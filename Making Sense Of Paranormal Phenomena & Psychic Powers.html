hey leo here for Ashley's dorg and in this episode
I'm going to be helping you to make sense of
paranormal spiritual phenomena the occult and psychic powers [Music] you
alright alright alright I'm really excited about this topic because
we have some tricky terrain to navigate and this is
what I shoot this content for is these kind of
deep juicy topics a word of warning though first which
is that this topic you want to listen to very
carefully with a very open mind set your skepticism aside
for just a little bit till the end of this
episode and stick with me to the very end of
this episode I know it's kind of a long one
but you got to be very careful about not jumping
to conclusions here or you're going to get this topic
wrong so what do we mean by paranormal spiritual phenomena
that's a very loaded phrase well I'll tell you exactly
what I mean I mean ESP extrasensory perception telepathy clairvoyance
remote viewing healing astral projection channeling out-of-body experiences or OBE
s as they're known near-death experiences or nve's as they're
commonly known witchcraft spirits ghosts aliens other beings angels demons
exorcisms telekinesis levitation past lives I need eeeh which is
the ability to live without food or water for very
long periods of time like years on end astrology fortune-telling
deities of various kinds auras heaven and hell and prophecy
that's what we mean by paranormal spiritual phenomena so of
course all of this is [ __ ] right all
of this is just coming from the overactive imaginations of
silly superstitious religious people or new-age hippies right isn't that
the answer is that the explanation for all this wrong
very wrong all of my research suggests that these phenomenon
for the most part not always but for the most
part are actually real phenomena and of they're part of
our now of course I have to make a lot
of caveats here when I say that because it's very
easy to misinterpret me when I say that now when
I say that these phenomena are real you have to
understand that this word real you might hold it in
a very objective way and when I say the word
real I hold it in a much more subjective way
to me reality is one giant infinite hallucination and so
ultimately everything within reality is unreal as phenomena so the
entire phenomenal world is really not real but we call
it real conventionally speaking and we think of it as
real and is very difficult for someone who hasn't experienced
a different state of consciousness than regular waking consciousness or
dreaming consciousness if someone hasn't experienced anything other than that
it's very difficult to convey to them just how flimsy
their current state of consciousness is and also how flimsy
their notion of reality is your body your life your
personal history yourself all of this is ultimately unreal that's
the truth of non-duality but we want to talk about
not that stuff here we're going to be talking about
different kinds of phenomena so what kind of appearances and
phenomenon can appear well that can vary a lot even
just if we stick to our conventional notions of reality
there's all sorts of weird creatures in the oceans there's
weird stuff going on in space there's weird stuff going
on in physics and in quantum mechanics and humans of
being supprised by the nature of nature for for thousands
of years now and we keep being continually surprised it
hasn't stopped and there doesn't seem to be a sign
of it stopping anytime soon so we have to keep
that in mind and I'll be belaboring this point more
and more as we go on but let me get
back to the point of research so over the last
two years I've been doing a lot of research just
for myself into non-duality because I want to help myself
to become enlightened I've been reading a lot of books
going to a lot of workshops doing a lot of
retreats and talking to a lot of people okay I've
talked about that in the past with you but as
I've been doing that research also what keeps cropping up
and you'll probably notice this yourself is that also these
paranormal aspects of spirituality also pop up it's not like
you can just read a bunch of books and only
you hear about the truth of non-duality you also hear
about these weird phenomenon and you're not sure what to
make of them are they real are they unreal and
initially of course you just dismiss them because our culture
dismisses this stuff and you say well it's just people
over exaggerating stuff of course you know religions have been
over exaggerating reality for thousands of years nothing new there
and we've got crazy and deluded people all around us
so we know that so we just chalk that up
to that that's our explanation but the more you do
research and the more you study the more you actually
meet people people face-to-face who tell you their stories by
going to retreats and seminars the more you meditate the
more psychedelics you take the more weird stuff you experience
the more mystical states you have then the more open
you become to the possibility that some of this stuff
actually might be more than just fantasy and what I've
been doing is I've been cross-referencing dozens of sources pretty
carefully over the last two years from books and in
person and from spiritual masters that I've met and so
forth and many of these sources I consider to be
reputable high-quality sources in my opinion of course you'll have
to decide for yourself what's a good source for you
but for me these tend to be high quality sources
and ultimately what this led to in me is a
sort of paradigm shift that happened about a year ago
where before I was just like most people and I
dismissed all the phenomenon as just sort of New Age
hippie fantasies and religious superstition to the point where actually
now my paradigm of reality is very comfortable with the
paranormal and the paranormal has ultimately just become normal for
me it's the new normal so one of the interesting
things that I want to to show you we're talking
about this and how this shift happened for me and
why it happened is that this notion of what's normal
and what's paranormal is actually a lot less scientific and
objective than we think and it's a lot more subjective
and just purely conceptual and purely conventional in the in
the end and this is something you can discover but
only if you're very open-minded and you're willing to to
hear some of these arguments that I would be presenting
some of the evidence and then you're willing to go
out there and do the research on your own because
I'm not here to just to feed you with Dogma
I want you to be thinking critically so over the
last couple of years I think I developed a fairly
good working model of what all this phenomena is and
that's what I want to share with you here now
I know that you're skeptical and I can hear people
in the audience saying well Leo come on come on
really are you [ __ ] kidding me you're going
to be spending an hour talking about aliens and [
__ ] spirits and ghosts and [ __ ] and
I thought this was a real personal development channel and
you were a practical rational guy now you're talking about
this stuff you're lending it credibility and you're ruining your
own credibility with doing this and I don't want to
even listen to your advice anymore so look I know
that I'm putting my credibility on the line but just
stick with me and listen to what I have to
say I'm going to answer many many many of your
objections here in ways that people have not seriously answered
before so you have all sorts of objections which I
have had when I started learning about this stuff things
like well if these phenomena are really real then science
surely would have proved it years ago and yet it
hasn't or well if these phenomena are real then why
isn't everyone talking about this or why haven't I met
such a person with some of these abilities in real
life or why aren't there youtube videos of people levitating
and seeing ghosts and [ __ ] or if people
can see the future and fortune-telling is real and clairvoyance
is real then how come people aren't using that to
predict the trend in the stock market and in making
a killing they're making billions in the stock market or
an objection like what about non-duality if non-duality tells us
that everything is 1 and that there are no separations
and there are no others relative to selves then what
are all these entities these deities and these aliens and
these spirits and so forth what are they that makes
no sense and contradicts non-duality and the list goes on
and on with these objections and I'll be covering many
of them more and more as we keep going but
let me first address these because I think that these
are the ones that really keep people from from going
deeper into investigating this so first the objection is why
as of science already proved this well you have to
recognize that science is not unbiased but science has certain
paradigms that it works within and this is well known
within the philosophy of science science goes through revolutions it
has in the past and will continue to in the
future science is always evolving science is fallible that's actually
what makes science good is that science is always trying
to admit some mistakes and to evolve so a lot
of people misunderstand this and they think that well duh
is fallible yeah sure but then they just assume that
everything that science tells them is then right you have
to take into account the fal ability of science you
also have to take into account some of the limitations
of science there are some very deep fundamental framework limitations
which I need to talk more deeply about here after
answer some of these other objections so we'll keep going
into that but yet you know in 100 years science
may very well consider some of these paranormal phenomena real
whereas right now it doesn't why isn't everyone talking about
this well this one's very easy who is everyone that
you're listening to you understand that mostly what you do
is like you watch TV you watch semi game of
Thrones you watch some stupid YouTube videos and you think
that now you have a broad representative picture of the
world who are you talking to where are you getting
your information what kind of media are you feeding your
self with is it the most mainstream the most low
consciousness media imaginable which pushes all your emotional buttons it's
hard for that media to even report accurately on a
presidential candidate or an election let alone to report accurately
on subtle spiritual phenomena come on get real here you
have to understand that your interaction with culture and the
media and information is extremely biased and very limited very
very limited I guarantee that if you go out there
and travel the world go to India go to Africa
study with various spiritual masters really bother to to try
to understand their culture and their perspective and and their
insights about life you will come back a changed person
you will not see the world the same way again
your eyes will have been permanently open about this other
question of why haven't I met such a person in
person well again the question is who do you hang
out with what kind of friends do you surround yourself
with most of the people you surround with yourself yourself
with they don't even understand what consciousness is they don't
even understand what enlightenment is you probably haven't even meta
and an unenlightened person in the flesh let alone a
person who has paranormal spiritual abilities and even if you
did even if such a person came up to you
and tried to tell you something like oh hey I
experienced some sort of weird spiritual phenomena yesterday what would
you do you would dismiss them and chances are you
actually have dismissed people like this in your life maybe
you've met a woman or a man at some point
in your life or maybe a call to get work
or a friend who try to tell you about some
of this stuff but because your paradigm does not allow
for anything paranormal because you hold reality as this fixed
physical object with which you interact you're not you're not
able to make sense of this phenomena you have to
reject it you see your mind is not really left
with any other options so we have to work on
your paradigm here very much as I keep talking about
this stuff so it's no surprise you haven't met these
people because you have it seriously bothered to go out
there and look for them and these people they aren't
part of your social circle they are part of your
culture these people that have these abilities if they have
them they're off on their own they're part of their
own circles because they would be demonized and burned at
the stake in many places today at the world if
you came out with such abilities and you told people
about them openly they would stone you to death alright
so you got it keep that in mind and even
if you're living in a Western developed country hey three
hundred years ago just for talking about what I'm talking
about right now I would have been called a heretic
and burn at the stake so you got to keep
that in mind we are not as far along evolved
as we like to think that we are we're still
in the very early stages still in the in the
Dark Ages as I call it why aren't there YouTube
videos of people doing this stuff well a couple of
reasons firstly because these people generally don't like to show
off for cameras now you might say well that's sort
of a cop-out there should be real physical proof well
we'll get more to that in a minute but the
other reason is that even if I showed you a
real video right now of someone doing something paranormal what
would your mind do would it accept that video of
course not because it would mean that your entire paradigm
of reality is wrong so rather than admitting that your
entire paradigm and reality is wrong what your mind is
going to do is it's going to question and skeptically
dismiss everything it's going to nitpick every single piece of
evidence that's presented to it which is why we have
an uphill battle here and why radical open-mindedness is so
important so maybe there are maybe there aren't YouTube videos
I don't know there's a lot of videos on YouTube
have you checked them all and the ones that you've
seen have you dismissed them so see I show you
one video and then you say well that's not good
enough I don't like that one it it's not clear
enough show me a better one and I'll show you
better when they said well that one's not good enough
either maybe these people were in collusion or just some
sort of dogma and people are just acting it out
and they are deluded they think that they are doing
this but actually they're not doing it or maybe it's
photoshopped or maybe you know all sorts of stuff is
possible so see the issue here is how your mind
reacts to the information but also of course a lot
of this stuff like how are you going to get
clairvoyance or remote viewing visible on a YouTube video you
won't the only thing you can possibly see on a
youtube video is the most gross physical manifestation to one
of these powers so maybe if someone is was literally
levitating you could shoot a video of that but many
of these powers are much more subtle than that they
aren't so materialistic and so you can't just take an
easy video of it the the other objection is well
how come people aren't making a killing in the stock
market if fortune tellers are so accurate well here's the
thing two points about this first of all a lot
of people when they hear about fortune-telling and seeing the
future they assume it's like oh it's a hundred percent
perfect in this sort of it's like a scientific instrument
like if I can tell the future that means I
can see exactly what's going to happen tomorrow everything is
set in stone all of reality is is predestined and
I'm just like reading a book and I can tell
you exactly what's going to happen and if it's not
like that then it's not really real but see that's
a rather silly materialistic notion of what seeing the future
is really like Rad's and bass think of seeing the
future as more of an intuitive ability which is hazy
which is fuzzy which isn't a hundred percent right and
in fact maybe it's only thirty percent right but thirty
percent is still better than zero percent the way that
most people do it you see the other issue there
is that I actually have read a few convincing reports
that there are people who use their psychic abilities to
play the stock market and make good money now think
about this if you actually had a psychic ability and
you were able to use it to make a living
playing the stock market would you go around laughing about
it to people would you go around showing off your
competitive advantage no of course not you would just do
it quietly in your basement and fill your bank accounts
with cash that's what you would do you would play
that market and you would win and you would be
happy and even if let's say you're at a party
and you wanted to tell somebody hey you know the
way I make money is by using my psychic abilities
in the stock market what are they going to do
they're going to laugh you off aren't they isn't that
what you would do if someone told you that you
would not take that person seriously so why should they
bother to go out of the way to convince you
you see that's part of the problem here with paranormal
abilities is that people who don't believe in them and
have no experience with them it's very hard to convince
them and yet the people who do have the experience
they are so convinced they don't need to go around
convincing anybody else they're just happy with what they know
and if you think about it that's really how how
true knowledge works when you have a true piece of
knowledge and it's grounded and experienced and you know that
it's real you have no doubts about it you don't
need to go run around convincing other people you do
that when you're unsure so maybe there are people who
are making a killing in the stock market with their
psychic abilities but would you know about it how would
you are you going to see these people on the
evening news bragging would you do that you see that's
actually one very good reason why you shouldn't play the
stock market because think about it you might be competing
against people with psychic abilities and also you're competing against
very large companies who have algorithms very complicated intelligent algorithms
who can play the stock market much smarter and more
responsively than any little individual investor can so watch out
with the stock market and this issue about non-duality telling
us that everything is 1 and therefore there's no room
for paranormal abilities actually no that's not the case at
all there's no necessary conflict between the two non-duality is
telling us that everything is 1 but then within everything
there being one there's all sorts of entities and creatures
and there are tree there houses there are cars they
are underwater squid and all sorts of stuff like that
so it says it's not weird at all that there
can be all sorts of different facets to reality phenomenal
facets to reality some of them very weird and very
shocking to our own minds and very unconventional and yet
nevertheless everything is still non-dual so I know you're skeptical
and we'll cover more of these objections we keep going
but let's move on the core of my argument here
is that there are way too many converging reports of
paranormal phenomena all across the world all across time all
across cultures for them to just be pure fantasy because
you have to ask yourself how do we explain these
reports and it's really only have a couple of options
here you can either admit that there's something true to
the reports or you can completely deny all the reports
but then you have to say why are there so
many reports and we're not just talking about hundreds of
reports or thousands of reports we're talking about tens of
thousands of reports like I said all across the world
all across very different cultures very different religious traditions different
languages and across thousands of years of time and if
you're wondering well what are all these reports it's because
you haven't bothered to do any of the even basic
research I personally haven't even done that much research into
the paranormal for naught I don't really have time most
of my time goes into running my business and pursuing
enlightenment and doing a spiritual purification work on my ego
that takes up most of my time and so any
research that I do with the paranormal phenomena is is
just cursory and just a couple of years of doing
that research has been fairly convincing to to transform my
paradigm of what I consider normal versus paranormal there are
these reports and these reports are not random it's not
like people are just sitting down and making stuff up
whole cloth like I believe that there are blue monkeys
living on the moon nobody ever said that nobody ever
believed that and yet people do believe in some of
these paranormal abilities and they take them very seriously so
why is that why is there convergence from different cultures
different times all across the world that's what's interesting to
me that's my central argument for why I think these
things must be true or have an element of truth
now I'm not saying they're all exactly the way that
they're reported necessarily of course reports can have all sorts
of exaggerations and inflation and all sorts of dogma comes
with it but when a lot of people report weird
phenomena I think we have to take that as serious
and we have to investigate that further with good science
and by personal investigation the ancient Yogi's called these powers
cities sidd H is cities and they write about these
powers in their books they also categorize these powers and
they talk about how to develop some of them some
of the dangers of of pursuing these powers and so
forth and this goes back to ancient Yogi's but also
to modern ones who I've read accounts of who talked
about developing some of these powers Yogi's today develop these
powers and talk about how they have these powers but
not just Yogi's so don't confuse this as just some
sort of Hindu thing because all mystical traditions and all
mystics from all across the world at all cultures in
all times report such abilities in varying degrees what's really
interesting to me is that every religion not only has
of course the exoteric aspect which is all the stuff
we don't like about religion all the the ritual and
all the external stuff but also like I've talked about
in the past it also has an esoteric aspect which
is the non dual component enlightenment and also it has
the occult aspect almost every major religion so including Christianity
Hinduism Islam you name it every single one of them
and even all the minor ones they all have a
cult branches and these are usually kept the most secret
of them all and that's for a good reason because
when you start to talk about these powers with common
folk they take out their pitchforks and they want to
crucify you so you got to be careful here's my
theory about these powers is that most famous mystics in
history such as the Buddha Jesus Muhammad etc and there
were many of them did actually possess and exhibit some
real paranormal abilities and that they are not just myths
the way they write about in the books now of
course surely some of the stuff in the Bible and
so forth a lot of it is pure myth and
just made-up fantasy obviously that's the case but also be
careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater
you got to ask yourself what was the motive for
creating these myths in the first place what are they
based upon and I think that what a lot of
modern rational skeptical scientific people do is they just say
no all of it is just fantasy but I think
that that is a fantasy the reality is is that
their way that Dogma works is that people don't just
make up stuff out of whole cloth Dogma works in
very particular ways dogma works by taking the truth and
then exaggerating it inflating it or converting it to the
egos purposes so what I think is that there were
a lot of enlightened people throughout history but only a
few of them have these very rare paranormal abilities and
these were the the very classic mystics who became deified
and who became revered and worshiped think about what kind
of effect especially a couple thousand years ago one of
these mystics could have on you if you were just
an ordinary person who did not believe in any paranormal
abilities but then you actually one of these mystics heal
somebody like a relative of yours or you saw them
perform some sort of a what seemed like a miracle
to you something that seemed physically impossible think about what
that would do to your psyche and then what kind
of believer or convert that would make of you that
would certainly make you a very loyal devotee of that
person wouldn't it it would even today if you saw
a video of me [ __ ] levitating your entire
relationship to me would completely change and you would hold
me in a in a totally different Escalon of teacher
and if you saw some of those things then you
would go around converting people to my cause wouldn't you
of course he would it makes perfect sense that you
would do that I think that entire cultures in the
past were built up around these paranormal abilities for example
like Egypt ancient Egypt clearly shows signs of this it
wasn't just an ordinary civilization but of course as these
civilizations really got going and they tried to go mainstream
spirituality and subtle paranormal abilities do not easily go mainstream
they get corrupted the ego takes over and so of
course all these cultures all these paranormal abilities all spirituality
was corrupted and it was turned into the kind of
religious dogma that today we really don't like and is
the reason why we dismiss all this stuff usually out
of hand think about also how difficult it always has
been to convince the egoic mind which is very materialistic
very pragmatic and very gross in its relationship to reality
that there are subtle hidden dimensions that could be asked
accessed by the mind if only the ego got out
got out of the way think about how difficult it
is to convince and it go ik mind at this
it's very difficult because the ego wants to stay in
power and the ego likes its relationship to reality as
being materialistic gross and and it doesn't want to give
that up that's the ego's dogma that's its position that
it's trying to defend many of these paranormal abilities are
subtle they're fuzzy they're intuitive they require one to unwire
their ego to go beyond the ego and that's something
that's just very rare these days in our culture there
are generally two problems when discussing the paranormal one is
that it's way too easily dismissed by the rational mind
and two is that it's way too easily exaggerated and
misinterpreted by the fantastical superstitious mind even if there is
some sort of core paranormal phenomenon going on the fantastical
mind can easily exaggerate it and misinterpret it and then
create a whole cosmology around it a whole belief system
a whole Dogma rituals and prayer and then it attaches
all sorts of meanings that not might be inherent to
that phenomenon that are just made up see and so
that's what makes this issue so so challenging is because
we're dealing with a big sea of grey not just
black and white it's not so simple it's just dismissing
or admitting the phenomena now notice that I am NOT
saying that all reports of paranormal phenomena are accurate and
I am NOT saying that all the cosmologies that get
created around these phenomena are necessarily true what I'm saying
is that there is a there must be a core
vein of truth running through these reports and through some
of these cosmologies but they could be greatly distorted and
so then it's our job if we really care to
understand what's being talked about to go in there and
sort the wheat from the chaff why is paranormal phenomenon
not widely known well like I've talked about in the
before in in my episodes about epistemology about radical open-mindedness
about paradigms about webs of belief about default decisions about
false skepticism that these are very important topics very fundamental
topics and I wasn't kidding about that and that these
topics close down your mind and prevent you from accessing
deeper aspects of reality which most people do not even
know that they exist because they're not aware of epistemology
and the traps that come with it and the lack
of open mindedness that they have this creates problems and
it creates a problem for modern science because modern science
has biases in it which are largely unrecognized today here
are some of the biases of modern science it split
itself off from Purse first-person phenomena modern science is only
really concerned with third-person objective phenomenon which is actually largely
conceptual so that's a huge problem modern science has split
itself off from consciousness and often denies the most fundamental
thing which is that consciousness is what's most real about
reality that basis creates a huge problem modern science assumes
a naive realist paradigm modern science assumes that reality is
physical and that its objective which is demonstrably not the
case we even see that basically demonstrated through quantum physics
even modern science shows us that the modern scientific paradigm
is wrong the problem is that even many modern scientists
haven't really fully grasped the significance of what their studies
are showing and I've talked about the problems with naive
realism in Prior episodes about that my rant against naive
realism you can go check that out that's very important
for understanding what I'm going to talk about today modern
science rejects the non-physical on principle in a dogmatic fashion
it's not empirical about that principle modern science is arrogant
because it's been successful in the last couple hundred years
creating a lot of computer technology and other kinds of
technology which has been very effective for human beings but
also just because it's successful in doing that now it
assumes that it's got everything right which is not the
case it's missing entire domain the reality that it doesn't
want to investigate and can't investigate because some of these
domains are beyond the gross materialistic instruments that science uses
to make to make such measurements science is overly analytical
and reductionistic science tends to be overly insular where all
the departments and science are broken apart and everyone sitting
in their little department and most the interesting phenomena that's
left to discover are actually in between the cracks of
those departments so that creates problems science is overly rational
that creates problems because a lot of the stuff we're
talking about here the paranormal is not rational so if
you insist on reality being rational you will have to
automatically dismiss everything paranormal and don't forget just how market-driven
and bureaucratic science is these days it is virtually impossible
for an enlightened professor to get tenure at a major
university you understand this no professor in a university can
actually be a mystic or be enlightened because they will
be they would be chased out of the building for
being a superstitious kook it's a complete absurdity how the
bureaucratic system of signs is structured you got to play
their games you got to jump through their hoops you
got to publish in their research journals you got to
pass their peer reviews you got to do all this
stuff and while that seems like that's good because that's
a filter against [ __ ] also it's a filter
against truth too it works both ways it's really hard
to construct a filter that's perfect and science especially the
bureaucratic aspects of it create a lot of bias and
distortion and also science is market driven so the grants
that you get depend on what kind of proposals you
submit if you submit proposal about studying the paranormal phenomena
no one's going to give you grant money for this
no one's going to advance your career by by talking
to you about this or publishing your articles about this
so it creates a big hurdle for legitimate scientists we
assume that reality is Newtonian even though science has just
prove this pretty much since Einstein but nevertheless most scientists
and most normal people still walk around and live their
everyday life as though it's Newtonian as though it's physical
as though it's rational as though its objective as though
it's set in stone as though it it exists out
there somewhere which is not the case at all this
is completely a conceptual this is a conceptual matrix this
Newtonian idea actually what reality is is it's a hallucination
and even modern science tells you this you don't need
to think very hard about this this is not some
deep philosophy we know that everything that you've ever experienced
about life which is all phenomena all experience what assigns
tell you that it's all rendered by the brain so
everything you've ever known including your body yourself all your
most intimate ideas and emotions all your scientific theories and
even your sense of self that all of that is
just a hallucination rendered by the brain that's what basic
biology tells us and yet we don't really grasp the
significance of that we live in this hallucination as though
it's a real tangible solid close and you know reality
not a hallucination and the only reason that is is
because it's so goddamn persistent and unless you've exited it
through psychedelics or through mystical experiences through enlightenment experience or
so forth then you have no idea just how flimsy
this persistent hallucination really is so that's one of the
reasons why these abilities are so little-known because we don't
really have a framework within which to couch them and
in fact our framework actively denies them the paranormal is
not rational as much as it is highly intuitive and
for many rational minded people this is hard to understand
I don't know maybe their mind can't be intuitive and
that presents a real obstacle to understanding the paranormal maybe
that's just a feature of their mind I think that
some people are very very left-brained physiologically so to the
point where they actually cannot access intuition and in a
sense they live in a different reality to know those
who can access our intuitions it really is like talking
to a different kind of person and that's why there's
this gap and there's this disconnect the paranormal phenomenon doesn't
lend itself easily to scientific proof now this rubs rational
people the wrong way because of course they say well
leo that just means it's unfalsifiable and of course with
that you can get away with anything and so they
tell me that that's a cop-out but actually no your
position is the cop-out because notice that you're being very
circular in your definition of proof because what you consider
as scientific proof is actually just a convention based on
all your beliefs about how reality is and should be
so your expectations of what reality is like color what
you consider as proof and the kind of measurements that
you're willing to do and the kind of evidence that
you're willing to accept so the question here is what
criteria are you using to define what you call scientific
proof and what you're doing is if you're if you're
saying that I'm failing the falsifiability criteria is actually what
you're doing is you're being circular you're not seeing that
your own criteria are not admitting any way of being
changed or influenced because you're already saying that hey I
know all the possible phenomena that could be found out
there in reality and there cannot be any paranormal ones
and see my position is that no you have to
be a lot more open than that that's an empirical
question that's not a question you can answer theoretically or
a priori science is largely a set of conventions you
have to understand this how science is done what's considered
good science what's considered proof and criteria and evidence and
proper method these are all things that we invented and
we continue to refine and evolve and this stuff will
definitely continue to be improved in the future so be
careful about clinging to science too much because we know
that science is fallible that is the very mechanism by
which science is so good and so accurate another reason
why this phenomenon is little-known is because this phenomena can
be subtle and weak and it's not necessarily always super
strong like I said before with the seeing the future
example it's not necessarily always 100% accurate same thing with
accessing some of these different kind of entities aliens different
beings and all sorts of weird stuff like this it
might be something you can't directly control it might not
be something you can produce in a laboratory setting see
a lot of times scientists will say ok we want
to study this phenomenon so what we do is we
get a volunteer we hooked them up to all these
electrodes we stick them in a in a white lab
coat clinical laboratory setting and he's sitting there now he's
asked to see the future and to predict what we
want him to predict we'll see those are silly rationalist
notions that are being placed upon the paranormal the paranormal
might not work that way and just because that's inconvenient
for you with your lab testing doesn't make it false
it just means that you have to go out of
your way to to test this stuff in unconventional unorthodox
scientific manner see we've to be open to that possibility
we can't expect all of reality to fit our current
methods of science and methods of matters of measurement you
see how closed-minded that is and how circular that is
if you have that kind of expectation then what will
you find you will only find evidence that's it's your
way of collecting evidence and all the other evidence that
exists outside of that will be completely dismissed science is
still in its infancy that's another factor we have to
consider that's another reason why this stuff is little known
people somehow just assume that no science has already figured
everything out that's not at all the case 95% of
the matter and energy in this universe is unknown to
us dark matter dark energy are completely unknown we don't
know what the hell these things are only about 5%
of our universe is made out of ordinary matter which
we have studied and we know fairly well so 95%
is already known to be unknown all right so largely
we don't know what the hell we're dealing with when
we talk about reality and there's probably even more outside
of those 95% that we don't know also you have
to consider that these powers and abilities are very rare
and they can take enormous amounts of disciplined training which
very few people are willing to go through and that
once they go through it they're not very interested in
being scientifically tested like a lab animal that creates other
obstacle another obstacle is that these powers are not useful
for egoic purposes in many cases or to fulfill materialistic
goals see the rationale is 2 goack gross mind likes
to think about these powers like this like well if
I can levitate then I can use that ability to
impress people and become a celebrity and then get on
TV and hurt a bunch of money or if I
can predict the future I can guess tomorrow's lottery numbers
and become a billionaire and then keep doing that week
after week after week you see that's how do you
go to mind thinks about this stuff but these powers
don't necessarily work that way we're talking about a much
more subtle realm of reality where actually ego is the
obstacle to these powers and once you let go of
your ego and you purify yourself spiritually then the way
in which you use these powers can be much more
subtle and cannot potentially fit some of these materialistic goals
that you have and then a lot of rational people
take that as evidence it's like oh well that means
there are not real powers no it just means that
these powers don't work the way you want them to
work they don't work the way that you see them
working in the movies be careful about that mainstream culture
has a lot of movies that allude to these powers
but then of course they blow out of all proportion
and they make all these powers very very concrete physical
rather than subtle and spiritual they're actually interestingly is quite
a lot of scientific evidence for the paranormal and if
you want I have books on my book list which
I highly recommend you go read to follow up on
what those studies are because I don't have time to
go into them there's quite a lot of them and
it's not just individual case studies or reports of individual
people it's actual studies that have been done especially on
psychic phenomenon like ESP and telepathy and remote viewing and
so forth they have done hundreds of studies thousands of
individual cases were were tested and then they were all
put together and meta studies were done and what has
been found is that actually there is very very strong
evidence statistical evidence for flight size phenomenon within the average
population and then even stronger ones within trained meditators and
Yogi's and so forth this science seems legitimate I've looked
at it only briefly so I'm not a scientist I'm
really not qualified to analyze the statistical analysis that went
to these meta studies you have to go look for
yourself and see if you're convinced but I think some
of the evidence there is pretty strong the problem is
that mainstream science dismisses all these studies and all the
individual reports because if it admitted even one it would
have to admit that there are deep fundamental framework problems
within science itself it would mean admitting that science is
incomplete and of course that is the last thing that
science wants to admit and science is wedded to the
naive realist paradigm and that paradigm would be shattered if
they admitted some of this stuff so they're going to
hold out as long as they possibly can and dismiss
it as much as they possibly can until it's just
overwhelming and at this point it hasn't become overwhelming yet
and I'll tell you why that is because of what
I call the whole effect the blackhole effect is very
interesting and it explains why this phenomenon is not really
understood by science very well so think of it this
way let's say that I'm a really serious respected scientist
in a university like Harvard or something and people come
to me and they bring me some paranormal studies and
some reports and I read them and I say no
this is this is silly this can't possibly be real
I dismiss it but people keep bringing me these reports
and there seems to be a certain pattern to these
reports and after a certain while I should to say
hmm maybe there's something I this is crazy but maybe
there's something to this I got to investigate this a
little deeper so you go and follow the breadcrumb trail
and you start to investigate a little bit deeper and
you get a little more and more convinced but still
you're not totally convinced and you tell yourself I won't
be totally convinced until I actually see it and demonstrate
it for myself so then you tell yourself okay I
am going to do it myself I'm going to develop
some of these abilities and then you go off and
you retire from your University you go and you you
find yourself a cave in the Himalayas and you live
there for 10 years and you concentrate and meditate for
20 hours a day for the next 10 years and
you develop some of these abilities and you're shocked you
actually get some of these abilities but of course what
happens you've passed through the enmet horizon of a black
hole there's no coming back and really convincing everyone else
outside of what you've discovered you see this this is
the black hole effect you don't know what's in the
black hole you enter the black hole you find out
something amazing but then it's so amazing you want to
tell everyone back there outside the hole what's in there
but then you can't because nothing escapes the black hole
you're stuck in there forever you're in a new reality
now and the only way anybody can understand you is
to come through that barrier themselves but then as soon
as they do they will not be able to convince
anyone back home imagine that you have developed these powers
as this scientist and now you come back to Harvard
to your University and you try to convince some of
your old colleagues that you develop these abilities what will
happen will they believe you or will they rationally dismiss
you they will rip apart all your arguments all your
evidence they will question you and they will just dismiss
you as a kook they will say you're one of
these scientists yeah you were a scientist you were respected
scientists but then when you went off into the Himalayas
or when you did some DMT or whatever ah you've
lost it you've just you just become a kook that's
what you've become and that's how they all dismiss you
now maybe one of those scientists will be open-minded enough
to say hey you know this guy was my friend
I really trusted him I don't think he's just making
all this [ __ ] up it must be something
to let me follow the breadcrumb trail so he follows
the bread come from he goes down the rabbit hole
he moves to the Himalayas he lives in a cave
for ten years and developed some of these abilities and
as soon as he does he realizes oh [ __
] I'm never going to be able to go back
and convince all my colleagues that this is real and
by that point after 10,000 hours of concentration meditation practice
and enlightenment after enlightenment and seeing the most ridiculous and
mind-blowing things you could possibly imagine you have no desire
to go back and convince all your colleagues Sciences science
is long gone for you you're way beyond science at
that point you're way beyond rationality and logic and arguing
with people and changing the minds of mainstream culture you
see those people as walking zombies and chimps by that
point you do not even try to reason with those
people anymore that is the black hole effect and see
this is a very dangerous effect at a lot of
people misunderstand they don't really appreciate the full ramifications of
it and it explains very well how come things like
enlightenment or these paranormal abilities don't percolate up into mainstream
culture and they are not well understood by science if
you want to to read more about this evidence go
check out some of the books I have actually a
paranormal section on my book list and I have some
books also on my book list about the philosophy of
science the nature of science and some of these issues
about scientific paradigms now though let's actually get into the
juicy details and talk about the actual powers so firstly
we've got ESP telepathy clairvoyance remote viewing fortune-telling and prophecy
I kind of lump all these together because these are
all the psychic powers this is all about knowing things
in the future or predicting things seeing things and so
forth how real are these my research tells me that
these are definitely real there are just way too many
examples of this all across the world being reported I've
even had examples of this reported in my own personal
life with people I've dated various girls and women women
actually interestingly tend to be more intuitive than men because
men are sort of autistic versions of women and are
very rational and because they're so rational they're not really
able to tap into some of this ESP phenomenon quite
as easily as women wears a lot of women are
and that's why men make fun of women we say
that all women are so so flaky and so airy-fairy
because they believe in horoscopes and astrology and all this
stuff actually you know what it is women believe in
affair scopes horoscopes and astrology because they're more intuitive than
men and they tend to experience this kind of ESP
phenomena more easily that's my theory makes sense to me
maybe you've even encountered some of these kinds of women
in your life or maybe you are one of these
kinds of women and then you're your boyfriend or husband
doesn't really understand you because he's very rational and so
what do you do do you try to convince them
no you have to just close your mouth and keep
that stuff to yourself you see and again that's the
black hole effect at work so these abilities can definitely
develop be developed I think if you if you practice
a lot of meditation and concentration shilling I think is
also one of those abilities that is real I think
examples in the history books of various saints and sages
and mystics who did miraculous acts of healing on people
that these are not just exaggerations and pure accidents or
pure coincidences that there actually are these abilities I've actually
personally met multiple face-to-face people who told me that they
were healers I met this one woman at an Enlightenment
retreat in in Toronto who was talking about how she
had some ESP type of abilities before enlightenment then she
got enlightened through doing these workshops and so forth and
after that her healing abilities just blossomed and then she
became a professional healer and she's actually able to touch
people and see and just like intuitively feel where there
are diseases or ailments in their body and then just
sort of energetically heal them and remove those which is
a pretty cool pretty cool to hear one of those
reports you know face to face not just reading it
in a book and and so that in combination with
other reports that I've read and heard about convinced me
that healing probably has something to it now how does
the healing actually work does it work through a mechanism
of physical healing or energetic healing or non physical what's
actually going on there I have no idea no idea
at all but that's something for science to really investigate
if science wants to be open minded astral projection is
definitely real you can learn to do it I have
a book on my bookshelf called learn astral projection in
ninety days there are so many people talking about how
you can learn astral projections are tons of books tons
of techniques you can do this one yourself channeling I
also have books on my bookshelf about how to learn
how to channel and I've seen videos of people channeling
and they look fairly convincing at first when I heard
about channeling it sounded silly decide that somehow people are
able to connect to some higher being or some sort
of alien entities and get information from them but the
more you study this and the more you study cases
of brain disorders and the interesting stuff that goes on
there the more open you become to the possibilities of
channeling now what actually channeling is I don't know are
these people actually connecting telepathically to some sort of alien
entities I don't know maybe all it is is that
they're connecting with some aspect of their brain that most
of us can't connect to maybe their brain is wired
differently has different chemicals in there such that they're able
to connect to different aspects of reality that normally we
couldn't connect to the books on my list about different
brain disorders are very very eye-opening and can really help
you to shift your paradigm in this case because you
hear of all these well-documented medical cases of injury and
damage in the brain or chemical imbalances and how that
shapes one's reality in very radical in weird ways you
start to see that yeah of course a lot of
this phenomenon if you want to can simply be explained
by brain chemistry differences in brain functions different modules in
the brain which are activated genetically in different people at
different times in their lives and through different practices like
concentration meditation and so forth now the mistake that many
people here make when they hear about all this is
all just brain stuff it's all just brain hallucinations that's
how you explain all this stuff Leo be very careful
about that because you have to take into account that
all of your reality your sense of self your personal
history everyone that you love and care about all your
notions of sides all your rationality that all of that
is also a hallucination which is rendered by your brain
or so science tells us and it's just a chemical
phenomenon you see so when we say that Oh channeling
is just brain phenomena we'll all of reality is a
brain phenomenon so that doesn't dismiss the channeling the way
that many people think many people forget the default position
that they're operating under which is that they think that
hey what I see right now this right here is
real reality and everything else is just hallucination no no
no no all of it is hallucination including what you're
seeing right now especially what you're seeing right now and
you can easily discover this just by taking some high-dose
DMT or psychedelics have a break through that and you
will clearly see what I'm talking about that will really
open you up to understanding some of this phenomena out-of-body
experiences quite definitely real not near-death experiences also seem very
plausible and very credible there's thousands of these examples you
can read entire books about it past lives I've heard
so many reports about past lives from people who do
deep psychotherapy from people who practice deep meditation who experience
enlightenment in hypnosis sessions people talk about past lives all
the time now does this mean that there actually were
past lives or that is some brain phenomenon or whatever
it is I don't know I don't know the ontological
status of past lives but I think it's a real
phenomenon auras also seem to be like a pretty credible
and real phenomenon that certain people experience now what about
witchcraft magic and voodoo surely this must be fantasy right
actually just not that long ago I was reading a
blog written by a modern witch yeah I'm serious she
has a blog you can go there you can read
about her witchcraft and she tells you about her witchcraft
and different points that she makes she talked about flying
ointments and how to prepare them as I was interested
in flying ointments that's how I found this blog I
was researching flying women and what this is is that
she takes pig fat she renders it down for like
multiple days then she takes various psychoactive herbs like henbane
and Mandrake roots and datura which is a very powerful
psychoactive substance and Bala Donna and all this kind of
stuff all some of these are very poisonous actually they
could kill you she puts them in there she makes
this broom she boils it down and she creates this
little jar of flying ointment and then what does she
do with that she takes and she rubs on our
temples she rubs it under her armpits and she rubs
it in her vagina and then this Center on a
wacky psychedelic trip and this is where the idea of
which is flying came from and there's a whole there's
a whole art in sides to witchcraft that I've only
skimmed the surface of so so yeah witchcraft is not
just witches flying around on sticks over your city it's
more about inner travel and then she talks about how
this flying whiteness helps her to do astral projection helps
her to do channeling and healing and all sorts of
weird stuff like that um now I hear what you're
saying sable leo I don't have vagina how am I
supposed to be a witch well I got good news
for you coming next week the episode will be how
to attract a hot witch girlfriend and then you can
have her and then she can tell you all about
her experiences this stuff is kind of wacky but then
when you actually study it your perspective changes in a
very interesting way how about ghosts spirits and poltergeists are
these real man I don't know I've never seen one
personally but it seems like people cannot just be making
this [ __ ] up out of scratch it has
to be based on something I'm willing to bet I
would put my money on the fact that there are
certain kinds of ghosts and spirits as a raw phenomenon
that you can experience now what they actually are metaphysically
I have no idea but I think that you can't
experience them how about aliens and beings there are so
many UFO and abduction stories that I think that it
is definitely a real phenomenon but again I don't know
what it is metaphysically is it actually aliens from another
star system I doubt that I think it has to
do more with with the brain and more with more
kind of subtle spiritual phenomenon with these uh with these
sort of entities what about deities people in all sorts
of religious traditions and mystical traditions talk about deities I
have it on pretty good authority that actually they are
also real in fact because there are certain mystical traditions
very ancient ones a very rigorous ones like Tibetan Buddhism
and Hindu Tamil about actually manifesting real living deities so
what you do is you you use various arcane occult
meditation practices visualization practices to actually create these deities and
these deities will come to life they're not just figments
of your imagination in the way that we conventionally think
this deity will appear before you it will be animated
it will be lifelike it will make you crap your
pants and then it can tell you real wisdom about
life about reality can enlighten you it can transform your
entire life you can actually learn these practices and go
do it and then prove me wrong I bet you
if you were really serious about it you could actually
do it I've read accounts of Yogi's that I trust
modern-day Yogi's serious meditation practitioners who have actually done this
stuff how about angels demons and exorcism surely this must
be false actually I think that this is also a
real phenomenon that you can experience I've I've heard some
credible accounts from multiple sources talking about experiencing demons and
I think that is possible if you can experience a
deity surely you can experience a demon and this demon
will be completely lifelike it will make you crab your
pants it'll make you wish for mommy I think that
that's definitely possible and if you start to read II
read studies of psychotic patients and schizophrenic patients whatever's going
on with them I'm not sure but they also report
seeing various kinds of demons and then of course that's
where the exorcism would come from that we know about
how about telekinesis levitation surely these must be fantasy right
actually I don't know about levitation but as far as
telekinesis I have one credible report from a very enlightened
master that I respect and trust who claims that he
is personally witnessed telekinesis in Asia I don't know I
don't know I'm just saying what I have experienced as
far as rece my research goes I have not experienced
any of these powers personally but just gathering all this
data has has been very interesting and very eye-opening I
would not be surprised at all if some very very
hardcore serious mystics were able to levitate I would not
be surprised by that at this point I mean I
would be shocked if I like walked into a cave
in the Himalayas and I saw a mystic levitating I
would be shocked and I would definitely pull out my
phone and want to record it and post it on
YouTube to show people but at the same time in
the back of my mind I'd be like yeah I
kind of knew that was possible anyways just because once
you go to a certain level in your spiritual work
and in your meditation and you have a few enlightenment
experience experiences and you see that all of reality all
of this is just a hallucination an infinite hallucination you
start to open yourself up to all sorts of crazy
possibilities does that mean they're true but you're more open
to them have it in hell are these real I
actually think there's something in there is something to this
I think that I've heard reports from people who talk
about heaven and hell not just metaphorically the way sometimes
I talk about it want to talk about non-duality but
like literally they actually go to these places these alternate
realities and they are very heaven like or very Hell
like and in the hell like ones there is so
much suffering there that in your wildest dreams you couldn't
imagine that degree of suffering and these people want to
escape and they're so glad that they did escape and
that experience of being in Hell has transformed their whole
attitude and made them a lot more loving and more
compassionate towards other people towards the suffering of other people
and the kind of suffering that they inflict on other
people makes them tread carefully in the world because they
never want to go to hell and they don't even
want to send their worst enemies to hell because it's
so bad there what does that really mean what's the
ontological status that I don't know how do you get
there I don't know you'd have to go in there
and do more research and lastly transmutation transmutation is the
ability to actually change physical matter into something other than
it is a sort of alchemical fashion I've seen and
heard reports of Yogi's and mystics being able to bless
objects physical objects actually charge them with certain spiritual energies
which these objects then possess and then radiate to create
like relics so to speak or to create a sacred
objects or to even to bless temples for example and
then that is not just something that they do intellectually
but something that's actually a physical phenomenon where they're actually
able to charge these objects with certain kinds of energy
so those are the various powers that are potentially out
there now people sometimes ask well Leo what is there
besides enlightenment all that [ __ ] that I just
talked about there's all that which most enlightened people do
not tell you about the Neo advance are not going
tell you about any of this stuff they don't care
to explain it at all because their position is at
a there's nothing to do even within the realm of
enlightenment there's nothing to do just sit back you're already
enlightened there's nothing to do there's nothing to learn there's
nothing to understand that's your position it's such a stupid
position that I don't even feel like arguing with it
anymore it's just such a stupid position even if you're
enlightened you still have to be epistemic ly humble in
the sense that you really don't know unless you've experienced
some of these phenomenon if you haven't personally levitated if
you haven't personally experienced the demon if you haven't personally
channeled another entity you have no business talking about these
things as though you know or dismissing them or saying
well but all that stuff you know enlightenment is the
supreme truth and all that stuff is just phenomenon no
the fact is you have no idea what that stuff
is until you've encountered it firsthand and then when you
do maybe I'll change your mind maybe it won't but
maybe it will the point is you don't know so
don't be so dismissive what's very interesting I found is
that even the most sober non-dual teachers the most non-religious
ones if you actually sit down with them behind closed
doors and question about these certain paranormal phenomena on they
will be forced to admit that they have had some
of these kinds of experiences or even some of these
abilities are manifested in them and yet these people would
never ever speak about these abilities in public nor would
they even tell their regular students about it nor would
they write about it in their books never why is
that because they don't want to distract the ego from
the work of overcoming itself they know how easily you
can get distracted by shiny objects and then you want
to go chasing these powers and so they usually keep
quiet about it and that's another example of why most
people don't know about this stuff to me reality makes
a lot more sense when you accept that the paranormal
is possible how else can you explain all of spirituality
and I mean all of spirituality spiritual traditions are so
rich and complex and varied all across the world that
in my mind it's impossible to explain this merely by
saying at all well of its it's all just based
on enlightenment and non duality and a bunch of dog
when a bunch of fantasy that doesn't explain it that's
really a cop-out that explanation only works if you're sitting
on your couch eating Cheetos watching Game of Thrones watching
YouTube videos listening to my videos while you're playing video
games if you're that kind of person and you're not
a real serious inquire into the nature of reality you
notice you're not seriously doing any kind of hardcore spiritual
practices then yeah for you that kind of explanation can
work but for someone who reads hundreds of books carefully
open-mindedly investigates all the sources all the reports goes to
seminars meditates his ass off has enlightened experiences does psychedelics
does all this stuff and very careful manner that explanation
does not work our world spiritual traditions are so complex
and contradictory I think because there is the kernel of
non duality in all of them but also there are
kernels of these paranormal abilities which are really difficult even
more difficult than enlightenment to to communicate to people because
the rational mind just doesn't want to hear it and
and I think that different people in different traditions and
even within the same traditions have different abilities to experience
this paranormal phenomenon and that that's why there's so much
disagreement and so much bickering and back-and-forth in within one
particular school of Buddhism for example or one particular school
of Hinduism there will be sects and divisions and conflicts
agree why is that because some of them literally access
different aspects of reality than others it is not the
case that all enlightened people are identical and all the
same now the question comes how does paranormal phenomena fit
in with non duality I think like this non duality
is the absolute truth behind all of reality the paranormal
is not that it's below that the paranormal is just
deeper dimensions of phenomenal reality so phenomenal reality can be
any number of infinite ways and some of them can
be very weird and strange but most of them are
just plain or ordinary reality the way we know it
so the strange ones these edge cases that's what I
think the paranormal is and it's accessing different dimensions of
reality maybe it's accessing different dimensions of your mind or
your brain I don't really know I don't think there's
any conflict though between the two I think that the
paranormal is necessary to really explain the the full complexity
of spiritual traditions and that once you do adopt this
kind of lens and you start to look at the
spiritual traditions through this lens they start to make a
lot more sense to you and you start to fight
and resist them a lot less than you did before
now of course the million-dollar question is how do I
develop paranormal abilities there are two ways one is that
you're born with them or you're genetically predisposed or somehow
your brain chemistry is such that you're predisposed to it
so that's one and two is that it requires thousands
and thousands hours of practice specifically concentration practice from my
reach what I concluded is that concentration practice is the
key and you need to do it not just on
and off a couple hours a day but I'm talking
about ten hours a day 20 hours a day for
years if you spend 10,000 hours in deep concentration practice
you'll probably develop some paranormal powers what those might be
who knows they tend to be pretty random and you're
not guaranteed to get them and which ones you get
we don't know you you know it probably depends on
the type of psyche you have the type of brain
chemistry you have so forth another way to quickly maybe
get a little taste of psychedelic abilities is by taking
psychedelics especially very wacky ones like DMT which can put
you in touch with other entities and aliens and extraterrestrials
and so forth which will be very lifelike and very
convincing for you because there's actually a module in the
brain we found there's a module in the brain that
when this module is stimulated with the right chemicals like
DMT that what that does is that that makes you
recognize others other entities this module is responsible for how
you can recognize other human beings and distinguish them from
physical objects and so when this gets over stimulated then
you start to interact with all sorts of other entities
now is that just brain abnormality or are you actually
accessing some hidden dimensions of the reality I don't know
you'd have to go try and see another question people
would have is will I get these powers if I
become fully enlightened and the answer here is no just
because you're enlightened doesn't mean you're going to have these
powers maybe but maybe not generally what I find is
that if you want these powers you have to work
for them specifically it's sort of like weightlifting you have
to isolation train the specific muscle that you want to
grow and there's no one sighs that builds all your
muscles equally but of course enlightenment is very helpful because
enlightenment opens you up to a very different relationship to
all of reality it really shatters all your old paradigms
so it really opens you up and you might have
some powers that come with very deep enlightenment so be
prepared for that be open to that don't be taken
by surprise is it worthwhile to develop these paranormal abilities
the answer to this is maybe I've seen that there's
lots of potential for growth in pursuing some of these
things for example like astral projection or channeling you could
grow yourself a lot in pursuing these but also there's
a lot of potential for delusion you could easily delude
yourself there's also potential for corruption because these are powers
and of course what we know is that the ego
easily gets corrupted by power especially if you try to
develop these powers while your ego is still fully intact
and you haven't done a lot of spiritual work on
yourself you haven't had any kind of enlightened experiences then
you're very likely to abuse these powers to harm yourself
and to harm others which is another reason why many
spiritual masters do not talk about these powers because they
don't want that to happen and also it could become
a distraction from doing your spiritual purification work from doing
self inquiry from working towards enlightenment so you have to
be careful you have to recognize that there's only so
much time and energy you have in the day and
enlightenment and spiritual purification work already takes up a lot
of time a lot of energy so do you really
have the time to go out there and to to
chase extrasensory perceptions or channeling and studying all this sort
of stuff you can if you're really interested in it
but you know consider it as an opportunity cost and
that might be a very big cost ultimately I think
that pursuing enlightenment is the the highest goal it's the
best thing for you I think and then if you
want to pursue powers or abilities after that then you
can and you'll be able to do it from a
nice non-ego explai and you might actually be able to
develop these abilities to help people for example if you
want to become a healer or you want to use
your higher intuitive abilities and your ESP abilities to somehow
help people that's great but you need to do that
on a foundation of enlightenment and not just on the
foundation of your current ego state so that's basically these
powers in a nutshell now I don't want you to
do this believe me I'm not here trying to be
a New Ager I'm I'm trying to fill your head
with dogma I'm no Alex Jones conspiracy theorist I don't
want you to now go start researching on the internet
for years and years and years going down the rabbit
hole about how aliens are raping our children and putting
chemicals in our water and all this like none of
that all right that's not what this talk is about
what I'm doing here is I'm really just sharing my
informal research findings with you my worldview on these powers
is still developing in a couple of years it might
change in a couple years I might come back here
and say you know what all this stuff I said
is all nonsense I've proven to myself that it's false
maybe that might happen I'm totally open to it I'm
not dogmatic about this topic I don't have a horse
in the race I don't care if levitation is real
or it's not real like it really doesn't matter I
think it would be cool if it was real but
if it's not real I'm okay with that too I'm
just a guy who is doing a lot of research
studying a lot of stuff and just trying to make
sense of life in the world that I see around
me that's all that my mission is here and I'm
very willing to admit if I'm wrong about something in
future now understand that my claims here are actually empirical
and they are falsifiable so if you're the skeptic sort
there's a scientific sort and you really care about knowing
what's true understand firstly that you can go out there
and do your own research and be convinced by that
research some of it is very convincing number two is
that you can actually develop these abilities for yourself do
not dismiss this possibility and there are some really easy
ones to develop like astral projection you could develop this
one in a couple of months and also you can
do some psychedelics which can really open you up and
give you a previews of some of these abilities so
put your money where your mouth is if you're skeptical
if you're rational if you're an atheist good that's very
good nothing wrong with being skeptical but now put your
money where your mouth is go do some of this
stuff don't just sit on your couch being an armchair
skeptic that right there is mental masturbation I dare you
to go spend 10,000 hours in deep concentration practice and
not develop some of these powers I dare you to
try that but just remember the black hole effect will
get you so once you become convinced well that doesn't
mean you'll be able to convince all your friends and
everybody else in fact you will probably inhabit a totally
new reality of course you'll be happy much more happy
in that reality than in the one that you're in
right now because you'll have a lot more consciousness and
a lot more self awareness but you will then suffer
from this problem of how do I share this beautiful
stuff with the world and that's a problem that's plagued
mystics and sages for thousands of years how do we
share this stuff when the common herd is so pragmatic
and so gross and materialistic that they have no possibility
for understanding the subtle dimensions of reality that's a very
big problem that's something I've been wracking my brain over
for for years now and it's very challenging I have
a hard time doing it myself through my content and
I basically devoted my whole life to helping people understand
these very counterintuitive things and to combating a over rationalism
and so forth so you're going to have just as
much trouble as me probably even more because hey it's
probably not your life mission but that's how it is
test it out for yourself put your skepticism to the
test I want to conclude with a couple of warnings
firstly it be careful not to go on a power
trip with these things don't go chasing these powers clearly
clearly recognize that that would be ego also be careful
not to get distracted by this don't go off reading
a bunch of books about actual projection when really you
should be sitting down and doing self inquiry also be
careful not to project your skepticism onto me if you
disagree with some of the things I say here okay
fine we can have a legitimate disagreement but don't go
pointing your finger at me and saying oh Leo now
you've become a New Ager ever since you started doing
psychedelics ah now all your content is all airy-fairy it's
all over the place and you've gone down the deep
end you're getting crazy and I don't want to become
like you look this is growth this channel is about
growth my models of reality are changing this was predicted
from the very beginning this is not a surprise this
will continue to happen ultimately what's going to happen with
me is a total black hole effect at some point
in my development and maybe sooner rather than later I
will reach a point where I may not even be
able to communicate with you through these videos because I
will have experienced things that are impossible to communicate with
words I mean I've already experienced things like that which
I can't really communicate to you and even if I
try to the only thing would happen is that you
would just become incredulous and then it was just backfire
on me because it would just tarnish my reputation which
is why the deepest sages Saints and mystics they don't
talk very much they sit in caves very silently and
even when students come to them they sit there for
days in silence because they just know that you can't
get from - they are from here without making a
quantum leap in your consciousness your current level of consciousness
is blocking you from understanding a whole hell of a
lot of stuff about life so that's it in conclusion
just realize that the content of reality can be weird
just [ __ ] a lot weird than you ever
expected and actually that makes perfect sense because your board
is this life and you don't know what you're going
to encounter everything is new the only reason that you
have expectations is just based on past memories and past
experiences but the past doesn't necessarily mean the future and
what you know here doesn't necessarily mean is the same
as the stuff that's over there or under the ocean
or another planet or in some other dimension you don't
[ __ ] know what you don't know that's the
ultimate epistemic lesson here so we got to be very
humble you got to be very open about all this
stuff and the last thing I'll say is welcome to
self-actualization it goes way deeper than you ever imagined that's
