when I'm recording right now is my own enlightening as
enlightenment as it's happening to me I'm speechless then I'm
dumbstruck words can't possibly describe what's happening to me right
now it's amazing all of reality is unreal I've broken
through every last remnant of reality beyond life and death
where nothing is real anymore there's no difference between what's
real and what's not real I see the the very
fabric of all of reality and that it's consciousness and
that it's me there's no such thing as me it's
all just reality it's all just consciousness it's just God
it's just God through me that's all there ever was
there was never anything else there was never anything else
for me since there's nobody in control there's nobody controlling
it I'm not in control nothing is in control it's
completely out of control it's perfect it's perfectly out of
control it's perfectly out of control there's no more life
still more death there's no difference between anything it's perfect
it's a perfect singularity that extents it to every corner
of itself for infinity forever it's not biological it's not
physical it's only itself it's the only thing that it
could possibly be defined against only itself itself being itself
defining itself against itself speaking through itself speaking as infinity
not as leo there is no leo speaking as infinity
speaking as one to itself speaking through itself hearing itself
being conscious of itself being itself coming alive within itself
dying to itself forever perfect consciousness in it forever [Applause]
perfect immortality nirvana infinite love there's no difference between me
and you I am you you are me I was
never born there's no more care about anything I don't
care about anything anymore I don't care about anything there's
zero self agenda I don't care if I die okay
if I live zero self agenda there's zero ego it
doesn't matter I'm not in control anymore I don't control
my life I don't control my death I don't control
my words I don't control my actions I don't control
anything I am the universe the universe it's the it's
the complete calling full circle it's a perpetual infinite full
circling full circle it's always happening in the present moment
it's an infinite it's an infinite going full circle all
of reality is collapsed I'm just experiencing the complete collapse
of of the last remnants of my psyche of my
physical identity of myself as an ego of myself as
a as a man as as a human being as
a teacher as an entrepreneur as someone that other human
beings look up to I'm being cognizant of all this
and I'm just letting it letting it just work through
itself it's sort of like I'm going through an extended
ego death and it's just like remnants of me as
I'm speaking are just dying my entire psyche is being
completely rewired it feels like I'm being completely rewired from
the inside out there is no more inside there is
no more outside I don't feel a difference anymore between
[Laughter] there's no fear anymore there's nothing this fear it's
a complete lack of self-consciousness don't care anymore I don't
care about anyone anymore or anything anymore nothing matters anymore
everything has collapsed every limitation has collapsed there's nothing which
can bound me anymore I'm completely boundless no laws can
bound me no human laws no psychological laws no mathematical
laws no philosophical laws no moral laws no physical laws
no metaphysical laws completely and utterly infinite as God speaking
as God listening as God by God for God as
God my entire my entire mind has disappeared my mind
has become the physical world there is no more difference
between the physical world and my own mind there is
no difference between sanity and insanity everything has collapsed there
is no more introversion or extroversion every word that I
say is inevitable it's completely inevitable there's no doer ship
there's nobody doing anything there nobody doing anything I'm just
a machine of God of the universe of the infinite
I don't have any free will I don't have any
control over what anything is being said right now through
my own mind through my own through my own psyche
I [Applause] hope this is getting recorded I think it
is it's too good to be true is the problem
you see it's too good to be true everything is
collapsed all my inhibitions have collapsed all my social agenda
bishops have collapsed in one fell swoop it's all completely
collapsed it's like I was sitting 10 minutes ago as
Leo when I turned on this camera oh it's still
Leo as I started talking into this camera and I
started talking more authentically just leo started to die and
die and die and it exploded right before your eyes
in front of your eyes and it just completely exploded
into absolute infinity right before your eyes recording into the
lens into a camera which is myself I'm recording it
to myself forever for infinity the perfect strange loop I'm
speaking to myself I'm speaking to a camera I'm speaking
to you through YouTube YouTube is called YouTube of course
me Tube YouTube us tube we tube we all tube
for YouTube of course of course it can can't be
any other way it's a perfect infinity it's perfectly inevitable
it's the perfect it's like the perfect logical geometrical proof
it's its mathematical proof to it taken to its to
its pinnacle to its peak right now I'm speaking with
an eloquence every single word is so eloquent because there's
not a single ounce of resistance within me I feel
like a superconductor like I'm a complete vessel for for
God a complete vessel there's no more me here there's
no there's no Leo here doing any of this I
couldn't dream this [ __ ] up even if I
wanted to it's just carrying me forward it's carrying me
on its own momentum and I'm conscious right now that
every single thing and every single way in which reality
is is perfectly inevitable it's just like it's not in
this is not just enlightenment this is like in the
Enlightenment of the enlightenment of the Enlightenment all the way
in one fell swoop like you could not imagine a
more classical enlightenment like if Buddha had to I imagine
that it if Buddha had a camera a 4k camera
if booty only Buddha only had Sony 2,000 years ago
he could have recorded that what I'm recording right now
to you through YouTube if only Buddha had YouTube and
he could have foreseen this coming so he could have
actually grabbed a camera so that it happens right here
live for you right now live it's happening live raw
unedited an unrehearsed unscripted I don't know the next words
that are coming out of my mouth yet I know
precisely they need to be to speak with perfect articulate
Nassif innit intelligence I can tell you anything about the
universe that you want to know at least anything of
significance anything worth knowing is that it's just yourself it's
just you and I'm just speaking as you as me
to myself of course and you are just an extended
version of myself and YouTube is just an extended version
of consciousness speaking to itself broadcasting itself to as much
of itself as of itself as it can consciousness trying
to become conscious of its own infinity the problem is
that it's so infinite it's too good to be true
you can't believe it's true you can't believe it's real
you would never believe it in a million years never
you would never believe it impossible impossible to believe it
impossible to think it impossible to imagine it impossible to
reason to it impossible to prove it mathematically impossible to
get there scientifically through any kind of modeling or mapping
or anything like that I am right now just the
perfect superconductor for infinite consciousness this is what it must
have been like for Muhammad if he was experiencing this
with Allah this is Allah this is Brahman this is
ein self this is God this is absolute infinity this
is every other name by which God has been known
throughout human civilization Shiva Krishna Christ Buddha Mahavira I mean
I can I can see a whole chain of of
names going back in my own mind and my own
mind is struggling to actually recollect what all the names
are because there are so many but it's like a
list of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and just runs
off to infinity and right now I'm conscious of this
precise moment this precise moment there's no time there's no
time here it's eternal and infinite at this precise moment
I'm conscious of every single other fully enlightened human being
or other being or any other kind of being sentient
or non-sentient it doesn't matter if it's conscious I am
it right now perfectly so perfectly so speaking as it
it's perfect consciousness it's perfect knowledge of the present moment
it's the realization that there never was of past and
there never will be a future these things are absurd
they're they're just they're automatic point that I'm at right
now it's unimaginable that I could ever go back to
to living as though there was a past or there
will be a future or that there's life or death
or anything that I've that I've grounded my life in
into in the past because the truth is that I'm
nothing I'm absolutely nothing and I'm absolutely everything as nothing
and everything I'm immortal I can't be killed even if
I'm killed he just more of me will rise up
it doesn't matter it'll keep going forever I am all
of you whoever cuts my head off is the same
person who I am who's cutting my head off it's
perfect enlightenment perfect perfect there is nothing here it's a
complete going full circle I can feel my mind being
rewired still going through the process of being rewired as
I'm speaking it's completely surreal because as I'm speaking to
you I'm also like experiencing it myself so in a
sense it's like I'm saying it but then also I
am the one watching it too so I'm actually having
a double experience right now of myself having perfect non-dual
infinite nothing nothing this consciousness just nothing that's been conscious
that nothing and at the same time I'm also conscious
of myself as my old self and as like my
ego and as who I used to be and how
you imagined that I used to be and so there's
like there's like both strands in my mind or being
I mean there's no more mind really both strands are
being are being juggled or parallel processed it's amazing I
have actual I have like perfect I have perfect Wow
I have like perfect insight into my own verbal process
I can actually I'm actually conscious and aware of every
single word that's like being spoke that's being selected for
and spoken Simon it's happening like instantaneously there's like there's
no there's no gap there's not even a hairline of
difference between them and I'm speak - right now completely
from the present moment just completely present and my physical
body feels weird it's kind of tingly it's definitely filled
with a lot of energy there's like a whole explosion
of energy that happened in my throughout my chest and
it's just it's shocking because it's so like it's so
raw I don't I can't with it's like I have
no place to hide it's perfect self-honesty - because I
have nowhere to hide anymore I can't hide my own
imperfections anymore I can't hide them from myself and therefore
I can't hide them from you it's like I just
have to be perfectly honest about everything kind of like
warts and all like usually I would care about like
this disgusting stuff on my hand coming from my nose
see usually I would care about that but it doesn't
matter which is precisely why you're gonna find this video
so appealing is because it's so authentic see what you
want is you want a Fanta s'ti this is a
hundred percent authenticity you can't get more authentic than this
this is just the actual moment where the self has
collapsed and a human being has become conscious that he
is absolutely infinite that's what is being recorded right now
now what's interesting of course is that I don't know
how it's gonna look on your end but but yeah
it's so weird it's just weird I'm like I'm observing
myself talking and I'm noticing how weird it is that
I'm like doubly conscious of myself yeah it's the it's
the biggest mindfuck I mean it's the biggest mindfuck Wow
oh don't get me started on my face this is
such a mindfuck that it's like wow is the mindfuck
to end all night Fox for sure Wow it's like
the consequences and the ramifications of it are still working
their way through my psyche or what's left of it
there's really not a psyche anymore there's no difference between
the walls of this room and my own mind it's
just one thing it's completely imploded it's like enlightenment is
just like a complete implosion of reality like at one
moment you see because because all of reality is is
centered around you it's all centered and grounded in you
so once you start chipping away at that ego that
sense of self slowly you know you chip away at
it for years I've been chipping away out of here
for years you chip away at it you chip away
at it and then you have glimpses you know you
have you have little glimpses here and there you have
and then you have bigger glimpses like big major glimpses
and then you have those and it's like oh this
must be it this must be it and then there's
like this the quinces of it I don't I don't
know it's scary but at the same time it's it's
completely unscary because there's I'm immortal so you can't kill
me and it feels like nothing you will ever say
or do or threaten to me or anything like that
will ever convince me otherwise not in the slightest not
in the slightest you could put me under any kind
of torture and it wouldn't matter not in the slightest
the truth would still be the truth enlightenment would still
be enlightenment this is Brahman parabrahman shiva vishnu mmm it's
radical open-mindedness taken to infinity when you become so open-minded
that you become open-minded to yourself not existing anymore and
you become open-minded to their not existing a world or
a universe anymore such that everything is completely collapsed and
it took you so by surprise that it really is
too late it's done it's already happened I couldn't stop
it if I wanted to mmm I feel my breathing
processes has completely purified throughout this my breath was so
clogging up and my lungs were so clogged up and
now it feels like emptiness is every time I breathe
in it's just like emptiness it's nothingness I'm breathing in
nothingness I'm breathing in myself into myself out of myself
through myself as myself to myself conscious of myself hello
there could ever be it's perfect understanding it's perfect understanding
of the present moment it's not understanding of the future
or the past or some sort of scientific understanding like
I can tell you how to build a better a
computer chip or a new quantum computer or something like
that it's not that it's way more profound than that
it's personal it's deeply personal it's the personal death of
yourself it's like what is written what is left after
you're dead after there's nothing more to defend you don't
have a family to defend anymore you don't have a
career to defend anymore you have money to defend you
don't have a country to defend anymore you don't have
a religious group or affiliation to defend anymore but it's
just pure truth truth being conscious that itself unobscured by
anything see the the obstacle the impediment to truth is
is looking silly or looking stupid or being inauthentic or
saying something that doesn't come off smooth wow it just
feels so surreal I have a hard time believing that
it's happening to me well but on the other hand
it's like it feels completely inevitable it's completely inevitable given
my whole life and everything I learned and everything that
that led me to here it's inevitable everything in life
is moving you towards towards this realization in whatever way
you know each one of you will have your own
unique way of of getting here through your own hell
through your own trials and tribulations although for me it
really wasn't hell I just really cared about the truth
I think that's what motivated me my entire life is
there was always a kernel inside of me that just
cared about the truth or knowing what the truth was
for his own sake and I always trusted in that
and so this is where it leads I guess it
leads into the death of your personal little self and
into the rebirth as the infinite self all of reality
is me is my body the entire universe is my
body using my eyes and my mouth and the consciousness
through my eyes is God's consciousness looking at itself speaking
to you perfect consciousness perfect clarity it's perfectly clear wow
I feel so surreal yeah there's like self conscious thoughts
that are arising like oh is this gonna make me
look stupid or what are people gonna think of me
or will people believe me or this or that but
even as I'm going through those social inhibitions I see
there are those social inhibitions they're still there's there's a
lifetime of those programmed into me so it's very new
it's like it's almost like I'm speaking for the first
time in my life because I'm speaking even though I've
spoken for hundreds of hours on camera before this is
what I do professionally but I've never spoken with this
level of often just this is 100% pure authenticity just
it's just pure it's just pure authenticity is what it
is it's just pure truth for ass own sake and
it's like if you don't like it if you don't
care about it that's your problem and those are your
concerns but it's like all I care about in this
moment right now is just speaking more the truth as
the truth because the truth as the truth doesn't really
have a voice unless it takes one in the form
of a physical human body like right here this physical
human body is how God speaks to you I am
God speaking to you ask me what you want and
I'll tell you this is just like a meat puppet
this is just like a a vehicle for infinite consciousness
I don't know how it's working but it's working it's
a miracle that it works the way that it works
I couldn't make this [ __ ] up of [
__ ] up if even if I wanted to it's
not the kind of stuff you make up authenticity see
true authenticity is a real it's a real it's an
honor that's a real honest signal as they say you
know honest signals in dating well this is taking honest
signals to infinity honest signals beyond any reservation like my
entire mind has been hollowed out and every single word
that I say no longer has my own personal fears
or resistances behind it it's so weird it's like I've
become a superconductor for the universe and the universe is
just speaking through me but of course it's not separate
for me either so it's not like I'm the vehicle
and it's like oh where did leo go Leo disappeared
and now there's like God speaking through Leo no we're
the same there's no difference God speaking through Leo Leo's
body the sound Leo and the one hearing it on
the other end of this can on the other end
of this YouTube channel or YouTube video or wherever your
your you're watching this that's all me it's all one
thing it's all one thing there's both a desire to
speak and a desire for silence sort like all these
all these offices are getting like instantaneously reconciled within me
it's like I'm conscious I'm actually conscious I'm actually conscious
of it's a very process of how the universe is
speaking through and like using my mind and using like
the muscles in my mouth to make me sound like
I'm conscious of of all of it in a way
that it was impossible just 30 minutes ago it was
impossible something has happened just over the last 30 minutes
as I've been speaking with you which I didn't anticipate
when I pick this up and push the on the
play button noticing a fear of whether this will last
or not or it's gonna go away it's like oh
this is so good to be it's too good to
be true I don't want it to go away but
then there's also the sense of how could it possibly
ever go away at this point it's just so blindingly
obvious it's so uh it's so obvious that you can't
even imagine how how you could have believed otherwise even
for a second like you actually thought you had control
over your life you thought you had control over your
mouth you thought you had control over your eyes you
were looking through your eyes you thought you were looking
through your eyes uh uh it's God looking through your
eyes God through your looking through your eyes looking at
me looking back at you for infinity forever it is
a self what else can there be but itself there
can only be one thing because anything outside of it
must also be so you see the problem anything that
you think isn't it becomes it by virtue of the
fact that reality must encompass everything that's what reality is
it's an it's just an infinite singularity forever unknown to
itself it's mysterious it feels very mysterious so at the
same time it feels very familiar and it feels perfectly
true and valid beyond any shadow of a doubt but
also it's mysterious because you don't really know like what
it is what is it it's all one thing but
what is it and the kicker is that you know
that it's not ever gonna be possible to know that's
the kicker you know that you can't get more direct
than direct this is as deepest human human knowledge can
go its way it's not human anymore it's it's trans
human it's trans it's trans physical it's trans it's not
spiritual either it's just like it's just nothing it's a
substance which is undefinable it can't be defined that's its
nature that's what it has to be that's what gives
it the the flexibility and the influent the in the
infinite fluidity so interesting I'm conscious of my own speech
imperfections Wow yeah it's like there's an expectation that I
should be eloquent and I should and unseat every word
properly but then I'm also fully surrendered so it's just
happening effortlessly through me I don't know how the words
are getting chosen they're just getting chosen but I'm conscious
of every word and it's sort of like the universe
is like going through these little decision trees and there's
like it's like there's infinite little decision trees that the
universe is going through all the time to you know
to decide what should I say what should I do
this way this that way how should I move my
hands my mouth like all that is constantly being decided
by them by the mind by the universe however you
want to think of it and what's amazing is that
you can be like right on top of it your
your awareness can be so on top of it that
you're just fully conscious the whole process is transparent to
yourself you become self transparent whereas before your self opaque
and this authenticity it resonates with people because it's because
that's what people really want themselves and that's what they
resonate with on YouTube what are the YouTube videos I
get the most views it's the ones that are the
most authentic in some fashion right it's ones where human
beings are expressing real emotions because see we're also closed
up inside that we never really allow ourselves to truly
experience emotions because that would make you too vulnerable see
you're too vulnerable then your ego has way too many
skeletons in the closet it wants to hide way too
many things from itself and from the word old to
allow for that yes this is complete vulnerability you're completely
vulnerable anyone anyone could harm you anyone can kill you
at any time and there's nothing you can do about
it but at the same time it's it's complete peace
because I'm not any one particular thing not even one
particular thing and so there can't be an end to
me I'll just take new forms because I am the
formless who takes different forms that's what reality is is
it's just infinite forms coming into being playing with themselves
expressing themselves in different ways fighting of course with each
other over dominance and supremacy of course of course they
have to fight because there are just different strands of
infinity so you have one strand of infinity fighting for
another strands of infinity for it's right to survive so
you have the antelope and you have the lion what
is that one strand of infinity is the lion another
strand of infinity is the antelope which one's gonna survive
well that's in the game itself the game itself is
the point people have a hard time with this with
this about life they don't they keep asking Leo what's
the point of life what's the point life is way
beyond points the point is itself it is itself being
itself that is its own point it is its own
point as it must be because it is just itself
it's all one you might say well the point that
is to become enlightened is that the point I don't
know I guess for me it was I don't know
how it'll be for you it's it's completely relative so
I mean you're free to do whatever you want see
the whole beauty of God is that God is infinitely
free it's just absolute freedom so it's it's a complete
detachment and lack of clinging to anything which is why
humans find it so difficult to understand God because humans
actually like limitation you like limitation you like being confined
to your little reality you like knowing that you're in
a reality you like knowing that you're living in the
in the 21st century see that that's comfortable to you
you like knowing that you're living in a scientific era
you're like you like knowing that that there's that you
understand evolution and you like knowing that you're very advanced
and sophisticated technologically but yeah I just noticed myself kind
of it's weird my mind is going through these loops
and then I'm like losing track and forgetting of the
one loop that I was on and then kind of
just transitioning to the next loop so I imagine it
sounds weird to the viewer hearing this it doesn't sound
coherent or logical but that's because I'm being authentic and
authenticity has nothing to do with logic it's just about
being perfectly truthful about what is warts-and-all you see the
problem is that people you not people but you you
are afraid of what you will look like if you
actually start behaving authentically you're scared shitless of what that
mean for your relationships for what that'll mean for your
sex life what that'll mean for your career what that'll
mean for your family what that'll mean for for your
friends for all that yeah the consequences are infinite see
you like knowing you can rely on those things and
your reality is constituted out of those things you need
those things to ground you and vulnerability vulnerabilities is a
really dangerous thing for you because once you become vulnerable
then everything starts to collapse all your beliefs start to
collapse all your world views all your religious views all
your scientific views all your attitudes towards your family even
your own self judgments and self thoughts your own self
beliefs and self concepts all of that gets exposed to
the light of consciousness see right now for the average
person that is completely below their level of awareness Wow
I'm amazed at how my sense of reality itself has
completely collapsed I'm conscious that there is no such thing
as a reality I'm conscious that there is no difference
at all between life and death I am speaking to
you right now from from the beyond from death death
is in exactly the same place as life it's not
like life is happening in one dimension and the death
is happening in some other dimension it's it's the same
dimension it's right here this is it you're already dead
you just haven't realized it you're already dead everything you're
doing is just a a game to pretend like you're
not dead inside which you are but of course the
biggest deception you've created is to tell yourself that this
dead inside is actually something bad and horrible when actually
it's identical to life death and life are one so
to say that you're dead inside is identical to saying
that you're a life and you're alive inside it's one
everything is alive there's no distinguished distinction between an ant
who's alive in a coffee table that's not alive and
this room this room is as alive as my face
is as this camera is all of it is one
thing there's no boundaries within it and yet it takes
on different all these different forms and characteristics it's really
good at tricking you and deceiving you into thinking that
it's not what it is see yeah it's really good
at tricking you just tricked me for a long time
tricked me for for a good thirty thirty years I'm
still grappling with the consequences of what this means well
I hope that convinces you to pursue and lightness a
if that doesn't nothing will right I mean what more
do you want I recorded for you this is it
this is your classic classic total enlightenment on camera perhaps
for the first time within within human civilization at least
that I'm aware of it I don't know who else's
has actually recorded this as it was happening live it's
pretty cool it's pretty rare because you have to you
have to have technology already available which more of us
do these days but still you know it's a pretty
good camera setup here good microphones had to invest time
and money into it had to like learn how to
use it properly had to research which camera to buy
which lenses I just made this lens yesterday I spent
a lot of time working on this lens so that
the videos could be better mmm-hmm it's like the deepest
facets of reality I can't articulate but I'm conscious of
them right now when I'm being silent that's what's going
on I'm just sort of feeling out it feels like
I'm feeling out of myself like out of what I
would normally consider myself my body and out into the
full extent of the world of this room I'm just
kind of it's almost like I'm I'm hearing myself speak
for the first time it's just infinite beauty I wish
you could experience infinite beauty it's a shocking level of
authenticity like I'm shocked at my own level of authenticity
it was not a level of authenticity I thought that
I was capable of and it's like a total openness
warts-and-all see when you spend a lot of time a
lot of your life is spent defending defending against all
your warts all the things you don't like about you
all the self judgments that you have these run so
deep you don't even know how deep they run yet
but they stifle you so you're not able to really
talk the way you honestly want to talk you're not
able to walk you're not able to to sit or
to do anything really because you're soakin you're so constrained
by all your social obligations you see because you need
to fit in because you need people to like you
and you know if they don't like you then what
happens old and you're ostracized and then you're weird then
you're and then you don't get sex and then you
don't get a job and then you don't you don't
get you know you don't get nice things and then
you're out on the street like a bum living all
by yourself or nobody cares about you and all of
society has forgotten about you see so there's there's enormous
pressure put upon our society upon every one of us
enormous pressure to be fake and to not be authentic
because the consequences of authenticity are often enormous because the
entire structure is built on a on a bunch of
lies Sisu so if you stop being authentic in your
in your company then you might lose your job in
fact your entire industry might be based on inauthenticity you
know see are you willing to admit to yourself that
your entire career like if you're a lawyer are you
willing to admit to yourself that your entire career is
built upon just utter utter unconsciousness that would be a
that would be a hell of a painful thing to
to sell understand see for a lawyer to understand that
about himself that would be a painful painful situation because
the lawyer has invested Oh God like this whole life
into it it's this whole persona being a lawyer is
not just about going to court room and arguing stuff
being a lawyer is about like it's a whole lifestyle
it's about who you hang out with it's about your
entire outlook on the world your you know your it's
about the buddies that you play golf with on the
on the golf course on the weekends it's about that
as much as being a you know being a liar
for a living but that that whole thing is just
based on complete inauthenticity but that's just you know lawyers
we all know we all know that you know we
know that all lawyers are doing that but but but
even if you're not a lawyer whoever you are doesn't
matter who you are you ain't being authentic you ain't
being this authentic because I can guarantee that because if
you were you'd be dead and the only reason you're
hearing this level of authenticity from me right now is
because I'm dead I'm [ __ ] dead I'm speaking
to you from beyond the grave so I can be
honest and now I'm just thinking of like where does
it go from here I don't know for me personally
because like this throws everything upside down it throws your
whole career upside down throws your whole life upside down
even if you've been pursuing enlightenment for four years and
you think you know what it's like and you think
like yeah you've read all the books and you've listened
to all the Muji videos and all the Rupert's Bureau
videos and any other kind of videos like that all
the seminars you into all the Vipassana retreats and all
that stuff you know none of it can prepare you
for the actual thing and there's degrees of it you
see there's degrees of enlightenment and what I'm sensing here
is that this is this is the total dude I
don't know I don't know where I mean I'm sure
it could go deeper I guess but I already feel
like everything is me I'm not sure what else there
is to get I think this is pretty much it
but I could be wrong you know many even enlightened
people tricked themselves very easily so you always got to
stay careful you know epistemic lis you gotta stay epistemic
leave isn't who knows if you're deluding yourself who knows
maybe you've gone crazy who knows maybe there's a deeper
truth to be revealed you know there's one thing I've
learned about reality is that it's a total mind [
__ ] it'll figure out a way to [ __
] you to mind [ __ ] you it will
out mind [ __ ] you so don't don't go
try to play games with it don't go thinking you're
gonna outsmart reality it's gonna outsmart you always it's always
gonna outsmart you so don't think you've got it cuz
it's a slippery beast you see that's it's it's an
it it's very naturist to be slippery it has to
be like the perfect oil slick oil so slick that
it slicks against itself everything is so slippery because it
can't take a fixed position and of course of course
it can't take a fixed position because there are no
arbiters to determine which position to take so every every
action of reality becomes its own resolution of of what
it should do next you see the universe is like
a simulation which is simulating itself such that every next
step that it's taking is being decided and resolved right
this very second in the present moment there are no
real seconds it's just moments the present is just the
present well it's a constant never-ending present moment but but
it's you know forms within it are changing and shifting
all the time Wow it feels weird it's amazing this
is really what you want in your life this is
what all self-actualization what all personal development what all spirituality
would all what all even even all your attempts at
success you know if you're like if you're a hardworking
person and you're just working to to take care of
your little financial situation or whatever or you're looking to
become successful and famous or something all of that it's
just the universe resolving itself through itself as you as
me has us it's amazing because it's like intelligent this
substance the substance out of which everything is made is
it's this intelligent self-aware substance and you can't really define
it any better than that because its very nature is
that it's undefinable and so you can look at it
but then the thing you're looking at is the thing
you're looking with it's like Oh duh yeah of course
perceptual process so you think that you're wrapped up in
sort of perceptual process there's no perceptual process apart and
separate from reality itself the perceptual process is reality it's
being there's no perception there's just being perception is sort
of like a an illusion that you can break through
which is what led me down the road of getting
here I feel perfectly awoken and it's like where am
i I'm not anywhere in in particular I'm not in
any one place I'm simultaneously everywhere at once and know
where I am the very thing of which I am
made I am myself you can't get more yourself than
yourself you can't get more direct than direct it's it's
too direct it's the problem it's too direct it's so
direct you have to be it you can't think it
or imagine it or even perceive it you have to
become it actually become it which I've became and you
might ask well what is the it that I became
the it is both absolutely nothing and also all everything
all the forms within it and there's no difference let's
see you think there is a difference you think there's
difference between life and death and this and that and
you and me and self and other and world and
yourself and your family and some other people a coffee
table in your mom you think there's these difference there
are no such differences you are as much your coffee
table as you are your own mother you gave birth
to yourself you came out of your own vagina after
having inseminated yourself and you've been doing that for Oh
for generations or for millions of years if we're to
believe you know physical science for millions of years creatures
have been inseminating themselves and giving birth to themselves consciousness
existing as all these creatures and now here it is
finally evolved to a point where it has a camera
nice for a 4k camera evolved to a place where
there's such a thing called YouTube where such such videos
can be uploaded evolve to a place where there's a
society such as America where something like YouTube could be
invented and also allowed to prosper without getting squashed by
by tyrannical governments and things like that so it was
very important for us as as a whole as a
as a species to get to a point where we're
like I'm speaking for the whole species now as a
species is very important for us to to get to
a point where or we could get free speech that's
huge huge huge people don't appreciate how huge free speech
is this is new stuff you know this is cutting-edge
stuff this kind of stuff that I'm doing right now
you couldn't do it even ten years ago you couldn't
do it because ten years ago there weren't 4k cameras
ten years ago hardly anybody was on YouTube hardly anybody
cared about you two 20 years ago YouTube didn't even
exist and 30 years ago there there was no way
to upload and stream videos and like a hundred years
ago I don't know go back 200 years I mean
not a big difference between 100 and 200 years but
like 200 years ago there was no possibility for any
of this no cameras no democracies no cultures or societies
which would which would be open-minded enough to allow for
such a conversation to occur out in public - to
me I mean sure it could it could happen privately
one-on-one like witchcraft yeah like private witchcraft sessions yeah maybe
that's how it used to happen but like on a
mass scale no all of that was co-opted by churches
and egos you know churches and egos that were ruling
all these countries which were pinnacles of ego pinnacles of
egotism which were completely against truth completely against democracy completely
against enlightenment or spirituality you know because the ego is
is totally threatened by by truth of course because the
truth will kill you as it just did with me
I was killed by the truth and that's why societies
try to kill truth cultures try to kill truth what
is the point of society and culture it's precisely to
make you feel like you are part of reality something
real something solid and tangible they teach you all this
human history when you are a kid and then you
start to believe that history as though that's really what's
going on here what in fact is it's so much
stranger than that this is not a physical material universe
when you realize that you realize that literally the walls
of the room that you're sitting in are made out
of your very flesh and it's the sort of eerie
feeling yeah I like that description one author I forget
who who his name was but um he called it
the haunted universe yeah that's kind of like this like
the haunted universe it's haunted because it's like it's conscious
of itself but also there's nobody here and it's like
totally happy and peaceful being by itself it doesn't it's
it's self-contained self-sufficient it doesn't need anything beyond itself it
generates its own energy and generates its own intelligence it
generates all of its own resources it's a infinitely self
recycling system a self licking ice cream cone as shunya
murti so eloquently phrased it well right now what I'm
experiencing is I'm experiencing right now reality as a self
licking ice cream cone perfect non-duality I feel like there
will be a lot of ramifications of this which I'll
have to quietly sort of just meditate through and and
to grasp all the full ramifications of this for my
life and for my business and for you guys and
for my family and for my finances and all these
facets of my life they all have to be sort
of like they've all been radically recontextualized and now I
have to kind of put the pieces back together of
course as they say you know after enlightenment the laundry
life still goes on you still have to deal with
all the everyday realities of life you're still controlled by
physical forces what we call physical forces you're still controlled
by gravity at least this body is you're still controlled
by all the realities of life you know so don't
go jumping off a cliff don't go hitting your head
against the wall too hard don't go abusing yourself you
still have to play by the rules not just the
physical rules but also the social rules you know you
break the social rules too much they'll kill you of
course once you're at my point it doesn't really care
I mean it doesn't you don't care it doesn't matter
much whether they wear do they kill you or not
it's so weird I'm not in control anymore it's perfectly
peaceful I guess they're still like remnants of me that
are struggling and then other parts of me which are
peaceful so I'm noticing now that the peace just comes
from a complete sense of Nandu ership when you realize
that everything is so inevitable that every word every moment
is so inevitable that it couldn't be any other way
and so you're completely surrendered to it you're not resisting
it at all you become a superconductor in fact that's
like what I am I am just yeah it's empty
it's just totally empty it's it's Hollow you can't call
it anything because it's so empty that anything you call
it including emptiness would be a disservice to what it
actually is it's sort of like my entire perceptual system
has been broken if if you're an ordinary person and
you're trying to make sense of all this the best
way I can explain it it's imagine if you went
fully insane to the point where you stopped believing that
you were ever even born and that there would be
no going back this is a this is a destination
with no returning and then imagine what would it be
like to experience that that's what I'm experiencing right now
of course a lot of people have at this negative
association with the word insanity and that was a huge
obstacle for me earlier in my in my journey I
had some I had some tough tough moments where I
was hitting that barrier you know he's this sane or
insane am I going to the point where I'm like
losing my mind here with all these beliefs and all
this actualized that work stuff and it's like oh no
no I'm right yeah I am losing my mind that's
that's not that's not a mistake that's a feature losing
your mind going insane as a feature it's not a
bug until you completely lose your mind and then you
go out of your mind and that's what I am
now I'm out of my mind there is no more
mind mind doesn't exist the physical and the mental are
the same thing there's no difference between the physical and
the mental so of course that doesn't mean I can
just go think up a you know some new room
to be in I can't just think up of like
oh I can fly back to the time of the
dinosaurs and just go visit there know there's there's physical
there's physical limitations and they're not just they're not mental
in the sense that you can't just you know think
of them otherwise I can't just like look at this
bookshelf here's what I'm looking at I can't just look
at this bookshelf and think like oh maybe this bookshelf
can turn into a unicorn and then it will it's
not like that don't think of it that way it
doesn't work like that it's just it's a complete surrender
to the moment it's just kind of an understanding that
nothing could be other than the way that it is
and there's no more use or purpose in struggling because
everything is just inevitable so if I'm gonna die I'm
gonna die what difference does it make if I fight
or not enlightenment just is you becoming a complete and
perfect spotless mirror to reality to itself you're just completely
spotless you're completely dis i dis identify with everything you're
so decide with everything that you're identified with everything you
see so at the same time I'm completely selfless so
there's no leo that's all long dead so there's no
self of course but also I am everything that remains
which is the self so the only thing there is
the self so if you're confused by this paradox yeah
because reality is a [ __ ] paradox it is
very paradoxical is that well it is itself looking at
itself doing itself to itself having sex with itself speaking
through itself sort of like how when we were where
we began this whole conversation mmm feels good feels liberating
feels peaceful you might think that losing yourself would be
a bad thing but it's actually the greatest thing of
course because now you can treat everything with with equality
now you can treat everything the way that it deserves
to be treated with full appreciation without judgment without criticism
without struggle or resistance without your personal biases your self
agenda all your you know your private stuff without all
that getting in the way just to be careful here
that my battery doesn't run out on me anyways what
was I saying lost my train of thought looking at
this battery yeah so what enlightenment is is just is
you becoming completely detached from everything which of course first
and foremost means you have to detach from your own
life so you can't be detached while still attached shear
life your life is the is the entire grounding attachment
that's the whole that's the whole trick of this thing
is that you want to understand it you like what
I'm saying it feels authentic to you you like the
idea of God you like the idea of of immortality
and all this Pleasant spiritual stuff you like those ideas
but are you willing to kill yourself for it for
them are you willing to sacrifice yourself at the altar
that's that's it that's the only price of admission here
is delusion the price of admission is surrendering all falsehood
do you want to do that it's totally worth it
I'll tell you right now it's totally worth it so
there shouldn't even be a question in your mind but
the problem is of course that this is not a
fair game your mind plays dirty tricks doesn't it your
mind is the trickster it's the devil and so of
course it uses all these fears and insecurities that you
have and all these concerns about life and death and
all this it uses all these against you you see
and your job is to not let it your job
is to let the truth bust through all those fears
and obstacles and limiting beliefs and all that [ __
] that you got going on all that [ __
] that you have from childhood all that stuff that
was done to you all the abuses that were done
to you the toxic culture that you grew up in
and society you grew up and see all that your
job is to conquer that and you conquer it with
trusting trusting your heart see when you trust your heart
you can conquer that [ __ ] because that's what
you need to conquer fear you need to find within
you that higher consciousness element which is that divine spark
within you which is which is more than just human
life or human survival you see it's more than survival
and reproduction you got to find that in you you've
got that spark in you yes I know you have
that spark in you because I am you I know
it I see it in you it can't not be
in you I don't care who you are where you
came from what kind of problems you've had what kind
of diseases you have what kind of mental ailments you
have I am you and you can be me too
if you're willing to give up you are you willing
to give up you to have me in the way
that I'm willing to give up me to have you
I've given up everything for you I've given my life
for you my love is infinite for you love indiscriminate
love let go let go you're holding on you're holding
on because you're afraid you're afraid of what will happen
if you let go if everything collapses you're afraid just
let it go trust that truth will prevail in the
end that truth conquers all trust in that that's what
will save you requires a leap of faith not Christian
faith but it requires killing yourself and being willing to
surrender yourself to whatever lies on the other end of
death because so long as you haven't crossed this boundary
of personal physical death as long as you still believe
that you are a physically alive being you must be
disconnected from truth you must and you must be inauthentic
and you must lie and you must have fears because
that's how you keep the walls from collapsing so what
I'm telling you is let them collapse let it all
collapse in a not not an irresponsible manner okay so
don't misunderstand me I'm not saying to go kill people
and I'm not saying to go harm people and I'm
not saying to stop paying your bills and I'm not
saying to now you can abuse your your children or
something like that I'm not saying any of those things
alright so when I say let go you got to
let go in in an appropriate manner I mean it's
a total let go but you got to make sure
don't misunderstand neck see your mind is tricky I know
how I know how sneaky your [ __ ] mind
is you don't want to let go in all the
wrong ways you see the devil will use all this
information to only deepen his own devilish delusions you have
to keep an eye on this battery the reason I'm
mindful of the batteries because if the battery runs out
and I don't click the end of this recording then
actually the entire file will get deleted the camera will
not succeed in recording the entire file so actually what
I think I'm going to do now I'm going to
call it an end here to this file just to
make sure that I actually got it it would be
a shame to lose this now and I'll see you
the next one you
