hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm gonna talk about negative visualization misfortune ways most
heavily on those who expect nothing but good fortune this
is a quote from Seneca Seneca was a Roman senator
as I recall and he was a stoic what is
stoicism and more importantly what does this have to do
with our topic our theme for this video which is
negative visualization negative visualization is a pretty cool idea and
it's a technique that was developed by the ancient Greeks
and Romans to help you develop gratitude and more happiness
in your life and what I want to do in
this video is show you how to use this technique
and start to get you to really notice how you're
leaking happiness in your life because this is what's happening
a lot of people is that we're going out there
and we're creating success externally for ourselves but then we're
still feeling empty inside and that's because we fail to
understand some of these fundamental principles about happiness that the
ancient Greeks and Romans understood several thousand years ago and
yet today with all the information that we have we
still failed to actually practice this and it's always good
to go back into the past look at the sages
and the wise people who really knew and really studied
the stuff and really understood how happiness works because human
psychology hasn't changed in the last two thousand years it's
basically the same as it was so this is a
good reference point so what is negative visualization as a
technique this is a psychological technique that you can use
on yourself and it basically works like this you visualize
yourself deprived of whatever it is that you really value
in your life so whatever in your life is important
to you something that you maybe strive for in the
past and now you have whether that's your family or
your material possessions or your job or your health or
anything like that that you would really appreciate what you
do is you imagine that you lost this thing so
imagine that you lost your family imagine that you lost
your house imagine that you lost your job imagine that
you lost your health and when you imagine this you
do it in a cool and rational sort of way
not in a neurotic anxious sort of way and as
you do this what it does is it helps to
build a sense of appreciation within you that you have
these things that's basically what the technique is it's pretty
simple what's powerful about it though is that it goes
to some really fundamental truths about human psychology that like
I said the Greeks and Romans understood 2,000 years ago
and here is the fundamental truth the fundamental truth is
something called hedonic adaptation that's a modern word but the
ancients knew about this hedonic adaptation is the human tendency
to get acclimated to whatever circumstances were in in life
it's kind of like going into the pool right you
go into the cold pool and at first it feels
very cold and uncomfortable but then you get acclimated to
it and the water becomes refreshing and it just feels
like you're floating and you're not in cold water if
you go into a hot or a warm pool again
your body will also acclimate to that and you're not
going to feel that as much as well now this
happens with us physically with sense of touch with sense
of sight with sense of hearing but it also happens
to the stuff that we have in our lives so
whatever you have in your life whether you have really
bad circumstances in life what we would call objectively bad
let's say you're in severe poverty or if you have
really good circumstance in life let's say that you're really
wealthy actually those circumstances they don't have as much effect
on your happiness level as we would assume they do
the naive assumption that we would have just our intuition
would say well of course the the rich person is
going to be much happier than this parsha person who's
stuck in poverty but actually what you find is that
there's not that much of a difference there is an
initial difference so what your body is really good at
and what your brain is really good at registering is
changes in differences so that means that if you were
rich and you become poor you're gonna feel that that's
gonna probably hurt a lot for you but then if
you acclimate to that situation let's say you go from
be very wealthy to going bankrupt and becoming very poor
if you live in poverty for a for a while
you're not gonna start to notice that as much it's
not gonna it's not gonna really influence your happiness level
because your mind and your body is very adaptable it
just takes on whatever conditions it's given likewise if you
are poor your whole life and then suddenly you become
rich that change in your conditions is gonna make you
feel really good it's gonna make you feel very excited
and it's gonna seem like you became happy because now
you're much richer but actually what's gonna happen is that
you're gonna get that initial spike in happiness but then
it's gonna drop back down because your body and your
mind are gonna acclimate in a few months after your
wealth a few months of living in in that kind
of that kind of lifestyle and those kind of circumstances
eventually what's going to happen is that you're just gonna
get back to them basically the same level that you
were at when you were poor so this is a
tricky thing hedonic adaptation this is really why it's hard
for us to ever be happy in our lives because
we're always going out there and we're chasing stuff we're
trying to establish really good life circumstances right whether it's
that family that you want that girlfriend or boyfriend that
you're really looking for or maybe you're looking to improve
your health you want to get fit or you just
want to get rid of some ailments that you've got
or you want more money you want to start a
business you want a career you want a job you
want more friends whatever it is if you want of
course we think that those are gonna make us happy
and you should pursue those things but you should also
develop appreciation for it and this is really where the
Stoics had some brilliant understanding of human psychology who were
the Stoics the Stoics were people like Zeno Seneca who
I'm quote who I quoted at the beginning here Epictetus
and also Marcus Aurelius all of these people were famous
Greeks and Romans and they practice stoicism as a life
philosophy stoicism was a school of philosophy that was really
concerned about how do you create a good high quality
life it wasn't just interested about arguing theoretical concepts and
doing kind of traditional philosophy as we think of it
it was more what I would call now a positive
psychology it was more like self-help it was like how
do you live your life in accordance to certain principles
that will guarantee maximum happiness and the Stoics were really
keen and real sticklers on practicing what they preached and
so they developed some of these techniques and these techniques
can be really powerful and they used them themselves you
could read books from Seneca or from Marcus Aurelius you
can read their writings and you could see the way
that they thought about life was very different than the
way that we think about it today so appreciation how
does this negative visualization create appreciation for us it might
seem on the surface that if I'm thinking about being
deprived of some of the stuff that I'm happy about
in my life like my family or my home or
my job then that would make me depressed or miserable
let's take a look at an example of how this
actually works so what the Stoics are telling you to
do here this is literally how it works you wake
up in the morning and let's say you go and
you do your morning routine so you're gonna go to
the bathroom and you're gonna shower and shave and do
all your stuff there and brush your teeth now as
you're brushing your teeth what you're gonna do to practice
this negative visualization is for about five minutes as you're
doing that you're gonna start thinking and you're gonna think
to yourself hmm what do I really value in my
life that I take for granted now just be cuz
I've adapted to it through hedonic adaptation well what about
my hands it could easily be the case that I
don't have any hands what if I was born without
hand there are people like that it's a genetic defect
what if I lost my hand let's say I lost
my left hand in a car accident or while I
was deployed overseas or in some sort of accident elsewhere
what if I did have my left hand right now
what would my life be like and so you start
imagining what your life would be like and in fact
as you're brushing your teeth and you've picked up the
toothbrush with your right hand and you're reaching for the
toothpaste with your left hand you're gonna notice oh I
couldn't do that if I didn't have this amazing left
hand in fact this is a really amazing instrument we
take it for granted but the amount of movements possible
with this hand the precision that we have is really
amazing there's not even any modern mechanical robotic hands that
are really quite as sensitive and quite as as as
capable as a human hand so it's a really a
marvel of engineering that this thing evolved and now we
have two of them but how often do you really
think about that maybe never in your life have you
considered how amazing your hands are and how how much
you really appreciate and value that until right now when
I'm telling you this but see as you're doing this
negative visualization and you're reaching for that toothpaste now you
can't you can't do that if you don't have a
left hand so now you start to appreciate oh this
left hand allows me to squeeze the toothpaste on my
toothbrush while I'm holding it how would I do it
otherwise I'd have to like lay my toothbrush down on
the counter maybe it would tip over because then I
would have to use my right hand and how would
I unscrew the cap from the toothpaste with only one
hand that would be a challenge to I'd have to
lay down the the toothpaste and then I have to
somehow finagle it see and this is gonna start going
through your mind and as you're thinking about this you're
really getting a sense of gratitude about how nice it
is to have a left hand whereas if you didn't
do that that negative visualization then you would never even
consider how much value your left hand has to you
in fact you might have noticed this but if you
ever get like a cut on your hand or maybe
you get a blister or something and then you go
about your normal everyday life you start to recognize not
only how much you use your hand but even a
specific part of your hand has that ever happened to
you it's funny like sometimes I'll cut myself and and
then I'll be driving the car and I'll notice that
actually that part where I cut myself and maybe it's
just I'll lick a little cut like maybe it's even
just like a paper cut right just like a little
thing and it's somewhere on my hand here and I
just I would assume that you know well this this
part of the hand it's not it's not very meaningful
it's just like maybe 2% of this entire surface area
but actually what you realize is that when you're driving
your car that little paper cut you can notice that
oh now I see that I was actually using that
part of my hand on the steering wheel and maybe
not only on the steering wheel but you're also using
it when you're doing something else like flicking on the
blinker lights and maybe you're using it when you're writing
a document at home maybe you're using it when you're
picking up your kids maybe you're using that part of
the hand when you're working out at the gym and
it's really funny that when you when you get a
little cut like that it makes you appreciate and almost
sometimes when I get a cut like that in a
really kind of a like a place that gets used
a lot on my hand then I'll start to think
I'll be like oh damn I just I just wish
I got that cut somewhere else and then what happens
is that sometime later maybe a year later I get
a I get a cut on some other part in
my hand and then I wish oh man I wish
I wouldn't didn't get a cut there either because you
never appreciate just how much you're using this stuff so
this is what the Stokes really want to turn you
onto with this negative negative visualization is is just how
much you're taking for granted everything in your life it's
good to make a list I want you to actually
use this technique for the next week so what that
means you're gonna spend five minutes every single day consciously
doing some sort of negative visualization and to help you
do that what I want you to do right now
is after this video is over I want you to
sit down pull out a piece of paper and write
down ten things that you really have in your life
that are just absolutely amazing but that you take completely
for granted maybe that's going to include your parents your
family your kids your house the country that you live
in the fact that you have good health the fact
that you have decent income the city that you live
in the girlfriend or boyfriend that you have maybe how
fortunate you've been up to now in your in your
childhood and also as as an adult the circumstances that
you've had you know take note of the stuff that
you're really taking for granted in your life maybe it's
your hands maybe it's your body maybe it's your eyesight
or your sense of hearing there's quite a lot here
really sit down and think about this create a list
of your top ten now when you've got this list
briefly consider right then as you're looking over it what
your life would be like if you lost that thing
because you're not entitled to anything see this is where
people really go wrong about happiness and success in life
and I see this happening a lot in modern society
and this wasn't the case I think 2000 years ago
because back then it was a lot harder to acquire
some of the amazing stuff that we have today simple
luxuries that they didn't have 2,000 years ago today we
just take completely for granted a lot of people argue
are so entitled about stuff in life and really what
the Stokes taught was that you're not entitled to anything
anything at all we like to think for example that
we're entitled to a decent house we're entitled to clean
water we're entitled to free medical care we're entitled to
being treated well by our spouse we're entitled to seeing
our children go grow up and grow old we're entitled
to see ourselves be healthy we're entitled to have a
good job we're entitled to have friends that are nice
to us we're entitled to not have to pay too
many taxes so like all of these things we think
like they're just our rights when in fact if you
really think about if you'll really look around you for
a second it's just a miracle that you're just sitting
right now wherever you're sitting or standing and that you're
just living and breathing that right there is already an
amazing thing as I wonder because you've literally got several
trillion up cells in this body that are comprising you
and each cell is like a little organism and it's
got its own life this cell you are made up
of trillions of those and all those cells are somehow
cooperating and working together functioning amazingly well so that you
can have energy so you can wake up in the
morning so you can go pick up the kids so
you can go work at your job and do all
the kind of normal stuff you do in your day
and you take completely for granted but then of course
if you have a health problem you quickly realize just
how much you take that stuff for granted that your
body does for you just a simple cold will make
you very aware of this fact but an even more
serious condition will will really sober you up to that
fact and the fact is that you're not entitled to
anything in life you're not entitled to a job you're
not entitled to have a car you're not entitled to
love or sex you're not entitled to income you're not
entitled to even be alive you're not entitled that your
family is a lie you're not entitled that your children
are alive none of that stuff is entitled that stuff
is just something that exists right now in the moment
and it will go away one thing that the Stokes
really taught and based their whole philosophy around is this
idea that life is very impermanent and that everything that
you have now everything that you've ever had will be
gone and it's not going to be that long until
that happens so you have to start to appreciate really
how much you have in your life right now and
how fleeting all that stuff is because that stuff is
all in a state of flux a state of transition
everything around you that you value is transitioning including your
own body your health yourself your children your house your
job all of that stuff will decay all that stuff
will die not only will all the people around you
die all the circumstances around you will decay all the
buildings around you will eventually collapse all the corporations that
exist will eventually dissolve or go bankrupt or be no
more the entire human species will eventually be gone this
entire planet that we're living on is eventually going to
be evaporated by the Sun when the Sun expires and
it burns through and it basically explodes and consumes the
earth and every other planet in our solar system so
all of that is gonna go and it's it's sobering
to realizes because we don't usually think about it some
people might say well that's pretty negative Leo pretty pessimistic
of you to be talking about this stuff shouldn't we
be positive well the the Stoics were I wouldn't say
they were pessimistic sort but they were they were very
they were they were very pragmatic about life it wasn't
about positive or negative it was just about what is
and they were doing this in a controlled cool and
rational sort of way they weren't doing this as neurotics
or as anxious pessimistic thinkers that wasn't their modus operandi
so I want you to make this list make a
list of these things and really consider what would be
like if you lost some of those things how would
you feel how how would you like be different it's
interesting because people will sometimes leave me comments in the
YouTube sections of my videos and it's it's very interesting
to read some of those because sometimes you really see
a lot of negative thinking or a lot of victim
energy in those comments and one of the things that
people will do is they'll start to compare themselves to
other people and they'll feel entitled to certain things for
example somebody will come in and say well but I
suck with women Leo I can't attract the woman that
I want I can't get that girlfriend I want or
somebody else will come in there and say I can't
start the family that I want to start or I
can't do the this kind of job that I want
to do or I don't have enough money to do
this or this or this or this and so they
compare themselves to other people and they feel like they're
entitled to the same level of results or success that
other people have and this is very much not the
case you have to start considering that your circumstance are
very unique and that you're not entitled to absolutely anything
in life sometimes people will come in and they'll say
something like this oh man I just lost that amazing
promotion that I wanted at work I was really gunning
for that promotion and I didn't get it and now
I'm so depressed and so miserable but what the Stokes
would say that person is but do you still have
a job do you still love your work and that
person would then think about it say oh yeah that's
right I do have a job I was taking my
amazing job for granted I was already doing good at
my job I want to do even better I was
so focused on doing better that I completely forgot that
I was already doing pretty good okay wow I should
be grateful I should be happy just about where I
am right now not thinking about where I need to
go but then see some of you will say beliya
I don't even have a good job so aren't I
entitled to be miserable and depressed and complain about that
because this person sure he's got a decent job so
that promotion that's like icing on top of the cake
but what if you don't have a good job aren't
you really miserable then and the Stokes would come back
and say what about your family do you have a
family that loves you why don't you be grateful for
that even though you don't have a good job oh
that's right I do have a family I should be
grateful I'm taking my family for granted a lot are
not it oh that's right maybe I could feel a
bit more conscious about that a little bit happier in
the moment okay but see some of you will still
keep going and you'll say bolillo not only do I
not have a good job but I don't have a
good family either in fact my family is miserable maybe
they hate me or we have a lot of conflict
very dysfunctional family so I don't even have a good
family so aren't I entitled to be miserable now and
the answer is no you're not because the Stokes would
come back and say okay so you don't have your
family do you have a pet do you have a
cat or a dog that you love oh you do
well you should be grateful for the fact that you
have a cat or a dog or some other pet
that you really love even though you don't have a
family or a job because there's a lot of people
in the world that don't have a pet to love
but you do why don't you be more grateful for
that appreciate that a little bit more and now some
of you will keep going you'll say but Leo I
don't even have a pet I don't have a pet
I don't have a family I don't have a job
so my life is miserable surely right and the answer
is no you don't have a right to complain either
because maybe you don't have all those things but do
you have clothing do you have clothing that you can
that you can wear you have a shelter that you
can live in why don't be grateful for that because
there's a lot of people in the world that don't
have clothing or shelter and now someone might say the
leo I even struggle to to buy clothing and shelter
in fact maybe I just got kicked out of my
house or my apartment now I don't even have that
surely I can complain that I'm miserable now can't I
I'm justified in being miserable and the Stokes would say
no because you've still got so much what about your
health you've got great health be happy for that maybe
you don't have good clothing maybe you don't even have
a house or a place to live right now and
you don't have a family or a pet or a
good job but you still have your health and that's
a very amazing thing and now someone might say but
Leo surely there are people in the world that don't
even have their health they don't have health they don't
have shelter they don't have clothing they don't have a
dog they don't have a cat they don't have a
good family they don't have a good job they don't
have anything can they be miserable are they allowed to
complain and the answer is no they still have a
lot to be grateful for because they still have their
eyesight when was the last time you really showed appreciation
for your eyesight and how amazing that is how much
do you take that for granted and if you don't
have your eyesight then you have something else you have
your arms and your legs and if you don't have
your arms and your legs then maybe you've got hearing
and if you don't got hearing and you don't got
anything that was already mentioned then at the very least
which you've got is you've got your breath and you've
got just your aliveness you are alive and just the
very fact that you're alive is not something that you
should take for granted and it's not something that you
can feel entitled to that is not a right being
alive being alive is a very precious and a very
precarious thing in this universe because it's here one moment
and it's gone the next moment and you really need
to appreciate a lot more so no matter where you
are in your life there's always something for you to
be grateful for there's always something that you could lose
and feel worse than you're currently feeling so if you've
got nothing at all and all you've got is your
life then at the very least you've got that and
if you lost that you would be worse off than
you are right now that is how the Stoics want
you to think and I think it's a good way
to think I don't always go around thinking this way
but sometimes for five minutes in the day doing five
minutes of this kind of thinking can really bring you
back down to earth ground you because we live in
a in a culture and a society it's really ending
with media and the media is always showing us how
to do more right we want more we want to
do more we want to create more and nothing is
ever enough with this kind of philosophy and basically what
it does is it creates a never-ending treadmill and because
of hedonic adaptation you never get ahead you're just spinning
your wheels all the time well if you want to
stop spinning your wheels and develop some some real gratitude
some deep sense of happiness and life then you need
to start appreciating more of the stuff that you already
have that today you completely take for granted think about
all the stuff just five years ago that you wanted
to create in your life and align that stuff you
probably have already and how you completely have forgotten about
that stuff it's however the thing about that that's why
it's good to keep a list of goals if you're
a goal setter if you're doing lot of personal development
keep a list of goals keep those goals keep a
record and history of those archive those put them in
a file somewhere so you can go back ten years
from now and take a look at the kind of
goals that you had today and you take a look
at where you are ten years from now and you
see how much you've accomplished but what's really scary is
you see how much you've accomplished in those ten years
but you also see how you take all of it
for granted and how it hasn't really created any happiness
for you because even though you accomplished all that stuff
because you've now adapted to it it's not making you
any better on the inside the last point that I
want to mention here before I let you go is
this distinction between worry and negative visualization these are two
very different things and what I'm telling you here what
the Stoics were doing with this technique is they were
not telling you to be a worrier they're not trying
to make you a pessimist about life they're not trying
to make you neurotic they're not trying to make you
anxious well they're simply trying to do is to say
you have this ability to imagine and to appreciate this
is a conscious act worry and anxiousness these aren't conscious
acts these are reactions these are emotional emotionally triggered reactions
that's not what negative visualization is about at all negative
visualization is a very cool even minded almost meditative technique
so there's a very big difference between those two even
though on the surface they might seem similar and I
don't want you to use this as license to now
be a worrier about stuff that's not what we're doing
here so worrying is still bad don't do worrying but
negative visualization is good and what I'm leaving you here
with now is I want you two to do a
week where you do seven days straight of negative visualization
for five minutes every day in the morning in the
evening whenever you want to do it and just see
how you feel a week after that see how much
stuff you've been missing in your own life that's right
there it's right under your nose and you've been missing
it this whole time until now all right this is
