Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about the mechanics of belief.
This episode is basically epistemology. 101. Epistemology means the theory
of knowledge, how do we know what we know? How
do we sort truth from falsehood. And this turns out
to be a much more practical and important subject matter
than you might initially think. One problem we have is
that most people, I would say, like 99% of society
does not have a clue as to how beliefs actually
work. What they are, and what are the actual mechanisms
by which we come to know things, to hold things
as true or as false. Now that might at first
seem like it's a philosophical matter. But actually, it turns
out to be a very practical matter. Because if you
accidentally mistake falsehood for truth, and vice versa, then you
lead yourself in a very bad situation in life, you
basically can't grow. And you can't raise your consciousness. So
the reason, in a nutshell, why this topic is so
important is because your beliefs restrict your ability to raise
your consciousness. And they distort perception. And given the fact
that you're prime directive in life, is to be raising
your consciousness. What do you think, is the biggest obstacle
to that? It's your beliefs. It's your beliefs. That is
your biggest obstacle. Now, you might say, but Leo, I
don't hold any beliefs, you might be talking about some
religious people. And I'm with you on that. But how
does this apply to my life, because I'm a rational
person, I'm a scientifically minded person. Wrong. Wrong. That right
there in and of itself, is a belief and a
false one at that. Very dangerous belief, that one right
there. That's actually what I call a meta belief. It's
a belief about beliefs. I see a lot of otherwise
rational, intelligent people behaving very irrationally, by not realizing that
their rationality is grounded upon many irrational beliefs. And what's
worse, is that they deny this, they vehemently denied this,
when I tried to get them to look at this.
So this is a very, very important topic. It applies
to virtually anybody, I don't know anybody to whom this
topic does not apply. Right now, your ability to raise
your consciousness is limited by the beliefs you hold. And
a vast majority of beliefs you hold, are completely off
the map like completely off the mark, how can I
say that with such certainty, because I know that the
vast majority of your beliefs, you soaked up from your
culture, and the culture we live in, is greatly diluted,
meaning that you are greatly diluted. So let's begin from
the beginning. We're going to tackle a lot of different
issues here about the mechanics of belief. But the beginning
begins with the fundamental challenge of life, one of the
fundamental challenges is that you're born, and then somehow you
need to start to distinguish between what is true and
what is false. And this is not nearly as easy
as it seems. Ask yourself, when you're born, how do
you distinguish between what's true and what's false, and make
that distinction accurately? That is not an easy thing to
do. Because if what you're going to do is like
what most people do, is they just blindly accept whatever
is served up to them on a plate, then it's
guaranteed that you will delude yourself and you will be
believing many, many false things. Not only that, but your
entire epistemic attitude towards life will be misguided. And I'll
get to the end a bit towards the end. So
generally speaking, people aren't very conscious. And so when they're
born, and they're growing up as a kid, and even
as a teenager, and then even as an adult. You
They don't take this issue seriously of the challenge of
distinguishing what is true from what is false. And also,
it never occurs to them, that they themselves could be
their own greatest enemy. And that the beliefs they hold,
are actually taking a hold of them. And not the
other way around. They don't take seriously the possibility that
they could be deluding themselves. And that the that the
greatest source of inaccurate perception, and false belief? isn't some
con man waiting to trick you? Or scam you out
of your money? It's not that it's you. It's yourself,
you're your own greatest enemy here. And how is this?
Well, simply because lack of consciousness, lack of awareness of
the mechanisms of how beliefs work, and beliefs work in
some very twisted ways. So what I'm going to help
you do is to get awareness over these mechanisms, so
that you can stop being your beliefs, Little Bitch, and
you can become their master, rather than their slave. The
fundamental trap with beliefs is the following is that we
like to think that we can represent reality with our
ideas. And so we have all sorts of ideas about
reality, ideas about ourselves, or other people about life, about
existence, about religion, about science, about politics, about economics, about
our friends, about our enemies, and so forth. We have
all these ideas. And we take these ideas actually seriously.
Without recognizing that they are ideas. And that ideas, even
though ideas are part of reality, they are not actually
the truth. There's great limits on what you can represent
with ideas. And a representation is not the real thing.
And this is very easy to forget, as simple as
it sounds. A lot of very intelligent people, a lot
of very rational people forget this. When this happens, here's
the danger is that you have a lot of ideas
about how reality is or should be. And therefore, use
stop being open to direct experience to experiencing how reality
actually is. And so when you fill your mind with
a lot of ideas about what's true, or what's false,
that then obviates the searching for deep direct experiences. And
that's where a lot of stuff goes wrong. Because if
reality was simple, and not complex, and reality was intuitive,
and not very counterintuitive, then this strategy might work. Because
basically, it would work like this. I'm born, I have
some intuitions and ideas about how reality works. And oh,
what do you know, you know, reality just happens to
work exactly how I thought it was. And that's it
good enough. Problem solved. That would be fine. Except what
humanity has discovered, time and time and time and time
and time and time and time, again, is that reality
does not work, the way we initially assumed. Reality is
filled with very weird paradoxes, and facts that are completely
contrary to anything we assumed. And that many of our
speculations and our assumptions and our egoic intuitions about how
people are, how life works, how happiness works, what I
can achieve myself, and many, many beliefs along these lines,
that this is that this is contrary to direct experience.
And so what happens is that when your mind gets
filled with a lot of ideas, then it's like a
cup that is full. And when a cup is full,
you can't add more to it. So the thing that's
the most important, which is direct experience, actual reality comes
to you only in one form, through direct experience, and
through no other form. Your speculations and ideas about it
are always suspect and could always be overruled by direct
experience. Because that's the case. And I don't know how
deeply you reek realize that some people they sort of
agree with me on that, but they don't realize how
significant that statement is. That direct experience is King It's
primary, it overshadows every idea that you have. See, when
your cup is full, you can't undertake a serious inquiry
of life. You're living in IDEA land. And you don't
undertake a meta inquiry, which is an inquiry into the
process of inquiry. This is critical. Because to do an
effective inquiry, you have to ask yourself, How do I
do inquiry accurately, which takes you into the domain of
epistemology. Epistemology is like the bedrock of what philosophy is
about. Because if you want to make a claim about
the world, a philosophical claim a scientific claim, a religious
claim any kind of claim at all, you first have
to ask yourself, by what process? Am I making this
claim? How do I know that the thing I'm about
to claim is actually true? And not false? How do
I know it's not subject to my own biases, to
my own egoic desires, to my own egoic fears, to
hidden assumptions, to confirmation biases, to self fulfilling prophecy effects,
and so forth? How can I be sure about that?
And when you start to seriously ask those questions, now,
you're really on the right track. Before you can do
an effective inquiry into life, you first have to do
an effective meta inquiry. And that's what I'm going to
help you to do here. So what is a belief,
let's begin there. A belief is basically just an idea,
or thought of something that you think is either true,
or false. So this is a very general definition. This
covers a lot of stuff, hopefully, you can see how
many examples we can come up here, with an idea
of beliefs. There's different categories of beliefs, there's personal beliefs,
beliefs you hold about yourself. There's social beliefs, beliefs you
have about other people about say, there's political beliefs, scientific
beliefs, epistemic beliefs, which are beliefs about knowledge, beliefs about
beliefs, and metaphysical beliefs, which are beliefs about the very
structure of reality and what reality is. So some examples
of personal beliefs might be that I I'm attractive, or
I'm ugly, or that I'm good at math. And maybe
I'm bad at English. Or that I'm six feet tall.
And so on, and so forth. There's a lot of
personal beliefs you have. Some of them can be positive,
some of them can be negative. There's also social beliefs.
So you might believe something like, having a lot of
friends is good and contributes to my happiness, that would
be a belief. Or maybe you believe that's not true.
That's also a belief. Just because something is false. Doesn't
mean it's not a belief, as long as you affirm
it, and you hold it as an idea in your
mind, whether it's true or false. That makes it a
belief. You might believe, for example, that men are assholes.
Or you might believe that women are only attracted to
men with money. So we have beliefs about relationships, and
about dating and so forth. There's also political beliefs. Of
course, you might believe that one party is better than
another party, you might have economic beliefs such as you
know, capitalism is good, communism is bad, or you have
might have more nuanced economic beliefs, like tax cuts, are
going to help the economy or maybe you believe that
tax cuts don't help the economy. You also have scientific
beliefs, like you might believe certain theories in quantum mechanics,
you might believe Einstein's general theory of relativity, you might
believe that the, the Earth rotates around the sun. You
might believe that the Earth is round and not flat.
Or maybe the opposite, hopefully not, and so on and
so on, and so on. So many, many, many scientific
beliefs, basically, scientific beliefs. Just think about science class, back
in high school, all the high school classes, you took
chemistry, biology, physics, and so forth. And all the ideas
that you were taught about evolution, about matter about energy,
about, about galaxies and stars, about molecules, about cells about
chemistry. There's like just so much stuff and 99% of
it you just took on faith. It's a belief, right?
You didn't actually do the experiments to prove any of
that stuff. You just took it on as beliefs. You
also have epistemic beliefs, which are beliefs about beliefs. And
I'll talk more about that as we continue. And then
you have metaphysical beliefs. Like, if I asked you what
is reality, you've got some sort of beliefs about that.
You might say, reality is just a giant computer simulation.
Or you might say, well, reality is what I see.
Or you might say, well, reality is what God created.
Or you might say, Well, in reality is just dumb,
empty matter, which came out of the Big Bang. And
then through the process of evolution, here we are, or
whatever your ideas are about reality. You might think reality
is finite, you might think it's infinite. You might think
that reality was created by someone, or that it always
existed, you might think that reality will end at some
point, or that it lasts forever. And that's the turtle.
And you have all these sorts of notions about what
you think is possible within reality, for example, you might
think that, well, obviously, spirits, and ghosts are not possible.
That's only something we see in, in the movies, horror
movies and stuff. And you know, unicorns don't exist. Even
though maybe they could on a planet or something. You
might also believe like, Well, yeah, aliens could exist on
their planets. I haven't seen one. But my beliefs allow
for there to be aliens, and other people might have
beliefs that don't allow them to admit that there are
aliens or could be aliens. So all sorts of beliefs
exist, right. And we have very mundane beliefs to like,
you believe that when you walk into a house and
you flip the light switch, the lights will come on.
It's a very practical, mundane belief, or you believe that
when you go outside, tomorrow, the sun will still be
there shining. So it just kind of goes on and
on and on. So when people say, Leo, I don't
hold any beliefs. That's, that's just patently ridiculous, because you
actually hold 1000s of beliefs. You couldn't function without beliefs.
Now let's talk about some important features of the mechanics
of how beliefs work. These are important to start to
become conscious of how beliefs trick you. So the first
important feature that almost everyone overlooks takes for granted is
that every belief held feels true. Every belief held feels
true. Now that seems simple and obvious. But watch out,
because you fall into this trap. If every belief held
feels true, then how do I determine which beliefs are
true, and which are false, then goes back to that
fundamental problem. While most people assume that you can do
it based on feeling and intuition, it's like, well, yeah,
it feels true. But they forget that every belief feels
true. Once it's held, of course, it doesn't feel true.
If I tell you that Santa Claus is real, that
won't feel true to you. Because you don't hold that
belief, you actually hold the opposite belief. You hold the
belief that Santa Claus isn't real. But if I came
up here and started to argue to you about how
Santa Claus actually is real, you wouldn't be open to
that argument. Because you already have the belief that Santa
Claus is not real. And I feel so true to
you, that you will not listen to me, or to
any evidence that I present, about how Santa Claus is
real. Now, you might say, well, Leo, we all know
Santa Claus is not real. So why should I be
open to your silly arguments? But see, that just begs
the question, because our original problem here is how do
we identify what is true from what's false? And you
might say, Well, we do it based on a bunch
of evidence and reason and such. But actually, that's not
how you do it. You do it based on a
first come first serve sort of basis, which will start
to become clearer here as I keep going down the
list and keep talking to you about the different features,
the tree features of beliefs. But what I would urge
you to consider is that you actually don't hold most
of your beliefs based on solid evidence and logic and
reason. What you do is you simply latch on to
the first belief that comes your way that feels true,
that feels right. You latch on to that and then
another one, and another one, and another one and another
one without really looking deeply into them. And then after
a while, you've got that 1000s of beliefs, you have
a web of beliefs, and that based on those, you
evaluate other new beliefs when you think about adopting them.
So your criteria for judging beliefs is actually not their
truth. It's based on other beliefs you hold. But now
you can already start to see the danger of this.
Because how did you adopt your first early beliefs? When
this web was being constructed, when you were just a
child, when you were first born, you had very little
consciousness, and very little awareness, as of course, makes sense.
Because when you're born, you don't know anything. You don't
know what's true, or what's false. You don't even have
this as an important priority in your life. It's felt
like kids are born in the mist. Okay, my job
here on Earth is to accurately distinguish what's true from
what's false. No, that's not how a child's mind work.
A child's mind works as a sponge, soaking up absolutely
everything without a lot of questioning. I mean, yeah, it's
true that kids sometimes question a lot. But also, it's
true that kids are gullible. And generally, they will believe
whatever you tell them. In fact, it's a lot worse
than this. A lot worse, because there's a phenomenon called
imprinting. This is a phenomenon that happens, for example, with
animals, like you would take a baby duck, as soon
as the baby duck is born, when it's young, when
his mind is completely blank, it will imprint onto its
mother, and that will have an image, it actually knows
who its mother is based on what it was born,
next to. Now, generally, that works fine. Except, of course,
if the duck happens to hatch, not near its actual
Mother, what will happen is that it'll imprint on a
false thing. And the thing could be ridiculous. It could
not even looks like a duck. It could imprint to
a sock puppet. And they've actually done experiments like this,
where they've gotten ducks to imprint the sock puppets, which
sounds ridiculous to us. And we kind of laugh at
them say, Oh, look, look at that stupid duck. But
you gotta wonder. Because, you know, the duck is actually
a high level mammal. It's not a bacteria or something,
it's mind is actually quite similar to the human mind.
Not as intelligent, much smaller frontal cortex. But when you
are a baby, and you're just born, and your parents
start feeding you beliefs and ideas about the world, and
you're starting to soak it up from your school and
your culture and all that stuff. Yeah, you question some
of them? You question like 1% of them? 99% of
them you never question. And so you build up your
web of beliefs, that initial foundation, and then you use
that initial foundation to judge all new beliefs as an
adult. But did you ever actually question your web of
beliefs that foundation? And the answer is no, you didn't.
And when you consider that everyone in our culture, was
born and raised in a similar fashion, now you start
to see the potential traps that exist here. And what
I'll tell you is that the traps here are far
far, far, far deeper than you ever imagined. ever imagined.
Like, it's way worse than your worst nightmares will tell
you like way worse, humanity. And our culture at large
mainstream culture has got reality so wrong, that it will
shock you if you ever discover this for yourself. But
that will be very difficult for you to do, because
you're gonna have to weed through this vast quantity of
completely taken for granted and unquestioned beliefs, which have some
of these very sticky properties. So let's keep talking about
the properties of beliefs. I want you to recognize that
you don't consciously select your beliefs. It's not like you're
born and then you look up into a book, the
book of all possible beliefs, then you're like, Well, yeah,
I've considered this one and this one and this one,
this I consider all the alternatives, and I decided, You
know what, I'm gonna believe I'm gonna believe in God.
Or you know what, I'm gonna believe I'm gonna believe
in evolution, or I'm gonna believe in matter, or I'm
gonna believe in consciousness, or I'm gonna believe that the
Earth is round. That's not how works, you're not really
given a choice, you just absorb your beliefs from your
culture. Do you recognize how fucking significant that is? 99%
of your beliefs are absorbed from your culture, unconsciously, without
any choice or input from you. And I'm talking about
the most fundamental of the fundamental, the most possibly basic
things that you take completely for granted, like the laws
of logic, like mathematics, like that reality is a physical
system like that you were born and that you will
die that you are the child of your, of your
mother of your mother and your father, like these very
basic things that you would think okay, I mean, why
should we even waste time questioning these things? Yeah, it's
hard for me to even start to communicate, how deep
this rabbit hole goes. What's even worse is that 99%
of all your beliefs you've never actually directly experienced. Even
all the scientific ones, everything you were taught in science
90% of it, you've never actually directly experienced, you've never
derived it, you've never proved it. You just take it
on faith. But it's not totally blind faith. Because like
I said, what you do is you have this web
of beliefs. And so you use that web of beliefs
to evaluate new beliefs that come in, and your whole
game in life is to maintain a reasonably tolerable cohesive
web of beliefs. That's the game you're playing in life.
So sometimes a belief comes in you change it, sometimes
I believe, tries to come in, but you say no,
that that definitely can't work. Because if that was true,
then all these other things that I believe would have
to be false, and that can't be right. So I'm
gonna reject this belief. Another feature, that most people underestimate
our beliefs is that they are very difficult to drop.
Once you acquire them. It's like that baby duck. Who
got imprinted? That imprint is not something the baby duck
can consciously change. So whatever it happens to be is
what it is. Now, you might think that human beings
have the capacity to drop beliefs. And it's true, we
do. But it takes emotional labor, it's a lot harder
than you think. Which brings us to the next feature.
The tricky feature of beliefs is that beliefs generate strong
emotions. Have you noticed this in yourself, or in others
around you, certain beliefs generate very, very, very strong emotions.
What I found is that the deeper the belief is,
and the more the belief is disconnected from direct experience,
the stronger emotions, the belief will arouse. And in fact,
beliefs are actually addictive. Not only do they arouse strong
emotions, and also they fuel behaviors, but they are addictive.
So that once you hold a certain belief, and you
make it a pet belief of yours, something that you
really want to be true of the world, then letting
that go is can be very, very, very, very difficult.
Much more difficult than you probably imagined. Because it's not
a question of letting go of one belief. It's a
matter of reconfiguring your entire web of beliefs. A lot
of times, to let go of one belief that's at
the core of all your web of beliefs, requires that
you throw out and reconfigure the entire web. And that's
very difficult because your mind wants to maintain homeostasis. And
it generally wants to keep that web intact. It doesn't
want to screw with the web. It doesn't want to
screw with success, so to speak, but that ends up
backfiring. Because what if your web of beliefs isn't producing
the success you want? You might think, Oh, well, then
I'll just change it. And I'll replace it with successfully
But that's not how it works. Because the mind is
stubborn. Now it's addicted. And it's getting strong emotions from
the existing web of beliefs. And so what it'll actually
do is that it will forfeit happiness, and success and
truth in the name of just preserving homeostasis, even if
that homeostasis is creating a ton of suffering, and lack
of success in your life. That's the danger of stubbornness.
Beliefs also have the feature of being self fulfilling, so
that when you believe something, it tends to also reinforce
itself and become true. What's an example of this? Well,
if I believe that all women just want me for
my money, and I go start dating women, that will
become a self fulfilling belief. Because I will start to
look for all the examples of how women tried to
exploit me, and only like me for my money. And
let's say that I'm very successful in my life, and
I earn lots of money. That means I'm around lots
of people and women come into my life and, and
I try to talk to those women. Of course, I
let them know how much money I have. And I
kind of flaunt my money because I drive a nice
car, and all this kind of stuff. So women kind
of see it. And then of course, they start to
take advantage of it. And because I believe it, it
starts to actually become true. The self fulfilling prophecy like
this happens with many, many beliefs, especially personal limiting beliefs
that you have about your own life. It also tends
to become true with scientific beliefs, and beliefs about the
very core existence, that we're living in reality itself. For
example, if you believe that reality is physical and composed
of matter, you will only read scientific studies that verify
and prove that reality is made out of matter. And
its physical. And if ever you run across a study
in some journal or some magazine, about how reality is
non physical, perhaps you will disregard His hogwash. Of course,
because you already know that reality is physical. So why
would you waste your time reading a journal about how
reality is non physical when you already know it's physical.
And see this creates a self fulfilling prophecy effect. Even
more tricky is that all beliefs are circular. All beliefs
are circular. Which means that the only thing that justifies
a belief is another belief. Now, you might think that
some beliefs are justified by indisputable evidence, direct experience, hardcore
facts, but that's actually technically false. That would actually be
a metal belief, false medically, the reality is that every
belief you hold can only be justified by another belief.
And that one can also be justified by another belief,
and buy another one, and buy another one, and buy
another one and buy another one. And when you get
to the rock bottom, there's nothing there. You might think
that the rock bottom is the truth. But that's not
the case. Because the truth actually has no direct connection
to an idea in your mind, or a belief. Right?
The truth is actually, in direct experience, the truth is
independent of the entire structure. The scope of beliefs is
something that we're constructing in our mind and an overlaying
on top. And we think that our web of beliefs
is actually like, closely mirroring the truth. But that's not
the case. And you can discover this for yourself simply
by questioning a belief that you have, take one belief
you have, take something that you just are absolutely certain
about, could not possibly be false. And then start to
ask yourself, Why is that true? What justifies that, and
what will happen is that you will not arrive at
a fact or a direct experience, you will actually arrive
at another belief. And then you can question that one.
And you'll arrive at another belief and unbelief. Another belief.
And if you do that, what you'll actually discover is
that generally what happens a very common pattern is that
the beliefs it's a chain might have five or 10
different beliefs in it, but it always comes back around
in a circle. So the Problem of circular reasoning is
not just something that religious people face, the problem of
circular reasoning is the problem, the inherent nature of this
web of beliefs. That's how it maintains structural integrity, the
web of beliefs doesn't so much lien against reality as
much as it leans against itself. And in that way,
it creates this sort of self supporting structure. But it's
just a house of cards. That falls apart very quickly.
If you go to the very core of things and
start to question very deeply. Another important feature of beliefs
is that they determine what is possible or impossible for
you. possibility and impossibility is based on your beliefs. So
what do you think is possible you think it's possible
to fly? Do you think it's possible to jump out
of an airplane and survive? Do you think it's possible
to run into aliens to have contact with them? You
think it's possible? That what? You think it's possible to
become rich to become a billionaire? Is that possible for
you? Is that impossible? Do you think it's possible to
attract your dream spouse, and to create a beautiful marriage
and family? Do you think is possible to get enlightened
or not? You think it's possible to be pleased with
your life to be joyful and at peace? The majority
of the time? Or do you think that these things
aren't possible? That's determined by your web of beliefs. And
of course, you can see how this has very practical
implications. Not philosophical, but very practical. Because what you're able
and willing to go out and try is always limited.
By what believe you believe, is going to work, or
isn't going to work? Or is real or is unreal.
See, if I give you a technique, to sit on
your couch, and practice for 30 minutes every day that
will let you travel outside of your body and speak
to aliens? Will you actually sit down and do that?
Most people will not do that. Because they believe that
it's impossible for one to exit their body and speak
to aliens, because we are bodies and because aliens do
not exist. And as one example, out of many, many,
many, many, many things, you might believe that, hey, starting
this kind of business that I want to start, there's
no way I can make that work. I don't have
the money, I don't have the skills, that business that
marketplace already crowded, it's never gonna work. And so you
never even go and try. C. or or you might
be walking down the street, you see a cute girl,
you want to talk to her chatter up and maybe
start to date or you're really attracted to her. But
you think yourself, ah, you know, she's such a cute
girl. She's such a beautiful woman. She's probably already got
a boyfriend. And if she didn't have a boyfriend, well,
I'm not really dressed nice right now. didn't shave this
morning. So probably she wouldn't be attracted to me anyways.
So I might as well just not even bother starting
a conversation. And then that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy,
right? Because he thought it was impossible. And so therefore
it is. Victims have a huge problem with this. Victims
have a lot of personal beliefs like that. But this
issue goes way beyond just victims. If you don't feel
like a victim, I still guarantee you that you have
many, many existential limiting beliefs. Which brings me to the
next feature of beliefs, which is that there exist meta
beliefs. Meta beliefs are beliefs about beliefs. And this is
where things get really interesting and also extremely dangerous. Because
it's the meta beliefs, which nobody almost ever questions or
thinks about. And yet, it's these meta beliefs that can
get you completely stuck because they determine what you think
is possible or not possible to occur within the web
of beliefs itself. It's the beliefs You hold about the
web of beliefs. See, this gets very tricky. Here's a
list of some very, very dangerous meta beliefs, these beliefs
will completely stole your ability to grow your consciousness and
life. One is, I don't hold any beliefs. You see,
that's a meta belief. If you believe you don't hold
beliefs, that's a meta belief. Another one is, most of
my beliefs are accurate. Sure, yeah. Leo, a few of
my beliefs could be wrong, but most of them are
accurate. It's a very dangerous meta belief. Another one is,
Leo, it's good to believe certain things. So yeah, I
agree with you. I shouldn't just believe things blindly. That's
a problem. But there's certain things that we can all
agree on are very good to believe, for example, that
murder is wrong. Like morality, for example, that's a good
set of beliefs. Extremely dangerous metal belief that one. Another
one is, some beliefs are safe, in that some beliefs
cannot be doubted. Because they are so certain. Like you
might tell yourself, you know, Leo, it's completely ridiculous. To
doubt that the Earth is round, that's completely ridiculous. There's
no point at all. It's just complete waste of time
to doubt that. Or you might say, You know what,
Leo? God is a belief that I will never, ever
stop believing. That's a completely safe belief. Or you might
say, No, you don't do science, the scientific method. That's
the one thing that's safe, everything else can be doubted,
but that one thing we shouldn't doubt. That's a super
dangerous meta belief. Another one is, if I stopped believing
x, then I'm committing a sin. If I stopped believing
X, that I'm committing a sin, for example, if I
stopped believing in God, I'm committing a sin. If I
stopped believing in my morals, I'm committing a sin, if
I stopped believing that my family is good, and that
I should be loving towards my family. If I stopped
believing that then I'm committing a sin or I'm doing
something wrong. That's a very dangerous menabilly. Another one is,
there are no alternatives to holding beliefs. So you might
say, Leo, what's the alternative? All of us hold these
webs of beliefs. So that's the best we can do.
Very dangerous meta belief. Another one is dropping my beliefs
isn't that important? That's a meta belief. Another one is
that epistemology makes no practical difference in my life. Something
like Leo, you know, you're talking about all this epistemology
and all this abstract stuff, all these ideas, but what
difference does it make in my life, it makes no
difference. That's a very dangerous meta belief. Another one is,
and I see this one, a lot of intelligent and
rational people make this mistake is they believe that God
does not exist isn't a belief. But actually, it is
a belief. And the belief that God doesn't exist is
not a belief is also a belief. That's a dangerous
meta belief. Similarly, some people believe that science is not
a belief. If you believe that science is not a
belief, that's a meta belief, and a false one at
that very dangerous. Some people believe that logic is not
based on beliefs. Lead to logic. That's the most certain
thing we have. If logic is wrong, then what do
we got? We got nothing. logic isn't based on beliefs.
Logic is logic. That's a belief, a very dangerous meta
belief. You see, what makes meta beliefs like this dangerous
is when they create some sort of safety zone within
your web of beliefs, that becomes impenetrable, to alternatives. So
fundamentally, what you're doing when you're holding one of these
meta beliefs, obstinately is you're saying, Okay, so here's my
beliefs, I recognize that a lot of it is arbitrary,
came from all sorts of sources, I didn't really understand
how to filter it very well. So yeah, okay. Certain
aspects of it, I admit, could be fallible. But not
this part right here, see this part, I'm going to
carve out this part. And this part, I know for
sure is correct. And there's no way in hell, you're
gonna get me to reconsider that one. And that's the
mother of all fucking mistakes. The Mother of All metal
epistemic mistakes, is to carve out a little safety zone
or beliefs. And to tell yourself that, A, it can't
be false. And B, it wasn't a belief in the
first place. It's a fact. When you miss identify a
belief as a fact. That's when you commit the gravest
sin. That is so dangerous. And it leads to so
many problems. And if you think that you're somehow immune
to this, guess, again, because you've done this in your
web of beliefs, you, you that rational you, the one
that's very vigilant about this stuff, the one that thinks
it's got it all figured out. You've done this. You've
done this, how do I know? Because it's so difficult
not to do this. It's very, very difficult, you need
to be extremely conscious not to do this. Because everything
in your mind is pushing you towards doing this. And
this is something that will just utterly astound you, when
you really understand what I'm talking about. Like when you
really get it, not just hearing me say once, but
like 10 years from now, if you do 10 years
of consciousness work, and then you come back and you
say, Oh, my God, I got it. I can't believe
it. This explains so much of what's wrong in the
world. That will be a really powerful insight for you
to have, but it won't come easily, you're gonna have
to work for another meta belief that people commonly have
something like, well, Leo, you know, no one knows anything
for sure. It's all relative, in the end, who knows
what's true. That's a belief. A dangerous, very dangerous meta
belief. And the last one I'll give you here is
that, Leo, I'm already aware of my limiting beliefs. I
know what you're talking about here, I already took that
into account. In my Well, beliefs. That's a belief. And
it's probably false. And it's very dangerous. So now we
covered the topic of meta beliefs. The last feature of
beliefs that I'll tell you about is that beliefs are
not looking out for you. Think of beliefs as foreign
entities in your mind? Or in your body? Like memes,
right? People like to talk about memes. What is a
meme? A meme is like an idea that comes to
you and it kind of resides in your mind. It
almost has a life of its own. Well, beliefs are
like that. Beliefs are memes. And they live inside your
mind. And they reproduce. And they sort of hijack your
brain and they are not looking out for your highest
self, they are not looking out there. Number one objective
is not to get you to grow. And to be
an open, happy, successful, highly conscious human being that is
not their objective. Their objective is to lodge themselves in
your brain and tend to replicate into other brains. So
just like a virus, that's what they're doing. And when
you think the virus is your friend, and you start
walking around running around coughing on people, because you think
that the virus is actually you, it's actually something that's
deeply important and true. Now you can start to see
how all sorts of damage can happen both personally and
collectively as a species. So why are beliefs so dangerous?
Well, firstly, there's that self fulfilling prophecy effect, where what
you believe has to manifest itself. And if you believe
a bunch of negative stuff, which many people do, then
you manifest a bunch of negative stuff. And so that
ends up being dangerous. When you think that people are
dangerous. When you think that people are, are evil. That's
what you tend to see. And that's what you tend
to perpetuate with your expectations and your behaviors. You see,
which is ironic, because the people who believe in evil,
they are the ones who usually want to stamp out
evil. But the fact that they believe in evil is
actually what tends to perpetuate more evil. See, very ironic,
very counterintuitive and twisted. Also, beliefs are dangerous, because once
you hold the belief, you tend to filter out contrary
data. So you're not fully open to all the direct
experience possible. Because basically, once you've held on to a
belief, you want to defend that belief at any cost,
which means you're willing to disregard direct experience, which ends
up being disastrous in one way or another. Also, what
happens with beliefs is that it creates paradigm lock. A
paradigm is an entire perspective on reality. You can have
a scientific paradigm, like evolution, that's a paradigm, you can
have a religious paradigm like a supreme creator, that's a
paradigm, you could have an economic paradigm, like you might
think that having low taxes is really healthy for the
economy. So that's your entire paradigm. It's kind of like
a lens that you look at everything through. And the
danger with paradigms is that they're constructed by usually a
set of very fundamental beliefs that are never truly questioned.
And they were not originally selected by you. If you
take a look, and you do an examination of deeply
religious people, or very adamantly atheistic people, or very dogmatic,
economically, or political minded people, like Republicans or Democrats or
libertarians, or capitalist or communist, you know, you find these
people. And I will show you that that person didn't
actually at all, select these very deeply held beliefs that
they have. So the most hardcore and dogmatic Republicans, Democrats,
communists, capitalist Nazis, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and atheists, that these
people, as loyal as they are to their belief systems,
they are not conscious of the fact that they did
not actually choose that belief system. And that that belief
system was actually largely just a byproduct of the environment
that they happened to grew up in. Just so happened,
which is very, very ironic. You have to start to
see what's going on here on the meta perspective, from
the meta perspective. The danger with beliefs is not your
going to hold wrong beliefs. It's that you hold beliefs
that all you get that it's not a matter of,
oh, you know, Republicans are wrong, and Democrats are right.
Or communists are wrong, and capitalists are right, because they
hold the wrong ideas. That's not the problem. The problem
is holding any ideas at all. The holding is the
problem, not why you're holding, it doesn't really matter what
you're holding. What matters is that you are holding and
you're not willing to let go. Because you're not seeing
this from the meta perspective. And you're stuck in a
paradigm lock. Another reason why beliefs are so dangerous is
because they preclude seeking out radically new experiences. When you
have a parent On, when you have your whole level
beliefs arranged, you're not going to go out of your
way to have a really radically different experience in your
life. You're not, you're not going to go travel to
some third world country to try to invalidate your ideas
about capitalism, communism, you're not, you're not going to go
travel to Africa, and interact with kids who are hungry,
and have AIDS and stuff. To disconfirm, certain political or
economic philosophies that you have, you're not going to do
that. There's no way in hell you're going to do
that. You're not going to go read a bunch of
scientific papers and reports and textbooks, to invalidate your beliefs
about God and about your religion. And if you're a
scientist, you're not going to go study any spiritual texts,
or do any kind of meditative work, or any kind
of contemplative work to try to access an altered state
of consciousness? Because your scientific paradigm tells you that reality
is physical, and that there's nothing else. See? Another reason
why beliefs are so dangerous, is because they create emotional
reactivity, arrogance and inflexibility. Take a look at this from
the historical perspective, take a look at what human beings
have been up to for the last two to 3000
years. What have we been doing? It's been belief wars.
That's what it is. It's not wars over land. It's
not war over resources. It's not anything but ideological wars.
That's what every war is. It's an ideological war. at
its root, it's people fighting and killing each other over
beliefs. And the solution is not to find the one
right belief system and then spread it to the masses,
as you might think. That is exactly the type of
thinking that creates ideological wars, and arrogance and emotional reactivity
and in flexibility. The solution is to drop the entire
game, because you see it as a farce. The whole
fucking thing is a farce. So at this point, you
might say, well, Leo, wait a minute, aren't you being
a hypocrite here? Aren't you just giving us more of
your beliefs? So it sounds like you're finding some clever
little rhetorical argument for how to sneak your beliefs Leo's
beliefs into my web of beliefs. So how should I
take this? Do I believe you you want me to
just to believe you? And then how does that make
you different from everybody else? You're engaging in this ideological
war to know, that's the difference? The difference? If you've
got enough consciousness, you'll be able to see this? Can
you see this, the difference is that what I'm advocating
is a completely change, a complete change in attitude. There
are basically three epistemic attitudes that people have in life.
The first, attitude is the worst, proudly defending your beliefs.
Proudly defending your beliefs, this is what happens with religion,
with philosophy and with politics, very, very commonly, is people
just have some belief system, they just defend the hell
out of it, because they want to be loyal to
it. And they're actually proud of that. The next stage
up, when you get a little more consciousness and you
realize, wait a minute. The Game of Life is not
about defending my beliefs, but about expanding my beliefs, refining
my beliefs going out there and learning more and rearranging
remote beliefs so that it's more truthful and more accurate,
reflects reality more correctly. That's much better. And so you
feel like yeah, I've evolved, I've evolved here. And now
what you're doing is you're going out there, you're actually
seeking out some new experiences, you're actually disconcert. disconfirming, some
old dogmas that you've held and you're dropping some beliefs
and you actually feel like all this is freeing me
up. Look at this. I can do more stuff. I'm
questioning various personal limiting beliefs that I've had. Look at
this. All the sudden I'm able to have a relationship.
I'm able to have a better business better financial life,
better career, my kids are doing better. Great. I've done
it I've reached the peak. But that's only stage two.
You have yet to reach stage three. And stage three
is the most radical leap of all here require is
the most consciousness to make this final leap, which is
to realize that reality has nothing to do with belief.
And that reality lies outside of belief. And when you
actually grasp that, really grasp it on a deep level,
then what will happen to you is that you will
stop this game of accumulating, rearranging and refining your beliefs
at all, you will stop defending, you will stop being
loyal, you will stop arguing other people, you will stop
debating, you will stop looking for evidence. All of it
will stop. And the only thing that will be left
is just raw, direct experience complete openness, without any presumptions
or expectations about how reality is or will be, or
ought to be. And then you live from that place.
So, the reason that what I'm proposing is different than
the stuff that you're doing in your life, is that
I'm proposing that you make this attitude shift to dropping
the entire game not to adopt more of my beliefs.
Because you're right, if you did that, if all you
did was just to believe me right now. You wouldn't
have actually increased your awareness, you wouldn't have moved up
by level, you would just be a stage one or
stage two. But we need you to get to stage
three, to get to stage three, you actually have to
listen between the lines of what I'm saying. Because actually,
what I'm saying can't be said, because everything I'm saying
to you is just ideas. You have to recognize that,
oh, he's giving me ideas. But he wants me to
go beyond ideas. Oh, how do I do that? I
don't know. I've never done that before. Let me just
struggle with it. Do some trial and error and figure
it out. Maybe there's something there. Let me see if
what he's saying has some merit. Not to believe, but
to open myself just to raw direct experience, and to
drop my beliefs. Wouldn't that be something? Here's a very
important thing you got to realize is that believing things,
even when they're quote unquote, true beliefs, is still very
limiting. And you're not going to get to high consciousness
by doing that. As an example, if you just believe
that one plus one equals two. That doesn't do you
any good. You might say, well, I should believe it,
Leo, because it's true. One plus one equals two, if
it's useful and valuable to you, if it grows, you,
it's only to the extent that you've actually derived it
through direct experience, and you experience it as true. Not
that you blindly believe it is true. And there's a
huge difference. To grow in this life requires that you
undertake a never ending investigation. And that you keep all
channels open. As far as direct experience goes that you
don't block any channels that you don't say to yourself,
well, this thing I know definitely can't be true. So
I'm just going to dismiss it and never look in
this direction ever again. Because it's just a waste of
my time. Because clearly it can't be true. That's the
fundamental mistake. You can't do that. If you really want
to grow. If you want an excellent life. If you
want to get to your maximum potential as a human
being, you have to give up that whole attitude. So
let's quickly talk about how to apply a lot of
the abstract stuff that I talked about here. Firstly, take
it on as your mission to learn to function outside
of belief. Right now, you're functioning inside of belief and
the process of transitioning from functioning inside a belief to
outside of belief. That is a process that's not something
you're going to do overnight. That's difficult. It's emotionally grueling
work. Secondly, take epistemology Seriously, stop treating it as a
philosophical, airy fairy. Disconnected from my practical life, endeavor. It's
not. Thirdly, drop your pet theories, identify whatever pet theories
you have, whether they're economic, political, religious, scientific, personal, social,
sexual, whatever, dropped them. You don't need them. direct experience
is as accurate as things get. When you have direct
experience, you don't need pet theories. But that requires that
you actually surrender yourself at some point in your life,
you make a conscious choice and say, I'm surrendering myself
to direct experience, even if it's not what I want.
Even if it doesn't serve my ego at the moment,
I'm still surrendering to it. Why? Because it's what's true.
And I value truth. Above serving my ego, that's a
very fundamental choice that you're gonna have to make in
your life at one point or another, or you're just
not going to be able to go very far in
this work. Also change your attitude. From one of trying
to rearrange your beliefs, to one of never ending investigation,
it means that you will never ever reach a point
in your life ever, where you can say, Okay, finally,
I figured it out. Now I've got it. This is
what's true. You have to drop that fantasy. A truly
conscious person is so open, that they cannot do that.
The investigation can never stop. And if it ever does,
you've committed an epistemological error somewhere, somehow. Generally speaking, as
you apply this, of course, question all your beliefs. That's
the most direct method for overcoming this problem. question, question,
question question. The most basic, the more obvious, the belief
is question and especially questioning your meta beliefs, all your
beliefs about beliefs, all your beliefs about reality, all your
beliefs about epistemology question the hell out of those, you'll
be surprised that what fruits that sort of inquiry can
bear a lot more than you initially think. In practice,
you will still hold beliefs. It's not like you can
just say, Okay, I'm ditching all my beliefs tomorrow. And
then that's it. No, you're still going to hold beliefs.
So what I recommend is that you hold them lightly.
You leave wiggle room in there. Rather than assigning probabilities
of zero and one to your beliefs, assigned point probabilities
like, well, this thing maybe has a 25% chance and
I give that thing, 80% chance, but don't give anything
a 99% chance. Because as soon as you start to
go into the nine 9% Chance 100% chance that this
is false, or this is true. You lock yourself down.
Really think about what it means that direct experience is
king. In that truth is found in direct experience only,
and not in your ideas of it. That's a principle
you can contemplate and ponder for hours and hours and
hours and hours and not get to the to the
real core of it yet. Of course, don't take anything
I say as belief. Not in this episode, nor in
any of my other episodes. I'm not really interested to
come up here and to fill your mind with ideas
so that you can become junior Leo. And then I
have 1000 or 100,000 Junior Leo's running around they're behaving
and believing just like I do know, my objective with
actualize that org is to give you tools and to
help you become more aware, situationally aware of what the
fuck you're doing in your life. So that you can
say, oh, yeah, let's look a little look what I'm
doing with all this silly shit that I'm doing in
my life. So I'm giving you concepts and tools for
that. Many of the things I tell you, I don't
believe because I'm not operating at the level of beliefs,
I don't care about beliefs, it doesn't matter to me
that these, these are, these are like, this is like
scaffolding to build a building. Right? The scaffolding is not
the fucking building, the scaffolding is not valuable, the scaffolding
gets thrown away after the building is erected. That's everything
that actually gives is just scaffolding. You throw it all
away. Once you're done with it. You don't cherish it.
You don't go proselytize to people about it. You just
use it. And then you live in direct experience. And
you realize that all direct experience has nothing to do
with all this stuff I learned from actualised. Org, those
were all just stepping stones, to get me to transcend
it. So make a distinction when I tell you stuff
between believing me, and just taking these things on as
tentative hypotheses. So you might ask yourself, well, Leo, so
how do I apply this stuff? If I don't believe
you? That's like a huge paradox. No, it's not. In
sciences, called adopting a tentative hypothesis, when you're going to
do an experiment, you need to start somewhere. So you
have an idea about how something might work. And then
you go test it out. And you're not attached to
your idea. So if it doesn't work, you throw it
away. And even if it does work, you still remember
that that's just a theory you had. It's an idea.
It's a belief, it has nothing to do with what
actually is true. Even if it was verified in your
experiments. also uncover any implicit assumptions you have about life.
This is a really good exercise, take a look at
everything you assume. What are the things you assume that
you've never thought you assumed about relationships about yourself about
people about politics about reality, about religion, about science, make
an effort to seek out new radical experiences. This is
huge, since experienced King, seeking out new radical experiences will
submit significantly open your mind and break down this whole
game of manipulating your web of beliefs. You want to
blow your mind and really make a dent in this
web of beliefs. Go try some psychedelics, some high dose,
really powerful psycho, that shit will completely mindfuck you to
the point where you will look at your beliefs, and
you're just like, What the fuck is this? This is
just ridiculous. This is like kindergarten bullshit, compared to direct
experience. And of course, this is why people are afraid
of psychedelics, and why they're afraid of bad trips. You
know what a bad trip is? A bad trip is
just your web of beliefs getting fucked up. And of
course, you feel like, Oh, I've been so hurt by
this bad trip, because my beliefs have been so fucked
up. But of course, that's exactly what you needed. And
of course, it's exactly what freaks you out and keeps
you away from psychedelics. Isn't that interesting? See, your ego
is very smart at avoiding everything I'm saying here. It's
very smart. Never ever, ever becoming conscious of this, because
it's not in his interest. And remember that changing beliefs
is not equivalent to growth. You think that you can
just take your beliefs and replace them with my beliefs,
with better beliefs with more accurate beliefs? And you think
that that's going to grow? You know? It will not?
Nope, you're just gonna get frustrated. With all this work.
You did all these books, you've read all these videos
you listened to, but then no actual growth in your
life. That's going to be extremely frustrating. You're probably experiencing
that already, aren't you? Right? Yeah, you are, because you
harm making this mistake. You're operating at the level of
beliefs still. My number one advantage in this work, and
I think in my entire life over other people is
not that I am more hardworking, or that I'm more
intelligent, or that I'm taller or bigger, stronger, or any
of this kind of stuff. My number one advantage is
that early in my life when I was still like
1214 years old, I became conscious of the structure of
beliefs. The mechanism of how beliefs work became apparent to
me If. And when I saw that, I became willing
to question every single belief, without exception, with no safety
zones, with no sacred beliefs. And that one thing is
what has allowed me to grow so quickly. And so
much in my life. Because I'm able to explore domains
that were completely outside of my family background, my cultural
background. Everything I was taught in school, everything I assumed,
like I'm able to surpass all of that, because I
don't hold anything as sacred. Because I see what this
game is about, it's a game, see. And if I
could wish one thing for you is that you also
adopt that sort of attitude in your life, not by
believing me, because that won't do it. But by actually
seeing the structure of how this game is played, to
the point where you say, Oh, well. I know too
much. Now. I know so much about the game, that
I can no longer honestly participate in the game. Because
the game can only be played, when you're not aware
that you're playing the game. And you don't see all
the damage that it does. Once you start to see
all the damage this does. Once you connect it up
to the historical perspective, all the damage that this has
done throughout history, with religions, governments, politics, all of this
all the hundreds of millions of people who have been
butchered and murdered over this game, this silly little game,
and how the only reason you play this game is
because you're afraid of direct experience, you're going to stop.
And when you can do that, you will open yourself
up to true growth. What I'm saying here is a
radical attitude towards life, do not expect anyone around you,
not your friends, not your family, not your teachers to
understand this, to agree with this, to support this. Because
this is anathema to everything that society is up to.
Society is an artificial bubble, a matrix that's created. So
that together a collective fantasy could be constructed, so that
our egos don't have to deal with direct experience. Because
direct experience is threatening to the ego. And it's emotionally
challenging to open yourself up to everything that directly spirits
will show because it'll show you some things that are
absolutely mind blowing. Just unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I what I
want for you, what I wish for you is that
you reach a point in your life, where you experience
something that's so powerful that you see it right before
your eyes. And yet you still can't believe it. You
see it but you still can't believe it. Because some
experiences in life are simply that shocking. And that awesome.
It's beyond belief, way beyond belief. And I want you
to be ready for that when that opportunity presents itself
to you. All right, that's it. One thing I'm going
to mention is that I have an exercise for you.
For this whole thing. I have a worksheet. It's got
a series of questions and exercises to help you start
to dismantle this woman beliefs and this whole game that
you're playing. So go click the link down below, there's
gonna be a link below the video that will lead
you to the worksheet that you can download for free.
It's a PDF worksheet and do it that'll start to
get you to implement all this abstract stuff that I
talked about. Alright, that's it. I'm done. Please click the
like button for me. Post your comments down below, share
this episode with a friend and come to actualize that
org and sign up to the newsletter, check out some
of the resources, we have a forum there, I have
a life purpose course I have a giant book list
that will really open you up to some radical new
experiences and some new ideas. So if you want to
challenge your web of beliefs, read some of the books
on my book list, man, this stuff will just decimate
your web of beliefs. And stick around for this journey.
What I'm offering you here is a completely radically different
attitude towards life. I'm trying to take it much deeper
than just self improvement. Most people who teach you self
improvement, they do not go to these lengths. They don't
really go to the core, which is why you don't
get very significant results from traditional self help. You get
little results. But you don't get nearly what you could
you get like 1% It's like buying a lemon, and
then just like squeezing a little bit, but then leaving
all the juice still inside. So if you want to
squeeze the entire thing, right, you want to get every
last drop out of it and out of your life.
You got to go deeper, takes more commitment and work
from you. Takes more seriousness from you. Takes more emotional
maturity from you. But hey, the the end result is
totally worth it. So, if you stick with me, what
I promise you is to take you all the way,
like all the way all the way. So you have
the deepest understanding that's humanly possible in the 21st century,
that's what you will have. And not only will you
have that you will have a practical mastery of it.
And you will experience things that no human being hardly
ever in the history of mankind has ever experienced. And
this shit will absolutely blow your mind with its beauty
and its awesomeness. So that's what gets me excited to
wake up every morning to shoot more content. So I
hope you stick with me and I'll see you soon
more
