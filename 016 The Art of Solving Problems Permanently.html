            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FFrR0cGWnac' target='_blank'>The Art of Solving Problems Permanently</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Looking for Quick Fixes</b>: Leo explains that many people tend to look for quick solutions to their problems rather than addressing the underlying cause. This approach only treats the symptoms temporarily and does not resolve the problems permanently.
</li><li><b>Depth in Coaching</b>: Leo discusses the challenge he faces when coaching individuals, especially regarding the depth to which he should coach them. Most people approach him with superficial problems, but as he delves deeper into these issues, he discovers that they can often be traced back to root causes within the individual.
</li><li><b>Superficial vs. Underlying Issues</b>: Using the example of someone wanting to lose weight, Leo suggests that the surface problem might be overeating and lack of exercise. Still, the underlying issue might be the individual's mindset about food and using it as a means of self-medication due to dissatisfaction with their job.
</li><li><b>Addressing Root Causes</b>: Leo stresses the importance of addressing the root causes of individual problems if they want to fix them permanently. Treating a problem superficially by trying to control it through sheer willpower only treats the symptoms and is not a sustainable solution.
</li><li><b>Courage to Unravel the Problem</b>: Using the analogy of a big ball of yarn, Leo suggests that it takes courage to start unraveling the problem thread by thread to understand and address the root cause. This approach can be scary and may involve more work, but it is vital for resolving the problem permanently.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of Problems</b>: Leo explains that many problems in life are interconnected, and one problem can often be a superficial symptom of a deeper issue. Fixing one problem might require resolving a different, related issue first.
</li><li><b>Role of Personal Circumstances</b>: Leo emphasizes that all circumstances in life can be traced back to the individual. To permanently fix problems, the underlying personal issues need to be addressed. This could involve the individual's perspectives, mental state, action patterns, and their surrounding circumstances.
</li><li><b>Struggle with Sustainability</b>: Lack of sustainable results can lead to persistent frustration, especially when efforts fail to yield desired outcomes. This often happens because the strategies used only serve to treat symptoms and do not address the underlying problem.
</li><li><b>Work Satisfaction and Nutrition</b>: Leo suggests that if work dissatisfaction leads to poor nutrition habits, it's important to address and fix the work issue first to achieve sustainable nutrition goals. 
</li><li><b>Confronting Deep-seated Issues</b>: Leo touches on the need for courage and willingness to face deep-seated issues to achieve permanent solutions. This might involve dealing with job dissatisfaction, fear of confrontation, or low confidence in one's skills and abilities. 
</li><li><b>Economic Factors</b>: Leo acknowledges that actual economic conditions and personal responsibilities can constrain oneÂ’s options. But he insists that these should be recognized as part of the root causes rather than insurmountable obstacles. 
</li><li><b>Job Availability and Confidence</b>: Leo explores the problem further, suggesting that individuals might feel held back due to a lack of confidence in their ability to find another job. Addressing this confidence issue could prove key to resolving the overall work dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Addressing Emotional Issues</b>: Leo suggests the possibility of emotional issues preventing individuals from standing up for themselves in professional situations. Recognizing and addressing these can help in finding a better work environment.
</li><li><b>Addressing Deeper Issues to Solve Problems Permanently</b>: Leo Gura suggests that frustrations at work, such as a difficult boss, might stem from deeper issues such as fear of losing your job or lack of other job options due to skill deficits or lack of industry connections. He emphasizes that the real solution should address these underlying issues like boosting your skill set by self-learning, taking online training programs, or going back to school. 
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of Problems in Life</b>: Gura illustrates how individual problems are interconnected through an example. What was initially perceived as a health problem was traced back to a problematic job, and then to the lack of right skills, which suggested the need for further education. He underlines that all issues ultimately boil down to oneself and encourage viewers to identify what aspects of themselves they need to change to overcome problems permanently. 
</li><li><b>Fear of Addressing the Core Issue</b>: Gura notes that most people resist unravelling the deeper issues due to fear and the complexity involved. However, he encourages viewing these challenges in a constructive way, stating that resolving one problem usually leads to multiple areas of life falling into place. He adds that taking steps to resolve these deeper issues, such as education or skills development, can lead to permanent solutions like better jobs and work-life balance, ultimately enhancing other areas of life like health and relationships. 
</li><li><b>Investment in Finding Permanent Solutions</b>: Gura acknowledges that this process of unearthing and addressing the root causes of issues requires significant effort and could be challenging initially. However, he assures that such investments pay off over time, leading to improved life aspects and less maintenance work in the long run. He contrasts this with the simpler and more tempting quick fixes, stating that the complexity and hard work involved in seeking permanent solutions are worth the long-lasting results. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Overcoming Limiting Beliefs</b>: Gura points out that deep-rooted limiting beliefs about one's intelligence or ability can hinder the process of seeking permanent solutions. He encourages viewers to confront these beliefs in order to align various aspects of their lives for long-term success and fulfillment. He concludes that although achieving permanent solutions is an arduous process, the personal growth and improvement that comes out of it are invaluable.
</li><li><b>Importance of Education and Career for Problem-Solving</b>: To sustainably improve quality of life, education plays a vital role. Acquiring useful skills and obtaining desirable jobs creates a lasting increase in salary grade which improves the standard of living. Earning more allows investments in health, for instance, affording healthier food, gym memberships, a better living environment which all contribute to a higher life standard.
</li><li><b>Reluctance Towards Permanent Solutions</b>: The tendency to opt for quick fixes that promise fast, effortless results often supersedes the effort towards lasting solutions which require a complete reformation of personal and professional habits and lifestyles. Such quick-fix advocates have not been frequently disappointed enough by these approaches to appreciate the real, lasting value of permanent solutions.
</li><li><b>Relevance of Self-Reflection in Permanent Problem Solving</b>: To achieve permanent solutions, deep self-reflection and identification of recurring unsuccessful patterns in personal and professional life are required. It is important to confront limiting beliefs, destructive habits, and make adjustments accordingly.
</li><li><b>The Root System Analogy</b>: Analogous to healthy tree growth where a strong root system is necessary to support the tree's ascension, personal development requires a strong inner belief and habit system. Although roots may seem unspectacular because they are hidden underground and not visually appealing, they hold significant weight in supporting the whole structure of the tree. Similarly, in life, one's beliefs, habits, thoughts, and attitudes work as the hidden, unglamorous, yet powerful support system for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Call To Action for Long-Term Problem-Solving</b>:The encouragement to bravely unravel life's issues and dig deep into the real problems echoes throughout. Attractive, yet ineffective quick fixes need to be abandoned in favor of complete life overhauls in all facets: career, finances, fitness, and relationships. A significant effort is required to achieve this feat; however, the results pay lifelong dividends leading to a sustainably happy life. Despite the hard work, it is proposed that other aspects of life would synchronously fall into place once the intrinsic issues are resolved. A balance between personal growth and practical actions (inner and outer solutions) are emphasized.
