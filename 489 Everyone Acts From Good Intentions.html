            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/1W1BNqvEHzU' target='_blank'>Everyone Acts From Good Intentions</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Everyone Acts From Good Intentions</b>: Leo Gura says it is a general principle that all human beings act with good intentions - this includes people who are considered "evil". He argues that misunderstanding these intentions comes from difficulties the human mind has in dealing with differences in perspectives. Instead of understanding these differences, the mind often demonizes and ascribes bad intentions to others. Gura calls for intellectual integrity in understanding others' perspectives.
</li><li><b>Ego and Good Intentions</b>: Gura explains that the human mind always views oneself as a good actor, assigning good intentions to its actions due to a distortion of reality by the ego. He adds that all people operate this way as the ego mind makes itself the definition of good. Thus, the concept of goodness becomes relativized and is defined relative to the ego. Recognizing the profound relativity behind human actions will help individuals properly understand global events.
</li><li><b>Good Intentions and Evil Acts</b>: Gura asserts that what people consider evil acts, such as acts committed by terrorists, rapists, political enemies among others, are all carried out with good intentions from the actors point of view. This is because the ego mind justifies their actions as good. This realization can be controversial because it challenges peoples belief in their own inherent goodness.
</li><li><b>Difficulty in Seeing from Others' Perspective</b>: Gura iterates that it's hard to see outside of one's perspective and recognize own mistakes because it doesn't serve individual's selfishness. He reasons that if people cared too much about the collateral damage their existence has on others, it would become difficult for them to live due to excessive empathy.
</li><li><b>Understanding Empathy and Privilege</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that being overly empathetic can be overwhelming, as it exposes us to the suffering of others. He thus explains how our minds block off empathy to help us function in daily life. He challenges the entitlement prevalent in first-world countries, arguing that no one is more deserving of comfort, money, property or other privileges than anyone else. Coming to terms with this takes emotional maturity and intellectual honesty, which most people don't possess due to self-centered thinking.
</li><li><b>Reducing Selfishness and Embracing Truth</b>: Our actions often serve us first and foremost. Reducing selfishness and embracing truth can be challenging and may not directly serve our self-interest. However, a divergence between truth and personal interest can lead to a fragile existence, similar to living in a bubble thats vulnerable to bursting from the outside. Acknowledging this can be painful, and many people avoid it.
</li><li><b>Understanding Ego and Perception of Reality</b>: According to Gura, everyone thinks they're acting with good intentions, but these actions are limited by their level of awareness and perception of reality. The more selfish an individual is, the more distorted their perception will be, leading them to act selfishly while believing that they are doing good. Gura believes that the more selfless and compassionate one is, the more undistorted their perspective will be, allowing them to see the selfish actions of others more clearly. 
</li><li><b>Appreciating the Privilege of First World Countries</b>: Gura highlights the need for more privileged individuals to understand the struggles of those from underprivileged backgrounds. People from peaceful, democratic countries may look at terror activities and label the actors as evil, without acknowledging the socio-economic and political circumstances that shaped these individuals' lives. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Relativity in Perspectives</b>: Every individual's actions are affected by their perspective and circumstances. What might appear as evil from one perspective might be seen as an act of survival, protection, or religious duty from another. Gura urges viewers to open their minds and understand that no one intends to do evil from their own point of view. Their actions are based on what they believe is good for them according to their level of consciousness and selfishness.
</li><li><b>ExxonMobil executives and their perceived indifference to climate change</b>: Leo Gura argues that ExxonMobil executives, despite living on the same planet and being potentially affected by climate change, don't perceive the threat as acutely based on their financial capacity to mitigate its direct impacts. He indicates that while these executives may appear self-centered and even harmful, their actions reflect their belief in the value of their work in extracting and supplying oil and natural gas due to its critical role in driving modern society (e.g., transportation, electricity generation). 
</li><li><b>Comparative perspective on selfishness</b>: Gura suggests that individuals and entities like ExxonMobil share a common issue of self-bias, which manifests differently based, on varying degrees of selfishness and entitlement. Despite notions of caring for the environment, individuals still contribute to "collateral damage," such as killing animals and generating pollution through regular activities like driving and eating. 
</li><li><b>Relative perspective on good intentions</b>: He elucidates that ExxonMobil and its CEOs believe they are delivering "good" for the world through their operations. This belief stems from the perspective that they are facilitating essential services and saving lives through energy provision. However, critics, who view ExxonMobil as harmful, often fail to acknowledge the vast, complex interconnections and the resulting positive outcomes of their actions. 
</li><li><b>The realization of Maximum Goodness</b>: Through mindfulness and spiritual awakening, people can recognize the complex network of "infinite interconnectedness" and realize that all actors, including themselves and large corporations, represent manifestations of "maximum goodness". They operate under the bound constraints of their finite capabilities and contribute to the universe's love and goodness in their unique ways. 
</li><li><b>Inherent necessity of selfishness for survival</b>: Human beings are finite forms of love; their selfishness and biases are vital components for their survival. Individuals and entities like ExxonMobil are manifestations of the universe's love and goodness, albeit sometimes realized through seemingly "corrupted" or selfish behavior. 
</li><li><b>Application of this realization to all actors</b>: Individuals like Hitler, Osama bin Laden, CEOs of ExxonMobil, and even individual human beings, all act according to their unique frameworks of good intention and love. However, these framework's relative "twist or corruption", based on self-bias and partial views of reality, result in different perceptions of good or evil by others.
</li><li><b>Perspective and Level of Development Dictate One's Circle of Concern</b>: Leo Gura explains that one's interpretation of who counts as "your people", which he refers to as your circle of concern, is dependent on one's viewpoint and level of development. More conservative or right-wing individuals usually have a very limited perspective, inclusive only of their own race or ethnicity, or in some cases, strictly just their local tribe. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Cultural Exposure and Limited Worldview</b>: If someone grows up isolated or only has exposure to their immediate tribe, they may be intimated or threatened when eventually exposed to different cultures, cuisines, languages, or religions. This can make their world view limited, and may influence them to only care about their own local community.
</li><li><b>Ethnic Conflicts Rooted in Misunderstandings</b>: In many war-torn regions, differences, which might seem insignificant from an outsider's perspective, could lead to ethnic cleansing, war, and genocide. Such conflicts arise due to misunderstandings and the misattribution of bad intentions.
</li><li><b>Polarization and Misunderstandings within the Same Political Group</b>: This issue is not limited to only culturally diverse regions; it also exists in homogeneous societies. For example, in America, there is a considerable ideological division within political groups such as progressives, corporate democrats, right-wingers, and neoliberals. These divisions often lead to individuals misunderstanding each other and attributing negative intentions within their group.
</li><li><b>Role of Bias in Defining Social, Political Groups</b>: Leo Gura explains that its the ego mind that sets the boundaries and defines which group one belongs to, and what group one is against. This tendency to form groups and have an opposition gives a sense of purpose and intensifies the survival instinct.
</li><li><b>Understanding Good Intentions of Political Opponents</b>: Progressives often misunderstand the intentions of right-wing and alt-right groups, attributing them with negative labels such as racists, misogynists, and fascists. It is important to remember that 'good intentions' is a variable concept and relates to specific individual or group perspective. For instance, alt-right groups believe they are acting with good intentions when they try to preserve their race, ethnicity, or country.
</li><li><b>Importance of Empathy in Understanding Opposing Viewpoints</b>: Depending on the perspective, not being able to empathize or love someone with opposing beliefs (like an alt-right individual), makes one 'demonize' that person, which can fuel further disharmony and polarization. Leo Gura encourages individuals to recognize this in order to foster more understanding, peace, and clarity in perception. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Alt-right and Nazis</b>: Rationalizing good intentions, even in extreme situations, does not necessarily mean accepting or fraternizing with harmful ideologies like Nazism. The idea here is to avoid overgeneralizations and remain intellectually honest instead of labeling or demonizing the alt-right as Nazis. Furthermore, realizing that the majority of alt-right are not actually Nazis helps to deflate exaggerated perceptions about opposing parties.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding Others' Perspectives</b>: Leo Gura underlines the repercussions of losing the ability to truthfully understand others' perspectives. He explains that losing intellectual integrity and misinterpreting perspectives results in detachment from reality, causing divergence that subsequently leads to conflicts and violence.
</li><li><b>Balancing Pragmatism and Empathy</b>: Leo highlights the need for simultaneously being pragmatic, considering potential consequences of political ideologies, and empathetic, understanding others' perspectives. He argues that lack of empathetic understanding can lead individuals to hold distorted perspectives and feel divided, which ultimately results in negative collective action and potential social disintegration.
</li><li><b>Delusions of Motives</b>: He warns against deluding oneself about others' motives, particularly for progressives misunderstanding conservatives. These faulty perceptions may not appear immediately consequential but eventually, they cause misunderstandings that turnout into ideological conflicts, leading to perpetuation of suffering and evil.
</li><li><b>Importance of Holistic Understanding</b>: Leo stresses the importance of holistic understanding in maintaining a sound perspective. He suggests that animosity between different ideologies often stems from a lack of deep understanding and ignorance about each other's perceptions. He further asserts that understanding this helps improve individual lives and promotes societal cohesion.
</li><li><b>Impacts of Segregated Battle</b>: Leo points out that engaging in bitter battles with others detracts from one's life energy, contributes to societal polarization and can potentially lead to societal disintegration. This negativity also affects individuals' alignment with their personal spiritual center of love, creativity, and constructiveness. 
</li><li><b>Losing Sight of Larger Picture</b>: Lastly, he suggests that focusing only on short-term victories against contradictory ideologies can cause one to lose sight of the larger war and the ultimate goal of unity and empathy. He encourages adopting empathetic understanding, even for radical perspectives, as he contends it is vital for personal and collective peace.
</li><li><b>Believing in Bad Intentions</b>: Leo argues that always suspecting and blaming others for having bad intentions can breed an aura of fear and bitterness, preventing personal happiness and serenity.
</li><li><b>Consequence of Untruthful Perception</b>: Leo suggests that the fear bred from suspecting others as evil greatly limits one's perspective of reality. This restrictive perception is equivalent to a 'karmic consequence' that perpetuates fear and suspicion. 
</li><li><b>Paranoic Nature of Conspiracy Theories</b>: Utilizing the example of conspiracy theories, Leo highlights how such concepts promote paranoia, making one believe that they are targeted by malicious forces. 
</li><li><b>Blocking off Infinite Love</b>: According to Leo, cultivating suspicion and ascribing evil intentions to collective groups unknowingly severs one's connection to infinite love, goodness, and truth.
</li><li><b>Adopting a New Perspective</b>: Leo suggests trying out a new perspective - viewing every action taking place around us as originating from the highest good and the most loving intentions, only to get corrupted due to its limited form or manifestation.
</li><li><b>Corrupt Finite Love</b>: Leo perceives the negative actions one performs as love and goodness getting twisted due to constraints of the ego. He urges viewing oneself and all one's actions in this light, irrespective of common notions of good and bad.
</li><li><b>Observing the Shift</b>: Upon adopting this perspective, Leo asserts that a significant shift occurs that impacts how one feels. Observing this shift aids in recognizing the truth and power behind this perspective. 
</li><li><b>Embracing Infinite Love</b>: Leo views the ultimate aim of this exercise as a step towards the realization of infinite love, recognizing that reality is a manifestation of such infinite love.
</li><li><b>Looking back in Retrospective</b>: Following the recognition of infinite love, one's past actions and beliefs, especially those showing selfishness, would seem misguided. 
</li><li><b>Justification for Selfish Actions</b>: Reflecting an unconventional view, Leo argues that selfishness and corruption are as much a part of love as anything else, given love can manifest as both infinite and finite forms.
</li><li><b>Trade-off Between Infinite and Finite</b>: Drawing onto the trade-off between infinite and finite forms of love, Leo explains the presence of flawed human actions. He attributes the selfish, biased, and flawed behaviors to the trade-off between infinite and finite forms of love, indicating that it is an existential necessity leading to conflicts and suffering.
</li><li><b>Accepting the Trade-Off</b>: Leo underscores that embracing this existential trade-off can help in achieving a state of complete peace, regardless of the external circumstances.
</li><li><b>Surviving in Unfavorable Conditions</b>: Finally, Leo redefines the perception of survival - he purports that maintaining clear perception and understanding of reality aids in dying in peace rather than in misery, despite unfavorable conditions. This he asserts is the power of having a clear understanding of reality and its implications.
</li><li><b>Deconstructive Process for Self-Growth</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of a deconstructive process in which you examine and strip away your self-biases and limiting beliefs. This process doesn't involve adding new ideologies or beliefs, but rather clearing away existing limitations and distortions in your perception of reality. 
</li><li><b>Perception of Reality and Love</b>: With a clear mind and pure perception, you will realize that truth, love, and perfection are intrinsically connected, leading to a deeper understanding of reality. Limiting beliefs such as fear, hate, greed, and pettiness are not rooted in reality but are indoctrinations that most people never question.
</li><li><b>Choosing Truth Over Happiness and Love</b>: Leo urges individuals to choose truth over happiness and love. However, he clarifies that choosing truth does not mean rejecting happiness and love, as the universe is structured such that all three are interconnected. Understanding this link between truth, happiness, and love can serve as a person's "salvation".
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Awareness</b>: Using the analogy of an unaware millionaire, Leo explains that the problems most people face are not due to a lack of resources or possibilities, but due to the lack of awareness and pettiness in their belief system. By examining and questioning these beliefs, individuals can discover their true potential and wealth.
</li><li><b>Goals of Leo's Teachings</b>: All teachings, practices and discussions promoted by Leo seek to help people realize and understand the profound and diverse concept of love in its entirety. He underscores the need to remove limiting beliefs and to create space for infinite metaphysical love, which is essential for understanding the different aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Future Episodes and Learning Beyond Politics</b>: Leo mentions that future episodes will address collective and political issues while emphasizing learning the deeper lessons rather than focusing heavily on political ideologies. Regardless of one's political affiliations, the goal is to guide viewers to a higher level of consciousness to experience life beyond their current worldview and achieve infinite love. 
</li><li><b>Acknowledgement of Continuous Work Required</b>: Leo acknowledges that all individuals, irrespective of their political beliefs or ideologies, have work to do in terms of reaching higher stages of consciousness, evolving perspectives, and realizing infinite love. It's a holistic process, and Leo promises more episodes to help guide this personal transformation.
