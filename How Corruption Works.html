[Music] let's talk about how corruption works every government on
the face of the earth for the last 10,000 years
has been dealing with corruption and we still haven't eliminated
it yet there's still a lot of it left so
you have to wonder why is that you would think
with 10,000 years of evolution and advancement we would have
gotten it all by now and yet we haven't that
tells you that there's something deeper to corruption that we
don't understand we're not approaching it in the right ways
so to approach it in the right way is what
we have to do is we have to question it
existentially what is it really what are the underlying mechanics
we can't just simply dismiss it as though there are
some evil bad people over there who are corrupt we
have to look at it deeper so the key questions
for us now are what is corruption and why does
it happen have you ever wondered that like on an
existential level why does corruption exist within reality at all
why is this so prevalent within governments and other organizations
it turns out to be a deep existential problem which
we're going to explore here don't think that corruption is
only limited to the government there are a lot of
partisans simplistic ideas about how corruption works where people get
the idea that all will one party is corrupt no
it's not that one party is corrupt every single party
every single government across eras and centuries and millennia across
all the continents on the earth where humans have lived
have dealed with corruption so it ain't a problem of
a single party that you don't like it's a much
broader problem this problem of eliminating corruption is really synonymous
with the problem of eliminating evil that's what we're talking
about so you can't eliminate corruption unless you understand what
evil is which of course I've talked about previously in
various episodes which I'll be referencing some of those that
are pertinent as we go forward but I have I
have multiple episodes about good versus evil and how evil
works and what the devil is and all that sort
of stuff why is evil so hard to eliminate that's
what we'll be discussing today see people misunderstand why corruption
happens which ironically then contributes and adds gasoline on top
of the fire and only deepens the corruption that's part
of the problem but before we get into that a
quick reminder here I did just launch on patreon recently
a few weeks ago I really appreciate your support and
your donations for supporting this channel your contributions go to
making improvements to this channel to for example buying better
equipment I just yesterday purchased a $5,000 camera it's gonna
be a new camera an upgrade from what I have
right now so right now what you're seeing is not
the new camera this is the old stuff the new
stuff I'm still waiting for it to ship and to
arrive it'll probably come in the next few weeks and
I'll have to experiment and test it out and get
it to work and all that that'll take some time
but hopefully that will improve the image quality and I'm
also probably gonna make improvements to the website in the
future maybe improvements to the forum this sort of stuff
your funds help with that and open up new possibilities
for expanding actualize that org into the future so thanks
a lot for that you can click the link down
below and become a patron if you find value in
this content and that helps me to keep this content
free of sponsorships and a bunch of ads and other
corrupting influences speaking of which so now let's get back
to the topic at hand so corruption notice doesn't just
happen in government it also happens in organizations of any
stripe it also happens within relationships it happens within spirituality
and religion it happens within science and academia it happens
with food the food industry it happens within education the
education system and industry it happens with sex the whole
me - movement what is that about this is about
abuses of sexual power basically it's a form of corruption
you might say corruption happens in sports corruptions happen corruption
happens in the military during more time corruption happens in
police departments in families the health care system can be
corrupted in fact in America we have one of the
most corrupt healthcare systems in the world for a for
a developed country compared to many European countries and so
on the media can be corrupt businesses can be corrupt
the environment can get corrupt or be corrupted judges and
attorneys and the entire legal system can be corrupted political
parties can be corrupt computer systems and computer files can
be corrupt of course as you know even Minds can
get corrupt in fact that is the root of all
of this corruption all this corruption that we're talking about
if it's an external corruption like a corruption at a
political party or corruption of the environment or corruption of
the military where does it begin it begins here this
is what's running the whole show your mind all the
human minds combined are running the show even DNA can
get corrupted genetic mutations so forth leading to cancer other
kinds of illnesses and dysfunctions industries can be corrupt for
example Hollywood is getting more and more corrupt it seems
with the kind of movies they release they're not really
focused on releasing high quality movies they're focused on releasing
movies that earn them the most money these popcorn flicks
these superhero movies that there's just an end a stream
of losing the artistic value sacrificing artistic value for for
money and for maximizing sales video games are also getting
more and more corrupt as you notice video games have
loot boxes in them now nowadays all sorts of paid
schemes gambling basically virtual gambling taking place in video games
that's what you've seen as a gamer over the last
10 years especially you've seen the corruption of video game
industry with microtransactions and all that sort of stuff DLC
and various other sneaky tactics that that industry uses and
you know there's there's thousands of industries and all of
them have corruption in them and you can easily get
sucked into this corruption to see because a lot of
times this corruption is sneaky it's subtle it's hidden it
lurks in the shadows you don't know that you're getting
corrupted while you're getting corrupted you might just be entering
the industry you might be one of those bright-eyed bushy-tailed
you know people who goes to Hollywood and wants to
make it in the world of Hollywood and wants to
be successful as a director as a producer as an
actor or something and then the industry will suck you
into the corruption and of course the same thing happens
if you go to Washington or to get to your
tier local capital and run for government all this there's
always these forces of corruption so what is all this
about what's really going on here well first let's turn
to a definition of what corruption is here are some
definitions just from various online dictionaries that I've compiled for
you to get you a little bit of a clear
sense number one corruption is dishonest or fraudulent conduct by
those in power number two the abuse of entrusted power
for personal private gain that's an important one we'll circle
back to that one number three a departure from the
original or from what is pure or correct so this
third one is a more of an abstract notion of
corruption which goes beyond political exploitation and human activities number
four a process by which something typically a word or
expression is changed from its original use or meaning to
one that is regarded as erroneous or debased that's an
interesting definition this one almost dovetails with our discussion about
impermanence see my episode understanding impermanence where I talk about
how everything in reality is always changing so that should
if you combine these two concepts together that get you
a little bit of a kind of a hint or
a clue that maybe what's going on is that everything
in reality is constantly changing so if you want to
fix the meaning of a particular word or an expression
if we're talking about linguistic corruption here or you want
to fix the meaning of a let's say of a
Shakespearean play in literature and you want to say well
this particular you know Hamlet means this particular thing but
then you know those interpretations change over time that is
impermanence that is evolution happening see and then of course
who gets to say what is a corruption and what
isn't you see that's also a very important point here
what people don't understand about corruption generally speaking he said
they assume that corruption is some sort of black-and-white affair
where there's like some laws written down by God somewhere
which says it this is the good stuff over here
and this is the bad stuff over here and don't
do this stuff because this is corruption but this stuff
here is not corruption but of course this is not
how reality works in reality the concept of corruption itself
is completely relativistic so what's corrupt from my point of
view may not be corrupt from your point of view
who's to say which interpretation of Shakespeare's Hamlet is the
correct one who's to say what meaning for a particular
word is the correct usage and meaning of that word
of course the English language has evolved and changed so
much over the last 500 years you go back try
to read Shakespeare's Hamlet you can barely read it even
though it's written in English you can barely read it
because the words and the meanings have become so corrupt
but who's to say whether they were corrupted or they
were actually improved you see maybe if Shakespeare was brought
back to life and he had to converse with us
in our 21st century English he would say you've corrupted
my beautiful language that might be his perspective but of
course who's to say who's right so this gets us
into relativity for more on Dada go check out my
two-part series part 1 understanding relativity or understanding relativism I
think I called it and actually part two I still
haven't released yet I'll be releasing that one in the
future so that explores that in more detail definition number
five impairment of moral principle virtue or values and the
finished number six decay and decomposition which goes more into
impermanence so this gets you a bit of an idea
what we're talking about but what motivates corruption what is
the source of it corruption is selfishness ego or survival
all these words I'm going to be using interchangeably in
this episode I've talked a lot about them in the
past specifically see my two-part series understanding survival part 1
and part 2 where we go into a lot of
depth on that another word for corruption is delery I
like that word I use it quite a bit I
call people Devils sometimes or I speak of devilry and
to understand how I use that word I use it
in a bit of a nuanced way go watch my
episode a really important one of mine called what is
the devil where I explained that in more details so
you're gonna need that idea of the devil to understand
but I'll be talking about next so that is really
what corruption is is devilry which is selfishness which is
ego which is survival all that corrupt people are really
doing is they're surviving they're finding ways to survive at
any cost by any means and that is how survival
works its relentless it doesn't care about the collateral damage
it has one objective which is to survive the thing
that you are identified with being that's it whatever that
is will determine what you feel you need to do
and how corruption looks to you from your point of
view taking in to account relativity because everyone has a
different identity that are attached to that they're trying to
survive therefore there's competing identities that are all trying to
survive and so what looks like corruption from one person's
point of view does it look like corruption from another's
see the trick though here is that corruption is very
easy to see in other people but it's very hard
to see within yourself just like it's very easy to
tell when somebody is being selfish but it's much harder
to see when you're being selfish it's easy for example
to see when someone's being deluded or deceiving themselves but
it's really hard to tell when you are deluded and
when you are deceiving yourself that's really the problem that
we're dealing with here and this brings us to our
most important inside of this whole episode the crucial insight
is that you are corrupt corruption is not some boogeyman
out there corruption isn't some smog cloud hanging over Washington
DC you are corrupt you are the source of corruption
and that is a very counterintuitive and unpalatable truth because
you think you're an angel you think you're a hero
and what I'm telling you is I'm telling you that
you're the devil so do you want to accept that
of course if you're corrupt you won't want to accept
that and you're gonna deny it see the problem with
corruption is that people think that they are gonna fix
corruption you think that you are the solution to corruption
your ego thinks that your ego thinks that if hey
if things are just done my way if I get
everything that I want if reality is rearranged to suit
me that will fix all of corruption tada solution easy
right just make everything the way that I want it
but of course that very way of thinking is the
thing that creates the corruption because when everybody behaves that
way then the ends justify the means and then they
use all sorts of devilish means to accomplish what they
think is the best solution and corruption ensues you can't
fix corruption until you deeply acknowledge to yourself that you
are its chief cause and you stop blaming others for
it that's the crucial mistake and in politics this gets
weaponized of course corrupt politicians will weaponize this to try
to shift blame on other corrupt people you see they
don't want to get you to actually look inwards to
reflect on your own corruption they don't want you to
reflect about our collective corruption as a country if we're
Americans or whatever country you're from doesn't matter see instead
what a country generally does is the politician will come
to power and say ah it's not America that's corrupt
it's the rest of the world this is the Middle
East that's corrupt it's the it's Asia that's corrupt and
so forth now of course they probably are because almost
every government is corrupt so calling somebody corrupt isn't really
saying much it's the the pot calling the kettle black
Issy but what it is is very clever distraction it's
a red herring to get you to not look at
our own corruption really what we should be looking at
as a nation as Americans or whatever country you're from
you should be looking at the corruption within your own
nation first and foremost what is your nation doing to
contribute to corruption and what are you doing as an
individual to contribute to the corruption of your nation that's
the critical question and of course this question never gets
asked in the media or in political analysis that almost
never gets asked so repeat after me I am a
shameless corrupt devil take your finger and point it to
yourself to your chest and repeat after me I am
a shameless corrupt devil and I am the source of
all the world's evil and point to yourself as you're
doing this are you doing this are you saying this
make sure you say this because I wanted to register
in you and if you're noticing a resistance like ah
but I don't want to say it Leo this isn't
right there you go that's your corruption coming up see
this is the first step in overcoming corruption is admitting
it it's just like Alcoholics Anonymous you got to admit
you're an alcoholic you got to admit that you're the
devil then we can move forward beyond that and consider
other solutions the problem is that this first step is
never taken by almost anybody if you identify with being
an American or whatever country you're from you also have
to admit and take responsibility for the collective corruption of
your society and your country and of course you can
go even one level higher and you can take responsibility
for the corruption of the entire human species as well
because there's there's plenty of corrupt stuff that humans do
as a species independent of national borders but you know
like we have we have to be honest with ourselves
as Americans that hey you know we are very corrupt
in terms of the way that we use our military
around the world to serve our business interests see and
you benefit from that as an American you get lower
gas prices and you maybe get a better job and
you maybe get some tax breaks or whatever else maybe
you work for one of these military defense contractors and
literally your paycheck depends upon that see otherwise you might
not have that job you gotta take responsibility for that
if you really care about fixing corruption you see now
you understand why fixing corruption is so unpopular really because
you think that ah by by starting to fight corruption
out there that you know we're gonna defeat the evil
ones out there but then what happens is that you
go Circle and you realize oh the corruption I thought
that was out there actually circles back around in a
in a strange loopy sort of way and points right
back to me and then it's like oh so to
fix the corruption of the world I would have to
fix myself oh but that would mean I have to
change myself up but I don't want to do that
that's the last thing I want to do see this
is what's not recognized it's very easy to rant against
the corruption of others it's much harder to carefully observe
your own corruption and to let it go and to
act with integrity that's the real work here both individually
and collectively I want you to consider the following possibility
that corrupt people are not actually evil in the way
that they're portrayed in the media you know sometimes we
see some corrupt politician get caught or some corrupt businessman
get caught and then he maybe even gets dragged out
of his office in handcuffs and then on the you
know on the evening news it says oh they caught
some corrupt politician engaged some sort of bribery scheme you
know they caught him red-handed and the handcuffed him they
dragged him to coordinates and then everybody looks at that
and they sort of applaud and they said good that
that that guy is evil you know they talk about
him as though he's the evil one as though he's
somehow some exception he's not the exception he's an ordinary
person he's just like you that's what is not acknowledged
and recognized corrupt people are not really evil they're totally
ordinary people put into situations of power and temptation and
backed into a corner as far as their survival goes
all they're doing is they're just surviving that's all they're
doing they're finding clever ways to survive and then of
course when you really attach a survival it's easy to
find manipulative opportunistic parasitic ways of surviving and that's what
that politician was doing he was being a parasite on
the system for his own selfish gain why because he
has desires temptations he wants sex he wants money he
wants to send his kids to college so of course
he takes the bribe of course you would - most
likely only if you're very careful and very conscious will
you be able to resist that trap that temptation but
see what a lot of ordinary people underestimate is how
much this problem gets magnified and amplified when you become
much more successful and powerful and famous than you are
right now most people are so far away from being
super famous super powerful or super successful that never in
their life do they even face those kind of temptations
and that kind of power and responsibility that comes with
being in in a position of leadership towards the top
of the hierarchy see so you might be thinking but
below I I would never take a bribe I would
never be involved in some sort of sex scandal in
the White House or whatever I would never do these
sorts of things I'm just an ordinary person I live
a comfortable kind of easy life and I'm not all
obsessed by these ambitions and so forth but we have
to understand is that for you to climb to the
top of that hierarchy to get to where some of
these really famous successful powerful people get to you got
you're gonna have to have a lot of a lot
of ambition to get there you see and by the
time you get there and you put in all the
work and all the time and all the energy to
climb up there and then you're there and people look
up to you people adore you people shower you with
praise and and people blow smoke up your ass and
people kiss your ass and now you're powerful and you
can control the lives of people you can make or
break people you can sexually exploit people you can make
or break their careers you determine who gets rich and
who gets poor this sort of stuff you can throw
your fame around and your fame leads to more accent
to more money in all this this becomes extremely tempting
see much more tempting than you realize as an ordinary
little person if you haven't really pursued success seriously and
this I think most people underestimate so even when you
might start out life let's say at the bottom of
the hierarchy you're not very wealthy you're not very famous
you're not very successful but then you work your climb
your way to the top and you tell yourself well
I will never betray my my values for money or
for sex or for opportunities or for success or for
anything like that but you get sucked into it slowly
it seeps into your mind slowly and as you become
more and more successful the fruits of your success they
start to affect you they start to make you complacent
they start to make you entitled they start to make
you feel like you deserve it they start to make
you have delusions of grandeur where you start to tell
yourself a mythos of how you did it all by
yourself you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps this sort
of stuff see and this becomes very dangerous and you
know we know many many a celebrity in the news
have destroyed their own lives with drugs and sex and
food and various schemes and various kinds of lawlessness because
you know once hear some actor in Hollywood who everybody
adores and everybody loves and everyone wants to have sex
with and who has 50 million dollars and you know
all this sort of stuff like nobody bosses you around
see you have enormous power now if you want you
can bully your employees people who work for you your
personal assistants you can throw telephones at them if you
get angry you know you can throw beer bottles at
them whatever else you can sexually abuse them yeah and
see most people are not taught how to deal and
cope with this kind of level of responsibility in this
kind of level of power power magnifies corruption and ego
by a hundredfold and whatever a little character defects or
shadow issues you have now as an ordinary little person
when you become successful and powerful and famous I'm telling
you all those will get magnified you know four little
cracks into a Grand Canyon sized flaws and you can
really destroy yourself if you don't pay attention to those
and you can take down others close to you your
family and so forth as you become more successful and
powerful and famous there's much more opportunity to exploit and
to be manipulative there's much more opportunity to be a
bully it becomes much easier to access sex drugs food
gifts favors deals and to skirt the law in various
ways and to think that you won't get caught because
white-collar crime isn't regulated and prosecuted nearly as seriously as
on a more more traditional classical physical crime even though
often is it's much more dangerous and much more harmful
because it can affect millions of people not just one
person and especially once you get on a roll of
success you know you start getting book deals and then
tours and then people know you more and your business
is growing and growing you're getting more clients and then
those clients lead to more clients and it just becomes
this sort of snowball of success you might think well
Leo this is awesome be careful be careful it's very
easy to get lost in that success and then just
to just want to like one-up it every time every
year you wanna be more and more successful and then
in that drive more endless infinite success you end up
becoming very corrupt materialism corrupts you and then you don't
even care about spirituality more because in your mind it's
like well Leo I don't why should I meditate why
should I do yoga why should I maintain my practices
why should I spend all this time reading and practicing
and doing all this stuff when I could just like
earn more money and then get everything I want with
the money that's a very tempting trap to fall into
but it doesn't actually work that way it could lead
to very disastrous consequences see the trick here is that
the ego never sees its own survival as corruption see
we're playing a game here of perceptual illusions the mind
is tricking itself in order to gain survival advantage to
do that it's not that the mind is tricking others
first and foremost the mind has to trick itself into
feeling righteous about its survival agenda and so your mind
literally twists and contorts and distorts your perception such that
what you see and how you think about reality itself
the actual structure of reality gets warped and distorted by
your survival agenda such that you can be highly corrupt
but not consider yourself to be corrupt you can think
of yourself as the good guy the hero the angel
while you're being a devil because from the egos point
of view from the point of view of survival corruption
is what others do by definition you see that's how
the ego distorts the notion of corruption it's like you
become so successful and powerful and famous that you start
to think that you're above the law you start to
think you're above being bad you sort of think that
you're above needing to worry about how you hurt people
or the collateral damage that you caused because there's no
consequences because you're so [ __ ] powerful that nobody
tells you anything they can't because you have so much
power over them see and that in your mind just
validates the fact that hey I'm perfect I'm an angel
I'm doing good for the world and corruption is just
something that other people do I could never do corruption
I'm always doing good but of course that's how every
corrupt person thinks corruption is always excused and justified in
the mind it's amazing how powerful the mind is at
excusing and justifying all sorts of devilry it's amazing that
very process itself is the very heart of what devilry
is devilry is not just you going stealing candy from
a baby that that sort of you know brute force
example first and foremost devilry is how you justify it
to yourself how you excuse that activity to yourself because
you would never be able to get away with that
activity in your own mind unless first you did some
very sneaky self-deception and of course for a self-deception to
be effective it has to be deceptive which means that
you have to not notice it it has to go
under the radar of your own awareness which means it
has to be unconscious which means that you don't know
you're doing it which means that you're very likely to
deny that you're doing it because from your point of
view you can't see that you're doing it you can't
connect all the dots and to see how the actions
and thoughts and emotions that you're feeling and all this
stuff you're doing the words you're saying how all of
this is all the manipulations are doing how all that
is adding up to creating the corruption in the world
you haven't connected those dots why not because why would
you if all you can is your survival see it
doesn't benefit your survival to connect all these dots which
is of course why actualize that org doesn't benefit your
survival all that actualize already is all these videos are
are me just connecting dots for you that's all we're
doing here we're connecting dots what can I join dots
to create these big pictures of reality and this is
very threatening to your ego and to your way of
life so you might wonder how is this practical well
it's not practical from your point of view it has
a higher transcendent practicality of practicality beyond practicality the practicality
of escaping needing everything to be practical there's something beyond
that in fact you're lost in your own practicality the
problem is that is not that you're impractical the problems
that you're too practical that's your real problem of course
you also have problems with being practical so in truth
you have problems on on all sides you have many
problems not just one problem see the mind never sees
a problem with its own self-preservation unless the mind is
very conscious unless the mind is connected a lot of
dots unless the mind is is doing a self actualization
work then it can start to catch on but even
that is this still tricky it's still tricky you know
I talk about all this stuff as if I'm a
master of it but I have my own corruptions that
I deal with every day it's tricky I'm susceptible to
self-deception just because I talk about self-deception doesn't mean I'm
immune to self-deception people commonly my critics commonly misunderstand me
here and I've said this in my self-deception series I
said very importantly towards the end that I am absolutely
not above self-deception and neither are you and that in
fact is the whole point of talking about self-deception is
to realize that you're not above it nor will you
ever be not even after you awaken and it's that
vigilance and that humility of recognizing that this is a
trap I could always fall into that keeps you out
of it but again there's no guarantees you're doing the
best you can but there's no guarantees so see this
whole corruption issue is a really a problem of relativity
in perspective it's very hard to see outside of one's
own worldview to assess one's own worldview objectively it requires
awareness of self bias which I talked about in my
series on self bias go check that out very important
topic most people are totally clueless about self bias so
therefore they can't evaluate their own world views and beliefs
objectively and this gets them into a lot of trouble
and ultimately creates corruption see because see the problem is
is if I'm corrupt I have to be objective enough
with my own self to admit to myself that I
am corrupt and then I'm somehow doing something wrong and
that I need to change but to admit that I
am wrong in some way or that I've hurt somebody
this is painful it's painful to admit that because I
have a positive self-image that I need to uphold I
have this self image of being a hero or be
a good guy or being a noble guy being an
angel not being a devil whatever so whenever a devilry
is pointed out to me it stings it hurts you
don't want to know that you're a devil you don't
want your mom or your spouse coming to you and
pointing out to you how you've been a devil because
then you feel bad you feel guilty you feel like
you need to change you feel demonized you feel people
are attacking you you feel you're not being loved you're
feeling I think appreciated which is what you want the
most in life all you want in life is love
so when I call you a devil you feel attacked
see you want me to call you an angel see
but being an angel has to be earned you can't
just call yourself an angel it can't be a name
only you actually have to be an angel how do
you actually become an angel well that's what all of
actual eyes are always telling you how to do it's
hard you might wonder why aren't there more angels in
the world why are there so many devils so many
more Devils than angels well when you get deep into
this work we're doing you'll realize Oh goddamn this work
is so brutal it's so [ __ ] brutal it's
so hard it's so emotionally taxing I feel alone I
feel frustrated I feel disgusted with myself I feel insecure
I don't know which way to go I don't know
where I'm gonna go I don't know where that's gonna
leave me I feel like I'm losing my mind I
feel like I'm going insane I feel like I'm losing
my grip on reality yes this these are all the
costs of becoming an angel that is the purification process
see the the devilry is being burned out of you
by the light of consciousness by the light of God
and of course you don't like that the devil doesn't
like that it's like pouring salt on a snail so
in order to avoid corruption you need to have enough
awareness of your own worldview to see how your worldview
and your survival needs are distorting your perception of reality
I have an old episode called something like um being
needs versus survival needs where I talk I talk about
that I'm not sure what I titled that episode I
think that's in the subtitle being needs were surrounding something
like that where I go into more depth on that
distinction between survival needs and being needs see corrupt people
aren't conscious of their corruption that's what is not understood
very well their mind tricks them into believing that their
corruption is actually okay it hides the corruption through a
whole series of mental gymnastics and manipulations of its own
self through self-deception make sure you go watch those three
episodes on self-deception those are I think three of the
most important episodes I've ever released if you really want
to figure out what's going on in life and why
human beings behave the way they behave and why you
behave the way you behave it's all explained by self-deception
so the critical element here about corruption to corruption is
the level of one's consciousness I've also talked about this
in the past levels of consciousness our goal here is
to raise your consciousness and so when you're at a
low level of consciousness that basically guarantees corruption because low
conscious minds do not see a problem with selfishness self
bias manipulation lying cheating moralizing demonizing others partisanship they don't
see a problem with this well either or not because
a low consciousness mind isn't conscious enough to spot its
own projections denials self biases and self-deceptions it doesn't think
that it's self deceived that's one of the key characteristics
of a low consciousness mind just to admit that you're
thoroughly self deceived and that your entire perception of reality
is distorted by your own mind just to admit that
already takes an individual with a relatively high level of
consciousness and sophisticated cognitive development don't underestimate this don't don't
take this for granted I would say at least 60%
of the entire population of humans on earth right now
in the 21st century are not at a level of
consciousness and development cognitive development where they can spot their
own self deceptions and this is the ultimate root cause
of a lot of the problems that we have politically
but also individually and all the corruption you see around
us the average person is easily corrupted by money power
sex and fame actually one of the things that saves
us from this is that the average person never gets
very far in terms of money power sex and fame
and that's actually a good thing because when you get
a lot of money power sex and fame but you
don't have a foundation of self-actualization and consciousness work on
which to in which to ground it you're gonna you're
gonna do all sorts of evil things it requires self
actualization work to resist the temptations of money power sex
and fame it takes a person of exceptional integrity character
values consciousness and moral development to be able to do
this which is why it's so rarely done and here's
another really profound insight for you corruption gets baked into
our culture it's not that an individual is corrupt per
se that's just the tip of the iceberg we're talking
about something much much much deeper here corruption is baked
into the culture which includes entertainment media the news art
religion government business the norms of your culture the education
system of your culture the military even science as it's
done by your culture the medical system see the corruption
gets institutionalized in the form of ideology in the form
of ideas norms theories concept is it's a conceptual framework
really created by the mind whatever industry we're talking about
whether it's the military or science or academia or entertainment
or Hollywood or whatever some religion there's always an ideology
that comes with that system that's maintaining that system like
the legal system has a certain ideology to it certain
things that they believe are right and wrong true and
false delusional and not delusional see but where did these
ideas come from well they came for past generations and
where do those come from well from other past generations
and so it goes back thousands of years basically but
this this culture is constantly evolving it's never staying the
same cultural norms and ideas of what's right and what's
wrong was corrupt what's not corrupt is always changing and
who as a whole we're not staying still we're also
evolving in our consciousness both individually and collectively see so
uprooting corruption it begins with you individually personally and we're
gonna talk more about how to how to let go
of your own personal corruptions it begins there but it
doesn't just end there corruption is also a collective cultural
phenomenon and so the problem here is that the reason
most people are so corrupt is because most people are
conformist in their thinking this is spradlin AMEX tej blue
but even staged orange is still very conformist and even
staged Green is still very conformist in the way that
it thinks in the way that it adopts its ideology
and belief systems about reality and so when your conformist
what happens is that you're born into this world and
you just accept the prevailing paradigms of your culture the
norms of your culture you accept them as absolute you
accept them as the way things should be done the
best way that things could be done with no alternatives
you don't question them existentially you don't question things from
scratch you don't question your society you don't question why
things are done a certain way you just follow the
rules and of course society forces you to conform as
a child with punishments and rewards in school they give
you punishments and rewards so you were basically trained to
be a nice lap dog in school and your parents
train you to be a lap dog and to just
accept all sorts of things including science they trained you
to accept the dogmas of science not because they're true
but simply through conformity and all so you should be
careful here to make a distinction between truth and conformity
in the sense that just because something is true does
not save you from the problem of conforming to it
so you might say all leo but you know something
like the earth is round that's actually true how do
I know it yes through conformity of course because I
just believe what my teachers told me but it's not
a problem because it's true no the problem is not
in whether it's true or not the problem lies in
the fact that you're conforming just for the sake of
conforming you see the problems that you didn't derive the
truth for yourself that's what really matters here so we're
not really interested in what's true or not we're interested
in how you got there and if you got there
through conformity that's a problem it's your process which is
corrupt we're interested in the meta dynamics here of how
your mind works we're interested in the process of it
and the process you're doing epistemology you're using is very
very corrupt and very very naive and takes so much
for granted so when 90% over 90% of the world's
population is simply learning through conformity and then entering all
these different industries and sectors of society like art media
entertainment news culture education military signs all this they're entering
into it and then they're reinforcing that system that system
brainwashed these people and then these people become what they've
become the next generation of those who support the system
so some university professor first he spends 30 years being
brainwashed by the university system in the school system which
feeds the university system and then after 30 years of
that then he becomes a professor and he continues to
do the very same thing and of course he doesn't
recognize that he's doing it and so in this way
conformist people like sheep they become vectors for corruption corruption
here is like a virus infects your mind see if
you want to inoculate your mind against corruption then you
have to start to think independently for yourself from scratch
question things existentially don't take anything for granted don't believe
anyone including me and then most people because they just
assume that the the cultural programming they get is is
good and in fact often it's the greatest in the
world you know Americans are the greatest or the Japanese
are the greatest or the Indians are the greatest this
is national and basically once your program with that you
become so loyal to your cultures against Bielema sage blue
is really good at this loyalty to one's culture that
then what happens in it then then they go into
denial mode about the corruption of the culture because when
your wing first you make a loyalty oath to your
culture and you're gonna support your culture and defend your
culture at all costs see now it's about defending your
culture something you're attached to something you're identifying with rather
than the truth because what happens when your culture is
corrupt and the truth conflicts with that what happens is
this type of person going to admit that the culture
is corrupt of course not because his loyalty is to
the culture not to the truth he's not being objective
he's being self biased here and so of course he's
gonna deny the corruption and in fact he's gonna blame
you he's gonna blame the truth for being falsehood he's
gonna call what's true false and he's gonna call you
as the person who shows it to him as a
devil when in fact it's he who's being a devil
by being attached to his culture see it's not just
religious fanatics that do this I'm talking about you I'm
talking about your family I'm talking about your friends I'm
talking about your colleagues your co-workers everybody you know is
doing this including you unless you've done a lot a
lot of work to escape it and even then it's
it's very hard to escape it's like escaping a black
hole it's got your real deep you've been brainwashed since
you were aged zero all right so keep that in
mind and I'll just give you one example here with
science it might sound here like I'm talking about some
religious fundamentalists or some sort of cult by the way
check out my two-part series on cult psychology where I
do talk about a lot of this kind of stuff
and also check out my my episode on how ideology
works where I talk a lot about this kind of
stuff but back to the point you know people think
that oh this is this is only fundamentalist religious people
that leo is ranting against no science science is guilty
of this modern science is deeply corrupt but the scientists
and academics who are part of this system are in
denial about the corruption and when you tell them hey
your institution is deeply corrupt they say what are you
talking about where's the corruption there's no corruption you're crazy
because they never questioned the system that raised them that
created them they're a part of that system their survival
is hinged to that system you think some university professor
who has devoted 40 50 years of his life working
his ass off taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars
of student loans that he's probably gonna be paying off
until he retires you think he's gonna admit that the
system that he's hitched himself to is corrupt not a
chance not a chance he might admit it on the
surface but he's never gonna admit the deep corruption of
the whole system see and actually to admit corruption on
the surface is a clever ploy the devil plays its
part of the corruption see there's there's layers to this
deception so one of the ways that you can avoid
admitting your own corruption and you can say oh yeah
yeah okay yeah oh I know I know we're corrupt
I know science isn't perfectly of course scientists make mistakes
some academics are bad sometimes sure of course some academics
even make up you know studies and they make up
their results you know yeah there are some rotten apples
in the in the batch but leo you know yeah
we'll get rid of those rotten apples you know science
corrects itself and blah blah blah this whole spiel this
this this is the ideology I'm talking about this is
the corruption this is a dis disguise for the deeper
fundamental metaphysical corruption the paradigmatic corruption which infects science and
academia which I can't go into here it's a very
deep topic I've touched on in the past and I'll
have separate episodes that go deep on that that's that's
a very deep issue but the problem is is that
every time I bring this up any time I bring
up the corruptions of science I'm always accused of being
anti science of course that's precisely how corruption maintains itself
the whistleblower or the reformer the one who's pointing out
the devilry will be the one who himself gets called
the devil because the devil that is being pointed out
needs to project the devilry back out you see in
order to deny as devilry which of course is survival
so the the funny irony is that those people who
accuse me of being anti science are actually just projecting
projecting that on me see I'm I'm very Pro science
I want to remove all the corruptions of science so
that science can be in its full glorious form right
now what we call science in the 21st century this
is really barbarism this is like the equivalent of bloodletting
with leeches that used to exist existent in the medical
field you know a thousand years to come in the
medieval times so you know this is our science is
extremely crude in its understanding and thinking about reality and
so one of my missions is to help to correct
out about science but of course I understand this is
it this is a very tricky mission because see scientists
are such a clever [ __ ] Bunch as soon
as you start to question various metaphysical and epistemic foundations
of science they get all clever on you and they
start to play the skeptic and they start to say
all about where's your proof and where's this and where's
that were your studies were your double-blind placebo-controlled and all
this [ __ ] you know again all that [
__ ] they were programmed with what they were learning
what science was that is the corruption that needs to
be cured that which has never been questioned it's the
very epistemic foundations of science that were never questioned and
always taken for granted by the scientists that's what needs
to be questioned but when it's questioned of course because
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy effect because they're stuck in that
paradigm either they have to admit that their paradigm is
wrong or they have to attack me so of course
they're going to attack the messenger and this is this
is a this is a classic problem with corruption not
of course just science let's broaden this out now to
include all the different domains of life it's well known
throughout history especially in politics and in government that people
who call out corruption get demonized and often killed why
is that you would think if you were thinking about
this naively you would say well but but if for
example if some American in the military let's say a
soldier who is you know responsible for some war that
America is gonna wait overseas in the Middle East if
this soldier comes forward because he sees some corruption in
the military in his squad and he sees that people
there that they're raping and abusing others and maybe that
they're killing prisoners they shouldn't be killing that they're doing
torture and whatever other despicable and illegal things if he
comes forward and reveals that you would think like well
the military would love him for that he should get
rewarded for that because he's helping the military to improve
itself by pointing out the bad parts of it but
of course what actually happens exactly the opposite the military
hates him for that he's considered a traitor he's demonized
he's tarred and feathered he's court-martialed he's put on trial
he's put in jail maybe he's been killed you know
today in today's age we don't kill that many people
through the legal system but but you know in old
times 500 years ago for that kind of thing you
just be shot in the head or even worse not
only would you be giving a quick death you would
actually be tortured for that you know the Spanish Inquisition
what was that about that was about rooting out heretics
those those so-called heretics what were they they weren't just
bad-mouthing religion because they hated Christianity no oftentimes they were
reformers they were people who were pointing out hey you
know this part of your churches you guys are taking
money that you shouldn't be taking and oftentimes the people
who were called heretics were actually Christians it's not like
there were some evil atheists they were often more Christian
than the ones who they were criticizing and the ones
who were calling them heretics in fact that is the
whole point of the Inquisition see the Inquisition presents itself
as though it's rooting out the corruption in the Catholic
Church that's from the inquisitors point of view the point
of view of those in power of the church but
then the one that that the Inquisition is focused against
he could also be a good Christian he could be
a better Christian and he could be pointing out the
corruptions of those bishops and Cardinals and Pope's and whoever
else is in charge he could be saying things like
you know like what Martin Luther was saying like you
guys are so corrupt you're taking money religion has become
all about you know going to church and giving donations
and receiving favors and it's like the connection to God
and to Christ has been lost by all this materialism
and of course for this you know you will easily
get tortured for this kind of stuff you know maybe
not today but that's how it wasn't past and you
find this all across the board this is just a
problem with the Catholic Church this is a problem and
of course the Catholic Church has this problem even today
for example with the the pedophilia problem that they have
they're notorious at hiding it you would think like why
wouldn't the higher-ups in the Catholic Church want to shine
light on the problem and expose all the you know
all the corrupt pedophile priests and preachers in the church
because this would be good this would be a cleansing
of the church then the Catholic Church maybe could regain
his good name but of course that's precisely what they
don't want because they would then have to accept that
this beautiful church that they have identified with that they
think is all good and they think it is some
divine you know vehicle for God amongst mortals they will
have to admit that this was actually a tool of
the devil how are you gonna admit imagine imagine that
you grew up since a little child your whole life
you've been taught about the importance of Christ and spreading
Christ's word and doing good thing and doing good works
and being loving like Christ and doing all of this
and that you're part of this institution the Catholic Church
which is which is so good and it's doing such
good things around the world and you know it's got
billions of people and all this and imagine spending 30
years in that ideology and then having to admit that
actually what that leads to is some serious devilry that
would be enormous ly emotionally painful for you it would
not be part of your survival agenda to admit that
you see and if you don't understand all these complicated
and sneaky dynamics that I'm talking about because you know
the Catholic Church doesn't really teach you how your mind
works in fact they just brainwash you some more and
and so what how are you gonna figure this out
you're completely lost inside your own mind you're so identified
with the church you're gonna want to defend that church
and in this way the devil co-opts all religions but
of course not just religions science academia the education system
the media the news the entertainment system the government the
military business yeah if you are a whistleblower in a
business what's gonna happen to you they won't torture you
they probably won't kill you at least not nowadays but
they will fire you they will make it difficult for
you to get a job in the industry that's pretty
damn sure whistleblowers and reformers are treated as the enemy
from the point of view of those against whom their
whistleblowing why because the people that the whistleblowers are whistleblowing
against are already corrupt for them to be corrupt means
they had to be extremely selfish to begin with which
means they had to be extremely softt biased which means
their mind had to distort reality which means that now
when that highly self bias self deceived distorted mind looks
at the whistleblower what it sees in the whistleblower is
not somebody who's doing good by reforming the system it
sees a devil that is the very projection of the
devil who did the corruption on to the angel who's
pointing out the devilry see how twisted this gets a
corrupt mind will project its own corruption onto those who
seek to clean up the corruption so if I stand
up and I start to point out all the legitimate
limitations and problems with the paradigm of science for example
I will be denounced and demonized and attacked by the
most reputable scientists of course it must work this way
because if they were conscious enough not to do this
not to protect I mean they would already be conscious
enough to realize those things that I'm trying to point
out the reason I need to point them out is
precisely because the people I'm pointing them out to can't
see it it's a problem can't see it can't see
it can't see it that's what the whole awareness in
consciousness-raising is all about it's helping you to see things
you couldn't have otherwise seen a devil hates it when
his devilry is called out by its name because what
a devil needs to do in order to be an
effective devil is he needs to act like what he's
doing is not devilry but that it's good and so
he convinces himself and he convinces everyone around them he
creates an ideology or collectively we come together as humans
we create an ideology that hey what we're doing is
good like if you go inside the corporate culture of
ExxonMobil what is their attitude towards global warming inside the
the the upper management of ExxonMobil they've created over the
last 50 years in order to survive as a company
because they couldn't exist unless they did this they had
to create an ideology a collective corporate culture had to
be created specifically tailored to the needs of ExxonMobil which
explains away the greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution all
this and the oil spills and how this is destroying
it explains all that away as ah well there's they
have a whole list of of explanations these have been
so ingrained or so absorbed let's say it's better word
these this ideology has been so absorbed by the people
who work in that organization that it's not even recognized
by them it's not that they sit sat down one
day you know some evil CEO sat down and he
said okay here's a bullet pointed a list of all
the things that we're gonna say in order to to
trick ourselves into believing that that we're not hurting the
environment and other human beings he never sat down and
said that his mind did it for him automatically this
is just what it means to be a human this
is what it means to survive if your mind didn't
do this you'd be dead a long time ago all
right so you're really good at doing this you're so
good at doing this you don't know you're doing it
such that the CEO of ExxonMobil could be sitting here
listening to this episode right now I could be speaking
directly to you and I could be explaining all of
this and you could be sitting there nodding your head
and agreeing with all of it you can say yes
yes yes Leo I want a reform Society there's so
much corruption in the world all this but you will
still not admit your own corruption and the role that
you play you will just skip over that conveniently your
mind will just excuse it away even though I could
call you out by name your mind will still skip
over this part the last five minutes I've been talking
you're mine we'll just erase all that and you will
just agree with everything else I said and keep doing
the devilry you've been doing because that's what you need
to do in order to keep working in that company
because if you really understood what I'm talking about here
and you really understood the role that you play there
you'd have to quit how would you feed your kids
after that how would you live with yourself see very
tricky stuff here's the key insight for you trying to
defend against corruption creates corruption this is very counterintuitive and
this is one of the cleverest tricks of the devil
plays see the devil is all about trickery it's trickery
within trickery within trickery see you unravel one trick and
you think you're done but actually that trick was wrapped
inside of another trick which is wrapped inside of a
third trick so you got to do a lot of
unravelling to really unravel the whole thing and of course
this is this is the illusion of a reality that
we're altima to unravel here but let's not get there
yet let's start with the simpler stuff so for example
trying to protect a religious doctrine a rigorous doctrine let's
say you're very Orthodox why are Orthodox people so Orthodox
it's under the pretense that they're being Orthodox because they
want to protect the purity of that original strain of
teaching so if you get us some Orthodox Jew and
you ask him why are you so serious and so
Orthodox about your Judaism inevitably what he's going to tell
you in one way or another is he's gonna give
you some sort of story how it all goes back
to the original source like Moses or I don't know
who he would cite the originator ham or whatever the
original source and that his orthodoxy somehow he's good he's
gonna he's gonna trace his lineage back to Moses to
Abraham to Adam and he whatever and he's gonna say
we'll see I'm I'm so Orthodox and so strict with
my religious doctrines I follow the rules so religiously I
you know I pray exactly how I need to pray
I do exactly what the book says I need to
do I go and observe all the holidays that I
need to observe and all this I'm super Orthodox because
I don't want my religion to get corrupted but you
see that itself is already the corruption because what you're
doing is you're practicing spirituality in a formalized mechanical manner
through conformity you didn't actually derive and develop any of
these rituals or holidays or prayer techniques you didn't create
them where do they come from you blindly accepted them
through indoctrination in your upbringing that's the truth of it
if you're honest it takes a lot of honesty just
to into that what I just said there and so
you're highly partial to them and so part of the
conformity and the ideology that you have is that your
ideology is not an ideology but that is it's actually
going back to some deep original truth and that by
being strict and mechanical and how you observe these these
principles and rituals and so forth following the Ten Commandments
and all that that that by doing this you're being
somehow spiritual but you're not you're being the opposite spiritual
you're being a devil you think you're preventing corruption of
your religion by observing these things rigorously no these very
things that you're accepting now through conformity all these rituals
and in rules and Commandments of worth these are already
highly corrupt these have been corrupted by the devil thousands
of years ago but see the devil loves nothing more
than a conformist mind because what the devil can do
then is he can just he can just write a
new rule and then justified as being somehow linked to
the original chain going back to the source and then
he knows that you will just conform to it and
you'll just do it mechanically and blindly and there the
devil wins so this is the case not in Judaism
only but in Islam and Christianity and Buddhism and elsewhere
even in yoga like I was arguing with who I
already said this story once but this story is pertinent
to this this episode even more so I was arguing
with with one guy on my forum about Sadhguru stitching's
and he was telling me how he's a loyal follower
of Sadhguru you know Sadhguru his is his guru the
YouTube guru and I mean soccer is great I don't
have any problems with him per se but he was
telling me about how well well you know Sadhguru system
is the perfect system it's never gonna get corrupted because
he's so enlightened and he's so conscious and he makes
all of his students memorize his teachings and teach them
word for word to other students and in this way
it ensures that the teachings will stay pure for a
thousand years no no this very process is the thing
that makes it corrupt it's gonna turn into another religion
which is going to turn into all sorts of abuses
and and devilry because the key that distinguishes consciousness from
devilry is that consciousness is not mechanical consciousness is independent
consciousness is its own authority consciousness is not looking to
some external authority figure conscious recognizes that the only authority
figure is oneself because of course your God here you
are the ultimate authority check out my episode how authority
works which which really will mind [ __ ] you
about about that point there I won't go into it
further here so so yeah anytime you're looking for an
external authority figure to tell you how to practice your
religion you already gone wrong you've already corrupted it same
thing with scientists a lot of people who fancy themselves
scientifically minded defenders of rationality and so forth they they
get very rigorous and strict with their rationality so much
so that their mind actually constricts and distorts reality well
it doesn't occur to them is that by becoming more
rigorous and strict with your science actually your science misses
out on too much you see science is like a
filter almost like an anti-virus you might say and science
wrecks this firewall against false beliefs and false theories and
doctrines getting incorporating the science there's a very strong firewall
within science but of course you know how that works
in practice with your computer when you erect a really
strong firewall on your computer it doesn't let you install
a lot of good stuff stuff that's important for you
to install in fact most antivirus software gives you so
many false positives or false negatives whatever they're called is
that you spend more time fighting with the the firewall
on your virus and on your antivirus then you ever
get viruses viruses are rare compared to the problems you
get by installing an anti-virus which then doesn't let you
install all the software and all the other stuff that
is good there's no problem with it that you need
to install but it is how you do it see
this is the problem with science when you get very
rigorous and very rational you get so rashly you forget
that rationality is a tiny subset of reality and and
this so this is one commonality and interesting commonality between
the way religions try to protect against corruption and how
science tries to protect against corruption but how in the
very act of trying to protect against corruption they actually
create the very corruption that they were hoping to avoid
and so in this way of course it's completely obvious
that sadguru's teachings will be corrupted as of all religions
been in science and institutions and all this see because
you're not thinking independently it's a game of telephone that
you're playing where one generation of people tells another generation
of people what to believe and you just believe it
but in every subsequent generation you're making a copy of
a copy of a copy of a copy of a
copy a telephone game and every step it gets corrupted
a little bit a little bit a little bit a
little bit until a thousand years pass and then what
you have is you have the Spanish Inquisition or you
have the you know the pedophile priests of today or
you have some government corruption or you have some legal
system corruption or whatever corruption cannot be prevented mechanically corruption
is mechanical miss mechanical misses lack of consciousness corruption is
lack of consciousness if you want to solve corruption that
requires consciousness which means you can't follow any simple formula
you have to think for yourself Maya is another name
for the force that creates corruption Maya is the intelligent
deceptive force of nature or what we call the devil
what I call the devil ego co-opts universal intelligence for
personal gain what you're actually doing as an ego self
as a human is that you're tapping into God's infinite
intelligence to be able to live your life to do
science to do religion to rationalize to think to imagine
things you're tapping into infinite intelligence but you're tapping to
such a tiny portion of it and you're twisting and
distorting it based on your fears and your limited conceptions
of reality because your perspective is so limited in myopic
you see so little of it that you're actually being
very very stupid and unintelligent but you think you're being
intelligent of course it's relative you're intelligent relative to an
ant but you're very unintelligent relative to universal intelligence relative
to God so you're somewhere in the middle they're probably
closer to the bottom and mentors at top and so
the more conscious you become the more fear you let
go the more your sense of self expands the more
you tap into universal intelligence and you do so less
for personal gain and more for the dissemination of consciousness
and love and my claim is is that if you
were infinitely intelligent you would only use your intelligence for
spreading love and nothing else not for personal gain not
for any selfishness but of course most people have no
idea what that even means they have no idea what
infinite intelligence is for that you'll check out my episode
what is intelligence where I explain that so corruption creates
more corruption corruption makes corruption easier once an institution has
been corrupted that institution that infects very easily other minds
so one of the key tricks the devil uses is
the trick of corrupting the highest most credible institutions so
if the devil can corrupt the institution of science if
the devil can corrupt Harvard and Princeton and Yale and
MIT that's where what he wants to corrupt if the
devil wants to corrupt Christianity and Buddhism that's that's perfect
that's the perfect target for for the devil if the
devil wants to corrupt holy man a priest perfect perfect
because see nobody suspects that a priest would be corrupt
nobody suspects that a priest would be bold enough to
molest a child nobody suspects that a priest who preaches
about the evils of homosexuality would himself be a homosexual
or have homosexual desires of course nobody would suspect that
the scientist with five Nobel Prizes well I don't think
such scientists exist but they're lucky to get one a
scientist will even one Nobel Prize and a bunch of
other credentials nobody suspects nobody questions that whether they understand
reality so that's perfect the devil will spread deception through
that scientists through authority figures because they are it can
disseminate downwards very easily and it has enormous scale you
see you only need to corrupt a few top key
officials in the government or in a church or in
a spiritual group or in a scientific field to then
corrupt millions of people down below because it's the trickle-down
effect here it's actually real the trickle-down theory of corruption
actually works it's like a virus so you see the
devil is not stupid the devil is harnessing universal intelligence
for the purpose of spreading corruption of spreading selfishness because
the devil needs to create an environment of corruption around
himself the devil can't survive in a sterile environment of
light and love the devil needs an environment of of
selfishness of fear-mongering of anger and bitterness and and low
consciousness so he needs to create that environment so not
only is he miserable he needs to make everyone around
him miserable to do this the rule of thumb is
is that those who make a big show of fighting
corruption outwardly are actually likely to be very corrupt themselves
inwardly their show that they're putting on is a front
that's how the devil works the devil creates fronts and
facades and masks and all this this is how trickery
works so the trap here is fighting corruption outwardly instead
you need even much more concern about fighting corruption inwardly
this is the difference I've talked about in the past
of the the lesser jihad versus the greater jihad the
greater jihad is the inner journey towards conquering one's own
corruption and egotism the lesser jihad is fighting out there
against one's enemies the infidels who you think are corrupt
so this is again you know speaking of religions you
know Islam has become very corrupt over the last thousand
and a half years precisely because it's so conformist in
the way that people learn that religion and it's gotten
so twisted up that the greater jihad has been replaced
by the lesser jihad of fighting infidels in the world
somewhere you know fighting Westerners from the Middle Eastern perspective
this is not what Islam is about what Islam is
about is the inner journey of curing your own devilry
that's what Islam is about surrendering literally Islamist means surrender
to surrender one's own devilry and look what is turned
into for most people exactly the opposite see so I'm
not picking on any one institution or group I'm trying
to be fair how to try to you know be
an equal opportunity offender here offend everybody the scientists and
the religious people everybody's offended now and everybody hates me
for pointing all this out of course which is why
it's rarely pointed out because the people who point it
out do it at great consequence of themselves so why
should they risk their own neck to point this stuff
out and you don't want to hear it see so
why should I be telling you all of this against
your own will if you aren't interested in identifying and
removing your own corruption why should I be more interested
in your corruption than you are you see how backwards
that is see it's the scientists who should be more
worried about the errors of science than I am and
yet they're not it's the military people who should be
more worried about the evils of what the military is
doing then its citizens are but of course they don't
it's the politicians who've you should be most worried about
corruption but of course there's at least worried about it
everything is his opposite everything is upside down in the
world of the devil integrity is key for dealing with
corruption except there's a problem the devil plays a trick
here too there's a very big difference between actual integrity
and integrity as a show as a front or as
an ideology for example many religious people Christians especially put
up the front of having high integrity but actually it's
totally just ideology its words it's sweet words when what
really matters is your level of consciousness and development it
doesn't matter what your ideals are you can have the
highest ideals about being the most godly person you can
believe in Christ and the teachings of the Buddha or
whatever else and none of that matters because what dictates
how you actually show up in the world and whether
you're gonna be corrupt or not is do you have
enough consciousness is your consciousness high enough are you at
a certain high level of cognitive and moral development if
you're not it doesn't matter what you believe in fact
the more you believe that you're doing good the more
of a devil you'll become this is why priests and
religions become so corrupt because it just becomes a philosophy
empty words ideas nice theories about you know turning the
other cheek and all that and helping the poor but
then in practice do do modern evangelicals help the [
__ ] poor they don't give a [ __ ]
about the poor politically speaking because they vote for right-wing
conservatives don't give a [ __ ] about the poor
who would cut welfare programs like that if there wasn't
a popular uprising against it really if the evangelicals weren't
corrupt they would be the most liberal and the most
Democrat voters and of course do evangelicals want to hear
that do they want to admit that of course not
they will deny this till the day they die what
I just said they will accuse me of being a
partisan hack of hating the Republicans of being unfair of
being biased they will project all that onto me just
to deny what I said there because religion conformist organized
religion loves to project that image of purity that is
a front to keep them from actually questioning the conformity
of their mind and raising their level of cognitive development
and really purifying the devil from within themselves see that's
that's how the devil operates he cloaks himself in the
image of God but it's just an image it's an
illusion it ain't the real deal there's a big difference
between talking about God and being conscious of what that
difference is lost not only on religious people but also
on scientific atheistic materialistic people too they both make a
dangerous conflation of those to corruption operates on untruth manipulation
lack of spiritual connection lack of love lack of perspective
righteousness denial projection fear and attachment materialism lower chakra drives
for higher power for sex money laziness gluttony cronyism the
more you run by your lower chakras and water up
your which brings us to another important point which is
what is the relationship between Spile dynamics and corruption the
lower your stage on the spiral by the way if
you don't know what that means spiral dynamics check out
my multi-part series on Sparrow the minute the lower your
smile stage the more corrupt you are that's the rule
of thumb why is this so because these stages correspond
to levels of consciousness and moral and cognitive development values
development and the higher one goes up these stages the
larger one sense of self the lower one is on
these stages the lower ones the the more limited and
more contracted one sense itself so a person with a
very contracted limited sense of self cannot be conscious of
their self biases and so of course they're going to
be corrupt and they're gonna be very conformist in their
thinking they're gonna be very very ideological and this ideology
is one of the primary vectors for devilry it's really
when you get to tier 2 stages yellow and turquoise
that corruption gets eliminated I mean it could still exist
in corners and pockets but you really need to get
to tier 2 because remember tier 1 it's probably named
str1 which is stages blue orange green and yeah those
three and some even lower ones that is tier 1
and tier 1 is all about meeting your basic survival
needs and tier 2 that shift from green to yellow
and above that's when you're going beyond survival needs and
you're you're getting to being needs what Maslow Abraham Maslow
called being needs and it's only there that you're detached
enough from your identity and from your own ideologies and
from your own self deceptions and thinking and distorted perspectives
of the world and from your own personal needs for
love and gratification and money and all that you're detached
enough to see your own self and your own worldview
objectively and therefore you're able to eradicate your own corruption
it's still difficult but you're able to do it or
as really in tier 1 you're not able to do
it you're too self-involved you're too scared and too worried
about your own personal agenda to care about eliminating your
own corruption but you will make a show of demonizing
other corrupt people you will do that that's a very
convenient red herring because every time you're you're judging other
politicians on TV for being corrupt that's that's a very
good distraction from ever discovering your own corruptions that's the
lesser jihad the biggest obstacle for third world so-called third
world and underdeveloped countries like in Africa and South America
parts of Asia and so forth Russia Eastern Europe their
biggest obstacle is corruption those countries could be so much
better if only everybody was willing to cooperate and not
act like a selfish barbaric animal and manipulate the whole
system to their own advantage damn the collateral damage but
of course they can't do that precisely because they're so
stuck on survival it's a dog-eat-dog world they're in these
third-world countries there's limited resources to go around it's a
real problem it's not a fake problem in certain countries
that I was talking about you know in Africa and
elsewhere in South America they literally don't have enough food
for the children so of course it's gonna be a
dog-eat-dog situation and it's gonna be extremely corrupt because your
life depends on it that's my point I'm not saying
corruption is some frivolous thing that you can just easily
wish away I'm saying that the reason corruption has existed
for 10,000 years and will probably consist continue to exist
for another 10,000 years at least in human societies is
because of how deeply wedded this is to your life
we're talking about life and death here and the ideas
and ideologies you hold are directly related to your ability
to live and to meet your basic needs like food
shelter sex love approval companionship friendship all that stuff that
a human needs or thinks he needs that's what corruption
is serving so in these third-world countries vested interests are
resisting development slowing down the process slowing down the process
of expanding love and consciousness but they can't stop it
entirely because the devil always loses in the long run
the devil could only slow down the process so that's
what's happening slowly these countries are becoming less and less
corrupt but it takes generations for this to be noticeable
and of course just because I'm explicitly pointing out third-world
countries here I'm not by any means saying that first
world countries like America or in Europe are not corrupt
we we have plenty of corruption I'll get to that
in a minute there's actually I've posted on my blog
in the past a corruption index there's websites that actually
rank a nonprofit nonpartisan website that will rank the corruption
of every single country in the world and they track
this over decades they track what is happening it's it's
an score from zero to a hundred zero means totally
corrupt you could barely live there a hundred means totally
pure no corruption at all this includes the court systems
the political system the police the military all this so
they rank this and you see this map it's a
really illuminating map because this corruption index is one of
the most important indices to track for a nation's development
and growth not the GDP corruption index because this corruption
index directly correlates to the collective consciousness of that society
what you see is that countries that are below 50
these are not countries you want to live these are
very problematic countries with a lot of violence a lot
of selfishness it's hard to do spirituality there these countries
are extremely dogmatic very conformist they all by to some
form of nationalism or some religion these are devil countries
you might say of course a lot of countries in
the Middle East a lot of countries in Africa are
at this level countries in South America and in parts
of Asia and Eastern Europe as well and then you
have countries that are above 50 those are tend to
be clustered in in Europe some of the highest countries
are in northern Europe to Scandinavian countries of course America
Canada are pretty good Mexico is pretty bad from what
I'm just I'm recalling this rememory Japan is pretty good
yeah you can go find out on my blog maybe
I'll link to it again that's a illuminating map and
that that map basically tells you the level of consciousness
of of every country in the world and you know
one of these I'll surprise you is America is not
the top on that list which shows you we have
more more work to do this is really what politics
is about you know in my series on conscious politics
that four part series long as hell this is one
of the core pillars of what conscious politics is it's
the the raising of the consciousness and the identity of
a collective society to redo or to raise the consciousness
index or I mean the corruption index to get it
closer to a hundred so that there's little corruption in
very corrupt countries that are under 50 on this index
it's hard to do any self actualization work there it's
hard to grow it's hard to start a business because
these countries are so corrupt to start a business you
already need to pay thousands of dollars in bribes otherwise
they won't even let you start a business or they'll
extort you you could start a business but then you
know some some mafia guy will come to you and
you'll say hey that's a mighty fine business you got
there looks like you're earning $5,000 a month you know
it would be a shame if something happened to your
business why don't you pay me two thousand dollars a
month and I'll let you keep the other three otherwise
I'll holla I know where your mother lives and I
got a baseball bat see that's that's how business is
conducted in in most of the world actually most of
the world is it's amazing because if you grew up
in a first world country like America or in Europe
you're extremely lucky first of all be grateful for how
lucky you are but also you have no idea what
it's like to live in a in a third world
country um like no idea what it's like to live
there to do business there see it's it's not yeah
you can travel sure you could travel to Africa you
could travel to South America you could be there for
a few weeks you know stay in a nice hotel
your money is worth a hundred times more than the
people who earn the money locally there so you can
afford to stay to nice hotel and eat nice restaurants
and it still feels very cheap to you and all
this and so you you only see the good sides
of those countries you don't see like the ghettos you
don't see the political corruption you don't see the court
system you don't see the police system unless you do
and if you do it can be quite a culture
shock that's one of the values of travel especially to
non touristy places around the world third-world kind underdeveloped countries
is that you get to see just how how radically
barbaric most of the world still is we're insulated from
it here in America to a large extent although of
course we have pockets of it here too we have
our own ghettos and inner cities and and and stuff
so I'm not discounting that but what man like you
can get really ugly in in some of these also
posted a video on my blog somebody actually linked it
on the forum and then I reposted on my blog
about Liberia oh man you want to see one of
the most corrupt countries in the world Liberia in Africa
[ __ ] the [ __ ] that goes on
there will make your skin crawl that's like you can't
even write that stuff that stuff is more horrific than
a horror movie that's real corruption go watch that to
really appreciate that and then and then contemplate how if
I was a political leader in Liberia how would I
help my country to evolve you see how how crippling
the the problem of corruption is it's this it's this
twisted catch-22 where the people are in such desperate straits
they're so desperate to survive they can barely they can
barely buy enough food to support their children [Music] they
they they don't have time to go to school they
don't have time to read books they can't afford a
book there's no bookstores they don't have internet they can't
watch actualised videos like um they're literally sucking [ __
] in a in a whorehouse for 12 hours a
day just to make ends meet they're sucking [ __
] that's their reality and now you try to think
okay how do I introduce some of these actualized concepts
that we talked about how do I introduce that to
a mother who works 12 hours in a horse house
sucking [ __ ] and then you see how difficult
it is and even if even if some some good
leader or politician stood up what would happen to him
he would be killed instantly selfishness kills selflessness but even
though that's true selflessness is still stronger because in the
end selflessness is actually immortal whereas selfishness is temporary and
permanent see one of the benefits of being God is
that you're totally formless it can't be killed you're so
selfless it doesn't matter to you if somebody kills you
and that's the whole point of spirituality the whole point
of spirituality and mysticism and religion ultimately if you want
to boil it down to its to its core kernel
is that you become so conscious and so selfless that
it doesn't matter to you if somebody killed you and
this makes you invincible and then from there you can
effect real change and if someone kills you like they
did with Gandhi or MLK you're okay with it that's
real power that's what inspires people to follow you that's
what pushes society forward that kind of leadership of course
that kind of leadership is very rare it can't be
faked this is the most honest of signals you can't
fake this kind of leadership you can only do this
kind of leadership if you're very very pure and selfless
not as an ideal but actually this is very hard
to pull off you would need to actualize all the
stuff that I talked about and even more to pull
this off no community can run without a deep understanding
of how corruption works this topic is crucial to any
kind of community building I don't care if you're a
politician or not it doesn't matter if you're not a
politician you might say Oh leo well you're just talking
about this for people who want to be politicians or
something or big corporate CEOs but I'm never gonna be
that so I don't need to know about this you
still need to know about this because first of all
you're a citizen of your country and you vote and
it's important that you be able to recognize what corruption
looks like versus what it doesn't people have problems that
that's number one number two is that you're still part
of various organizations at work and so forth even like
for example I'm no politician or anything but just in
the last four years that I've been running my forum
it's almost been four years since I started actualized the
actualized forum it's been a very interesting and educational experience
for me because I've had to deal with various community
dynamics that I don't usually deal with like organizing community
maintaining a community dealing with corrupt people because you know
we do get people in there who come in there
who are spammers or who want to promote some sort
of toxic racist ideology or whatever we're gonna kick them
out with but we have to be careful and how
we kick them out cuz if we're if we're too
aggressive about it then we accidentally you know get some
false positives and whatever and we we step on on
the toes of members who are not doing anything wrong
and then they get upset and all this so it's
very tricky it's the problem basically of policing how do
you police without being overbearing with your policing that's very
difficult to do and society has always dealt with this
problem unity has dealt with this problem since the dawn
of time and we're dealing with it today you know
China's dealing with it right now in Hong Kong they're
dealing with the problem of how do we police the
stuff in Hong Kong without being too vicious about it
but at the same time we can't just let rioters
run around you know vandalizing the city without any kind
of policing so that's an extremely difficult balance we see
the same kind of balance for example in social media
there's been a lot of corruption over the last few
years with political manipulation and there's kinds of ads on
Facebook and on YouTube and elsewhere online you know a
lot of proliferation of fake news and all sorts of
ideology devilry basically the devil is expanding into the digital
domain into the social media domain you know this is
this is a ripe new field for the devil the
devil has only known about social media for for maybe
five or ten years you know he's just catching on
he's kind of late to the party the devil has
learned how to use Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and
all this and so it's still fresh you know the
devil is still figuring out how to manipulate all this
stuff and so so yeah corruption is always expanding into
new fields and you know what we're seeing with these
social media companies like Facebook they're also dealing with this
issue how do they police Devils without being overbearing with
their policing same problem on YouTube you know how do
they eliminate the like the terrorist videos and other kinds
of bad content and here's kinds of right-wing ideologies and
white nationalist stuff and anti anti well I mean I
guess just homophobic stuff anti-gay stuff how do they police
this without being too draconian about it that's the extremely
difficult balance it both sides will criticize YouTube or Facebook
or whoever else or China both sides you know they
can't win that they're damned if they do and damned
if they don't if they over police they're criticized if
they under police they criticize that's very difficult to strike
that balance and I've felt that in running my forum
I've I've experienced that you know sometimes I've over policed
sometimes I've under policed and it's very tricky people don't
appreciate how that works this is what it means to
run a community or a society communities can involve billions
of people like in China or they can involve 10
people they could even involve just four people in your
family so this topic is extremely important this topic of
corruption is extremely important for leaders because almost by definition
if you're a leader you're gonna have some sort of
at least a little community that you're leading if not
a big one and the more of a leader you
become the more you're gonna have to deal with these
policing issues and with corruption your own corruption but then
others peer pressuring you into being corrupt yourself you see
the problem is that when you're Trump when you're a
high consciousness visionary leader and you're trying to lead others
out of their low consciousness and into love and into
truth you would think that this would be you know
easy but this is the hardest thing because the very
people you're trying to lead can't appreciate the pearls that
you're giving them and so what ends up happening is
that if the leader is too high above the rabble
of the mob to lead they they come for him
with pitchforks and they kill him see this is this
is the ultimate limiting bottleneck of the rate at which
a community or society can evolve it can only evolve
as fast as the masses the Sheep the conformist sheep
which comprised like 80 to 90 percent of the community
are willing to accept what the visionary leaders are disseminating
down and usually they can't accept too much they can
only accept maybe you know 20% above where they are
30% 50% after a leader becomes too conscious and too
loving and too good relative to the mass that he's
leading they will actually turn on him and kill him
or exile him or demonize him in some way basically
remove him from power because the things he's proposing to
them from their relativistic perspective seem like devilry when actually
it's the opposite what they've forgotten is actually oh it's
us who are the Devils see which is why the
most conscious politicians rarely get elected why is that because
the people who elect them themselves are not very conscious
and developed it's a it's a catch-22 vicious circle so
you need highly conscious and developed citizens to elect a
highly conscious leader because only they only a high consciousness
and developed mind can appreciate a high another high conscious
adult mind but you can't get that high consciousness leader
until you have high consciousness people and you can't get
high consciousness people until you have high consciousness leaders so
we're stuck we're not really stuck it does move but
it moves slowly it's got a certain internal molasses kind
of like internal resistance to it it flows like molasses
and so society evolves like molasses and that explains quite
a bit and of course none of this is taught
in school and you might wonder why and the answer
is because school is corrupt it's part of this whole
catch-22 the people who elect the school teachers principals the
school boards all that these are composed of ordinary citizens
ordinary citizens they're not self actualized enlightened people they're very
simple they're conformist they're very traditional so what they do
is they elect leaders who are like them the teachers
and principals who compose the school curriculum who are they
well they're they're the peers of the ones who elected
them if ever a principal or a school administrator somehow
gets into power who is way ahead of the curve
very conscious very enlightened very loving some sort of Jesus
like figure you might imagine if he ever gets elected
to the school board what will happen is that the
changes and reforms that he makes the critiques he makes
of the corruption of the school system will be so
bitter tasting to the people who elected him that they
will unelect him they will kick him out they will
demonize him and maybe even in Prior times they would
have killed him and of course they would accuse him
of corrupting the minds of the children which is exactly
what Socrates was accused of and put to trial in
to death for corrupting the minds of the youth of
Athens see that's classic projection right there another example of
classic projection of course is Donald Trump we can't end
this episode with thought without talking about him it should
be obvious to you I hope that Trump is the
most corrupt US president we've ever had this was obvious
before he even came into power which was the whole
point of opposing his coming into power and not voting
for it there was a whole brouhaha about how Hillary
Clinton was very corrupt the reality is that the people
who judge Hillary Clinton to be very corrupt have no
sense of proportion of corruption and these people do understand
the dynamics that I'm talking about here they're mostly stage
blue stage orange spotted Amex folks so they did again
they're just acting out of conformity and ideology and so
in that case of the critical the critical piece of
insight that was necessary in the 2016 election in the
US was that Donald Trump was more corrupt than Hillary
Clinton as corrupt as she was and I'm not saying
she wasn't corrupt Donald Trump was way more corrupt and
is way more corrupt and if this isn't obvious to
you then you're not you're not thinking objectively you need
to check yourself bias because clearly Trump is far less
conscious and more selfish and narcissistic than Hillary Clinton clearly
again if you can't see this you ain't you ain't
doing the work and so the irony of Trump of
course is that while he ran on the whole notion
of draining the swamp and railing against the corruption of
Hillary Clinton of course that was all projection Trump won
the election in a corrupt way and he himself has
been thoroughly corrupt his entire life and he runs his
whole administration based on corruption and cronyism starting with his
family his son-in-law his daughter his sons all that and
down to his friends and all the people he appoints
corruption now you might say well Leo that's it's it's
common for politicians to appoint their friends and so forth
to positions yes it's common but what we have now
is the worst it's ever been ever been this is
just blatant blatant corruption Trump is the king of corruption
that's the irony of it because he's he's the king
of Devil's sea because he's got such a massive ego
the bigger the ego the bigger the devil so in
this sense he's the top but of course he doesn't
recognize it his supporters don't recognize it because they're there
Devil's Due and all of this is totally predictable Trump's
devilry was totally predictable and obvious along before he came
into into office and of course is totally predictable that
all of his associates often get arrested or get embroiled
in various scandals and financial misdeeds how many of his
administration officials have resigned because of some sort of impropriety
'he's with misusing public funds for airplane travels and excessive
vacations and all the sorts of stuff i think ben
Carson bought bought himself like a $30,000 uh-hum bookshelf into
his office or some [ __ ] on using public
money it's like this kind of stuff it was completely
obvious that all the people who Trump would be surrounded
with in his administration would also be as corrupt as
him because uncorrupted people would never work for a corrupt
devil the people who are Trump's friends who want to
work with him are the most corrupt of the most
corrupt because anyone else has already resigned a long time
ago I mean this is this is a totally predictable
this is textbook stuff textbook stuff you could have predicted
this in 2015 because Trump has zero integrity and he
has zero moral development he's narcissistic he's opportunistic he's transactional
he's materialistic he's pragmatic he checks every box of what
you need to be corrupt he can't not be corrupt
if that his corruption is so deep that we don't
even know the tip of the iceberg we only see
the tip of the iceberg of his corruption like I'm
it's it's just it's so much worse than you think
we will spend the next decade discovering more and more
and more of trumps corruption even once he's kicked out
of office or whatever just more and more stuff will
be coming out and it's just gonna be shocking every
single time like people are just gonna be floored at
at how much corruption is totally discovered because it can't
stay hidden forever the devil plays in the shadows he
hides stuff Hugh's deception but deception never holds out forever
the truth always prevails in the end so it's a
game he can't win it's temporary and if you think
what I'm saying here is all partisan hackery you're missing
the point this goes way beyond partisanship corruption is not
a partisan point and you might wonder we'll leave why
are you being so political and so partisan all the
time I'm not it's just that you've to understand that
consciousness and philosophy has real-world consequences see if I was
sitting here in only teaching you about enlightenment and other
kinds of self actualized theory and all I taught you
was just theory with no real-world consequences then you would
accuse me of all Leo this T'Challa all philosophy doesn't
matter in the real world but then when I teach
you this stuff and I show you how it connects
with the real world I connect it with current events
I connect it with China I connect it with Hong
Kong I connect it with Trump I connect it with
with Hillary Clinton all this that we connect at all
then when you see the actual consequences of what consciousness
and love means then you say oh no no Leo
here being a devil and you're being corrupt and you're
just you're projecting your own biases why are you being
so political all of a sudden you see you want
it both ways I get criticized from both sides because
consciousness is not neutral when you're conscious you have a
low tolerance from [ __ ] and for deception and
for lies and when you see a society which is
completely entrenched with in entrenched in in self-deception whether it's
within science or within religion or within economics with capitalism
for example or within the news or within government business
media marketing when you see all this devilry around you
you want to speak up against it this is what
consciousness compels you to do see and spiritual teachers and
leaders have done this since the beginning of time Christ
Buddha others they've all spoken out against corruption Martin Luther
started the Protestant Reformation what was that Galileo he spoke
out against the corruptions of the Catholic Church what was
that gr gr da no Bruno was burned at the
stake for for preaching mysticism against the Catholic Church even
though he was a Catholic monk you know this is
a story that goes back to the beginning of civilization
you can go back to ancient Egypt ten thousand years
ago and they were executing people for pointing out the
corruptions of the Pharaoh or whatever in fact I think
to time kamon I think King Tut he died very
young they did some like autopsies on his skull and
so forth on his body and mummy I think he
died when he was still a teenager maybe it was
a disease but also I think there's a theory that
it could have been that people didn't like his father
because he was he was very radical actually he was
actually a reformer he he made some significant changes like
the reforms that that his father made his father was
a Pharaoh Akhenaten was his name and he changed the
religion from a polytheistic one he tried to change Egypt
to turn it into a monotheistic religion that worshipped the
Sun or the Otton there's some theories that maybe he
was deeply enlightened or whatever and the the old guard
the old Egyptians they didn't like this apparently so they
actually once King Tut was killed and kicked out of
power their whole family thing was kicked out of power
basically in some devilish way and then they erased all
of their that the the Otton family's imagery on all
the stones as if they erased all of it like
all all mention of the Otton Zand king taught were
all erased from Egyptian history back then sort about whitewashing
because they wanted to go back to the old the
old polytheistic system that's what happens when you try to
teach someone awakening see it's as old as time so
the painful truth that Americans need to understand is that
Democrats right now and Republicans are not equally corrupt one
party is more corrupt than another and it's pretty clear
which one that is if you're following the news and
all of this of course will go down in history
in the history books so which side of history are
you gonna be on are you gonna be the one
who equivocates and draws false equivalence between those who are
corrupt and those who are trying to uproot the corruption
or are you going to participate in clearing up the
corruption or are you gonna deepen the corruption by calling
me a partisan for pointing out the obvious corruption that
is happening right now with the Conservatives and the Republicans
and with the Trump see it really is the case
that higher stages of the spiral on small dynamics are
objectively less corrupt because they're less egotistical and liberals are
higher on the spiral than conservatives and this is so
unpalatable to conservatives to admit this now of course it's
a gross generality there can be individual exceptions to this
rule but right now if we're talking about American politics
as an example it should be obvious to you that
conservatives are objectively less cognitively developed than liberals and if
you're conservative I'm sorry you don't want to hear that
but it is what it is it's on you to
figure that out you got to check yourself biases wise
government corruption so common because government is a giant pool
of money billions of money billions of dollars of money
and also the ability to print billions of dollars of
more money so it's a desig ient pool of money
that one can leech off of and be a parasite
upon but the biggest source of corruption is not what
many conservatives think it's not the welfare state it's not
poor people it's not immigrants who are abusing the system
it's the powerful and the wealthy who are the most
corrupt and who abuse and mapley the system the most
by definition you need power to manipulate the system some
illegal immigrant is not going to manipulate the system it's
the big honchos who are manipulating system for billions of
dollars and that's what trump is distracting you with while
trump is distracting you with illegal illegal immigrants and other
things like that gay marriage and whatever else you know
conservatives are concerned with the bigger parasites are leeching billions
and even trillions from the system these are corporate parasites
who leech billions through lobbying deregulation cutting the size of
government reducing oversight committees and lack setting laws blacks ending
environmental regulations getting favorable cushy government contracts getting subsidies you
know military spending pork projects this this is the true
corruption everything else is distraction this is what needs to
be routed out and as much as third-world countries struggle
with corruption right now America is struggling greatly with corruption
the reason that Trump got elected in the first place
is because of corruption the system is corrupted and the
reason is corrupted is because we have so much legalized
bribery in America and this is a situation that needs
to be corrected you might wonder but Leo doesn't government
corruption that you're admitting to here doesn't have me we
need a smaller government not a bigger one and the
answer is absolutely not government corruption is mostly done by
large corporation large players with a lot of power that
push around the government if anything they're means to be
bigger it needs to be bigger because the entities it
governs must be smaller than it if the entity it
governs becomes larger than the government then the entity now
becomes the government and the government becomes the governed it
turns upside down see a big government is important because
it needs to be the umbrella which unifies all the
other smaller subsets of society and makes them work holistically
collectively peacefully together towards a common good and if this
umbrella gets too weak and too small then the little
individual elements they will break free and they will corrupt
it try to take over it do a hostile takeover
that's basically what Trump has been doing the government see
and that's what a lot of corporations are doing when
you have some giant corporation like Facebook or Apple or
Microsoft or Google or Amazon which has a net worth
of half trillion dollars or something like that these are
extremely powerful a corporation like this could actually secretly develop
nuclear weapons if it wanted it has enough resources to
do that it could it could secretly create an army
of its own and take over the government in theory
I don't think they're actually doing that but they could
if they get too powerful and too ambitious and too
greedy see what the problem will be that these organization
know if if Amazon creates nuclear weapons and an army
and takes over the US government by force you see
the problem the problem is is that you have no
voting power in Amazon Amazon is effectively a dictatorship or
at the very least an oligarchy it's only the people
who own the shares the most shares you know unless
you have a million stocks of em of Amazon you
don't have any any say or control over Amazon and
how many people have a million stocks in Amazon probably
a handful so they're gonna be the ones who rule
everybody else and no one's gonna know what else isn't
going to get a vote we've already been there that's
that's like the medieval times that we came out of
that's what society was like back in the in the
time of the Roman Empire with Emperor's and oligarchs controlling
everything see and then we evolved to a democracy but
now what's happening is that our democracy is devolving back
into that old-style oligarchy through the corruption so we need
a bigger government but it's not just about a bigger
government for a bigger government sake it's also about a
better government the quality is actually more important than the
size so government needs to be cleaned up and the
only people who are gonna be able to clean it
up or who are themselves clean so don't be listening
to some fool demagogues like Trump who comes along and
says that he's gonna drain the [ __ ] swamp
he has no interest in draining the swamp he is
the [ __ ] swamp monster from the Black Lagoon
he's not gonna drain no swamp even if he wanted
to drain the swamp he do it he doesn't have
the moral cognitive or spiritual level of consciousness necessary to
achieve that which is what you see every day on
the news how he isn't able to achieve it he
just he's digging his own grave slowly see every generation
must do its job in fighting corruption this is how
society is what it is today no matter where you
live in the world if you think you live in
a bad country or a bad situation I guarantee you
it was ten times worse a thousand years ago and
ten times even worse than that two thousand years ago
and the reason you live in a relatively decent and
stable society today where you can go to the grocery
store without getting shanked in the kidneys by some crazy
person with a knife the reason that doesn't happen very
often where you live is because of all the blood
and tears and sweat that were expended to fight corruption
in your society society doesn't get this way the way
it is today in the 21st century it doesn't get
this way automatically we had to grow ourselves we had
to literally turn ourselves into a totally different type of
human to be able to create and sustain this current
society and we're gonna have to keep doing that we're
not done the US government like I was saying is
very corrupt currently in terms of how much money goes
into politics how corporations are influencing and lobbying government with
legalized bribery and political contributions and it's your duty as
a citizen if you're conscious it isn't to stand up
and speak out against this corruption because this corruption is
preventing us from being able to elevate the consciousness and
love of everyone around us which is the point of
life what we need is a constitutional amendment to end
money in politics and we need total public financing of
Elections it should be illegal for a corporation to contribute
money to to a super PAC or to have dark
money all of this needs to be publicly funded because
this is corrupting the very notion of one-person one-vote right
now the people who elect the politicians are not the
little people it's not one person one vote it's the
people who have billions of dollars who are able to
run ads and these ads of course are one of
the embodiments one of the epitome of devilry these ads
are always self biased and they're never concerned about truth
or consciousness or love but purely winning for the sake
of winning so towards this end I have something very
practical for you which is there's an organization called Wolf
Pack it's a it's a nonprofit organization it's a PAC
that was started to get money out of politics by
passing a constitutional amendment if you live in the United
States I recommend you make a donation go - wolf
- PAC without a cage just PA see wolf dash
pack.com and there's a donate button there where you can
go and make a donation even something as small as
five dollars as helpful today before I started this episode
I donated a thousand dollars so here's the receipt you
can take a look I'll post it for you on
this video I'll post the link to wolf pack calm
down below you can click on it make a small
contribution I think this is one of the most important
causes politically speaking that we can that we can tackle
right now it's a non political group this is not
designed to help the Democrats or the Republicans we're just
interested here with this initiative of passing a constitutional amendment
and to ban private money in our elections if you're
not an American you're watching from somewhere else well find
some other way to participate in the reducing of corruption
in your local community or country it doesn't necessarily have
to be through this site I'm just putting this website
out to you and I'm not really affiliated with them
in any way I'm just passionate about what they're promoting
and I wanted to give it some some views and
some free publicity first of all because this this episode
ties in with it so nicely and because it's such
a hot topic right now but also because I wanted
to show you how the theory that I talked about
it's not just theory that's what's different about actualized org
from philosophy that you get in some philosophy [ __
] class you know philosophy 101 in your university in
your university class they just talk about old dead philosophers
and it's just all it's completely disconnected from reality but
here we're connecting at all we're connecting the politics we're
connecting your personal growth we're contact connecting enlightenment were all
these advanced complex things and then we're connecting in the
room we're showing you how it all drills down to
just the nitty-gritty of going to a website and donating
five dollars and that's how you make change see you
need to be able to go up and down this
chain of big picture to little minutiae that you need
to master this process of going up and down don't
get lost in getting stuck into my new show and
not seeing the big picture or just being an airy-fairy
land talking about big picture ideals and ideas about awakening
but then not doing any work on any practices you
need both to be successful that's one of the most
important things I can teach you is is that so
start to connect the dots start to connect the theory
with the practice the first step is to admit that
you are corrupt so as a homework assignment I want
you to start to notice your own corruptions what do
I mean by this I mean little things like fudging
the numbers on your taxes every year manipulating your spouse
to get what you want out of her or him
torrenting downloading illegal copyrighted material stealing office supplies exploiting a
situation to get sex favoring your crony friends maybe at
work you put a recommendation for your friend who maybe
isn't quite qualified for the new job that's opened up
but you you tell your boss that he's actually really
good much better than he is just because you know
he's your friend and you want your friend to work
next to you and that's cronyism cheating in a video
game that's corruption lying is corruption littering is corruption cheating
on a test at school that's corruption exaggerating on your
resume is corruption trying to get favors from people is
corruption cutting corners at work turning in some shoddy work
that's corruption laziness greed Envy anger noticed this notice how
this leads to corruption within you notice your fear and
how that leads to your corruption your entire thinking process
is corrupted by fear and by greed by laziness by
hatred by judgment thinking you deserve special treatment in certain
situations that's corruption lying to get a better deal on
something you you're gonna buy that's corruption notice especially when
you're craving for things when you have a deep craving
for something whether it's food or sex or money or
whatever it is how that corrupts you you need to
observe this on a micro level just like you did
with fear from that fear episode where I told you
to observe your micro fears we'll now observe your micro
corruptions observe how your worldview is distorted by your survival
needs observe the ideologies that you adopt in order to
get your way in life to manipulate life and observe
the excuses you make and the justifications and rationalizations you
make to hand wave it away and to make it
seem like it's all okay and it's not corruption all
of these little things like I told you they're gonna
expand out into a giant chasm when you get more
power more money more Fame and you become a leader
more responsibility it's especially important that you do what I'm
telling you here if you plan on being any kind
of leader this is the thing that prevents you from
abusing my teachings if you don't do this and you
plan on having a life purpose where you go out
there and transform the world this whole spiel if you've
taken my life purpose course you're gonna be a devil
and I don't want to create Devils so start observing
this stuff how is corruption solved overall well first and
foremost just by the light of awareness remember on my
episode where I said awareness alone is curative well awareness
is curative as we're seeing Trump behave like a devil
in front of the cameras that camera light that's shining
on him literally is bringing forth his own devilry and
materialism and narcissism and broadcasting to the entire world how
ugly that is that's helping people that's helping us to
evolve in advance as a society that's necessary so don't
think that Trump is a step backwards Trump is a
step forwards in the counter intuitive sense that sometimes you've
got to see how ugly your behavior is before you
can correct it corruption is solved by truth corruption is
falsehood and truth does conquer falsehood in the end but
in the short term falsehood can went out sometimes lying
does work in the short term which is why you
do it another way corruption is solved is that it
autocorrects over generations it will autocorrect because of this larger
theme of life which is that evolution increases consciousness and
love that is what evolution is it's the steady increase
of conscious and love so corruption will slowly be reduced
further and further and further but also as new technological
fields open up new corruption will emerge there like we
talked about with the kind of social media examples and
the devil learning how to use technology bypassing better laws
and having a better legal system that's very important to
shore up our legal system of course Trump is showing
us the importance of having a high quality uncorrupted legal
system for keeping his delery in check corruption is stopped
by the evolution of culture culture is always evolving new
norms are forming new values culture is moving up the
spiral as well as the individuals and so that helps
to eliminate corruption a better education system is very important
that's a very deep topic you'll have a whole separate
episode about how to fix our education system and all
the corruptions of it corruption is also solved simply by
meeting people's basic needs increase the overall wealth and prosperity
of the of the society and then people have less
need to be corrupt it's very hard to tell people
in a in a country like Liberia where they're literally
[ __ ] on the streets for lack of public
toilets and eating dead bodies for lack of food cannibalism
when they have to resort to cannibalism and and whoring
and all the sorts of stuff just to make ends
meet it's really hard to tell these people to give
up their corruption they can't do it their life depends
upon it so what we can do those we can
elevate the quality of life you know build more houses
reduce disease in in third-world countries help them to generate
clean power and other things like this help them with
education maybe through online new online mediums give them Internet
access and this sort of stuff and in this way
we can we can reduce corruption and then of course
by doing that we can also eliminate terrorism which is
nice we can reduce war which is nice we can
reduce genocide we can reduce nationalist movements we can reduce
rape we can reduce religious indoctrination all that good stuff
and corruption is ultimately solved through the moral developmental line
and the spiritual development of line as you become more
truly spiritual not a name but actually in practice corruption
stops so start purifying yourself of your own corrupt tennessee's
right now and you can do that by starting to
ask the question what are all the ways in which
you are corrupt how does corruption hold you back from
greatness contemplate that question how does corruption hold you back
from actualizing your full vision for your life purpose and
practically speaking there's a lot of different techniques I've shared
with you that will help you with resolving personal corruption
such as plugging holes in your Maslow's hierarchy of needs
filling your base fulfilling your basic needs master your career
find a way to make money in a healthy way
then you're gonna be less desperate clearing out your lower
chakras I haven't talked about that much but you can
find resources try to do that the letting go technique
is great for letting go of various emotions that make
you corrupt and various cravings and so forth Kriya yoga
meditation of course this all helps self inquiry helps shadow
work helps I'll have an episode on that in the
future hum what some occult um shamanic breathing check out
my episode on shamanic breathing that technique can help you
to purge literally you can feel the corruption purging from
your body and mind with that technique journaling and introspection
contemplation I have many episodes that teach you how to
do contemplation psychedelics of course are very helpful facing your
fears my two episodes about understanding fear and how fear
works that's very helpful opening your heart being more loving
is also very helpful and I'll have episodes in the
future about how to open your heart and how to
be more loving but of course these are personal things
you do which are important but also you need to
take collective action as well which is why I gave
you that example with the Wolf Pack because that would
be an example of a collective action see it's not
just enough for you to open your heart we also
need to pass a constitutional amendment to get money out
of politics for example in America the ultimate solution to
corruption is consciousness truth love and spirit ego dissolution and
transparency transparency is just another word for awareness imagine for
example if your life was lived with a hundred percent
transparency that means that a camera followed you around everywhere
you went no matter what you did 24/7 and this
was broadcast on TV all the time that means that
everybody in the world knew your schemes they knew what
you were doing they knew what you were up to
they knew all of your secrets and imagine the camera
could even like we even plugged a computer wire into
your skull and we could even read your intentions your
thoughts and your emotions and how you feel and all
of this was broadcast to the entire world so that
if you had a corrupt thought if you had a
thought like oh you know I want to grab that
that woman's tits there's like ooh I want to steal
some of that money's like oh I want to whatever
you know whatever I want to steal some of that
candy from that baby you have these corrupt thoughts or
like you have some sort of desire like oh I
want to cheat on my wife or whatever you have
this but it was immediately broadcast to everybody see what
you should realize is that your corruption couldn't be sustained
because your and only works in the shadows many of
your thoughts and emotions are very toxic and selfish and
negative because they're so private to you and there's nobody
to hold them in check but you and of course
you won't do it because your self biased so the
reason I'm telling you all this is that if you're
more transparent in your thoughts words and actions that will
help a lot if you scheme and you manipulate and
you hi your intentions a lot that's gonna that's gonna
produce shadows in which corruption can hide remember also not
to be too quick to judge the corruptions of others
it's very difficult to rid yourself of all corruptions this
is a superhuman task this is a godly task this
is your life's work so before you judge others first
fix yourself worry more on fixing yourself or perhaps contributing
to good causes like Wolfpack and also have compassion for
corrupt people I noticed this tendency within the media on
YouTube and elsewhere you know some video comes out with
some latest person who's corrupted and everybody everybody dog piles
on that corrupt person and calls them a devil and
evil and bla bla bla bla bla but the compassion
is missing corrupt people are not really evil they're simply
lost in unconsciousness they simply weren't educated properly and they
simply don't understand what they're doing they're scared they're scared
of death they're scared of spiritual work they're scared of
love they're just trying to survive have compassion for that
and have compassion for your own corruptions to see because
if you judge others harshly for being corrupt you will
also have to judge yourself for your own corruptions if
you judge yourself too much for your own corruptions you
won't even admit your own corruptions and you'll be very
corrupt so paradoxically hating corruption doesn't solve corruption it increases
corruption because hatred is a low consciousness reaction low consciousness
produces low consciousness birds of a feather flock together if
you want to eliminate corruption within yourself and others practice
love love the corruption to death just like I told
you to love the evil to death same thing it's
okay to admit that you're selfish it's okay to love
yourself even though you're selfish and you struggle to let
go of a certain corruption or a certain selfish craving
that you have that you know you should be able
to let go but you just can't let it go
that's fine that's where you're at accept that love yourself
for being that way that will help you to overcome
it it's not gonna work by making yourself feel guilty
and hating yourself and also I have a corruption worksheet
for you so click the link down below in the
description under the video you'll find this corruption worksheet fill
it out that will help you to get a little
bit more of a awareness of your own corruption and
lastly I'll just remind you to if you want if
you're an american go donate to wolf pack calm even
if it's just five bucks i'm not affiliated with them
i don't get any money from them they don't pay
me this is not a sponsorship i'm just putting it
out there because when i originally conceived of this idea
of an episode about corruption i knew this would be
a powerful deep episode and immediately I got the urge
to to talk about wolf pack because it's just it's
such a practical and reasonable and common-sense way to just
tackle the root of a the root of this problem
at least with in American politics right now all right
that's it I'm done here this is the end please

actualized I don't work there you will find my book
list life purpose course my blog where I post a
lot of stuff and resources and videos that I share
almost on a daily basis you'll find the forum there
you'll also find my patreon donation link down below if
you want to support my work I'm very grateful for
that I'll probably be once I get my new camera
I'll probably show it off to you guys and maybe
I'll have some exclusive patreon stuff in the future I
don't know I'm still trying to figure out what the
best way to handle it that the patreon is but
I'm definitely gonna be using those funds right now to
be making various kinds of improvements and kind of trying
to funnel that money back towards value to you and
the last thing that I'll say here to wrap up
is that actualized org is focused on big picture understanding
of reality in life these teachings are rather advanced they're
too abstract for many people because many people are still
down at Maslow's hierarchy of needs you know down here
on the lower half they're still struggling with their basic
survival needs I have some older content which was focused
on helping you to meet your survival needs today I
mostly talk about being neat snot survival needs and I
understand that for many of you you're still you're still
you're not ready for that you need to spend a
good 5 10 years to going really hard on your
survival needs mastering those mastering your career and so forth
and I will still have content for you going forward
but I just want to warn you supplement what you
learn from me with other more basic sources that teach
you just simple stuff because my interest was never with
this with my work to teach very very simple stuff
on how to meet your basic survival needs might might
my vision was always to go for the biggest picture
understanding and really you need both it's not one or
the other you need both but I only have so
much time and energy in my life and my time
is already seriously consumed by by just the big picture
topics that I talk about that's it I will have
some very practical courses in the future that I'll release
I'm working on one right now actually probably should come
out in the next six months I'm hoping so that
will be useful but it's not to say that might
my big picture topics aren't useful they're extremely useful the
problem is that they're so abstract for many of you
that you don't know how to make use of them
so what I recommend is that you supplement my teachings
my channel with more basic stuff stuff that just teaches
you how to like earn some money how to write
a resume how to develop some technical skill how to
how to do a job interview so you're hired how
to maybe deal with a problem in your relationship this
sort of stuff right I in a certain sense like
this stuff is too small for me like these are
small fish I don't likes my frying small fish I
want to fry giant whales so that's what mostly I'm
focused on and then once once you do satisfy a
lot of the basic stuff once you do fry a
bunch of small fish then you'll really be ready to
take in the depth of what I'm offering you with
the big whales and they all interconnect work beautifully in
your life but you know this work we're doing you
this is the longest we have the longest time horizon
here right like my whole vision for you is that
you're gonna be following this content for 10 years for
20 years for your whole life you're gonna be following
this content don't get this idea that all I'm gonna
watch Leo for a year to fix all my whole
life and then just go about my life and and
like no there you're you're gonna have 20 years of
of learnings here at least 20 years of learnings don't
think you're above any of this you're just getting started
even if you've done a few psychedelics you're just getting
started even if you've earned a little bit money you're
just getting started even if you've had an awakening or
- you're just getting started I can't stress that enough
so really be patient with this appreciate how important these
conversations are that we're having this is laying the foundation
the theoretical foundation for the rest of your life this
is not a waste of time this is not you
just watching some YouTube videos the way it might seem
there's a difference between different kinds of videos some videos
waste your time some videos might help you a little
bit here and there but don't solve anything fundamentally and
some videos will change the entire trajectory of your life
but it's those that will that require a long time
horizon because we can't change the entire trajectory of your
life with one video in one week or in one
month or even in one year it it's cumulative effects
that stack together so if you really want to extract
the full value of what I'm offering to you here
then plan for the long term take notes be patient
don't expect immediate results right now you might have watched
this episode you might think well Leo how does this
corruption topic help me it doesn't help me in my
practical life one day will come where it will help
you you may not be there yet but just because
you have this in the back of your mind is
already gonna be enough that one day maybe five years
from now that you do get to that day where
it could make or break you you're gonna have that
in the back of your mind that memory of like
oh yeah Leo's was mumbling on and on about corruption
he was talking to how important it's gonna be one
day and here it is this is the day and
sure enough it makes a lot of difference and then
also to underestimate the critical mass of understanding that's gonna
be built here by watching this stuff yeah you watched
10 videos okay that's nice 20 videos okay you connect
some dots that makes a little bit more sense but
when you watch 300 videos when you connect them all
together when you contemplate them we need to practice all
this gels together you're reading books and this your whatever
you're doing retreats all of its gonna come together at
some point you're gonna reach this critical mass like I
have or it's the most remarkable thing and this is
really the whole point of all my teachings is to
get you to reach a critical mass of understanding we're
literally you can walk down the street and it feels
like you understand all of life you understand why every
leaf and blade of grass is doing whatever it's doing
why every car is zooming by why every bird is
flying overhead why all this stuff is happening why politics
is the way it is why religion is the way
it is why science is the way it is why
humans behave how they do all of it will be
transparent to you and that's that's really what Jazz's me
up that's what makes me most passion about this work
that's to me that's what I'm for I'm for understanding
infinite understanding I want to show you infinite understanding I
want to lead you to infinite understanding because with that
I think that is the magic key that unlocks for
you all of life you
