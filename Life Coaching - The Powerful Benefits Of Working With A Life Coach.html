hey this is the leo 4 actualized org and in
this video we are going to talk about life coaching
okay welcome back so let's crack into this one life
coaching we're gonna talk about what life coaching is how
it all works give you a little bit of a
taste of what it can do for you and how
it can potentially transform your life so let's break into
this first of all let me start by saying that
I am a professional life coach is something that I
like to do besides just studying a lot of personal
valid material which is really I'd say my first passion
I also love to coach people on it I love
to share my ideas with people and I'd like the
approaches that life coaching offers the tools the the techniques
and the strategies that come with that discipline I love
to apply that to problems people's lives because there is
something unique about coaching that's different than just advice giving
and just information and training and education which are also
very valuable and I'm really passionate about those but there's
something about coaching that's a little bit different a little
bit unique so let me talk about what coaching is
so basically coaching if you've never heard of it before
or done it it goes like this if you want
to improve some aspect of your life somewhere where you're
having a challenge or you're struggling you're just kind of
stuck and you want to do better and what you
really need is you need a third party objective perspective
and you want someone who will hold you accountable for
taking some action making some changes and can help you
see new insights into your problem and maybe share some
expertise and give you some education and some strategies and
some techniques to get you out of it to deal
with your own psychological issues then you might want to
consider hiring a coach so coach will help you go
from the kind of baseline normal level of quality that
you have in your life to an amazing optimal level
of quality that's the intent with with some individuals and
this is really the difference between therapy and life coaching
is that with therapy the therapist really focuses on people
who are in a severely dysfunctional state so people that
are crippled by depression anxiety suicidal thoughts manic depressive disorders
maybe they even have some some kind of biological medical
conditions physical conditions with their brain that they're working through
and maybe they need medication to fix that stuff so
these are more serious problems and here what we're doing
is we're taking someone from a dysfunctional level to just
kind of a baseline normal life coaching is about taking
someone from a functional level to a optimal level like
creating a kick-ass life so that's what exercise that org
is about you know I love to to see how
we can squeeze that last drop of potential out of
you just like think about squeezing a lemon like to
get every last drop out of you so that's what
coaching is about practically some of the logistics of coaching
coaching is usually done once a week it's done over
the phone I tend to find that few coaches coach
in person it's just not practical to do that it's
also unnecessary in it's not very convenient although in certain
environments setting in corporate environments a lot of times coaching
will be done face-to-face but usually coaching is done over
the phone it's usually done once a week so one
call per week and I usually see coaches doing between
30 minutes per phone call to 15 minutes per phone
call so somewhere around there and basically the way that
it works is that you get on the phone you
tell your coach your problem or your challenge and then
the coach starts asking you questions to help you get
to the bottom of it to create clarity for you
which then you can use and you can go off
and you can do the things that you need to
do to start addressing that problem or maybe it's just
a mental shift that you have to do and that
problem gets resolved right there over the phone sometimes it's
even as simple as that you can have big and
profound breakthroughs and revelations while being coached and this all
depends on your problem it depends on your receptivity also
depends on the quality of the coach how good are
they at asking you the questions that will get you
to shift your thinking to think about something from a
different perspective that you haven't considered before this is the
real value of coaching is the perspective component a lot
of people discount this or they fail to appreciate that
this is even possible is that you're so stuck in
your dysfunctional relationship you're so stuck procrastinating on starting that
business you're so stuck in your current career and not
being able to go into that dream career that you
have you're so stuck with these things that you think
that there's no way out and a lot of times
that's in your head that's all in your head you're
literally creating a cage inside your mind that you are
trapping yourself in and that's totally unnecessary and with a
few new perspectives new tools you can start to break
out of that another great thing about coaching is that
coaches will hold you accountable right a coach holds you
accountable for the things that you say you're going to
do sometimes it's just as simple as that because a
coaching is a is a serious professional relationship you have
to become into you have to show up on time
you have to schedule time out of your day you
have to be there to be focused for the call
and you have to pay for that so when you're
shelling out your money you're shelling out your time that
already shows that you're committed and when you actually say
that you know what I have a challenge here and
I really want to fix this challenge and I'm tired
of struggling through it I'm tired of waffling around it
I'm gonna commit my time my money my resources my
energy to get this fixed just when you make that
decision and you lay out the cash and you invest
your time all the sudden that already puts you into
gear but then an extra layer on top of that
is that your coach will be asking you about the
assignments that you've been working on will ask you about
the action you've been taking will challenge you to take
more action than you otherwise would we'll challenge you to
set higher goals for yourself when your coach does this
just you can see from from that process if the
coach always increases your goals a little bit more than
you would have naturally if the coach is always following
up with you and asking you about whether you're doing
what you're supposed to be doing what you promised yourself
to be doing then that is gonna create a little
bit of extra motivation it becomes a little more serious
in your mind this is not some sort of vague
promise that you are just gonna flake on because you're
paying for it because your coach is gonna question you
about it coach might be disappointed in you if you
don't do it so gets you a little bit of
you know let's a little bit of fire under your
ass so coaching how does it actually work so when
you're sitting there are on the phone like what is
the actual process there well usually what happens is that
you come in there the coach will ask you what
you want to get coached on and the coach should
be really good about this the coach should not be
pushing his or her agenda on you so it shouldn't
be about like well I'm gonna I'm gonna fix your
life for you it's very much the opposite of that
it's like the client takes the initiative so you come
to me and you tell me your problem you tell
me okay Leo I want to get coached on this
problem that I'm having at work because at work I
have this one co-worker who always rubs me the wrong
way I always get angry at them and I find
that it gets my mind totally off of work and
then I slip up on my projects and I miss
my milestones and so that's creating a you know a
serious problem for me at work so I want to
work through that let's find a permanent solution and then
I'll be like okay great let's look for a solution
and I start asking you questions and it just kind
of goes back and forth and back and forth and
back and forth until we get you some deep insights
about what kind of actions you want to take and
also just about how you're thinking about the situation there's
two components here one is how you see your world
and what you think about the beliefs you have your
psychology and the other one is about what is your
action plan what are you gonna do about it after
you got your psychology down you still need to go
out there and probably take some action in most cases
so coaching is great for getting you to drill down
and clarify exactly what you need to do so a
lot of times we will end the call with some
action items for you to do some homework assignments maybe
some journaling exercises some visualization exercises affirmations or just an
action item plan for how to start that business or
how to start that gym routine that you wanted to
start improve your health relationship whatever and so we work
through that and then the next time we meet the
following week you know I'll ask you about the assignments
that you've done have you done them have you not
done them why haven't you done them what have you
learned from them we talked about all that and then
we just kind of come on and then the next
challenge comes up and we talk about the next challenge
and that's how it repeats so coaching is powerful it's
a little bit difficult to quantify the power of coaching
because some of these things that we help as coaches
to get you the client to to create in your
life can be subtle and profound on the same level
a little bit paradoxical here so by subtle I mean
we can help you get a transition or a shift
in your psychology how you think about relationships how do
you think about business maybe get rid of some limiting
beliefs that you have about money or your health and
really open up the floodgates for you then go out
there and create amazing success for yourself and it's really
easy to discount the value of that and I'm not
just saying this because I need to create a job
for myself I'm saying this because well people and human
psychology has a hard time understanding abstract things and evaluating
putting proper value on abstract things that's why it's a
little bit hard sometimes to sell personal development all these
videos that I'm shooting on the one hand people can
tell like wow this is something that can really change
my life and other hand a lot of times people
will look at and say well it's not really nothing
that's kind of obvious it's kind of common sense what
is that really gonna do for me is that really
gonna change my life and when you take that kind
of attitude to it then what you're doing is it's
like you're taking it picking up a diamond a diamond
in the rough and you're just kind of like throwing
it out because it's not all pretty and sparkly because
it's not quite always obvious so you have the long-term
wisdom to see what this can do for you and
if you're thinking well my life is pretty good already
and you know if I'm already fairly successful I'll earn
a good income my health is good my relationship is
good some part of your life is good then I
got to really tell you that coaching is actually perfect
for you because there is the next level right it's
about taking you to the next level you might be
asking yourself why do I need a coach coaches are
for people who have screwed up lives and nothing really
could be further from the truth the people that have
amazing lives are always working on their lives that's why
their lives are amazing and in fact it's the people
that are screwed up that generally either a they don't
have the the foresight to know that they even have
a problem so they don't hire a coach they don't
have the money because they're so screwed up psychologically that
they can't have a decent paycheck so they don't even
have the money or the time to hire a coach
and they just they don't see the value in it
right for them they have more urgent problems like they
need to keep it electricity on they need to feed
their kids they need to make sure their marriage doesn't
crumble something drastic like that whereas with with people that
are already having pretty successful lives you know they always
want to take it up to the next level to
the next level it's the next level and you're gonna
be surprised how high you can go that's another thing
that coaches are great at is that we can help
you see the potential in you that maybe you don't
even fully acknowledge to yourself sometimes we have a hard
time acknowledging our own successes and our own potential and
you need someone like a coach a mentor type figure
in your life someone who's gonna say you know what
I see more in you I see that you're working
at this job but I know that you could go
and start your own business or I see that you've
already started your own business but I know that you
can triple the earnings of that business or I can
see that you're having this relationship but we can take
it to the next level we can get all your
relationships and all your all your interactions to be improved
if we do for example work on your on your
communication skills or your understanding and your empathy skills understanding
other people emotional intelligence stuff like that so that can
be really powerful is when we see potential in you
that even you do not see that's a lot of
times even why a coach will need a coach because
I tend to fall in that same problem too sometimes
I don't see my own potential so I get a
lot of value out of coaching even though I know
how to coach and I know a lot of stuff
that I've studied from personal development I get a lot
of value out of being coached by somebody else because
it's a new perspective and that's just like somebody pushing
you forward so I mean someone who trusts and you
someone who believes in you and not in a fake
way but in a genuine way because they get to
know you as your as your coach your coach will
know you will know intimate details about your life and
they'll know your strengths they'll know your weaknesses and they're
not just gonna you they're gonna tell it to you
like it is at least if they're a good coach
they will okay so ultimately what can coaching do for
you and I'm not shooting this video to pitch my
own coaching services I do coach and if you want
to check that out you can on my coaching page
at actualized org but really feel free to hire any
coach out there who you like who you resonate with
who you click with you like but what coaching can
do for you I think ultimately is really cut the
learning curve of your development cut the learning curve if
you've been doing personal development you probably realize and you've
probably struggled with this issue where you go out there
you read one book you read some magazine article maybe
you even listen to a video like this you go
out there and you try to make some changes try
to implement something and then you you come up against
the wall right the brick wall and you keep hitting
your head against the wall and you're stuck and you're
stuck and you're stuck and you know there's something more
but then you get discouraged you don't know how to
do it or maybe you're even making progress but that
progress is slow and painful and it's very grindy well
I've been there I'm speaking from recognition so this is
what coaching can do this coaching can cut your learning
curve we can't eliminate it for you I want to
be really clear about this we're not gonna go out
there as your coach and take the action we're not
gonna promise you a million dollars I'm gonna promise you
a new business a new car or a new life
or a new husband or a new girlfriend or boyfriend
or anything in fact we really need you to be
extremely proactive in this coaching relationship you need to be
coming up to us with challenges and problems and asking
questions then we can get you the answers that you
need so what a coach can do though is cut
that learning curve because if you are wise and you
really understand what your life progress and your life growth
is going to look like you know that if you're
doing it right you have a slow steady upward path
if you're doing personal development if you're not then your
life's going down the toilet by either a slow or
maybe even a quick downward path so we definitely don't
you to be there and if you are going down
that road definitely consider a coach immediately or perhaps at
their best but if you're on that upward slow upward
path and you see that there's like more there and
you just kind of feel it you know that there's
something more and there's just something you don't understand something
you don't know and you see that there might be
another way then a coach will cut that curve for
you so you're not struggling as much we can point
you to the resources that you need we can point
you to the ideas that you need and sometimes that's
all it takes is just one idea don't discount the
power of one idea applied consistently in the right place
in your life at exactly the right time that could
have a huge shift huge shift breakthrough shift so really
think about this think about how serious you are about
improving your life and also consider that coaches some of
the best performing people out there in the world CEOs
professional athletes these people have coaches they have mentors how
do you think they got there Tiger Woods has a
coach even though Tiger Woods is an amazing golfer and
he probably golf's better than his coach why does he
have a coach well because the coach can give him
new insights the coach can give him a third perspective
the coach can share information that he studied that maybe
Tiger Woods's have time to study the coach can inspire
him the coach can see potential within him this is
the same with CEOs almost every CEO in every major
corporation especially like the fortune 5,000 even or fortune 500
especially all of them have been coached they didn't get
them by themselves they get coaching I mean it's just
that's how you progress in life is you have someone
show you the ropes someone who has either been there
and done that and has practical advice or someone who
can just ask you the questions you need to ask
to get you to think very very clearly a lot
of times that's what coaching is really about is clarity
you might even know the answers but right now you
have not articulated them you have not written them down
on paper and a coach will get you to do
that a coach will get you so much clarity about
the direction of your life your goals your vision where
you want to go your weaknesses your strengths what you
need to be working on what you don't need to
be working on what you should be thinking what you
shouldn't be thinking so all of this can a profound
effect and cut your learning curve substantially so I like
to say that what would take you a normal person
3 years of personal development work to get with a
coaching relationship with myself I can probably get you that
much progress and three months so think about that would
you rather spend the next three years fumbling around trying
to get this stuff done or get it done in
three months right and think about what that is going
to do to your wallet a lot of times people
will say well coaching and coaching you expenses I don't
know I want to pay that kind of money but
think about it because coaching is not going to be
a lifelong relationship coaching can last for just a few
months it could last longer than that but a lot
of times the problems are fixed in just a few
months you get some profound realizations and epiphanies that you
take away with you some tools and strategies that then
you can apply for the rest of your life and
if your learning curve is cut from three years to
three months you know that difference what are you gonna
do with that time you can do some powerful things
and you can make up that money many many many
times over so do not limit yourself with the money
problem in fact if you are having objections to coaching
even though you know you need it but you're saying
that it's too expensive it's too frivolous then that is
actually probably one of the biggest limiting beliefs that is
holding you back in life right now and you should
get coaching just for that reason right there so gather
the courage and consider a coach if you see that
you have something bigger that you want to accomplish with
your life all right this is Leo I am signing
