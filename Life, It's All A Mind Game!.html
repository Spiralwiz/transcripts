[Music] if you do enough philosophy as we do in
this work eventually you reach a point after a long
while of doing it after a lot of confusion and
a lot of questioning and a lot of scratching your
head trying to get the answers but really not being
able to get clear straightforward answers you come to the
point where you wonder well what's the point is there
even any point to doing this work it just all
seems like a mind game it all seems like mental
masturbation it all seems like it doesn't have any practical
purpose and that i'm just wasting my time have you
gone to that point yet in your own philosophical investigations
a lot of times people will leave these kinds of
comments under some of my more philosophical metaphysical type of
episodes where they will say okay leo so yeah you're
talking about this thing here and that esoteric thing there
and this abstraction here and this principle there and you're
talking about how reality is not real and it's imaginary
and god and whatever else but what's the point this
all sounds like word games and mind games but that
is the point the point of philosophy is precisely to
realize that reality is just a mind game it's all
a mind game but be careful because people don't appreciate
what that means and what i want to communicate to
you the only thing i'm trying to communicate to you
in this episode is just the significance of what that
means it's it's much more profound than people realize because
people also use this as an excuse or as a
way to hand wave away philosophical investigation a lot of
people don't even begin philosophical investigation because they just short
circuit it by saying oh well it's all just a
mind game yes but you don't really know that you're
short-circuiting the process and you have to be careful about
that because the process teaches you things you wouldn't otherwise
understand about how your game how your mind plays these
games for example i was into philosophical questioning since i
was a teen very early in my teenage years i
would question everything i was very skeptical about everything which
shouldn't surprise you at this point you know how did
i how did i become this way i was doing
this basically since i was a child now back then
it wasn't clear to me where it was taking me
how far i could take it and why i was
doing it i was just doing it because i was
just innately curious it was just curiosity but anyways my
mom would always poke fun at me at this she
would always say that oh he's he's she had a
russian word for me um which translates into english as
the unbeliever she would call me the unbeliever because all
the time i was doubting everything i was doubting even
things that you wouldn't normally doubt like for example i
remember when i was like in third grade or i
don't know third second fourth grade somewhere around there where
we were learning the multiplication tables and for the life
of me i couldn't understand why zero times another number
is equal to zero that didn't make sense to me
at the time and so you know my mom would
help me with my homework and anyways you know she
was just telling me to like memorize these these multiplication
tables but it didn't make sense to me why 0
times 2 is equal to 0. it didn't make sense
and so i i didn't believe it i was skeptical
about it and she didn't have a good way of
explaining it to me but you know she's like well
she used to tell me that it's basically true and
she just wanted me to memorize it but i don't
want to memorize it because i didn't it didn't make
sense to me and so she called me i remember
she would call me an unbeliever the unbeliever leo is
the unbeliever and i did this all across everything with
everything in life um and and also the reason i'm
bringing up my mom is because um when i would
try to engage with her philosophically about certain things you
know trying to get her to question stuff um she
would very quickly dismiss it it's just like oh it's
just philosophy it's just it's all just it's it's useless
don't worry about it that was her attitude and that's
still her attitude today anything that i explained to her
that i talk about with actualize.org all the like deep
metaphysical stuff anything that i explained to her she can
listen to it and she's fairly open-minded she'll listen to
it but she could even listen for an hour me
talking about god and consciousness and reality and and metaphysics
and epistemology and this and that and how things are
unreal and and then at the end of that hour
of conversation she'll just say yeah but that's just all
philosophy and see this is it's an ingenious defense mechanism
that the mind creates and so that in itself is
part of the mind game so yes everything is a
mind game but when i say that i mean everything
is a mind game i mean everything the problem with
the way that my mom my mom uses that notion
and the way that many i see who leave these
sort of comments under some of my episodes use that
notion is that they use that notion again in a
biased selective manner so when we're talking about deep philosophical
stuff they might even listen to it and then at
the end of it they'll just say oh yeah but
it's all just a mind game but that's not what
i mean when i say everything is a mind game
that is not the lesson of philosophy the lesson philosophy
is not just that philosophy only is a mind game
it's that everything is a [ __ ] mind game
that means science is a mind game that means religion
is a mind game that means means business is a
mind game that means relationships are a mind game that
means marriage is a mind game that means sex is
a mind game that means your ideas about yourself your
self-esteem your self-confidence all of your limiting beliefs that's all
a mind game it means motivation is a mind game
it means school and university is a mind game it
means government politics and society are a mind game it
means health and health care is a mind game medicine
is a mind game and ultimately it means that physical
reality itself is a mind game and this is not
a trivial realization is very significant but there's a very
big difference between realizing this at the level that i'm
trying to get you to realize it at versus the
level that like for example my mom uses that as
an excuse because it's applied very selectively only to those
things which she's not interested in or which perhaps threaten
her sense of reality and life but you see when
i tell her yeah but your life don't you realize
that means your whole life is a mind game life
itself birth and death are a mind game pain and
suffering are a mind game all of your problems all
of your family problems your relationship problems your financial problems
these are a mind game but you see no no
no no she says no no no what are you
talking about leo those aren't mind games my money problems
are not a mind game those are real and of
course that's the mind game it's an infinite mind game
you see the problem is that you think the mind
games are confined to some narrow finite portion of reality
and usually you use that on those portions of reality
that you don't like and that you're biased against or
that you're threatened by so this then becomes a very
big trap with serious consequences for serious people serious business
people you know they take their business very seriously they
don't treat it like a mind game they don't realize
it is a mind game but then when they look
at philosophy or spirituality they'll say oh that's all a
mind game religion that's all the mind game politics that's
all a mind game but they don't treat their business
that way and they certainly don't treat their family and
their children that way see if you're having a going
through a divorce with your spouse and it's a turbulent
nasty divorce and you're being sued and you're going to
lose all your money and custody of the children in
that divorce see in the middle of that you don't
think that's a mind game even though that's exactly what
it is that's all that it is it's layers and
layers of of nested mind games there that you and
your spouse and your lawyers are all playing and your
children too you see so you make exceptions and you
don't actually apply this principle of it's just a mind
game when things get serious and this is how you
get trapped in life and you can become a victim
of life when you don't realize it you forget because
you literally get mesmerized by the messiness of your problems
you don't think that your deepest personal problems are a
mind game whatever those are like if you struggle to
get sex you don't think that's just a mind game
you think that's a physical problem you think that's a
real serious problem and it causes a a real serious
depression for you maybe you'll even become suicidal and maybe
at some point somebody will actually kill themselves over this
i'm sure thousands of people every year around the world
kill themselves because they're not able to have sex the
kind of sex that they want and they believe that
that's not a mind game they believe that's physics they
believe things like that they're too short to have sex
that their dick is too small to have sex that
they're too ugly to have sex that they're not lovable
enough that nobody would want them that nobody would commit
to them that maybe somebody would have sex with them
but they would that would just be just to use
their body and that there wouldn't be a real genuine
connection there because the person isn't lovable enough or isn't
worthy enough or doesn't have the right job or doesn't
have the right hair or the right physical features and
all of that is not treated like a mind game
go try to convince an incel for example go to
an in cell forum where all the in cells hang
out and try to convince these in-cells that everything they're
doing on that forum where they are developing this toxic
uh ideology against women this toxic world view against women
and also um against attractive men where they believe that
they can't get laid because they're not attractive enough and
because uh women are shallow and only want to sleep
around with the with the most attractive chads with the
biggest jaws and the biggest muscles and the biggest cars
and and the most money and all this sort of
stuff like they develop this ideology go try to convince
one of these incels that hey that's just all a
mind game that you're playing on yourself that's that's the
most that's the last thing you'll be able to convince
them of is that and the reason is is precisely
because if they admit that then the entire mind game
would collapse like a house of cards so that's precisely
the one thing they cannot admit and that's just one
example how about your relationship problems your marriage problems these
are all mind games you're playing mind games every single
day with the people that you love with your family
the problem is that you don't treat them as such
you don't treat these things like mind games you're not
dismissive of these problems why because it's part of your
survival and of course as we've talked about in the
past survival is the ultimate mind game because birth and
death are themselves just mind games literally things you're imagining
in your mind the importance of being alive this is
a mental bias it's an arbitrary bias that you've developed
the idea that you're going to die this is an
arbitrary idea that you've you've picked up it's not true
and you you saying no leo it is true i'm
gonna die one day yeah that's the mind game that
you're playing that i'm trying to point you to that
you're in denial about and denial and then denial of
your denial and denial of your denial of your denial
is the mind game and perhaps another area an example
of where this mind game is extremely convincing and virtually
impossible to communicate or to demonstrate uh like with the
incels is within the scientific community scientists and academics actually
think that their intellectual work is not a mind game
i mean it's ridiculous when you really think about it
because if you just zoom out a little bit and
think about what science and academia are it's obvious that
these are mind games but they're such deep mind games
and they have such significance that people get mesmerized by
them lost inside of them doing them for years and
decades they build entire careers and lifestyles out of these
communities and and epistemic paradigms that it becomes their survival
and it's no accident that most of the hardcore scientists
and academics when you try to talk to them about
the fact that science and academia and materialism for example
are mind games and that let's do some philosophy to
figure this out to help you to help jail break
your mind out of this game that you're playing what
are they going to tell you they're going to tell
you oh philosophy but that's just a mind game we
don't need philosophy we're serious scientists and academics here philosophy
that's for that's for soft-headed people that's just a waste
of time everybody knows that you can't get anything practical
from metaphysics or from doing and reading philosophy it's just
endless debating back and forth and mental masturbation and you
know we're we're serious hard-nosed scientists and engineers over here
we're physicists we're biologists we're chemists uh and you know
we're building particle colliders here and battery technology and we
are launching spacecraft and and exploring the outer edges of
the universe through our telescopes and stuff like that you
know we're doing serious astronomy here and astrophysics and developing
theories that we can use to build gps systems and
quantum computers and whatever else and so it's not a
mind game how self-serving of you to frame it that
way isn't it isn't that interesting isn't it interesting that
every worldview and every paradigm frames itself in such a
way that it justifies itself to itself because of course
if it didn't you would stop doing it so again
the problem here is the way in which skepticism is
misused skepticism is weaponized i've talked about this my older
episode called true versus false skepticism it's a very important
episode that people don't fathom the significance of this is
such a crucial thing to understand watch yourself doing this
like a hawk your mind will abuse skepticism applying it
in a self-serving manner weaponizing it in order to dismiss
those things that threaten your worldview and threaten your mind
and your life and it will completely forget about skepticism
when it comes to your own pet paradigms and theories
because the only reason your mind cares about skepticism is
to serve itself you don't really care about truth you
care about using skepticism to defend falsehood by misapplying it
selectively and this is for example what many of the
right wingers do when they're skeptical about like climate change
they will pretend when they're debating about climate change they
will act as though they're being very skeptical in a
sort of uh you know philosophical almost as though they're
trying to be these good philosophers and truth seekers so
they apply skepticism in this manner to to climate science
and the reason of course they're doing that is because
a lot of these people get paid by the oil
and gas industry or they have relatives that work for
the oil and gas industry or because they subscribe to
an ideology where they simply don't want to take responsibility
collective responsibility for the environment it's difficult it's emotionally difficult
to take responsibility for your footprint on the environment that
takes a higher level of cognitive development and moral and
spiritual development because then you're gonna have to change what
you eat how you drive how much water you use
how much gas you use what companies you work for
if you take that stuff seriously and that that will
harm your survival in many cases you see and so
this air of skepticism is put on like oh yeah
i'm being very skeptical and rigorous when in fact you're
not being skeptical and rigorous because if you're truly being
skeptical you'd be skeptical of the skepticism that exists around
climate denial so notice your own mind doing this it's
easy to see other people misusing skepticism in this way
especially these days oh my god we have so much
abusive skepticism i don't think i've ever seen this much
abuse of skepticism ever in my life as we have
right now in the middle of this coveted epidemic every
day i turn on the news and i see people
horribly mangling skepticism about masks about vaccines about various kinds
of medicines and there's a there's a gen even more
general skepticism um when it comes to this this this
this attitude of distrust towards mainstream media and towards government
in general and towards corporations and towards elites people think
that they've woken up by turning against mainstream media government
and the elites and corporations people think they're waking up
this is a false awakening and i'm not even talking
about enlightenment here i'm just talking about it it's even
a false political awakening because uh yeah you're skeptical about
big pharma and you're skeptical about the military industrial complex
and you're skeptical about jeff bezos and bill gates and
you're skeptical about the presidency and you're skeptical about the
politicians and the mainstream media but then what do you
do out of that foolish notion of skepticism you swing
your pendulum to the other's end and you go down
uh ridiculously patently false conspiracy theories and alternative media sources
facebook posts and other things like that and there you
don't apply the same level of skepticism that you do
to mainstream media and then you think that you're being
smart and that you're doing good epistemology and you think
that you're now starting to understand the world that you're
waking up politically but actually no you're you're completely wrapped
up in delusion because the reality is no matter what
kind of biases cnn has cnn is way more accurate
and truthful than anything that you'll find on facebook and
in many cases even stuff that you find on youtube
many of the sort of new media alternative media perspectives
that you get whether it's right or left-wing progressive or
alt-right that you find on youtube on tick tock on
facebook and other social media sources the reality is that
all those sources are also deeply biased and a lot
of times not only are they biased but they're also
simply not factual because even though cnn has its biases
of course um it has a certain kind of group
think that it thinks inside of a certain box that
thinks inside of a certain paradigm that it applies to
how it reports on the news overall you can trust
cnn to be factual in many in many cases in
the majority of cases you can also trust cnn that
if they say something that's not factual that they will
actually correct the record in many cases they'll do that
um but you will not get get that same level
of um of professionalism from most of the sort of
independent news reporters that you find on the internet they
actually they don't have that same level of journalistic integrity
because at least the people at cnn they many of
them are like legit trained journalists of course not all
of them some of them are just talking heads a
lot of times and cnn oftentimes invites idiots to you
know to discuss topics but uh still they have legitimate
reporters on their payrolls legitimate journalists who actually went to
school for journalism got good degrees went to great schools
were taught how to be neutral and objective how to
look for bias how to have integrity about reporting facts
things like that whereas like somebody like alex jones you
know i mean it's laughable to even bring him up
in this context so you see this is a this
is the danger with skepticism if you're going to be
skeptical you have to be skeptical in an unbiased way
and that's exactly not how most people are skeptical they're
not skeptical about their own mental intellectual conclusions they give
preferential treatment to their own pet theories and prejudices and
then what ends up happening is just through confirmation bias
you develop an entire ideology by being skeptical against the
elites or the corporate people or whatever now am i
saying that you shouldn't be skeptical about the elites and
the corporate folk and the government no of course you
should but you should also be skeptical and even more
skeptical about all the conspiracy theories out there and the
alternative narratives that exist and you should especially be skeptical
about anybody who has built a career against the elites
you see these sorts of folks on youtube and i'm
sure in other places i mostly visit youtube i don't
spend a lot of time on other social media but
i'm sure you see this everywhere on social media is
that there are entire people nowadays who have built careers
and entire um brands out of [ __ ] on
mainstream media and the elites and the corporations and they've
gotten huge followings of millions of people and i can
just see how these people follow this anti-elitist populist rhetoric
and they're just getting suckered these people are getting suckered
because there's a little veneer of skepticism there but but
they're getting suckered into this populist ideology and that too
is just an ideology but it's not recognizing itself as
such you see and it's going to lead to more
problems than it really fixes and so that too is
a mind game so the mind game is infinite it's
a mind game within a mind game within a mind
game within a mind game within a mind game you
think you've unraveled one mind game and actually you've just
realized that that's the next mind game that you're playing
that's how this works so the whole point of our
work with actualize.org and really with with genuine any genuine
spiritual work is to realize that everything is a mind
game and then to actually live from that place and
also to become so adept and artful at playing the
mind game that you play it like in like a
like a master guitarist will play a guitar that's the
difference you see i'm not just talking about looking around
and calling everyone um some kind of player and being
just kind of generally vaguely skeptical about everybody and being
paranoid and doubting everybody i'm not just saying that i'm
saying when you truly start to suspect that everything is
a mind game what's the next step what's the what's
the next logical step what should you do about that
well if everything is a mind game you only have
two options one is to kill yourself and end the
game and two is to keep playing the game but
to learn to play the game artfully i guess you
have a third option which is just to go back
to sleep and continue playing the game artlessly the way
you've been playing it which is in fact that option
is the option most people take so what does it
mean to play the game artfully well the way that
you learn to play a game is that you study
how the game is played you study the mechanics of
the game you look at who plays it well and
who plays it poorly you learn the rules of the
game which is to say you learn the principles that
are running the game you learn patterns within the game
you learn patterns and meta patterns and then you actually
go out and play a few of these games yourself
and you make mistakes and through trial and error and
then also self-reflection you play a game then you look
back and analyze your own game and then you say
how did i play that one how did that turn
out what worked what didn't work you do a little
post-mortem on it it's just the same way as learning
how to play chess i mean this how does a
how does somebody become a chess grand master that's what
we're talking about here think of life as just a
giant infinite game of chess that you're playing and unless
you're going to kill yourself you're going to have to
play the game there's no other option there's no option
not to play the game other than killing yourself which
i don't recommend you do i recommend you enjoy the
game and actually see that's the thing is that if
you hate the game the reason you hate the game
is because you haven't actually learned how to play the
game yet life as a game is is amazing it
is the most amazing game that could ever be designed
it beats any video game it beats chess it beats
checkers it beats go it beats monopoly it's the ultimate
game that's what makes it so tricky is that it
is ultimate it is infinite there's nothing higher than it
there's nothing more complex than the game of life and
so what you have to do from an early age
but i mean you can start this at any age
but the earlier start the better what you can do
is you can you can realize that it's all a
game then you can start to learn how the game
is played and you can learn principles and patterns and
meta patterns and then quickly through trial and error and
using a lot of intelligence you can figure out how
to play the game and then the better you become
at it the more confident you feel the higher your
self-esteem becomes you also start to get some of the
fruits and rewards that are possible by playing the game
well and you avoid much of the suffering which is
is the punishment for playing the game poorly and then
you start to fall in love with the game and
you enjoy the game and then also when you are
fully you become fully conscious of how much of a
game it all is this becomes very liberating and freeing
because you no longer take it too seriously you can
be playful and that is the ultimate end game that
we might say what is the end game of life
the end game of life is to become so masterful
at dealing with all of the self-deception that the mind
constructs that's what we're talking about when we talk about
mind games we're talking about self-deception and manipulations of various
kinds and the illusions that the mind spins when you
become very artful and masterful at catching your own mind
playing all these various kinds of tricks uh and then
you master your own mind in that way then you
can be playful and you can just enjoy life and
it becomes a play it becomes a game and isn't
that what you really want do you want life to
be work or do you want life to be play
do you want life to be a grind or do
you want life to be play you want it to
be play so how do you get it to be
play by recognizing it's a game and then learning the
mechanics and that's what actualize.org is is that it's my
own study of how the game of life is played
and all the mind games that are played by humans
including myself i don't exclude myself from this i'm very
much involved in playing mind games just like we all
are right um it's very much about the quality of
the game you play how artfully you play it you
can get wildly different results depending on how you play
the game and also being conscious of what it is
that you're doing because most people are playing the game
but they're not aware that they're playing the game and
they're in denial that they're playing the game and that's
when you really get yourself into a lot of trouble
the reason scientists and academics get themselves into trouble and
doctors and politicians and spouses and husbands and wives and
lovers and children and business people they get themselves into
trouble because they're denying that they're playing the game they're
not aware of it religious people too i forgot that
one you know religious people people who joined the new
age cults that are out there some of which i've
shared information about on my blog go check that out
i like to share whenever i find videos of interesting
cults i like to share those on my blog because
you know one of the ways if you really want
to get good at mind games is study how others
play mind games and the best mind games are played
by cults and by religion and by science oh boy
those are those are really the only three fields you
got to study to understand mind games really well i
mean i would also include politics in there as well
maybe that's the fourth the fourth key pillar of mind
games and human [ __ ] is those it's cults
it's religion it's science and it's politics so you study
those and the way you can begin studying them is
just look at videos you can look for videos i
mean you can literally go into youtube and just type
in cults and see what kind of interesting cults come
up you'll find all sorts of interesting videos on cults
or religion to type in religion you'll see all sorts
of interesting religious mind games you could type in new
age and see all sorts of wacky new age mind
games politics of course you can type in politics and
you'll see the whole zoo of political mind games uh
now with science it's going to be a little trickier
because if you type in science it's going to seem
like what you get is serious people talking about serious
things but but just just notice that their seriousness itself
is the game um in many ways science is the
most challenging mind game to deconstruct precisely because it's so
serious and uh treats itself as so objective and so
rigorous but see that is the mind game of science
is the objectivity and the rigor of it um but
luckily you don't need to look very far for that
for help deconstructing that because i have a i have
a long ass over 10 hour long series on science
called deconstructing the myth of science part 1 2 3
and i'll probably release some more in the future to
add to that series that will get you started that
is a full deconstruction of science right there and i've
deconstructed other parts of science and other episodes of mine
so um i can help you with that most serious
of work that's personally my deepest passion you see because
you can't realize that all of reality is a mind
game as long as you think physics is real so
you have to deconstruct physics and to deconstruct physics you
got to deconstruct all of science basically and will science
help you to do this no you can't use science
to deconstruct science that's preposterous that's the same as going
into a mormon church or an evangelical church and expecting
them to deconstruct the bible for you they're not going
to they're true believers you see that's where you got
to apply your skepticism you got to see that that's
a bubble that's a bubble that they have a hermetically
sealed ideological bubble that they've constructed the mormons the evangelicals
and also the scientists and the academics which is exactly
why they're all so protective the mormons are as protective
as the evangelicals of their superstitions and uh and so
are the scientists and the academics they're just as they're
just as dogmatic and protective but in fact it's even
worse because at least with the mormon and evangelical you
can see how how obviously dogmatic they are but with
the scientists and academic see they play a deeper game
they're playing a double game they're playing a game within
a game their game is to act as though they're
being humble objective rigorous logical neutral and unbiased that's their
game and when you see that you actually start to
believe it even more than you would believe some passionate
charismatic preacher yelling at you from the pulpit but anyways
so if you haven't noticed what i do with my
blog which i hope you've been checking out you guys
are a lot of you guys are missing out on
this because look look what i've been doing with my
blog over the last three or four years that i've
been running my blog i've been mostly sharing videos and
links and other pieces of information that i find online
that are designed to be like little breadcrumb trails what
is that what is that old story of the the
breadcrumb trails was it it wasn't goalie like it was
somebody i forget exactly who it was that left the
breadcrumbs anyway some some girl that left some breadcrumbs to
find her way back from the evil witch's house or
something like that um it was it hansel and gretel
yeah maybe anyways um i need a refresher on my
folktales so so yeah i'm trying to leave a breadcrumb
trail for you with every blog post where i am
posting little clues you know a video here about a
cult a video here about some political you know nut
job a video here about alex jones a video here
about some scientist saying something delusional a video here about
some um a new age or doing something weird with
the hope that you slowly study these examples and sort
of piece together and start to see that aha there's
something bigger there's a bigger pattern going on here which
is always all a mind game and so i'm trying
to highlight for you like here look you could play
the mind game this way or you could play it
this way it could take the guise of a religious
person it could take the guys of a scientist it
could take the guys of a new ager it could
take the guys of a spiritual guru it could take
the guys of a of a you know a man
or a woman um that's what god is god is
an infinite shape shifter taking all sorts of forms at
all possible forms playing with itself it's a game of
self-deception it's a game of infinite self-deception and you might
wonder what leo why would god be so [ __
] twisted what's what's the game here what's the game
about why does god play games why can't god just
be straight well because of course you're assuming that reality
could exist if god was being straight but if god
was being straight there would be no reality physical reality
itself is god being twisted and not straight your life
the fact that you think you're alive that's the twist
in god's mind if you untwist god's mind you'll stop
being alive you'll stop being human you'll stop believing in
an objective reality you'll stop believing in a physics you'll
stop believing in science and all the things you hold
dear and you'll lose all your biases for your family
and for your dog and for your cat and for
your spouse for your children you'll lose all these biases
and then how can you play the game the game
will be over and even though you love to [
__ ] and moan about how unfair the game is
to you right don't you believe the game is unfair
for you especially because you believe you should have more
you believe you should get better results in the game
you believe you should have more sex more money more
love better house better car better place to live all
that you believe you deserve all that and you love
to [ __ ] and moan about how you're not
getting it and why you're not getting it and why
god's not giving it to you but uh the bottom
line is you actually love you you love the drama
of this game at some level you enjoy the suffering
and you're addicted to playing this game in whatever way
you like to play it if you're doing drugs you're
you love playing the game if you're having sex you
love playing the game if you're jerking off you love
playing the game if you're having children and you love
playing with your children you're playing the game if you
love business and earning money and bossing people around you're
playing the game if you love conquering your competitors you're
playing the game if you love social justice and fighting
for progressive ideas to improve society for the world and
for the downtrodden you're playing the game if you love
defending tradition and traditional values and heritage and preserving society
against the crazy marxists and socialist types and the utopians
you're playing the game you love playing that game you
don't want to give up playing that game and to
play physical physical games out in the world like with
your business to play because you know doing business as
a physical activity we might almost say um that's a
game but that also that game necessitates that you play
games in your mind you see because it's the games
you play in your mind that then dictate how you're
going to run your business and how successful your business
is going to be likewise when you're building a physical
family with children and house and cars and this and
all that you also have to play games in your
mind to do that to sustain that see and so
the function of philosophy is not merely to read books
nor is it to study what the ancient philosophers have
said like plato aristotle descartes and others like them in
fact the studying of the history of philosophy and the
reading of philosophy books is its own mind game the
purpose of that mind game is to prevent you from
realizing the actual mind gain that is being played here
right now in your life because you're not gonna be
able to connect all that ancient knowledge to what is
actually happening in your life today so that's what actualized
europe is trying to do is it's it's really sort
of like a philosophy 2.0 here we're trying to take
academic philosophy and apply it to the actual mind game
that is your life so it actually connects but if
you're not careful you can turn actualize.org into its own
mind game your love your life your ego mind would
love nothing more than to sit eating a bucket of
ice cream every night and just watching hour after hour
of actualizing org videos and navel gazing about it masturbating
about it and uh not changing your life not actually
applying the lessons not actually doing your own investigations and
contemplations into the topics that i talk about just taking
me at my word or debating and arguing with me
which itself is uh a very low form of the
mind game here every profound thing that i say you
have to derive for yourself first of all and then
second of all you have to learn how to how
to how it connects with your life and how you
can use it to improve the artfulness with which you
play the game that's the only point of actualize.org so
philosophy does have a very important point philosophy in a
sense you could define it as the study of the
mechanics of the mind game of life and reality you
really study it deeply and in fact you have a
love for the study of the mind game see most
people love to play the mind game but they don't
love studying how the mind game is played because that's
a meta function you see we talked about that in
the episode called what it means to go meta so
it's not enough to play the game you have to
study the game the game about what does it mean
to win the game what's the difference between people who
are playing the game artfully and those who are not
what causes suffering within the game how do people deceive
themselves within the game what are all the possible ways
and how am i doing that to myself see this
this is true philosophy and when you frame it like
this then you realize that is there anything more important
within the mind game than to realize that it is
a mind game and to study how the mind game
is played what's more important so there's a bit of
a paradox here is that when you first studying when
you first start studying how the mind game is played
and how it is a mind game at first it's
very abstract and it's not practical and people around you
will look at you like you're a little bit nuts
like why are you even studying this stuff what's the
point they don't see the point because they're not thinking
very far they're only thinking about how do i play
the next move so they're like desperate chess players just
looking to to make the next right move to save
their king because they're about to get checkmated that's the
that's the desperate situation that most people in life find
themselves in but see if you're a wise chess player
you realize that it's already too late that game they're
playing they're going to lose it's already too late what
they're doing if you really want to play chess well
you got to study long before you actually enter into
any competition you got to actually study by yourself the
different moves and the different opening tactics and gambits that
exist within chess you got to study the history of
chess and all the famous games that have been played
and you gotta play test games on yourself against yourself
or some other opponent who's like a teacher of yours
that you're practicing with who can show you the different
moves and the different tricks that exist you see and
so you prepare yourself but see when you're preparing yourself
and you're sitting there reading books about chess somebody who's
just eager to make the next move in a chess
game he's going to be like why are you why
are you reading that book why are you preparing just
play but if you play you're going to be a
fool and you're going to get a fools mate see
so when you first start start studying philosophy it's going
to seem very abstract and you're going to go through
a phase of what might seem like mental masturbation and
a lot of confusion and you're not going to know
what's up what's down you're not going to know who
to trust what book to read like you're going to
be confused and lost and so i went through years
of that and and uh what got me through that
it's just my love for the process itself so i
i didn't enter into philosophy with the hope of like
okay how can i quickly just get this over with
so that i have all the answers i just want
the answers no for me it was just an exploration
i wanted to explore the mechanics of the mind and
that was fascinating in and of itself for me i
didn't even need it to be practical or applicable i
didn't i didn't need my philosophy to get me laid
i didn't need a direct path from philosophy to millions
of dollars i didn't need a direct path from doing
philosophy to having a great career or becoming famous or
raising a family it was just for the the love
of truth and understanding because there's a there was just
an innate recognition intuition that truth is valuable in and
of itself understanding the mechanics of the mind is valuable
in and of itself it's interesting the mind is an
interesting thing to study because you're using it all the
time anyways but then what that ultimately led to is
all sorts of practical ramifications for example one of the
practical consequences of my early doing of philosophy is that
i became immune to religion to religious indoctrination of every
kind i became immune to it why because i studied
the mechanics of self-deception so deeply that now when some
religious person is talking to me i can see through
all of their [ __ ] it also made me
immune to cults i'm immune to cults because i can
clearly see the game that the cult leader is playing
and that all their followers are playing it's all also
made me immune for example to the sort of corporate
capitalist rat race a lot of people get lost in
that they think well leo i'm not stupid i'm not
a stupid religious person and i'm not stupid enough to
follow fall for some sort of idiotic you know sex
cult or whatever um yeah okay fine first of all
you're even that you're overestimating you could easily fall prey
to one of those but anyways but then you get
you fall into the trap of just materialism chasing material
success and money and climbing the corporate ladder and all
that sort of stuff but so see i uh i
saw through that game too and then if you don't
fall into that trap then you'll fall into the trap
of politics you'll subscribe to either a right-wing ideology or
a left-wing ideology whatever or even a sort of a
centrist neo-liberal maybe corporatist ideology you'll subscribe to that and
then you'll you'll play that game for your life for
the rest of your life because you won't see how
there's self-deception and bias in all those sorts of games
or maybe you'll fall into the mind game of like
becoming a um an athlete you know one of the
saddest things that i think almost nobody talks about is
like we had the olymp olympics recently the tokyo olympics
and um like when i see those young olympic gymnasts
and athletes doing their you know fancy stuff in competition
like to me it's like it's almost like watching a
dog show have you seen those dog shows where they
they uh strut out one of these silly looking dogs
and it just looks like a silly dog because it's
like a poodle and it's all trimmed up and stuff
and it's got this weird you know sort of elitist
looking aristocratic look to it because it's supposed to you
know impress the judges and they they strut strut out
this dog it looks ridiculous it jumps through some hoops
and stuff and then it gets some award and then
like i mean it's a mockery it's a mockery of
life and that's exactly what these uh poor uh olympic
kids have been brainwashed into i mean the olympics is
basically a cult because you don't enter the olympics unless
you've been brainwashed from birth into that basically you have
to start training for the olympics from like five years
old and your parents basically have to put you up
to it and you know by the time you're 15
or 20 you've been so brainwashed into this that you
actually believe that you enjoy what you're doing you actually
believe that you're living a good life by training every
day for five ten hours a day and jumping through
all these hoops and getting awards and applause and praise
from your parents from your teachers from onlookers and spectators
and you actually believe that this is this is some
sort of way to live a rich life i mean
it's you're just a dog in a dog and pony
show and it's sad because a lot of these athletes
will just like break an ankle and then their whole
career will be over they won't even make it to
the olympics or um even they make it to the
olympics and even worse is that they make it to
the olympics and they they win the gold medal and
then what they win five gold medals so what and
then what you're you're you're 20 years old you've won
five gold medals and what what are you doing with
your life it was all a mind game you're gonna
be depressed and miserable with your sitting at home with
your five gold olympic medals around your neck crying eating
a bucket of ice cream that's that's what it's going
to lead to right you see so you've been brainwashed
you've been in a cult and uh you know one
of the biggest cults i avoided was academia you know
when i was in university i was seriously considering you
know like what am i gonna do with my life
and i was seriously considered becoming a philosophy professor i've
talked about this in the past um i was really
supposed to be a professor in academia in a university
somewhere and then very very quickly astutely as i started
to research i actually bought a book about how to
become a professor i researched that and i realized the
whole thing is a [ __ ] racket becoming becoming
an academic professor is a [ __ ] racket and
academia is just a cult and i realized very quickly
that the reason that i wanted to do philosophy was
to get to the truth and i realized that i'm
not going to get to the truth through academia i
realized that it was just a [ __ ] it's
a cult it's not about the truth at all you
can't get to the truth through academia which is why
no academic understands what what truth is no academic can
tell you what the truth is just ask them they'll
they'll mumble and stumble and they won't give you a
clear answer because they don't know so so i avoided
that all because i was just self introspecting reflecting and
studying the mechanics of of self-deception now that doesn't mean
that i've that i'm immune to self-deception again people get
this so wrong i talk about self-deception a lot that
doesn't mean that i'm a master of it and that
i'm not capable of deceiving myself i certainly am and
in fact i'm constantly aware of ways in which i'm
deceiving myself that i haven't let go of yet or
i haven't fully brought myself to surrender yet i'm constantly
aware of that it's a never-ending process of being aware
of that um and there are so many other ways
that you can get tricked in life in fact i'm
gonna have a whole episode coming up soon in the
future where i'm gonna talk i'm gonna teach you actually
how to avoid getting scammed and conned in life you
want that episode it's a very practical one you'll love
it um i have a lot of experience with how
to avoid getting scammed and conned and tricked and i'll
explain that then but um but yeah i mean um
it's very easy to lose all your money in financial
investment mind games investing is a whole mind game the
entire investment industry house cards i've also avoided political dogma
like some of you will think no leo you're you're
politically dogmatic and all this you're you're such a leftist
but uh but um but i i also avoided actually
uh getting stuck into a political ideology um thanks to
this work thanks to this philosophy uh i've avoided a
lot of potential relationship problems that i could have had
as well i haven't been perfect there are traps i've
fallen into for sure i'd have to think about it
deeply to to remember all the traps i've fallen into
and [Music] but for the most part i've avoided a
lot of [ __ ] that a lot of people
do not avoid especially youngsters as they're growing up simply
because they take these things for granted they take philosophy
for granted they think it's all just fun and games
and that they don't need to study philosophy well when
you don't study philosophy what ends up happening is that
you you become a fool and you have to learn
the hard way see with philosophy you can foresee the
traps and preemptively avoid them whereas when you don't study
philosophy you don't see the meta patterns you the only
way to discover the patterns is by hitting your face
into a brick wall and then each time you're doing
that you're losing five ten years of your life like
you hit your face into a brick wall of some
new age cult that's five years of your life right
there that you just lost maybe more maybe you'll also
lose your family as a result of that maybe you'll
even lose your entire life savings as a result of
that that's how these cults work or you hit your
face into the into the wall of the brick wall
of religion you get indoctrinated into that for 10 20
years you've lost half your life with that toxic ideology
and even if you leave it remnants of it will
remain deeply rooted in your mind for for the rest
of your life you'll be suffering with that or you
get into academia or you get into the corporate rat
race that's 10 20 years lost right there and also
your health you're gonna lose your health in that rat
race too and you're probably gonna lose your wife and
your husband and your children maybe even from that or
you get into investing cryptocurrency what other new fad there
is and ntfs or whatever they're called um nfts i
don't i don't even know what they're called non-fungible tokens
um so yeah like you get involved in something like
that and then you lose your life savings in that
why because you didn't realize that all of investing is
a mind game you actually you actually were greedy and
you thought you're going to get rich you weren't skeptical
enough of your own greed and you know as they
say pigs get slaughtered on wall street that's how investing
works i actually have some interesting investment investment stories but
i think i'll save them for later um i actually
when i was really young my brother and i we
invested in uh early internet stocks like aol stocks back
in in the late 90s when the first internet bubble
didn't burst yet and we we actually made like over
a hundred thousand dollars um just on aol stock very
interesting of course we lost it all when it burst
but that was one of my first experiences with some
of the you know the trickeries of investing which is
why i'm still careful with it today but anyways yeah
so so what's the point the point is that it
is a game but it's also a serious game because
it's the only game in town these mind games are
all that there is that's why it's so difficult to
see that it's a mind game because when all you
have is an infinite mind game well you confuse it
for reality some people get bummed out when they hear
that reality is just a mind game everything's a mind
game but don't take it that way why are you
bummed out about that this should be the happiest news
you've ever heard why would you want reality to be
something other than a game don't you like games games
are fun games are play that's what you want reality
to be you don't want it to be anything else
you don't want it to be real why why do
you get bummed out when i tell you that reality
is an illusion or a hallucination that's the best possible
news don't you see then you can just play you
can play in a virtual reality in a dream that's
the best that's not something to be depressed about like
when you realize that your dog and your cat are
imaginary that's not something to bum you out that just
makes your dog and your cat all the more cool
how cool is it to have an imaginary cat an
imaginary dog that you're hallucinating you see when it's imaginary
then nothing is lost when it goes away your cat
and your dog can die and it's fine it's okay
they were imaginary but you could also learn to enjoy
them while they're here so what i recommend is that
you actually treat the game seriously especially at first later
when you become very masterful at it then you can
open yourself up to play more but at the beginning
especially if you're young treat the game seriously see a
mistake would be if you say oh well leo says
it's all just a mind game so i'm gonna go
do some heroin what's wrong with that it's just a
game and then i'm gonna go just have sex indiscriminately
and i'm just gonna like not play not not do
any work or discipline myself in any way i'm just
going to play video games all day and smoke weed
and sit in my mouth on my mother's couch in
her basement and i'm not going to go out and
socialize i'm not going to i'm not going to push
myself to talk to girls and to and to to
develop relationship skills i'm not i'm not going to develop
any career skills i'm not going to go to school
i'm not going to get good grades because leo good
grades that's just all a game and of course it
is grades mean absolutely nothing it's all just a game
but at the same time there is a difference between
being an f student and an a student and even
though grades are all just a game i was an
a student and it still matters reading books educating yourself
developing career skills building discipline all these things matter it's
it's all about mastering the game when life becomes really
shitty is when you don't develop mastery of the game
and you think you can just bumble through it that's
when your life can really suck so there's sort of
a paradox here where on the one hand you have
to be very pragmatic in fact i would say ruthlessly
pragmatic in life you have to take things like money
and business and your career and skill development and discipline
and motivation and relationships to take these things seriously and
you have to do what is necessary to be done
to succeed in those areas of your life on the
other hand you have to also be metaphysical you can't
just do that which is utilitarian in life and expect
to have a good life that is the trap of
the rat race that is just success for successes sake
you have to be metaphysical where you can stand back
and you can observe and to see the true nature
of why those practical things are being done and what
they're being done for and you have to put them
into a proper larger context if that context is missing
that's the problem with most successful people is that they're
very pragmatic but they're missing the metaphysical component on the
other hand you have the other types of people which
are the the hippie new age people who tend to
be very metaphysical very spiritual but they're completely lacking in
the pragmatic aspect of life they're not able to earn
enough money to pay their bills or to handle other
practical things and so that's one of the things that
i want to really teach you with actualize.org and to
demonstrate to you with actualize.org is the idea that it
to live a good life you really need a synthesis
a beautiful synthesis a sort of a yin-yang synthesis of
the pragmatic and the metaphysical and you got to combine
the two together and you got to let the metaphysical
inform the pragmatic and you got to let the pragmatics
also to some degrees inform the metaphysics of your life
and it's by by combining these two things in a
in a nuanced intelligent way that you get the best
possible life and if you only go for one or
for the other then it's not going to work and
so what i see is that most people they either
fall too much into one camp or into the other
camp they're not able to even maintain a career so
they just sort of want to leave society they want
to go live in an ashram and just meditate or
something like that and then they're they're basically helpless people
they need to leech off of others in life to
feed themselves and to clothe themselves and have shelter there's
those types of people and then there's the sort of
strictly business people business oriented people who just go out
and do a bunch of business and they become very
successful and all that but they're but they're gonna miss
the happiness and satisfaction they're gonna miss all of the
spiritual connection to reality they're gonna miss god love um
truth beauty they're gonna miss out on all of that
and so a lot of my content alternates back and
forth sometimes i will shoot an episode that's very metaphysical
other times i will shoot an episode that's very pragmatic
and sometimes people look at that and say leo that's
very kind of schizophrenic of you like choose one lane
stay in one lane and my point is that no
i'm i the whole point is that we're we're interweaving
these things together like a double helix that's how it
has to be because one of my missions is to
make philosophy practical but while i'm trying to make philosophy
practical i can't sell out its heart and soul just
strictly for the purposes of your survival so a lot
of people tell me like leo you know that most
of your people can't fathom and access these you know
deep levels of consciousness or some of these abstract metaphysical
truths why don't you make a bunch of videos that
are just like very practical teach us how to have
better sex teach us how to make money teach us
how to start a business teacher i could do all
that um and that's most what most of you need
but um but also there's a lot of that already
on the internet you can find practical stuff practical teachings
you can find that's that's most of what self-help is
about what's rare is a is an intelligent synthesis of
these two how do you combine these two things that's
what's really tricky that's the fine tightrope walk that we're
doing here with actualize.org so anyways i don't think i
concluded this thread earlier i was talking about how when
you first start doing philosophy it's very abstract you go
through a period of a few years where you're kind
of lost in theories and you're confused and all this
and maybe you think it's all pointless you don't know
what makes sense what's true you just keep keep going
and keep pushing and also as you're doing that keep
one foot in the practical side of things you can
keep doing your philosophy and at the same time also
building some career skills you should have some practical skills
that you're building for example build some computer skills build
some drawing skills build some film editing skills build some
music composition skills build some writing skills build some speaking
skills these like just down to earth skills this is
what actually people will hire you for you need some
of that for example when i was when i was
in university i was studying philosophy um i wasn't just
fooling myself at all i can just study philosophy and
everything is going to somehow work itself out in the
future i knew that i was studying philosophy but i'm
not going to get paid for philosophy i knew that
it doesn't take a genius to know that so i
had a plan i had a backup plan while i
was learning philosophy because philosophy doesn't have to take that
much time to learn i was also teaching myself game
design that was my practical skill set game design i
was studying how to build games video games um i
learned technical skills in scripting programming web development ui interface
photoshop 3d studio max animation software zbrush like i learned
very technical skills like very [ __ ] technical skills
in addition to doing my philosophy because that's how i
was going to pay my bills so make sure you
have something like that going for you you need a
practical plan for the material things in life and you
got to take those seriously and um you know i
was i was ruthlessly pragmatic when i was when i
was starting my first business my first business had nothing
to do with personal development i didn't even know personal
development existed when i started my first business and i
didn't know anything about spirituality right i was ruthlessly pragmatic
and you have to be to start a business because
business is about ruthless pragmatism you can't go into business
with your airy fairy new age ideas god is not
going to save you in business the only person that
will save you in business is yourself and you got
to be very careful with the finances and with how
you design your product how you market your product who
you market it to you got to have planning for
all of that it has to be realistic it has
to it has to work in the real world real
strategy go watch my episode called uh old really old
one i think it's called strategic thinking it's very good
episode oldie but a goodie so so i was ruthlessly
pragmatic and if i wasn't there was no way i
would be able to make it to where i am
today so that was a period of my life where
i was ruthlessly pragmatic also when i got into pickup
i was ruthlessly pragmatic when it came to pick up
and to getting better with women with dating women and
i did that for a few years and i did
the business for a few years and so i swung
my pendulum towards the pragmatism side and then once my
business was established and i was earning some decent money
earning six figures on a passive income from that and
getting some success with pickup and stuff like that then
more of my time was freed up because business takes
a lot of time um more of my time freed
up and then i was able to swing my pendulum
towards the opposite direction i started reading more books more
philosophy doing that thinking about deep things studying self-help and
i swung the pendulum to the other end and i
became more metaphysical and then after years of eve you
know i started doing very kind of practical self-help at
first but then eventually that practical self-help got into really
metaphysical types of self-help and led to ultimately spirituality led
to psychedelics and then the psychedelic sort of blew me
open into the really crazy abstract very philosophical metaphysical spiritual
dimensions of life and when i swung my pendulum in
that direction then my business suffered because i wasn't being
that practical and my results would pick up suffer too
because i wasn't being very practical i stopped going out
that's right and that's okay the point is that you're
gonna be swinging back and forth throughout your life you're
gonna have those phases and chapters in your life go
check out my episode called life unfolds in chapters and
phases um and then you combine the two you combine
the two because most people think of philosophers as being
very impractical people you want to avoid that trap you
want to make sure that your philosophy is not purely
academic and then some people complain like oh leo i've
watched a lot of your videos and they're getting too
philosophical for me and i'm not doing enough practical stuff
in my life so i'm gonna drop actualize that organ
i'm just gonna go away and i'm just gonna do
the practical stuff okay fine you can do that but
while you're doing the practical stuff you can still a
little bit each day you can sprinkle in a little
bit of theory and abstract and philosophical stuff right because
like i've talked about in my previous episode about how
you know very valuable things take a long time to
develop they require development over time in that episode i
talked about how you want to plan ahead and invest
in things so there are certain things that you can
invest a little bit into each day where you're going
to regret not having done so so for example like
invest 30 to 60 minutes every day reading books high
quality books even if you're doing something very pragmatic like
you're building a business okay fine by day build your
[ __ ] business work for 10 hours on your
business by day and then in the evening to relax
and i used to do this when i was building
my business spend 30 to 60 minutes reading something that
has nothing to do with your business something philosophical something
metaphysical something spiritual that doesn't mean you're gonna have to
go and embody everything you read and embody that enlightenment
that you're reading about right then and there no you're
gonna be focused on your business for 10 hours a
day for the next three four years fine but in
those three four years you will also if you keep
reading you know spiritual books for 60 minutes a day
in those four years can you imagine how much material
you're gonna process and how much deeper your foundation is
gonna be then once your business is established then you
can spend you know you can swing your pendulum and
then you can actually go and work really hard on
actualizing all that theory that you've been reading about like
that see like that a lot of spiritual people struggle
with with ruthless pragmatism and there is a sort of
an existential trade-off here what you'll notice is that a
lot of the greatest yogis and mystics and gurus that
a lot of them are not so concerned with pragmatic
stuff like if if you think about someone like rama
maharshi you know he lived in a cave he didn't
give a [ __ ] at all about pragmatic stuff
he didn't care about business about money about anything just
lived in a cave he was very much on this
end of the purely metaphysical um and that that can
work in rare cases that can work it worked for
him it might work for a few of you but
for the majority of you you're not you're not that
radical and you're not that conscious so it's not going
to work for you so for you you need some
some more more middle path there um and i recommend
you take on that challenge i remember when i was
first starting with philosophy i had this sort of utopian
idea that i would just become a pure philosopher and
just study philosophy and nothing else in life i wouldn't
concern myself with business with marketing with any of that
so just pure philosophy and and my dad and my
parents they basically sort of tried to disabuse me of
that notion by telling me like you got to be
practical in life like what are you actually going to
be doing after all your philosophy so that that helped
me to to also realize and appreciate the importance of
the pragmatic um and so my first business really taught
me to be ruthlessly pragmatic and that was such a
valuable lesson even though it was painful in many respects
and i didn't want to do it because my natural
inclination is to be more metaphysical than pragmatic but um
you know sometimes you gotta go into territory where you
don't feel comfortable and you just gotta master it anyways
and so even though business is not my forte you
know i mastered or got proficient at at least certain
aspects of business and marketing that i usually would be
philosophically opposed to and that helped to round me out
and eventually that got me to where i am now
i couldn't be where i am now there couldn't be
an actualized org if i wasn't ruthlessly pragmatic back then
for a certain period of time and i had to
be ruthlessly pragmatic even to start and to launch actualize.org
it couldn't have gotten this successful without doing that so
you know ultimately what you want to be is you
want to be flexible enough to apply the right kind
of strategy in the right kind of situation sometimes a
life situation requires you to be more philosophical abstract and
metaphysical and spiritual to resolve that problem and then other
times a life situation actually requires you to be very
ruthless and pragmatic and material to resolve a problem and
one of the mistakes is when you misapply one or
the other for example if you have a if you
have a physical ailment like let's say you have a
cancer or a broken leg or maybe a like a
a viral infection or something see you can try to
apply a philosophical solution to that problem or a material
solution a material solution would be like going to the
doctor and getting a cast for your leg a more
metaphysical solution might be to say oh you know i'm
just going to suffer it i'm just going to tough
it out and meditate my way through it or maybe
i'm going to go to some new age spiritual healer
who will magically heal my bone or something and in
this case the proper solution is probably to go to
the doctor to get a cast not to meditate through
it or to go to some new age you know
healer but then there are other problems you might have
where it is appropriate to use the more metaphysical philosophical
new agey spiritual approach because it's it's a it's a
non-material problem it's hard to fix a non-material problem with
a material solution so for example you have a if
you have bad self-esteem you're not going to fix that
with a trophy wife or with a with having children
or by earning a bunch of money or by becoming
famous that's not going to solve your low self-esteem problem
that's a that's a non-material problem that's going to require
a non-material probably spiritual solution if you're struggling to attract
women for example there's a very easy material solution to
that you know what you do you start going out
every night and talking to women and that's precisely what
the majority of guys don't want to do they want
to have some sort of theoretical solution there is no
theoretical solution to the problem of sex go where the
women are and then you'll have sex with some of
them just by fluke luck that's the solution to that
problem now you could say oh leo but isn't there
a high level solution where you become so metaphysical so
enlightened and so awakened that you don't even want sex
anymore what about that yes interestingly enough there is such
a solution although it's a very radical solution that's not
going to work for most people because see most guys
who are too scared and too weak to go out
and talk to women at night is that guy going
to reach a level of awakening where he has transcended
sex no no [ __ ] way and to even
plant that idea in his mind is ridiculous now can
it be done yes it can be done by one
in a million people it will be done but it's
not appropriate advice for most guys see so sometimes there's
a metaphysical solution to a problem sometimes a physical sometimes
there's multiple levels of solution and sometimes you have to
sort of step your way up the ladder of solutions
where you do you do a little bit of a
practical solution physical solution material solution and then that that
increases your that makes you a little bit less desperate
but it doesn't solve the problem all the way and
then you're going to take another leap and swing your
pendulum towards the metaphysical spiritual domain and then that will
maybe help you to get to another level and even
when you get there maybe there will be an even
higher level where you swing it back and you go
back into the physical and then maybe you have you
know you get yourself a physical wife or husband on
top of your awakening see so in the end it
is all a mind game but it's all a mind
game so treat the mind games seriously but also have
fun you
