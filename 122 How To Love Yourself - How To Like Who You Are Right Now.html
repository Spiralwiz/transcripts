            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ufNOWvcfrE4' target='_blank'>How To Love Yourself - How To Like Who You Are Right Now</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Self-dislike and focus on imperfections</b>: Leo addresses the issue of self-dislike, stating that this feeling often stems from focusing on perceived imperfections about oneself, whether physical, behavioral, or circumstantial. He emphasizes that all individuals have these qualities, yet it is harmful to obsess over them and let them dictate self-worth.
</li><li><b>Imperfections in context</b>: Leo suggests seeing one's life, past, and future in a broader context. He advises us to accept that imperfections are a small part of this bigger picture and not to magnify their significance.
</li><li><b>Personal negativity impacts others</b>: Leo alerts us that a negative self-image can spread to others, affecting relationships negatively. He warns that constant self-criticism can lead to spreading misery inadvertently.
</li><li><b>Exercise for self-love</b>: Leo proposes an exercise that promotes self-love, encouraging viewers to look at themselves in the mirror, focus on their reflection, and repeat the phrase "I love and accept you exactly as you are" 20 times without succumbing to self-criticism. This exercise aims to promote self-acceptance, reminding viewers they are more than just their flaws.
</li><li><b>Interplay between self-acceptance and desire for change</b>: Leo discusses the delicate balance between accepting oneself as they are and the desire to change or improve certain aspects. He advises those who want to change to attempt to do so, but if it's not possible or desirable, they should shift focus away from the imperfection and focus on other positive aspects of life for remedying detrimental self-judgment.
</li><li><b>Focus as a choice</b>: He emphasizes the notion of focus as a choice. Leo affirms that individuals can guide their focus and by choosing to refocus off of one's imperfections, they'll recognize the insignificance of these flaws in the broader context of life. 
</li><li><b>Importance of unconditional self-love</b>: Finally, he stresses the importance of unconditional self-love, encouraged by the exercise previously mentioned. By doing this, one would not just improve their life but also their relationships, as it would reduce the spread of negativity.
</li><li><b>Self-Criticism and Self-Love</b>: Leo Gura insists that by loving ourselves for who we are, we learn more about our inherent prejudice against ourselves. He suggests that the act of telling ourselves, "I love you", could reveal deep-seated self-criticisms. Some may find that they experience hesitation or discomfort in expressing self-love, indicating a potential need for self-acceptance.
</li><li><b>Paradox of Self-Help</b>: Leo explains the paradox inherent in self-help, which lies between the need for self-acceptance and the impulse to improve and grow. He argues that both these aspects are not contradictory but complementary and need to be blended in our personal growth journey. Self-love and acceptance should not be seen as an excuse for lack of progress but as a foundation for continual self-development.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Self-Acceptance</b>: Regardless of our perceived imperfections and problems, Leo encourages individuals to accept who they are in the present moment and use this acceptance as a catalyst for future growth and development. He suggests that our true identity is not limited to our bodies, our flaws, or our current circumstances, but includes a more expansive and possibly spiritual aspect of ourselves.
</li><li><b>Potential for Change and Decision-making</b>: In life, we are not confined to a set path. Like a helicopter that can travel in any direction, we also have the freedom to change various aspects of ourselves and our lives. Moreover, accepting ourselves just as we are requires a mere split-second decision that nobody else can make but ourselves.
</li><li><b>Utility of Self-Acceptance</b>: If we truly accept and love ourselves, we can more readily share our unique gifts with the world and lead a more fulfilling life. This self-acceptance doesn't lead to laxity or mediocrity, but acts as a solid base from which we continually strive to become more 'awesome'. And this journey of becoming increasingly 'awesome' is entirely within our control and is predominantly a mental exercise.
</li><li><b>Importance of Continuous Learning and Personal Development</b>: Leo encourages viewers to sign up for his free newsletter, emphasizing the need to remain updated on personal development. He promises it contains strategies, techniques, and touts it as some of the best personal growth information available. He reinforces that staying attuned to our mindsets, thoughts, and emotions allows us to overcome the internal obstacles preventing us from living extraordinary lives.
