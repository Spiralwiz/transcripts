[Music] developing introspection life's most important skill here's the number
one technique for increasing your intelligence wisdom and for escaping
all the mechanisms of self-deception and delusion which are common
to the human mind which i've discussed at length in
the past in my videos and that is feeling inward
or introspection introspection we could also call it self-reflection consciousness
self-awareness observation in the past i've used all of these
words in various different contexts they can have slightly different
meanings but for the purpose of this discussion here they're
all going to be synonymous i like the word introspection
i like the word self-reflection even more uh consciousness of
course is a great word but most people are confused
about what consciousness is consciousness tends to have a lot
of like ambiguity around it and various sorts of metaphysical
implications that are tricky for people to understand awareness of
course is a great word it's redundant to say self-awareness
because all awareness is self-awareness and we've talked about observation
in the past i've talked about how learning equals observation
i have a whole episode titled that a lot of
times i'm sure you must have wondered this throughout all
this work that we've done together by now people ask
me leo but how can i tell what's true because
you're sharing all these different ideas and different theories and
models and i've been reading all these books and i've
been listening to all these different youtube channels and gurus
talking about this and that and science and religion and
spirituality and rationality all these different fields tell me different
things they contradict one another even within science there are
contradictions even within spirituality in the new age there are
contradictions and teachers and gurus disagree so leo how is
it how is there any hope at all to find
out what's true if i can't rely on my culture
to tell me what's true if i can't rely on
my school teachers to tell me what's true if i
can't rely on my parents and my family if i
can't rely on my friends if i can't rely on
my on my professors in college if i can't even
rely on science and logic leo how is it possible
to know what's true have you thought about that wonder
that it's good to reach this point this sort of
point of of deep doubt uh it's a doubt so
deep that you wonder maybe it's not even possible you
start to lose hope you start to become nihilistic about
everything but it is possible and that possibility is your
ability to feel inwards and to introspect you have that
capacity this capacity is greatly atrophied and underutilized in our
society this capacity is generally not taught in mainstream circles
it's not taught in school it's not taught in university
it's not taught by most religions in fact most of
society is geared towards getting you not to feel inwards
and feeling inwards has been much demonized and pooh-poohed to
many scientists and academics t or skeptics or rationalists this
idea that you can feel inwards and discover the truth
this this idea seems laughable to them as though like
well this is just subjective those are just your subjective
feelings man leo they're just feelings you can't trust your
emotions you'd be stupid to do that and yet what
are you trusting when you buy into that very argument
you're trusting your logical mind why are you trusting that
you see feeling inwards here is a very robust concept
and we're going to go into a lot of detail
here to just to show you how robust it is
because when i just say feel inwards uh it's not
just a matter of thinking about something and it's not
just a matter of feeling some emotion and reacting emotionally
about something the way that most people would think it's
much more robust and profound than that so introspection is
the ability to truthfully observe the dynamics of your own
psychology and mind and truthfully there is a very key
word truthful observation it takes practice developing this skill and
it is a skill of introspection or feeling inwards in
a truthful impartial unbiased accurate faithful manner because of course
as we've discussed in the past your mind is always
playing tricks on you and so how do you overcome
those tricks well by developing this skill this skill is
a meta ability it's the ability to observe all the
other functions of the mind impartially from a sort of
a a distance an elevated perspective a meta position such
that you're not getting enmeshed and entangled in the everyday
functions of the mind for most people this introspection skill
on a scale of one to a hundred is developed
to maybe a three or a five even in psychologists
professionals who you would think are good at this and
philosophers academic philosophers professional philosophers this skill is very underdeveloped
maybe it's a 10 for those people 10 out of
100 and this of course is a huge problem from
this problem stems all basically all other human individual and
social problems so let's start to show you just how
sprawling this skill of introspection is and just how much
there is here to introspect about so when you're going
to be doing this introspection you're going to be very
importantly noticing your emotional states and their causes you need
to be able to distinguish and to feel fear anger
sadness loneliness frustration desire hurt craving happiness you need to
notice when you are when you are afraid you need
to be able to notice when you are angry you
need to be able to notice when you are jealous
or envious you need to be able to notice when
you're in a certain type of mood a good one
or a bad one just this category of of of
feeling your emotional states and introspecting as to their causes
what is causing these states it's not just a matter
of oh yeah i'm angry it's also why am i
angry what is causing this anger and a lot of
times it's not somebody else it's really how you're thinking
about the situation it's your belief system it's the meanings
you're attaching to things it's things that you're denying right
there's always a deeper hidden layer a sort of a
subconscious layer that you need to get at which is
the true cause of many of the emotions that you
feel so a lot of the emotions you feel you
can't just trust them blindly and then act on them
you need to go underneath them and to figure out
what's actually sourcing these emotions why are you having them
consistently and so there's there's a lot just to work
on here with emotions most people have terrible emotional intelligence
they're not able to distinguish between these very different kinds
of emotions they're not able to tell when they're afraid
and when they're angry they're just acting out their fear
or they're acting out their anger they're not able to
feel inside and to see how their thought patterns for
example are being subtly shaped by the anger inside of
them or the fear inside of them see and these
can be very subtle you might say well leo yeah
i know what i'm afraid i know when i'm angry
that's easy no you don't sure there are very gross
instances of fear and anger which are obvious to most
people when you're terrified in a panic when you know
some burglar is breaking into your house or when somebody
has really got you pissed off and you're flying off
the handle sure you know that but even in those
cases you're you're more so controlled by that fear and
by that anger you're enmeshed in it more so than
you're able to actually be aware of of it but
fear and anger usually these are subtle things that subtly
shape your everyday life you feel fear dozens of times
a day you feel anger many times per day but
usually you're not aware of it you're not aware of
how it's shaping you where that anger and fear is
coming from jealousy and envy for example these can be
very subtle emotions they don't broadcast themselves within your consciousness
as just like oh yeah i'm jealous of that that
lady there i'm jealous of that guy there for for
his success or how many subscribers he has or how
much money he makes or how good he looks or
whatever these are usually very subtle and so it's a
skill to be able to feel to feel into this
stuff and it is like feeling you're feeling into it
but it's not like you're reacting based on these feelings
i'm not saying that you need to be some emotional
mess and now a slave to your emotions uh i
mean it's difficult to describe because it's sort of slippery
and vague and our society has conditioned us to think
that the most real things in the world the most
important aspects of life are those which are tangible material
quantifiable and easily explained without any kind of vagueness or
fuzziness to them they are logical they are razor sharp
they're scientific and this whole notion of feeling into your
feelings or just feeling into your own body and into
your own mind this seems like some sort of sorcery
or woo stuff and it seems like it's not objective
enough to be able to sort of rely on it
because you might wonder well how do i know that
i'm feeling into things properly that's right it's a skill
it's a skill similar to surfing or skateboarding it's a
skill similar to a golf swing where you can't quantify
the perfect golf swing you can't write an equation for
it you can't write a scientific manual on the perfect
golf swing i mean you can try but actually by
doing that what that does is that puts you into
your head and that will ruin your golf swing if
you have all those equations and formulas and quantifiable procedures
and steps methodically that you go through when you're doing
your golf swing see that's actually gonna make your golf
swing unnatural so it's something you have to practice over
years and you have to develop a feel for and
then you can get really good at it such that
you can rely on it you can even bet your
life on it and it becomes more accurate and more
reliable than any kind of scientific formula or piece of
logic or any quantifiable thing and that's what life is
like life is like surfing you gotta get a feel
for it and the best people that are able to
live life most excellently are those who are doing it
by feel not through some sort of pure logic or
some sort of formulaic way it's uh it's a sort
of a soft fuzzy way of going about life but
that's just that's just life and um and it makes
it makes this the problems that it makes this skill
difficult to teach because i can't just give you a
one two three step formula that you follow for doing
perfect introspection and of course it can't be that way
because if there was this sort of formula then you
see uh any kind of formula like that is very
easy to to defeat similar to how in war or
in a chess match or war on the battlefield you
know uh you can't have a one two three step
linear procedure for how to win every battle or every
war or every chess match it's dynamic it's fluid you
have to adapt to the situation and one of the
most important aspects of it is that it's not formulaic
see because if you have a formula and i know
your formula as your opponent i can then beat your
formula uh so you can't live life in this sort
of formulaic way you have to be able to adapt
and you have to be very creative and this is
actually what makes life interesting and not boring this is
what makes you different than a robot you're a conscious
robot we might say but you have to take control
of this consciousness you have to be able to feel
into yourself you have to be able to also notice
your thoughts beyond your emotional states you have to notice
your thoughts and how your thoughts work why do you
think the thoughts that you think like you just had
a thought right now you had a thought why did
you have that thought where'd it come from what sourced
that thought what motivated it some deep need or craving
that you had some emotion that you had some egotistical
impulse or bias that you had which is driving your
thinking you also need to see and notice the interplay
between your thoughts and your emotions how the two feed
into each other in a strange loop sort of fashion
where thoughts can create emotions and emotions can create thoughts
you need to be able to also notice your rationalizations
justifications and excuses the mind the ego mind is a
brilliant rationalizer and justifier of almost anything the ego mind
can literally justify and rationalize anything it wants no matter
how heinous how biased how selfish how devilish how evil
how false it is the ego mind can make it
look true can make it seem justified and valid you
need to be able to notice that within yourself when
your mind is doing that to you the only solution
to that the only counter measure is to be able
to feel into it and through it to see through
the sham of it to see how your own mind
is rationalizing and you can actually watch it rationalize maybe
you're in an argument with somebody and then your mind
starts to rationalize about why you're right and you got
to be able to see through the illusion of that
and just see oh to notice that oh yeah that's
there it goes again my mind is going again now
it's rationalizing look how i'm rationalizing about that person and
how they're wrong and how i'm right and all of
this and i'm building a whole story around it and
i'm making excuses and i'm justifying why i hurt them
because in the past they hurt me and that now
makes it seem justified see most people aren't capable of
this because they haven't trained this muscle this is the
introspection muscle this skill that we're talking about you need
to also be able to notice your judgments your demonizations
of others and when you're blaming and scapegoating others this
is huge this just this alone you can spend the
next 10 years of your life just working on noticing
how much you judge all the ways in which you
judge the gross and the subtle the ways in which
you demonize and blame others you also need to notice
how you play victim there's lots of ways that you
play victim in different areas of your life i have
episodes in the past specifically about victim mentality victim thinking
how to stop being a victim part one part two
go check those out those are some old classic episodes
of mine um and i'll probably be talking about it
more in the future but our mind loves to play
victim especially for example within relationships you're in an intimate
relationship and you get in a fight with your spouse
or your partner or whatever girlfriend boyfriend and [Music] of
course the name of the game in that becomes who
can claim the victim status first that's what happens in
arguments have you noticed that whenever you're in argument with
somebody or maybe a family member both sides try to
say that the other side victimized them it's like no
you did that to me and she'll say no you
did that to me or some other thing and then
we'll try to out victim each other and the one
who can out victim the other wins the argument in
a sense that's the game that's being played but see
most people engage in that game without being able to
be aware of the fact that they're engaging in that
game whereas now when you're aware of it you start
to notice you can actually feel how your mind is
subtly trying to play up your victim status to raise
yourself on this pedestal of victimhood so that then you
are justified in making certain demands because see if you
can put yourself on a very high victim pedestal now
you're owed something now the person has to be nice
to you now they have to apologize to you now
they have to give you a gift now they have
to kiss you now they have to give you sex
now they have to give you money whatever it is
they give you love or attention and that's why you
play victim see you got to be able to see
the sneakiness of these dynamics that are going on inside
your mind this takes introspection skill you have to notice
when you're whining and complaining there my mind goes again
whining and complaining about this about that about not getting
enough sex about having a bad boss about not having
a good job about the economy being bad about how
the political system is unfair capitalism oh capitalism is so
is so bad i can't start a business because all
the elites are are keeping me down then they got
their boot on my neck and all of this and
it's impossible to be successful and this this sort of
stuff whining about how you can't meditate complaining about how
difficult it is because of the country you were born
in because of the illnesses that you have because of
how little money you have because how shitty your parents
were to you and don't get me wrong some of
those are legitimate hurdles to overcome i'm not trying to
minimize those i get it some of you have it
a lot worse than others for some of you it's
a lot harder to self-actualize and to meditate and to
do consciousness work or to earn money than it is
for others we don't all start on the same playing
field not at all there's enormous differences in our starting
positions we all have different handicaps and limits that we're
dealing with but whining and complaining about them this is
this is not going to help you and yet you
keep doing it why are you doing it what's the
payoff for whining and complaining see you have to be
able to feel inwards to notice what the payoff is
and that might take you a couple of years of
feeling inwards and struggling to figure out because see when
you feel inwards it all feels so vague and fuzzy
at first you're not sure what to make how to
make sense of it it's confusing you don't understand you
might grasp for something but then it's wrong you might
make wrong conclusions as you're trying to do this but
that's but that's how you learn to surf for example
you get on that surfboard and the first time you
get on it you're going to spill pretty badly you're
going to wipe out uh because you do something stupid
you you don't have that muscle memory built up for
how to balance and how to navigate the waves and
read read the water and all this sort of stuff
and yeah you're gonna take some nasty spills the first
time few times that you do it but then slowly
you're gonna build a sense of balance that's exactly what
it's like only here it's much more difficult because you're
you're playing this game against your own mind your own
mind you're trying to basically out smart your own mind
in this process because your mind has all these very
intelligent sophisticated survival mechanisms that are hardwired into you these
very psychological patterns and defense mechanisms which are designed to
keep you alive and now you're starting to introspect into
those but these these mechanisms are so sophisticated and sneaky
because they have to be in order to keep you
alive and so now you're trying to infuse consciousness into
those and that is difficult to do takes time takes
effort it's a tricky at first you might also discover
stuff there that you don't quite like that's right because
that's necessitated by survival see your survival again check out
my two-part series understanding survival part one part two very
important your survival is not just this dumb brute physical
activity that the body is doing like it's sending you
a signal when you're hungry when you're thirsty when you're
horny when you feel unsafe of course we all recognize
that the body sends us these signals when you're in
pain that's the body signal to tell you that hey
something's wrong you know why are you sticking a knife
into your finger or something and then the pain gets
you to stop doing that so this is kind of
gross obvious stuff but but the body is is so
sophisticated and the mind is so this is the software
that is running this very sophisticated body is is so
elaborate it's so counter intuitive because it has to be
because your survival isn't just those basic things for a
human survival is much more complex than just getting some
food and some water and some sex and avoiding getting
cut and burned and things like this survival involves all
sorts of sneaky abstract social games that we play politics
getting approval getting love and all these sorts of factors
these are these are critical to survival yes most yet
most people don't think of these as survival and the
kind of belief systems and ideologies that we adopt this
is also all crucial to our survival we usually don't
think of them that way we usually just think of
beliefs and ideas oh it's just some beliefs and just
some ideas no your entire survival hinges upon it the
kind of beliefs and ideas that you hold and how
deeply you cling to them you also need to start
noticing when you make excuses for not taking responsibility notice
how you avoid both personal responsibility and also collective responsibility
in fact one of the sneaky mechanisms that your mind
uses to avoid collective responsibility and a lot of right
wingers and conservatives and libertarians are guilty of this as
i've talked about in the past is that they will
actually use the mantle of personal responsibility to shirk collective
responsibility so in cases like systemic racism or inequalities and
injustices within society a conservative or libertarian will say oh
well they just need to take more personal responsibility no
you actually need to take more collective responsibility collective responsibility
doesn't negate and is not mutually exclusive with personal responsibility
both are important because we are both individuals and we
are also part of a collective and both of these
dynamics are are interpenetrating all the time within our lives
none of us are really individuals we're always interacting with
others whether it's online or in our family or in
our intimate relationships or at work in business it's all
collective type stuff so there's a lot of collective responsibilities
there and of course we don't like to take responsibility
the mind doesn't like to take on responsibility either personal
or collective why not well that's something you should introspect
about notice and feel when you are actually shirking responsibility
either personal or collective when you don't want it and
then try to ask yourself why don't i want it
in this case for example i've i've faced group situations
in the past maybe you have as well like in
school or at work there is like a little group
project let's say at school your teacher gets five of
you together you splits the class into groups of five
and gives each of you a school project and you
need to work on it together class project that you
work on together over the next week all five of
you have you ever been in that situation what happens
one of the first things in that situation that arises
is the question of who's going to be the leader
in that group it's not going to be just a
perfect democracy someone's going to arise as the leader and
to stand up and say okay guys i'm taking responsibility
for this project i'm going to spearhead it and so
forth this takes responsibility and uh it takes a certain
gumption and leadership and a certain confidence in that situation
you can actually feel into it and there's there's that
lingering moment before somebody steps up and and takes the
lead there's that moment of like well who's going to
take the lead am i going to take the lead
is he going to take the lead is she going
to take the lead it's like well i don't want
to take the lead or maybe i do want to
take the lead but i feel bad about i feel
guilty because i don't want to be some arrogant [
__ ] who dominates others but on the other hand
it seems like those other people aren't willing to take
the lead that means i have to step up but
if i step up that means i have to do
more work and i don't want to do more work
see all these subtle dynamics you can feel those playing
inside rattling inside of your skull when you're facing this
kind of situation hopefully you can relate to that in
some way see leading people is a huge responsibility it
means you have to act better yourself you have to
set the right example for others you have to hold
yourself to a high standard because you know others will
hold you to a high standard see and you can
you can further introspect and wonder to yourself in that
situation why am i resistant to take this leadership position
why don't i want the responsibility what am i avoiding
likewise if you're a conservative and you deny things like
systemic racism you can ask yourself why am i avoiding
collective responsibility here why am i just offloading this and
trying to excuse it and rationalize it away saying oh
those black people or whatever they're not taking enough personal
responsibility well is that really the case or maybe i'm
not taking enough collective responsibility by trying to blame them
for not taking personal what if they are taking personal
responsibility but the collective situation is so rigged or unjust
that actually we need to take more collective responsibility what
if that's the case that means i'd have to maybe
reevaluate my worldview because see my world usage blames them
for it so why don't i want to take collective
responsibility what am i trying to avoid there you also
need to notice when you're introspecting when you're thinking negatively
or having limiting beliefs this is huge huge huge huge
i could do a whole course on just the topic
of eliminating identifying and eliminating negative uh and limiting beliefs
this is one of the biggest things that holds you
back from expanding yourself into new areas in life for
example maybe you struggled with attracting women as a guy
and you might want to go out there and get
a girlfriend or something but you have all these negative
limiting beliefs like oh well i'm not attractive enough my
dick is not big enough i don't make enough money
i'm not emotionally confident enough i'm not funny enough women
are just [ __ ] and [ __ ] and
they won't want to sleep with me all the good
ones are already taken if i attract a woman she'll
probably be broken and one of the dysfunctional and ugly
ones and science tells me that unless i'm super good
looking i'll never be able to get a cute girl
and all these other excuses and limiting beliefs you know
when i got into pickup years ago i don't really
do it anymore um but years ago when i went
through that phase a huge part of of my learning
how to get better with women was tackling just a
slew dozens and dozens of these sorts of limiting beliefs
that i had and it's very difficult to tackle these
limiting beliefs because when you hold them they don't feel
like just limiting beliefs they feel like truth like reality
they feel scientific they feel like facts that can't be
questioned and that to question these would be some sort
of exercise in self-delusion when actually it's these beliefs that
are self-delusion but see you got to be able to
feel into your belief systems and and look inside and
see make the connections to see you know why am
i holding this where does belief come from is this
really true might have i just been cherry-picking evidence to
prop up this belief but really uh my my my
experiences and my and my evidence is very flaky and
shallow so literally that's what i did i would sit
down and i would for example i would have a
limiting belief like i would say i'm too old to
attract the kind of woman that i want like i
should have started this years ago like oh yeah like
when i got into pickup i was already i was
like 27 when i got into pickup which of course
in in retrospect is so young um but i was
thinking like oh most guys who do pick up they're
like in their early 20s i'm already in my late
20s and i already suck and i i'm already like
behind the curve and i'm too old like it's not
going to work and all this sort of stuff and
like by the time i learn it i'm going to
be in my 30s it's like oh my god it's
impossible i had to actually sit down i had to
i remember i would sit down with a sheet of
paper and uh and i would just write out that
um all the reasons that i am not too old
to learn pickup and i would sit there and i
write and i would write page after page and i
would force myself to write it and then rewrite it
and rewrite it and tell myself just literally drill into
my mind that i'm not too old i mean it
sounds ridiculous in retrospect uh but that's exactly how our
limiting beliefs are they they're ridiculous but when we believe
them they might as well just be rock solid reality
from our point of view see but you need to
be able to feel into that to spot them to
notice them to start to question them you need to
be able to notice your self biases and your double
standards the standards you set for yourself are usually very
different than the standards you set for others you're very
quick to criticize others but then when you yourself make
those same mistakes or violate those certain rules and boundaries
you don't criticize yourself these are double standards that you
set your whole mind is built upon these sorts of
double standards these double standards even exist within academia within
science for example scientists will criticize religious people for believing
in authority or making appeals to authority such as like
well a religious person will say well god exists because
the bible says so and the scientists will say but
that's just a book you're appealing to authority okay fine
that's a that's that's that's a reasonable criticism to make
of religion but then do you apply that same standard
to yourself to science because see when i when i
when i start to question science and i start to
question the foundations of science to you as a scientist
what are you going to do you're going to resort
to appeals to authority as well you're going to say
well but but physics says this and einstein said that
and newton said this and and my college professor said
that okay but what is that that's just appeals to
authority most of what science is is just appeals to
authority but see you because you are not good at
feeling inwards you're not going to admit that you're going
to make excuses you're going to say oh well but
but this is different you know leo how can you
how dare you compare believing in the bible as the
same thing as believing in a physics textbook or believing
al albert einstein or or believing my college professor these
are not the same thing at all these are legitimate
legitimate appeals to authority you see but these are double
standards that you set and you're unable to recognize that
because you're so externally focused that you're not able to
feel into it to feel these double standards one of
the most important things i did when i was young
and got into epistemology and got into really thinking about
the nature of science religion and reality and how human
knowledge works is that i was quite good at feeling
inwards during various arguments and debates i had with religious
people because i was a scientific materialistic atheist at that
time and i would argue with religious friends and and
others uh who were like fundamentalist christians and so forth
and i could clearly see that the way they were
behaving was not intellectually into integris uh they were using
various kinds of double standards and they were being biased
in their arguments i could clearly see that in them
but then i started noticing that when i was parroting
scientific beliefs and ideas to them to counter their arguments
that i too was at a meta on a meta
level also engaging in this kind of uh lack of
intellectual integrity i was just parroting science at them and
i was using various kinds of double standards and that
the arguments i was using against them i wasn't fully
applying to my own self and i could feel that
and i could see the wrongness of that and that
was the only thing that was really able to allow
me to go beyond science otherwise i would have just
been lost in materialism for the rest of my life
right that is what opened that was the crack that
opened the door to skepticism of science and materialism for
me and that got me to question not just religion
but got me to question everything including physical reality like
everything because i saw how the arguments made by scientific
materialists themselves were were deeply circular in their logic and
had gaps in them that doesn't mean that the religious
fundamentalists are correct they are even more diluted than the
scientists materialists and atheists and skeptics uh but i could
even see the the flaws and the gaps within skepticism
itself and that is the key it's that ability to
feel inwards into introspect that was the key that allowed
me to to to ultimately jailbreak my own mind but
you see most scientists aren't able to do this religious
people of course aren't able to do this as well
skeptics rationalists atheists are not able to do this and
yet they poo poo this idea of feeling inwards yet
this is the one thing that will save you you
need to be able to notice when you hold a
belief and that a belief is a belief and to
be able to distinguish a belief from reality and from
experience for example most people do not have enough introspection
skill to notice and to admit to themselves that the
planet mars is a belief are you getting this you
scientists you materialist you skeptics and atheists and rationalists are
you getting the significance of this the planet mars is
a belief the continent of antarctica is a belief are
you seeing this the only don't argue with me this
is not a logical debate we're trying to have for
you to see that you need to be able to
introspect the only way you can understand what i'm saying
the significance of what i'm saying is to introspect and
to feel inwards and to notice what is a belief
see most scientific and materialist people they think that belief
is just like some sort of myth to believe in
god or some flying spaghetti monster or to believe in
unicorns or to believe in angels that's belief mars is
not a belief antarctica is not a belief but look
in your experience what is the difference between santa claus
and mars in your experience forget what other people are
telling you look in your experience feel inwards to feel
and to notice to observe with your direct consciousness that
the planet mars for you is a belief see this
is not a point to argue it's it's something that
you look and see for yourself another thing you should
notice when you're introspecting is when you're being dishonest and
when you're lying of course when you're lying to others
it's important to see that but even more important than
that is when you're lying to yourself most people don't
have enough introspection skill to notice when they are being
dishonest with themselves and usually when you lie to others
you have to lie to yourself first how do you
know when you're being dishonest you feel it you can
feel the dishonesty it has a certain dirty quality to
it you don't even want to look at it that
takes skill that takes practice to notice when you're being
dishonest when you're lying to yourself the only way you're
going to be able to do it is by practicing
it you're going to fail many times of course at
noticing it but then over years you'll get better at
it also you should notice why you lie what is
sourcing or motivating your lies and your dishonesty that is
very fruitful to notice because that would be how you
would undo the lying in the dishonesty by working on
the root sources and causes of that you should also
notice your grudges bitterness and trauma any kind of trauma
that you hold trauma can sit very very deep of
course we know from classic psychology how trauma severe trauma
can be even repressed uh for years and decades like
if your father mother abused you or molested you that
could have resulted in trauma that you might have buried
very very deep inside of your psyche but there's there's
more minor forms of trauma it doesn't have to be
so so obvious uh there's there's a lot of minor
trauma that you could have had when you were bullied
in school or your mom didn't love you enough or
your dad was too stern or he beat you one
time or said something cruel to you or whatever that
hurt you created trauma for you there's lots of different
kinds of traumas you can you can incur throughout life
and not just in childhood but also in early adulthood
even even as a full-on adult you can incur trauma
and then you got to be able to notice this
trauma and and then deal with it notice when when
you're denying this trauma when you're trying to avoid it
and hide it avoid facing it you have to notice
grudges and bitterness that results from this trauma you see
usually the trauma doesn't show up as trauma it just
shows up as a grudge or a bitterness or sort
of passive aggressive attitude or some sort of anger that
comes up unexplainably in various situations and you don't know
why and it's only by feeling into that and feeling
through the grudges and the bitterness and the anger that
you might get to the actual deep trauma and hurt
that is there as a wound that is sourcing that
that takes introspection you should also notice when you are
attracted to and repelled by things and what kind of
things attract you and repel you most people don't know
most people go through life live through life without a
clear explicit understanding of their own attractions and repulsions well
how are you going to navigate life this way your
whole life is basically dictated by this by your attractions
and your repulsions notice your preferences and your deepest needs
most people don't know their own deepest needs they're confused
about it you might think you need money but actually
that's not what you really need what you probably really
need is love or friendship or better health or more
free time or more time with your children or whatever
but you won't understand that until you do some deep
introspection on the surface these needs of yours might manifest
as i need sex i need a beautiful girlfriend i
need a trophy wife i need a husband who will
support me i need a boyfriend who will never leave
me and will love me unconditionally see these sorts of
these might be your external needs this is what's driving
much of your behavior but then when you start to
really search those and feel into them you will feel
through them into something deeper which is is more fundamental
and usually these kinds of surface level needs you won't
be able to ever satisfy them completely which is why
you'll always be dissatisfied end up chasing your tail for
the rest of your life without proper introspection you need
to be able to notice when you are attached to
a thing whether it's a physical thing or an idea
a belief an ideology a worldview a perspective feel your
attachment if the attachment feels like a like a sort
of a like you're you're gripping onto it and you
just you don't want to let it go and when
you feel that about an idea or a belief that
might spark the next sort of epiphany for you which
is like hey isn't this wrong isn't there something wrong
with the sort of attachment to this idea or to
this belief after all if this idea or belief was
true if it was truly good why would i be
so attached to it might this attachment be a compensation
over compensation for something else maybe the reason i've attached
this belief is because actually i'm afraid that it's not
true maybe the reason i'm attached to this ideology or
to this idea is because i really need it because
i'm insecure about some aspect of myself you see but
that requires a deep introspection otherwise you're just going to
be on the surface acting out your attachment you might
be attached to some ideology like red pill ideology or
in-cell ideology or some sort of nationalist ideology or even
like uh some sort of social justice warrior left-wing you
know socialist ideology and but but there's something deeper that
causes you to be attached to some sort of deeper
fear or insecurity about yourself and you might wonder leo
but how do i know that attachment is wrong how
do i distinguish what's right and what's wrong you feel
inwards you see you can actually feel inwards and you
can feel that attachment is wrong now of course this
is a relative sort of wrong it's not really wrong
you can be attached to whatever you want there's nothing
ultimately wrong in the world but in a relative sense
it's wrong because it's untrue it's predicated upon some sort
of illusion or delusion or falsehood and how do you
verify that you don't trust me you don't believe me
you go inside and you feel it and that's what
transforms you you should also notice when you're introspecting when
you're unwilling to let a thing go you should notice
when you are arguing how you get emotionally triggered in
that argument and wonder why that is see this is
sort of where i started my whole journey into epistemology
is i would have these arguments with my religious friends
in high school and i would get triggered emotionally in
these arguments and i thought that i had a strong
very strong scientific materialistic skeptical position atheistic position that i
was arguing from i thought it was true uh so
to me when i started to feel inwards i i
it it puzzled me huh you know i'm having these
arguments with these religious that's how i thought of them
religious fundamentalist fools who are trying to you know peddle
their stupid christian ideas to me i'm arguing with them
i know my arguments are are on firm ground i
know that what they're trying to pitch to me is
delusion and yet i feel there's something missing here why
do i get emotionally triggered in these arguments what is
that about could that be because on some even deeper
subconscious level i'm unsure about my own positions i have
certain doubts there are certain inconsistencies which i am hiding
from my own self and sure enough that's exactly what
there was but i had to really go deep inwards
see most people they don't do that when they're arguing
most people when they're arguing that argument is just uh
it's just all externalized you know they're just spouting their
ideas they're not actually questioning their own positions they're not
feeling into their own biases and attachments they're not looking
into the underlying fears that might be sourcing this argument
because if you were really in possession of the truth
you wouldn't argue about it there would be no argument
and there would be no insecurity and there would be
no emotional reactivity and triggering and you wouldn't feel dirty
or bad about it but see when you feel into
something and you feel it it's kind of dirty you
feel it's it's limiting you feel it's uh it just
feel i don't know how to describe it it just
it doesn't feel right that's that's a little clue that
your higher self ascending to you that hey maybe you're
fooling yourself here you need to be able to introspect
and notice when your ego uses logic and selfish ways
people love to use logic without any ounce of introspection
they just spout logic without any recognition of the possibility
that the logic they're using has been co-opted by their
ego and infested at its root with self-biases and self-deception
how do you know the ego hasn't corrupted your entire
logical system the way you find out is by introspecting
watching yourself using your logic and wondering what's really going
on there what is sourcing this logic how can you
trust this logic and if you do that i guarantee
you that you will notice that your logic is utterly
corrupt and infested with self-bias there's nothing objective or scientific
about the way that the human mind uses logic in
thinking about the reality and making sense of reality it's
utterly selfish and it's utterly untruthful you need to be
able to notice and admit when you truly don't know
a thing but you're pretending like you do this is
a huge one you should immediately recognize this within yourself
times when you are acting like you know a thing
when really you don't know it how do you know
when you know a thing and when you don't again
you feel inwards you don't ask a scientist you don't
go read and consult the bible to tell you whether
you really know a thing you don't talk to some
guru or ask him a question like hey do i
really know god do i really know am i really
awake no no no that doesn't work if you're asking
a guru if you're really awake or if you really
know god then you're not awake and you don't know
god i have people coming to me like this all
the time asking me leo here's what i think love
is is this really what it is tell me is
this what love is is this what god is is
this what enlightenment is but if you're asking that question
it already tells me you don't know you're just pretending
like you do you're hoping that you know you're guessing
you're grabbing at straws you're speculating you're convinced trying to
convince yourself that you know something that you really don't
know it would it would be a lot better if
you introspected and realized i don't know i don't know
what love is i don't know what god is i
don't know if there even is a god i don't
know if anything leo says is true this would be
a much more honest place for you to start with
rather than pretending like you know all these things you
see you've watched all this material that i've supplied to
you all these answers that i've given you now you've
you've you've programmed your mind with all these beliefs and
ideas now you're just parroting actualized ideas and concepts but
the truth is you don't know these things probably 95
of things i say you don't know yet you pretend
like you do religious people if religious people were really
honest it would be so easy for them to realize
that religion is a self-deception all you have to do
is you have to go inside any religious person whether
you're a muslim jew christian hindu whatever whoever you worship
or follow just if it's very simple just go inside
it and truly truly genuinely with with full honesty ask
yourself do i really know what god is do i
really know what the truth is do i really know
what awakening is and the answer will be no you
don't you don't know and that's what's true for you
and that's the best place to be is there rather
than pretending but see these religious people are so hooked
on pretending like they know they can't admit a religious
a religious person can't admit even such a simple thing
as did jesus exist if you're a christian right now
i want you to pause like if you are really
serious about truth if you want to stop playing all
the [ __ ] games and you just you really
want to get to the truth of religion like do
you want to just be a christian in name only
or do you want to actually get to the truth
if you really want to get to the truth go
inside of yourself right now and ask yourself do i
really know if jesus even existed and the obvious answer
is no you don't know that's the obvious that's the
only possible answer that you can have you have no
idea whether jesus actually existed and yet if this exercise
was offered to 95 of christians they would not do
this simple exercise why because they're so wrapped up in
needing it to be true because if you admit that
you don't even know whether jesus is actually real if
you admit that that's it that's the end of your
religion so there's no way the mind can allow that
but what you should be able to do as a
if you're if you're really interested in truth as if
you're a christian or a muslim whatever you should be
able to go inside and you should be able to
feel with enough introspection you should be able to feel
your own defensiveness and denial of even wanting to do
this exercise see your mind immediately is going to go
into this kind of overdrive mode to lash out at
me at what i'm saying because you're gonna have to
demonize the messenger here in order to get away with
this and you have to come up with some sort
of rationalizations or excuses for why the very simple exercise
that i'm proposing to you here is isn't right but
deep down in your mind if you do the exercise
you'll know it's right so the only way you can
deny it is by all sorts of distractions excuses rationalizations
and other sorts of defense mechanisms and when you're when
your mind is employing these defense mechanisms deep down the
subconscious level you know it and you can feel it
but in order to feel it you have to be
willing to go inside to feel rather than lashing out
and externalizing and and projecting all of your [ __
] onto me you see try it try feeling into
it and i mean this doesn't just apply to christians
or muslims or whatever if you're a scientist uh you
can you can do a similar exercise go inside and
ask yourself do you really know that antarctica exists do
it do it right now the only possible valid answer
is no you don't know you don't know you're going
to sit there and pretend like you do here come
all the excuses for why antarctica is not just a
belief and how it must exist blah blah blah blah
blah because of this because of that because of this
because this other thing but the reality is that you
don't know whether antarctica exists that's just that's just the
fact there's no other possible answer unless maybe you've been
there but how many have you been antarctica you say
well leo i could go there you believe you could
go there which is different from actually going there and
the only way to notice that difference is by feeling
inwards see can you feel that your conviction that you
could go to antarctica that that is a belief no
different than uh a muslim's belief in allah ah leo
but they're not different they're told i mean they're not
the same they're totally different yeah now you got to
notice that that is your mind spinning up rationalizations and
excuses as a defense mechanism it takes practice i know
i know it's hard at first it's hard to believe
these things at first but uh but that's the power
of this this this skill very powerful skill you need
to be able to notice when you're manipulating another person
or a situation this is huge oh my god manipulation
the topic look every i got i'm giving you this
list of these different things that you can notice different
domains of things you can notice this list is probably
of 50 items long uh i could shoot a video
maybe i could create a course on an entire on
every on every bullet point i could probably create 50
courses on all these 50 domains that's how deep each
one of these domains is this domain of manipulation noticing
how and when you manipulate and why you manipulate other
people in situations this is oh my god [ __
] this this will take you a decade just to
understand the significance of what i'm saying a decade of
work just to understand the significance of what i'm saying
not even to master it just to understand the significance
of what i'm saying you can feel when you are
manipulating versus when you are just authentically expressing yourself or
relating with another person or situation to be able to
notice yourself manipulating it is a is huge hugely important
most people can't do this you need to notice your
motives and intentions and oftentimes your surface level motives have
ulterior motives they're sort of like the false [ __
] motives that you present out there for others and
for your own ego self these are the excuse motives
and then there's the real true underlying ulterior motives for
the things that you do you need to be able
to notice those by feeling into them you need to
be able to notice when you're not being authentic in
order to please somebody else this is huge how much
of your life have you wasted pleasing others parents authority
figures teachers co-workers bosses lovers and partners many of you
women suffer from this you uh because you're trying to
fit in you're trying to be loving and supportive of
your man or whatever or you're trying to fit in
some community or some organization or some group you sacrifice
your own authenticity in order to please them to make
them feel happy because it makes you feel happy when
others are happy you don't want to rock the boat
you don't want to be too self-imposing on others but
you got to be able to feel into the fact
that you're not being authentic when you're doing that and
that's going to cost you that's going to come back
to bite you you're going to be suffering with that
for the rest of your life notice when you are
giving your power away you need to be able to
notice your insecurities and the overcompensations that you've created for
your insecurities are you insecure about your hair your teeth
your skin your height your breast size your dick size
other aspects of your personality or your physical appearance your
giant nose or whatever and then how do you how
do you cope with that how does that feel how
does it feel to be insecure about your hair or
about your teeth or about your weight or whatever and
then what do you do to compensate how do you
think how do you feel how do you protect yourself
how do you shield yourself and block yourself off do
you not look in the mirror do you create some
sort of ideology about how oh because i'm short the
tall people those are there they got it so easy
these tall people and they're their [ __ ] and
their jerks and all this because you know i'm short
and i have to deal with that my whole life
do you create an ideology like that do you now
believe that you're unlovable do you now believe that you're
low value and that you'll never find a mate and
you'll die alone and miserable see noticing your insecurities is
huge because usually we don't want to admit our own
insecurities to ourselves because we're so busy overcompensating for them
we develop entire worldviews and belief systems to compensate for
our own insecurities you might build an entire job or
career around some insecurity of yours you might build an
entire life purpose like you might become a christian missionary
that flies off and tries to proselytize you know uh
poor underdeveloped you know brown folk in some you know
some on some island nation in in micronesia or whatever
to your christian philosophy but deep down the the whole
root that is sourcing this activity and this life purpose
that you think is so great of this missionary work
is actually that deep down you're insecure and you have
no idea what god is and you don't even really
have a full confidence in your own religious belief system
so you spend the next 20 years of your life
proselytizing others just to avoid looking inwards at these insecurities
it's an overcompensation it's a giant a giant overcompensation overcompensations
can be very minor or they can be they can
be epic you need to be able to notice when
you're in denial that's huge because when you're in denial
by definition you're in denial that you're in denial so
it's really hard to notice when you're in denial because
you're going to deny it and no one else is
going to convince you that you're in denial only you
can notice by feeling inwards when you're in denial denial
has a certain feeling to it you can feel for
it you can get good at noticing it notice when
you're irked or annoyed by constructive feedback when you're threatened
by constructive feedback a big one for many people notice
when you're learning something new that actual moment when you've
learned something new to notice that that's a huge event
in and of itself most people learn things but they're
not aware of the things they're learning they're not aware
of the exact moment when they learn something you can
only really truly appreciate that when you introspect notice how
you react to failure notice your habits and addictions that's
a big one there are gross addictions they're also subtle
addictions i have a whole episode that i shot in
the past a couple years back called subtle addictions many
addictions that you probably don't even think of as addictions
start noticing those and also notice further what is sourcing
your addictions notice the following notice the tone of your
self-talk when you are talking to yourself in that internal
monologue voice what tone does that voice take for a
lot of people it's very harsh and negative if you
use that kind of tone of voice to talk to
your boss you'd get fired the same day and you
yet you've been using that tone to talk to yourself
for the last 20 years of your life and now
you wonder why you hate yourself why you're in conflict
with yourself why you're miserable all the time well maybe
it's just the tone of your voice and you haven't
been even noticing that the tone of your internal monologues
notice your hidden assumptions in every situation you go into
there's hidden assumptions you go to buy a house you're
going to have hidden assumptions about how the house works
and how the sales process is you get into a
new relationship there's going to be a host of assumptions
hidden assumptions that you hold about that other person and
yourself in relationship with them you go to start a
new business there's going to be a bunch of hidden
assumptions naive ignorant assumptions that you hold about how business
works and how this thing is going to work out
and of course it usually won't work out that way
it's extremely helpful to be able to notice those assumptions
before you dive head first into that situation notice with
your job in your career conflicts of interest notice how
just the fact that you have a certain career or
job or business and you need that job or business
to pay your bills to feed your family and your
kids and to just support yourself how that in and
of itself skews your entire worldview you see if you're
working for the pharmaceutical industry you're probably going to believe
that the pharmaceutical industry is doing something good for mankind
and you're not going to see the evils of the
pharmaceutical industry because it doesn't serve you to see the
evils because your paycheck depends upon you not seeing it
see if if your job is working for the catholic
church you're not going to see the sexual abuses of
the catholic church your mind is going to ignore those
because your job depends upon you not seeing them if
you work for the oil and gas industry you're not
going to see how oil and gas is destroying the
environment notice when you sell out or are tempted to
sell out and swayed by money like maybe your heart
is set upon becoming an artist but then you see
this business opportunity over here if you just rearrange your
art a little bit you can sell out and you
can earn a lot of money but you're going to
be some serving some sort rather than serving your artistic
ideas you're going to be serving some sort of you
know corporate agenda selling some sort of stupid product or
whatever it's probably bad for people but hey your art
is going to be sold widely and you're going to
get a lot of money so that's what you're gonna
go for right you gotta be able to feel when
you're when you're selling out or being swayed by money
notice when you're being invasive and avoidant there are many
things in your life that you simply avoid you don't
want to even think about them you don't even want
to imagine them maybe you don't want to imagine your
dog being sick of old age maybe you don't want
to imagine your mother or parents being in a nursing
home or getting cancer you just avoid those thoughts usually
because they might be pointing to something true and you
don't want to think about that it's too it's the
truth can be too brutal sometimes so we avoid it
and evade it you can feel that avoiding sensation if
you get good with a skill notice when you're being
arrogant obnoxious and disrespectful just just that right there is
huge just notice when you're being arrogant in an argument
or in discussion with somebody notice yourself being flippant or
dismissive when somebody presents you with an idea or a
proposal you can feel that flippantness or that dismissiveness when
you don't even give some idea the light of day
you don't even take a person seriously probably because you're
trying to avoid something that they're telling you notice when
you are being unjust or unfair to others this is
a huge one of course the ego is really good
at masking this because it doesn't serve your direct agenda
to notice when you're being unfair and unjust uh but
this is noticing when you violate the golden rule you
know the golden rule means or it says that do
unto others as you would like have done unto you
but why do so many people violate the golden rule
i mean most people would agree about the golden rule
in theory in general in principle but then when it
actually comes to practice they violate the golden rule all
the time people treat others how they would hate to
be treated themselves why does this happen so frequently throughout
society throughout human history everywhere it happens in your family
and your relationship it happens everywhere why does it happen
because people don't introspect enough to notice when they themselves
are violating the golden rule when they're being unjust and
unfair this actually takes takes work to do that notice
when you violate your own principles and standards when you
break integrity with yourself like you tell yourself i'm gonna
go to the gym tomorrow and then you don't do
it or you have some sort of standard like i
people should show up on time but then you yourself
fail to show up on time violating your own principles
and standards but then you normally you would excuse it
away or you would avoid it or ignore it or
evade it or deny it but here you can turn
inwards and you can feel it notice it notice what
effect that has on your psyche when you break integrity
with yourself and violate your own standards and principles notice
when you lack intellectual integrity notice when your mind is
being weasley in arguments sometimes you can actually catch your
mind just weaseling its way out of an argument you
you already know that you're wrong and yet still your
mind is trying to weasel its way out and save
face rather than to admit that you're wrong you can
feel for that and notice it notice your own defense
mechanisms i'm going to have a whole episode just on
defense mechanisms in the future there's a lot to say
about that notice when you project and when you externalize
this is huge projection i'm gonna have a whole episode
about projection as well notice your shadow i'm gonna have
a whole episode about the shadow as well i know
i've been promising the shadow work episode for years but
believe it or not it is coming um notice when
you aren't feeling good that's just so simple it's so
simple and yet nobody really does it you would think
well leo i know when i don't feel good do
you really no you don't to truly have enough discernment
and awareness of when you don't feel good not just
when it's something very terrible but in subtle ways you
cannot feel good and there's different ways of not feeling
good and they mean different things and the way to
to figure that out is to to build this introspection
skill a lot of times people will not feel good
but they will continue to do that activity or behavior
or keep themselves in that situation where they don't feel
good for years for decades people can be over stressed
and overworked for example for years and decades and keep
doing it and simply because they they've so detached their
brain from their body that they just sort of dissociate
themselves from that and yet they just keep you know
they keep pushing forward they keep like being this good
soldier pushing themselves forward even though they don't feel good
in this job in this career in this relationships in
this relationship or with the food that they're eating the
most people when they eat some bad food they don't
even they're so numb and they lack so they have
so little introspection ability that they don't even draw the
connection between the nasty food they just ate and how
bad they feel a few hours later that takes practice
that takes years of practice that could even save your
life people could have chest pains for example and not
even go to the doctor or not even change their
diet or not even change their exercise regimen um and
then that heart and then that that pain will lead
to a heart attack and the reason it gets so
out of hand is because that person simply isn't even
just feeling into the fact that they're not feeling good
in their heart or some other part of the body
isn't feeling good sometimes it can take you months just
to notice that you're not feeling good in some part
of your body and that that's a serious problem and
it requires some some addressing you can then ask the
question of well why doesn't this part of my body
feel good and of course that might lead you down
to some things that you've been avoiding or denying like
maybe it's because the [ __ ] you've been eating
or because of the way that you've been overworking it
at the gym for example you know a lot of
guys they go to the gym these gym rat types
these uh you know jim bros and uh you know
they they work themselves to death and they pull muscles
and tear ligaments and all this sort of stuff when
if they were just introspecting a little bit more they
would be able to notice when some part of their
body isn't feeling good when you're pushing too much weight
you got to feel to feel that and got to
be able to stop before it gets out of hand
notice when you're stressed and overworked notice when you're tired
and you need to take a nap it took me
years of introspection just to get that part down just
to notice when i feel tired and then to allow
myself to take a nap rather than just denying it
because in the past what would happen is i would
feel tired but i would feel guilty about taking a
nap in the middle of the day or something and
i would try to try to you know push myself
forward just kind of pull my way through the problem
uh and after years of doing this is it's it's
unhealthy it's bad for my health it's unsustainable uh and
so i've had to come around and rethink that strategy
that coping mechanism and i've had to notice that hey
you know i am not being aware enough of when
i'm actually tired and i'm not honoring that feeling of
tiredness because if i was if i was truly loving
with myself when i feel tired i would allow myself
a break i would allow myself to take a nap
and not feel guilty about it and now i do
that and life goes a lot better remove a lot
of suffering that way also improves the quality of my
work too notice your gut feelings and intuitions a lot
of times when you're trying to make some important decision
you have intuitions and gut feelings but you're so unskillful
and feeling into that that you're trying to use your
logical rational mind to make the decision and that usually
makes for a worse decision notice when you're being closed-minded
and stubborn this is huge closed-mindedness is actually something you
can feel it's critical for you to be able to
feel when you're closed-minded go check out my episode called
how open-mindedness works i have multiple actually episodes about open-mindedness
go look for those for more on that or actually
take you through some exercises for feeling your own closed-mindedness
notice and acknowledge when you're wrong a lot of times
you're wrong but you don't want to apologize you're too
proud to apologize notice that feel it notice when you
try to cover up mistakes notice when you feel guilty
notice when you feel shame and embarrassment notice also when
you feel love and spiritual connection so it might seem
like i'm telling you to notice all this negative stuff
about yourself but it's not just the negative stuff you
also want to notice the positive stuff like when you
truly feel genuine love or a genuine spiritual connection or
an artistic connection an aesthetic connection to reality you're inspired
by something you're enthusiastic you're motivated notice that notice what
is causing that and then do more of that i
mean this isn't rocket science it's so simple you want
to have a good life just notice what makes you
feel love motivation inspiration joy and spiritual connection and just
do more of that and do less of the opposite
and there you go there's your formula for how to
create a great life but that assumes you know how
to feel into this stuff you have to be able
to distinguish between false dirty sorts of pleasures and satisfactions
versus high quality spiritual pleasures and satisfactions a dirty pleasure
is you know gorging yourself at a buffet on some
greasy food that's a dirty satisfaction it feels good for
a while then it feels terrible and there's price to
pay for it and it's ultimately never that fulfilling and
then you have much higher qualities of of happiness and
joy which is the more of the love and spiritual
connection sort and you got to notice the difference between
those two and what kind of activities and behaviors lead
to one versus the other of course you have to
notice the contradictions and inconsistencies of your own worldview notice
the circularity and question begging of your own worldview this
is huge for many of you rationalists and scientists and
skeptics and so forth you might say leo what contradictions
what inconsistencies what circularity well how do you know that
science is true because science tells us that science is
true okay how's that different from the bible telling a
christian that the bible is true see basic circularity but
you can only notice that if you like genuinely want
to look inwards with objectivity you skeptics have you noticed
as a skeptic that you're skeptical about all sorts of
things but you're not skeptical about your own skepticism basic
contradiction and inconsistency you rationalist and logical people have you
noticed how do you know that logic itself is valid
and consistent how do you know that logic is not
circular what are you using to justify your logic further
logic can you see how that's circular you're begging the
question there i mean all it takes is a little
bit of introspection but you're not able to do it
so you're stuck in your logic notice when you're fantasizing
you gotta distinguish between direct experience versus fantasy a lot
of these new age type of people love to fantasize
about stuff because they're blurring the boundary between fantasy and
reality and of course there is no firm boundary between
the two because reality fantasy are ultimately just different forms
of consciousness but still it's important to be able to
distinguish these things on a practical relative level notice when
you're in an unresourceful state in a bad mood such
that you don't act or make decisions from that state
notice your own privileges if you were born in a
wealthy part of the country if you were born white
if you were born tall if you were born with
good health and good genetics if you were born to
good parents who didn't abuse you if you went to
good schools if you were fortunate not to be born
into poverty if you were born into a decent country
like america or western europe somewhere in a decent democracy
although not so much in america anymore um you know
notice these privileges people take this stuff for granted notice
your perspective is a perspective rather than reality that's a
big one notice your interpretations you have to be able
to notice and distinguish between what you call reality versus
your interpretation of a situation a lot of the things
that people call facts and reality and objective science or
whatever it's actually not that it's an interpretation you gotta
be able to notice how your mind is interpreting the
situation and to recognize that that's that's not the situation
itself there's a difference between the situation and your interpretation
of it notice you're being peer pressured when you're conforming
and also notice social conditioning in you you have to
be able to notice where your beliefs came from like
maybe i just believe in christianity because my parents were
christians oh yeah that's exactly what it is if you
actually go inwards and you feel inwards you'll realize that
that's exactly the only reason you're religious is because your
parents were it's just it's pure social conditioning pure conformity
but you're going to deny that notice that you're going
to deny that double notice that you're going to deny
that you're going to deny that you're going to deny
that it's a double denial triple denial notice all those
layers you have to go meta to notice all the
because your mind is always building up extra layers of
of deception so you have to be able to go
one level beyond whatever deception your mind concocts notice when
you're being rebellious just for the sake of being rebellious
i know that i had a lot of that problem
when i was younger uh i would love to be
just you know challenge authority just for the sake of
challenging authority even even if i even if it's wrong
like even if it's the wrong position i would just
take the position just because it was rebellious or iconoclastic
and i noticed you know through introspection i noticed that
i noticed that it felt wrong it felt wrong just
to rebel for the sake of rebellion and so i
stopped doing that for the most part notice your impact
on others and your ecosystem notice the collateral damage and
externalities that your actions and even just your very living
creates most people ignore that notice the games and roles
that you play in the very mask various masks that
you wear notice when you're being pretentious and fake notice
when you're posturing notice when you're constructing reality on the
fly using words categories and concepts we talked about this
in the nine stages of ego development part three where
we talked about the construct aware stage a lot of
it has to do with noticing how language is shaping
your whole construction and understanding of reality in your sense-making
process notice your mind constructing self-serving narratives notice when you're
suffering notice different kinds of suffering nose notice what causes
suffering notice your exaggerations and strawmans of other people's perspectives
notice when you aren't actually understanding another person's point of
view this is huge you can actually feel in whenever
you're dealing with another person's point of view when their
point of view is radically different from yours you can
actually feel inwards and you can notice you can ask
yourself am i truly understanding their perspective and your heart
will tell you no you're not notice various generalizations and
stereotypes that you subscribe to and make notice your own
internal divisions and conflicts notice how your mind creates problems
catch your mind in the act of creating a problem
and then you solve that problem and then your mind
creates a new problem notice that problems are not found
out in the world problems are something your mind creates
notice when a new problem arises and then when it
disappears and then in general notice when you're being selfish
notice your own corruptions notice when you're being a devil
notice how you're contributing to global evil so there you
go just a small list of things for you to
notice you can spend the next 50 years of your
life try to notice all these things and you still
won't master it all so i hope you can start
to see the power of and significance of this simple
skill of building introspection and why i tell you without
much exaggeration this is perhaps the most important skill that
you can develop as a human is the skill of
introspection now you can see how that can be so
true because it touches on so many domains there's almost
no aspect of your life that doesn't affect so let's
spend a little bit of time here now talking about
applications of this stuff i already sprinkled in little bits
and pieces of the application as i was giving you
the list but here's some more for example if you're
a professor or an academic start feeling in to the
various kinds of inner workings of your mind which are
propping up your academic intellectual efforts feel into that feel
into the game that you're playing when you're engaging in
academia when you're writing your research paper feel what's actually
going to feel how your profession is shaping the way
that your mind is working this is will what will
determine whether you're going to be a hack academic or
professor or a really brilliant visionary one whether you're able
to feel into that if you're a medical doctor same
thing feel into how the bureaucracy and the social conditioning
of your profession shape the way that you practice medicine
feel how you're corrupted by the money and incentives that
these pharmaceutical companies are offering you you know when the
pharmaceutical rep comes over once a month and brings you
a free lunch to your secretary and takes you out
for golf and all those sort of feel into how
that's corrupting your profession that's the point of why he's
doing that he's trying to corrupt you feel that feel
how you're not able to explain the various cases and
patients that come in you're not able to you're not
able to explain all of the diseases and ailments that
they suffer from because your your profession has just taught
you to categorize things into a couple of you know
patients into a couple of narrow categories materialistic categories and
you're not dealing with the more subtle aspects of health
that they come to you for you just ignore those
feel that see this will make the difference between being
a hacked doctor and being a life-saving doctor an extraordinary
doctor if you're an atheist or a scientific materialist i've
already given you a little hints here and there and
practices but feel your attachment for example to atheism there
is an attachment there if you go inside and you
feel into into into your atheist positions first of all
you can feel and notice that it's just a belief
it's not truth at all you have no idea whether
god exists or doesn't exist feel that you you're pretending
feel yourself making arguments and excuses and rationalizations about that
feel yourself being attached to that position how resistant you
are for example to an idea that there is a
god or that there is angels or other things like
this just feel that inside of yourself this will transform
everything for you if you're able to do that feel
yourself making excuses about that feel yourself going to hyper
rational mode just to argue with me and to deny
what i'm saying if you're a muslim feel into the
fact that the only reason you're a muslim is because
your parents were and you were indoctrinated into it that's
the only reason there's no other reason that people are
muslims the only reason people become muslims is because they're
indoctrinated into it that's the only reason and i'm not
picking on muslims here i mean this applies for to
christians and and jews and so forth but just feel
that feel go back into your mind into the past
and actually trace through the steps of indoctrination that resulted
in you now holding these firm muslim beliefs feel your
attachment to allah feel your attachment to muhammad feel your
attachment to the quran feel that it's deeply biased there's
nothing objective about it you're not equally attached to the
torah you're not equally attached to some buddhist scripture or
sutra why not there's no good reason why not it's
just just indoctrination it's just your personal bias notice that
that's your bias if you're a psychologist or a therapist
and you're practicing with a client again feel into feel
into the sort of social conditioning and indoctrination that you
received as a psychologist or therapist in school and university
in your training programs that got you to categorize people
into various you know little pigeon holes and how really
if you're honest with yourself you have no deep understanding
of human psychology even if you think you're a good
psychologist just admit to yourself feel inwards that you you
don't really understand human psychology very well at all you
don't even understand your own psychology very well feel that
feel how much of a hypocrite you are here you
are serving as a therapist for all these clients who
are dysfunctional and messed up and that when you go
when you go home you are perhaps even more dysfunctional
than some of these clients of yours and yet you're
sitting there pretending like you're some you know some great
psychologist and that you understand the human psyche no you
don't if you truly understood the human psyche you wouldn't
be as dysfunctional as you are if you're a conservative
feel your attachment to your conservative positions and ideology feel
your closed-mindedness you are close-minded i guarantee you just feel
it don't believe me just feel it feel your close-mindedness
feel your inability to take social responsibility feel the rationalizations
and excuses and denials that you create feel the double
standards that you use when arguing with liberals if you're
a liberal same thing feel about how emotionally triggered you
get when you're dealing with some conservative who you think
is stupid or backwards feel the arrogance in you feel
the fact that you don't actually truly understand the conservatives
position you've never really looked at the and you don't
want to look you avoid looking at the conservative position
or point of view as a liberal because you think
you're above it notice the kind of rationalizations and double
standards that you use for your liberal policy positions and
political maneuvers and i'm not saying that the conservative and
liberal are are both doing the same thing they're not
they're not symmetrical but uh that doesn't excuse the liberal
the liberal is more developed than the conservative mind but
that doesn't excuse the liberal from many of these problems
that i've been outlining here as a liberal you have
a lot of introspection to do as a progressive if
you're progressive and you're thinking well yeah the liberals do
but not progressives i use the term liberal very loosely
i i use it to include progressive as well but
if you think you're different from a liberal by being
a progressive well i'm telling you as well as a
progressive you you've also got a lot of introspection to
do you're not nearly as clever as you think you
are if you're a conspiracy theorist a flat earther or
something like this feel into that feel how attached you
are to your conspiracy theories fear feel that you actually
don't know but that you're posturing and pretending to know
you don't really know if there is a slat you
don't really know if there's aliens out there you don't
really know if there's pedophiles controlling the world you don't
know any of this stuff it's just complete complete fabrication
of your [ __ ] mind if you're honest if
you want to be honest you can actually feel that
and cut it out if you're a soldier in the
military feel how the military indoctrinates you into holding certain
principles and beliefs feel how you justify to yourself your
own participation in the uh killing of others and the
training to kill others how you justify it how you
rationalize it how you glorify it how you demonize enemies
and bad guys how you create a purpose out of
this how you cast yourself as the good guy feel
that as a wife in an abusive relationship feel how
you are giving your power away how you're being a
doormat how you're being a people pleaser you're just pleasing
this abusive guy because you whatever whatever stories excuses you
tell yourself feel how you create a victim roll out
of this for yourself feel the excuses you make about

to pay the bills and who's going to take care
of the kids and all that feel that feel the
fear feel the insecurity that's that's keeping you in this
toxic abusive relationship feel the attachment the neediness for sex
or for love or for approval if you're an incel
feel the toxicity of your ideology feel the misogyny that's
in your heart it's there i guarantee it feel all
the limiting beliefs that that are there about how you're
never going to get a girl and how uh girls
are just [ __ ] and they're they're only interested
in chads and you're not good enough and all this
and that you're hopeless and that you're too ugly and
all they care about is the size of your dick
and all this notice all that notice how you're playing
victim notice how you're creating this ideology notice how you're
not taking action if you're a pickup guy and you're
into pickup notice how manipulative you are with women and
notice how you excuse your manipulations for sex notice how
you don't treat women according to the golden rule in
the way that you would like to be treated you
don't i guarantee it notice how you lie notice how
dishonest you are in your interactions with women in order
to get sex notice why you do it notice how
it makes you feel notice how you lie about it
with you and your friends notice the ideology you've created
around it if you're a businessman or a boss or
a salesperson notice how you swindle and exploit customers notice
how you manipulate them notice how you do manipulative marketing
notice how that makes you feel inside notice the kind
of excuses you create in order to screw other business
people out of the money it's like well yeah i
got to screw him out of money because if i
don't screw him out of money he's going to screw
me out of money notice how you exploit your employees
and how you justify it to yourself if you're participating
participating in a debate any debate whether you're in it
or you're observing it notice your attachment to various positions
in the debate you're not actually trying to be truthful
in the debate you're attached you're arguing for a position
or you're rooting for some position you're trying to score
points notice that notice it feels wrong it's out of
integrity with the truth if you're participating on some online
forum or you're writing a comment on youtube or elsewhere
on my forum notice notice when you're just talking [
__ ] notice when you're just uh keyboard jockeying when
you don't know what you're talking about notice when you're
acting out notice when you're posturing and pretending to know
more than you really do know those are a few
of areas of application for you just to get your
mind jogging so to start to wrap this up how
do you avoid self-deception you know i talk about self-deception
being this huge giant problem see my three-part series on
self-deception called self-deception part one part two part three check
those out those are some of the most important episodes
i've published so if you've watched that and you understand
the severity of the problem self-deception how do you break
out of it well it's very simple through years of
introspection to the point where you are intimately familiar with
all the tricks of your own mind how do you
make good decisions in life through introspection by getting so
good at knowing yourself so deeply and developing and honing
your intuition and listening to your heart how do you
discover what's true through introspection with a genuine radically self-honest
inward search searching your own experience with crazy high integrity
and objectivity and impartiality cutting through all of the deceptions
you don't look for truth in a book you don't
get it from a guru you don't learn it from
a video you get it by radically self-honestly looking inwards
that's the only way you'll get truth how do you
become an authentic person how do you stop being fake
by studying all your posturing insecurities and all your inauthenticities
all of the compensating mechanisms that your mind uses all
of the reasons that you're inauthentic all of your fears
that need to be faced in that situation how do
you become a good human being in general through introspection
by studying deeply your own devilry and selfishness you see
reality is a dream it is this is a dream
when a dream hello wake up you can wake up
at any time you want uh if you are serious
enough about it so reality is a dream and if
you can't step back and observe this dream you're going
to be entranced by the dream in this illusion lost
in the illusion the illusion will run you and that's
what's been happening for most of your life and to
most people in your life if you don't develop an
intimate familiarity with the trickeries of your own psychology in
mind you will forever be self-deceived that's just the bottom
line there is no cure or substitute for a lack
of introspective ability or self-awareness nothing will ever compensate this
ability you cannot outsource it you cannot buy it you
cannot shortcut your way to it you cannot fake it
money won't do it sex won't compensate for it success
won't compensate for it fame won't compensate for it so
stop looking to authority figures and external sources to tell
you what is true if you really care about the
truth commit to a search of your inner experience this
is very counter-intuitive because it doesn't seem like experience subjective
experience is something you can trust it doesn't seem reliable
enough that you would be able to find truth in
it you want something outside of yourself to be the
anchor of truth for you you want a scientist or
a textbook or a bible or a guru to ground
and anchor the truth for you but what you don't
realize is that scientist that textbook that bible that guru
these are all just what aspects of your own mind
of your own consciousness of your own subjective experience so
how can they possibly ground the truth when there's only
subjective experience and nothing else you see the problem how
can you ever ground yourself in anything objective that doesn't
work what you have to realize is that actually there's
a deeply counterintuitive move here that needs to be done
is that you need to go deeper into your subject
you need to go so deep into your subjectivity that
you come out the other end of it and it's
recontextualized as actually something that's not subjective at all but
that it's absolute and what you realize there is that
turning inwards is the only reliable anchor that you have
it's more reliable than any external source and that really
what you've been doing your entire life is you've been
externalizing and avoiding responsibility for truth itself you've been trying
to place truth somewhere outside of yourself when really it
is the center of what you are and who you
are it's at the center of you it always has
been but you've been too scared and too avoidant of
that if you want to understand this problem on an
even deeper level go check out my episode called how
authority works where i explain to you how you externalize
all authority and that really there's only one authority entire
universe which is you and there can't possibly be any
authority but you because your subjective consciousness is all that
exists you are all that exists but anyways that's getting
2d for this episode here i want to issue a
few warnings here before i conclude warning number one is
that introspection is not speculation and it's not rationalization does
not belief so don't fool yourself into thinking that you're
doing introspection when you actually aren't if you're sitting there
and rationalizing your worldview that is not introspection if you're
sitting there and you're speculating about things aimlessly and just
grasping at straws with your mind that is not true
introspection and if you're just believing in stuff that i'm
telling you or that somebody else told you that is
also not introspection introspection it can involve questioning it can
involve contemplation but ultimately at its at its root it's
a it's a very almost passive quiet ability it's observation
you sit and you patiently observe your mind at work
without judging it without emotionally reacting to it without trying
to manipulate it without trying to change it you just
observe very patiently for more on that go go see
my episode called learning equals observation where i talk about
more about how observation is done uh another warning here
is that uh memorizing and parroting actualized.org concepts is not
the same thing as introspection ability just because you've watched
a hundred of my videos and you can parrot many
of the things that i say that does not mean
that your introspection skill has improved at all so beware
of that trap also beware of the following is that
introspection only works in tandem with a genuine intention for
truth and a commitment to intellectual integrity that is key
you need to be able to and this is part
of introspection when you're introspecting you need to be able
to feel when you are being aligned with a genuine
intention towards truth and a commitment towards integrity rather than
some sort of defending of a position or reinforcing of
a of a bias of yours or just acting out
something that you want or something that you personally need
like money or sex or whatever else right so when
you introspect you have to place everything else as being
tertiary compared to your getting to the truth of the
matter so when you're questioning yourself you know am i
being honest am i lying to myself am i rationalizing
am i am i blaming somebody am i scapegoating some
whatever any of this stuff on the list i talked
about if you're trying to ascertain that the first thing
you got to do is you got to ground yourself
in a genuine intention for the truth what does that
mean that means you have to actually want the truth
at all costs so go into yourself right now and
feel it feel you can feel when you want the
truth or when you don't you can feel when you're
aligned with when you have an intention to reach an
accurate perception of something versus where when you're just you
know you're just doing something else that's crucial so i
have a new value for you that you can adopt
in your life the value that you can adopt is
truthful accurate clear introspection that can be a value that
you set for yourself write that in your common place
book in your journal whatever and that can be a
value that you honor for the rest of your life
truthful accurate clear introspection genuine introspection not just a validation
of your pre-existing beliefs and ideas and opinions no no
that's not genuine introspection genuine introspection means that when you
introspect if this thing that you're introspecting violates all of
your beliefs and all of your ideas and all of
your desires and all of your cravings and needs and
personal wants you're going to go with the answer rather
than all of your other crap see that's what you
use to cut through self-deception because ultimately the engine of
self-deception is your own cravings and needs and wants and
biases and all that if you care about those more
than you care about truthful accurate clear introspection you will
never get the truth can you see why because you're
always sidetracked by some personal thing you have some personal
grudge or grievance or craving or desire or some need
to mean to manipulate yourself or somebody else you have
to let go of that of all that another warning
for you is that introspection comes at a cost there's
a reason that most people don't introspect what do you
think that reason is because when you do introspect the
i'd say the biggest reason is is that um it's
the emotional labor that comes with discovering all of the
self-deceptions and lies and all the ugliness within yourself it's
too much to bear for most people the amount of
lying and dishonesty and self-deception in your worldview is so
outrageously high that it would make you vomit physically vomit
you would feel physically ill if you ever became conscious
of all of it at once it might knock you
to the floor if you did so usually what you
have to do is have to get pick away at
it for years bit by bit by bit because it's
too much to handle at all and so even when
you're picking away at it still you're going to be
bombarded with ugly truths about yourself and about society in
the world that you're not going to want to admit
you're going to want to be in denial about emotional
labor will come with that there's going to be struggle
and difficulty it's going to be confusing as you're introspecting
at first it's going to be difficult like i said
you're learning to surf and you're just sort of trying
to balance yourself and you're not quite sure how you
take some nasty spills you do some wipeouts you you
maybe start to doubt yourself you start to tell yourself
something negative like oh this is not going to work
at all this is you know not worth it anymore
and so on and so you'll quit you won't develop
the skill also another huge reason why introspection isn't done
and the cost of it is that uh the more
you introspect the more responsibility you're going to take for
your life the more you're going to realize how little
responsibility you took for your emotions your relationships your communication
your actions and behaviors your responsibility to others to society
to mankind to life to the universe to god it's
too much responsibility for most people to handle they don't
want this much responsibility this responsibility makes your life harder
introspection makes your life harder it's a lot harder to
live life when you are conscious of the consequences of
your selfish thoughts beliefs behaviors biases rationalizations emotional outbursts and
reactions because once you see all that once you see
how big of a devil you are you're sort of
now basically obligated to be better to be a better
person and it's not easy to be a good person
it's not easy to surrender the devil that you have
been most of your life that's hard that makes your
life hard business will be harder relationships will be harder
[Music] politics will be harder when you're dumb and you're
ignorant things seem simple and easy because you have no
idea of the the true consequences of your beliefs and
actions and behaviors everything will become harder being good is
hard being bad is easy being bad is the path
of least resistance being god-like this takes serious work this
takes a lifetime of work so why do it you
might ask you might say well leo if it's so
hard why should i do it why don't i take
the easy path well like i've said in the past
uh you know life is counterintuitive and sometimes the easy
life is actually the hard life and the hard life
is actually the easy life now another important point here
that you need to remember as you undertake this journey
and this pursuit of a lifetime of building introspection skill
is that it will take you years to develop significant
introspection skill you're not going to accomplish this in a
few months this is a commitment that you make for
the rest of your life to pursue this you'll be
pursuing this for decades also understand that this is a
subtle skill that nobody in society is going to really
push you to develop no one's going to force you
to develop it no one's going to ask you hey
how's your introspection skill going today are you keeping up
with your commitment no one will care in fact they
will try to do the opposite they will try to
distract you and to get you to do everything but
introspect society does not teach introspection it does not value
introspection uh and this is such a soft and abstract
fuzzy skill that see you can't easily externalize it you're
not gonna get a bunch of praise for it people
aren't going to see the fact that oh oh you're
this amazing you got this amazing level 100 introspection skill
oh wow you're you're so cool man let me follow
you on instagram let me pay you some money no
you're not going to get any external rewards for this
in fact the more introspective you become the more of
a nuisance other people will perceive you to be because
now you've got some powerful introspection ability you'll be able
to shine that light of introspection not only inwards but
also outwards at them and at other situations and people
and of course you're gonna be able to cut through
[ __ ] because you've cut through your own [
__ ] using this skill you've cut through your own
self-deception and because you come you've become intimately familiar with
your own self-deceptions you of course very clearly see the
self-deception in others and that's exactly what they don't want
because they're playing the game of deceiving themselves and deceiving
you but now you can see through all that so
that makes you a bit of a nuisance and yet
on the other hand this is one of the most
important skills in life that you can develop because it
lets you cut through all the [ __ ] but
the cost of that is that you're gonna have to
practice this every single day for the rest of your
life and if you don't nobody will care and nobody
will hold you accountable so the only one who could
hold yourself accountable for developing this skill is you nobody
else i am maybe the one of the few other
people on this planet who will try to hold you
accountable once in a while if you keep watching my
videos to keep working on this skill but otherwise virtually
nobody will so it's all on you is what i'm
trying to say and that's what it means to grow
up that's what it means to be an adult is
to take that responsibility right your mom is not going
to remind you to keep doing this the tv commercials
are not going to remind you to keep doing this
youtubers other youtubers are not going to remind you to
keep doing this and even i might forget to remind
you about this you know i'm not going to remember
in every single episode to remind you it's not practical
it's your job to do that so i recommend that
right now and for the rest of your life you
make this commitment to adopt this introspective attitude from here
on out to work on it to commit to honing
your introspective skill to level 100 and just again if
you're wondering is this really something that i should do
leo i don't know i don't know you make it
sound kind of hard why why should i do this
why should i invest all this time energy well here's
how we figure that out close your eyes right now
and go inside of yourself right now and i want
you to ask yourself i want you to ask your
deepest self and your deepest intuitions and your heart i
want you to ask yourself if i spend the next
20 years of my life committed to developing this introspective
skill as leo has laid it out here over the
last two hours and i become good at penetrating all
these different domains with my own with the light of
my own inner awareness if i become good at that
is that something that's going to be worthwhile is that
going to pay me dividends is that a wise thing
to do close your eyes feel into a feel for
the feeling of it and that feeling is your answer
don't look for a logical answer that feeling is your
answer follow that feeling that's what makes you fully human
all right that's it i'm done here please click that
like button for me and come check out actualize.org that
is my website you will find my blog the forum

oh sorry at patreon.com actualized if you like this work
and you want me to keep releasing more and in
the future i'll be using some of that funding and
money to do some advertising and to promote this content
more to others so if you want to help spread
this this life-changing material then you can do that a
little bit help me out with with patreon that helps
and i appreciate that thank you guys for supporting me
uh because there's a trade-off there's a trade-off between the
depth of content that i like to deliver and then
the popularity of the content every 10 minutes that my
videos are longer is me losing like 10 of my
potential audience clicks views profits and so on and the
last thing i'll tell you is that no matter how
much i teach you it will mean nothing unless you
develop this solid introspection skill actualize.org as good as it
might sound is not going to compensate for your lack
of introspection abilities only you can live your life only
you can feel into the truth of situations and things
and things that i said or others have said you
have to follow your heart use your heart as a
compass to show you where to go and the more
you practice that you have the better you get at
it until eventually the entire universe will be moving through
your heart and guiding your entire decision-making process in your
life from the large decisions to the small this is
something that takes time takes years to develop this it
takes courage to to do it you're gonna make some
mistakes as you try but man i don't know i
don't know anything that's really as worthwhile so hopefully you
can feel that as well and stay tuned with me
for more you
