hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm talking about spiritual enlightenment and specifically how to
go about creating an actual experience of no self the
objective of this video is to create a real experience
of no self so this is a somewhat advanced thing
here and I'm not going to go into a lot
of foundation about what spiritual alignment is so if you
are hearing this for the first time what is this
thing called no self what is this thing called spiritual
alignment then you got to go watch some of my
earlier more introductory videos about that which you can find
on my channel but in this video I'm not going
to spend a lot of time covering theory what I
want to do is I want to tell a little
bit of theory but then jump right into a guided
meditation where we're going to try to get you a
real little taste of no self not real enlightenment but
just like a little taste of it so that this
starts to feel real for you because it's really important
that enlightenment is not confused with some philosophy or some
religious system or some way of theorizing about the world
but recognizing that this is an actual fact an empirical
fact that you can experience right now it's happening for
you every second of your life the only question is
are you conscious of it so here we're going to
try to quiet your mind down so you can become
conscious of it if only for a couple of minutes
so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna show
you the truth of no self what is this truth
well to recap from all the other videos the truth
of no self basically means that the entity that you
believe is you which is the entity that's experiencing all
of life that's perceiving the sound of my voice right
now that's looking at me if you're watching me on
video that's feeling your body that's thinking things that that
entity that that's an illusion of the mind that's not
a real entity and that this is the mother of
all truths and this is like the key that unlocks
the highest most advanced levels of personal development and self-actualization
that you can get to in life right this is
the key that unlocks it all this is the mother
of all truths this is what is behind all your
neuroses in life all your fears all your frustrations your
inability to be happy all the problems you have in
relationships all the problems you have motivating yourself and being
productive in your life it all boils down basically to
this fundamental root problem the problem is that you believe
that you are this entity but this entity doesn't actually
exist so what we want to do in spiritual enlightenment
work is we want to undertake a empirical investigation using
our senses and using first-hand experience to actually discover for
ourselves that it in fact is the case that there
is no self because it's one thing for me to
tell you and you could even agree with everything I'm
telling you but that's not going to be good enough
you need to actually experience it believing doesn't count for
anything here so that's our objective here now this is
going to be very practical video in fact you're not
going to get much from it unless you actually sit
down and do this guided meditation with me so I'm
going to guide you through it and we're going to
get to that in a couple of minutes after I
introduce this topic so find a quiet place find a
place where nobody will distract you find a place where
you're not going to feel weird doing this all right
and if you're driving your car somewhere or whatever then
you're going to have to wait to do this when
you're at home in a quiet location okay good so
the key principle here that I want to really introduce
before we get into the guided meditation is this principle
that the only thing that is real is what exists
right now in the present moment the only thing that
is real it was what exists right now for you
in your direct experience experience in the present moment now
this is a very important principle and right now I'm
not going to go into length proving it to you
right you're just going to have to take it on
my word that this principle is the correct principle right
one of the problems with doing spiritual alignment work is
that people look for proofs and they want justifications but
all that stuff really to us is not important because
we're going to cut through all that [ __ ]
and we're going to get straight to the direct experience
so we're not going to need a lot of justifications
and all that stuff plus I've got other videos that
will cover the justifications in the theory in lots of
detail so I'm not going to do that in this
video I want this video to be very very practical
but I want you to take as an axiom this
principle because this principle does pretty much all the heavy
lifting in this empirical investigation if you just take this
one principle and you run off with it and you
apply it rigorously again and again and again again in
your life you're going to become enlightened right that's the
power of this principle the trick is that right now
if you haven't done this work then you don't realize
the power that lays in this principle again reality is
only what exists right now right this second in your
awareness right in your awareness this means that if you
have some idea about how reality is if you're thinking
two minutes into the future if you're thinking about yourself
if you're thinking about your family if you're thinking about
the person in the next room if you're thinking about
the back of your head all those things are not
what's actually in your direct present experience meaning that those
things are not reality we like to call a lot
of things reality which actually are not reality so one
of the things that we do with spiritual alignment work
is that we get very very rigorous about what we
actually define reality as and reality is not the past
it's not ten years ago it's not one year ago
it's not even five minutes ago it's not even one
second ago it's right now this present moment also reality
is not future it's not ten years from now it's
not one year from now it's not even five minutes
from now it's not even one second from now it's
right now now this might seem like it's kind of
like a pedantic point but this is a very critical
point because once you start doing this self inquiry what
you're going to discover is that oh my god most
of my life I live either in the past or
in the future and a lot of times we think
well I don't always live in the future but actually
we're going to discover is what you mean by future
is you mean like a year in the future sure
you don't live in a year in the future but
the way you run through your day you're usually living
five minutes in the future 20 minutes in the future
two hours in the future right your mind is just
thinking forward all the time or is thinking about the
past well what we need to do is we to
recognize that that stuff is not reality what that is
is that's a figment of our imagination it's like a
projection inside the mind of something and we call that
reality but that's not really reality and this is really
where a lot of the illusion comes into play so
that's a very important point right but even in the
present moment you might say well Lee okay that makes
sense but even when you're in the present moment there's
still a lot of thinking that you do in the
present moment about whatever you could be thinking about the
back of your head right now and believing that that's
a real thing but actually what that is is that's
a thought an image in your mind of the back
of your head which are not actually seeing or experiencing
you might be experiencing it if you're feeling the back
of your head but you're certainly not seeing it so
what we mean by what's actually real is that it
has to be felt seen smelled Hurd touched immediately perceived
or sensed by you right this very second so if
right now you're not experiencing the moon the moon is
not real for you if you're not experiencing the Sun
the Sun is not real for you if not if
you're not experiencing your children or your family it's as
though your family doesn't exist it's not real that's what
we're saying and this is a radical claim to make
and you might wonder well are we even justified in
making such a claim and what I'm going to say
right now is that just go along for the ride
with me because it's not about justification it's about where
we're going to ultimately go using this little tool and
this tool is not to be taken as gospel it's
simply just a tool that's going to help us to
get to some really cool place experientially so the important
thing here is that enlightenment is experiential right experience enlightenment
is about actually being the truth that we're looking for
it's not about a logical rational understanding we're not trying
to model reality here we're not trying to outsmart some
other person or trying to come up with a better
theory of life than we had in the past that's
not what we're trying to do this is a very
big trap that a lot of people get caught up
in very very big trap and just because I warned
you about it doesn't mean you're not going to fall
into it so I'm going to keep warning again and
again and again some of this stuff might seem like
I'm being repetitive but this is just the nature of
the work right because there's not much substance in spiritual
alignment it's very simple you just be the truth very
simple the problem is that we need to kind of
move in circles around and around and around until your
mind starts to get what we're actually referring to here
we're referring to very basic and simple things understand that
existence itself is not a rational thing you could use
your rationality to think about life and to come up
with the laws of physics and all this stuff but
the fact that something exists in reality the very fact
that reality itself is real and it exists this is
not a rational thing this is not something that you
can use your logic on this is not something you
can think about it doesn't make any logical sense that
something exists versus that it does not it makes no
sense it just exists we just happen to find ourselves
in this amazing reality and we tell ourselves that we
know so much about reality and in a sense we
do but in another sense we don't really know what
the existence of it is we know how to manipulate
reality but that's a very very different thing than understanding
the existence of reality itself which is what we're trying
to get out with spiritual enlightenment because we're not only
concerned with the existence of reality but also even primarily
concerned about what is our personal existence Who am I
what am I really am I the body am I
the thoughts in my mind am i the voice in
my mind am i the thing that's perceiving all these
sensations what actually am I now this might seem like
it's an obvious thing well I'm this creature standing before
you or I'm this creature sitting over there well it
turns out that it's not quite so simple and in
fact you're not that creature and that you even presently
don't believe really that you're that creature but you're just
confused about it so what we're going to demonstrate what
I want to demonstrate to you in this video with
this practical exercise that we're going to do is that
enlightenment is not a philosophy it is not a theory
it is not a religious system it is not a
belief and it is not a scientific model it is
none of those things we should really pique your curiosity
because then you would wonder well Leo then what exactly
is it how could it not be one of those
things everything that I've known in my life is one
of those things what you're proposing here either you're masquerading
as something else but it's actually one of these things
or it's actually really something totally different what could that
be I can't even imagine because anything that I can
imagine is going to either be a theory a philosophy
a belief system a religion or a scientific model what
else is there well that's a very very good question
and I want to demonstrate to you what else there
is what there is besides all that stuff is there
is reality itself there is being being as in to
be this is the thing that all those other things
are trying to describe and what we want to do
is we want to eliminate all the middlemen and we
want to go directly to the being without any intermediary
so we're not going to use a philosophy or a
theory or a model or even plot to get there
because if we're using thought and that's basically what all
these different things are theories and philosophies and religions and
scientific models they're all thoughts the problem with thoughts is
that if you're thinking thoughts then you're not actually being
the reality you're just thinking about reality wouldn't it be
cool if you could be reality itself without thinking about
it now that might seem irrational that might seem crazy
that might seem like it's impossible but I want to
suggest to you that actually it might be possible just
that you haven't really practiced doing this before and that
no-one's really taught you how to do this before so
you've never really had one of these kinds of experiences
you've never really had a true experience of being what
you've had 99.99999% of your time in life is an
experience of thinking of conceptualizing of modeling of theorizing of
philosophizing of religious sizing and every other kind of izing
that you can come up with all of it basically
thoughts so we want to do is we want to
cut through all that so now I want to start
this meditation process I'm going to guide you through what
you're going to do is you're going to just sit
very comfortably it's going to be enjoyable process you're gonna
sit very comfortably and I'm going to take you through
this thing and it's going to take maybe 10 or
15 or 20 minutes I'm not sure how long it'll
take but we're going to guide you through and what
I want to help you do here is I want
to help you actually get a little taste of an
experience of no self this is an experience of what
it's like to not be a self but to be
the actual reality that we're trying to really understand all
that the word understand is not a very accurate word
here we're trying to understand this without thinking about it
which is tricky because you don't know how to understand
something without thinking about it in your life in your
life you've never done this so before I begin I
want to give credit to Peter Ralston who I got
a lot of great ideas and information from about enlightenment
so I'm he's one of my favorite thinkers about this
topic and some some of his guided meditation sessions were
really helpful to me so I was really inspired by
that so let's go ahead and begin go ahead and
take a comfortable seat I want you to sit with
your back straight and upright get comfortable put your feet
flat on the ground and close your eyes and we'll
begin make sure that you're in a quiet spot and
that no one's going to interrupt you for at least
10 to 20 minutes ok good go ahead and close
your eyes now as you do that I want you
to relax your body just a little bit start relaxing
all the muscles relax your face relax your legs relax
your stomach go ahead start to bring your attention in
the present moment in the moment of right now not
a second ago not a second later but right now
notice all the sensations in your body all the feelings
all the emotions all the thoughts any issue might have
any pressure in your body you might have any feelings
of warmth or coldness I want you to feel all
of that feel the pressure of your butt on the
seat that you're sitting on don't think about it just
experience it experience it as a raw sensation good now
experience the sensation of the soles of your feet on
the ground or whatever surface they're touching experience that right
now that experience is happening for you in the present
moment every experience that you experience is happening only in
the present moment good notice that you didn't notice these
sensations previously five minutes ago when you were watching my
video you were totally unaware of all this stuff but
now you're in the present moment and you're starting to
get a sense that these things are happening to you
every millisecond these sensations are morphing and changing and evolving
and changing how they feel so just go with that
flow whatever it is for you and just allow it
to be and just accept it can you allow yourself
to accept the present moment exactly as it is even
if it's not perfect even if you have some lingering
worry in the back of your mind about some problem
that you have in life go ahead and just let
that go just for now just for a few minutes
you can always come back to it and they need
worries you have about the future go ahead and let
that go too and just converting the present moment start
feeling your body without moving can you sense your feet
just how your feet feel can you sense your legs
your lower legs and your upper thighs go ahead and
sense them right now good now since you're but sitting
on the seed just feel it whatever feels like good
now since your lower back and sense your stomach and
your ab muscles without moving them just cents good now
bring your awareness up to your upper back and your
shoulder area and also your front chest muscles just sense
all that notice how the sensation is happening without your
control you're not controlling it you're not manipulating it it's
just happening you don't need to think about it you
don't need to make it happen it's just happening good
now since your shoulders and your upper arms down through
your elbow and into your forearms since all that good
and now since your hands the tendons in your hands
the muscles in your hands the palms of your hands
and all the way through to your fingertips without moving
just sense that good now since your neck muscles and
move that awareness up into your jaw and into the
front of your face feel the sensations the raw sensations
in your facial muscles and go ahead and completely relax
all of them make your jaw very loose relax your
face so it's totally comfortable good now go ahead and
take one really deep nice breath in at your own
pace inhale slowly and then exhale slowly good relax your
body as you do that go ahead and relax your
body right now even more than already is feel all
the tension melting away from your body and you're becoming
very still very calm very centered in the present moment
very in touch with existence notice that all these raw
sensations that you're feeling that this is raw existence don't
think about it just feel it just notice it experience
it existence is experience good now going to take one
more nice really deep breath in calmly and then exhale
and as you exhale relax your body completely good let's
have you take one more nice steady calm deep breath
in and then as you exhale relax every single muscle
in your body until you're completely and totally relaxed very
good now let your breath breathe automatically for you without
having to control it notice how the breath just breathes
for you without you having to will anything now there's
a certain raw sensation to the breath good now also
notice your heart beating inside your body what that feels
like can you feel it good notice that this happens
again automatically without any conscious control from you good now
what I'm going to have you do is I want
to have you imagine some things and I want to
have your mind be very calm and very still and
very tranquil and Placid like a still pond without a
single ripple on it as you go and you imagine
these things and I want you to just accept what
I'm going to tell you and just go with the
flow and just see where it takes you if you're
comfortable just go with the flow don't think about it
too much I want you to imagine right now that
the point from where you're sitting in the present moment
all the way into the past back all the way
to the moment that you were born that all that
time never even existed just erase it from your memory
as though it never even existed it's just not real
good now what I want you to do is I
want you to picture all the time from the present
moment to tomorrow to next year all the way to
the very end of your life that you can envision
all the plans that you have your entire calendar your
work week your schedule and all the huge big goals
you have for your future erase all of that from
your mind just make it a like pretend like it
never even existed that it will never exist total fiction
could now notice that that leaves you very centered and
very present in the moment the word past doesn't even
exist in your mind the word future doesn't exist in
your mind all there is is what's exactly happening moment
by moment by moment as I'm speaking and as you're
feeling all the sensations in your body good now imagine
that all the possessions that you have your house your
furniture your car anything else that you own your bank
account all the money in it take every single possession
that you own and imagine in your mind that they
just don't exist just completely erased from reality they don't
exist they never even existed can you allow yourself to
imagine that good total blank spot as far as possessions
go now I want you to imagine your job or
if you're a student imagine your school or any other
social obligations that you have imagine the schedule you have
for the next week or the next month in your
imagination I want you to completely erase these things imagine
as though they don't exist and they never existed at
all poof gone good now I want you to imagine
all of your social roles that you play in life
I want you to imagine your friends and your family
the people around you your relationship maybe your husband or
your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend I want
you to imagine that none of this exists take it
from your mind and just totally erase it it doesn't
exist and it never existed total blank and this feels
fine you're not threatened by this it's just a total
blank now I want you to imagine the society that
you live in the culture that you live in any
societal obligations that you have imagine that the society in
this culture just is a complete blank it doesn't exist
and it never existed at all totally gone from your
mind doesn't influence you anymore at all culture doesn't influence
you society doesn't influence you imagine that you have absolutely
no social responsibilities you have no social role whatsoever good
now imagine all the personal worries that you have in
your life all the concerns that you have whether about
money or relationships or your health or your career or
your business or your personal development take all of those
and imagine that they don't exist and they never even
existed no worries no concerns no fears all of it
just has been erased from your mind imagine that you
have no personal concerns whatsoever good notice how good it
feels how calm and peaceful it feels so just keep
going with it allow yourself to just play along and
you just go with the flow even though it might
seem a little unorthodox or weird to be imagining these
things now imagine that all the beliefs that you have
about life all the scientific beliefs you have all the
religious beliefs all the spiritual beliefs all the everyday common
most basic beliefs that you have about life things that
you believed because other people have told you about them
theories that you have about how life works and how
things should be I want you to imagine that all
of this is just completely gone poof erased as though
it never even existed good imagine also that any traditions
that you have these are also all erased as though
they never existed good now I want you to imagine
that any emotions that you've had in your life or
any emotions that you presently feel or think you might
feel that all these emotions are completely gone now and
they've been completely erased no happiness no sadness no excitement
no loneliness no fear no anger no frustration all of
it just gone there are no more emotions imagine that
emotions never even existed in reality good now I'd like
you to imagine that any opinions that you have about
life or about yourself or other people and any conceptualizations
that you have any theories you create any stories in
your mind about what reality is or how it works
that all of these are now gone erased as though
they never existed you've just completely released opinions you don't
need opinions anymore good now I want you to imagine
that thoughts no longer exist literally any thought about anything
does not exist anymore it's just gone from your mind
as though it never existed as though we lived in
a reality where thoughts do not exist good good now
notice without thinking because thoughts no longer exist so as
you're listening to me you're not thinking about anything you're
just existing you're just being right now you're just experiencing
whatever experience is coming to you right now in this
very very moment good now imagine that there is no
self-image anymore there's no picture in your mind of you
there's no more picture in your mind of your body
or of your name or of your personal history or
your social connections or your relationship to reality or your
position in life imagine that your self-image is just completely
erased it doesn't exist as though it never existed good
good can you feel the sensations and experiences right now
in the present moment the sights through your closed eyelids
the colors the feelings in your body the sounds of
my voice other sensations you might have smells pressure in
your body pressure in your mouth of your teeth and
your tongue imagine that these things are just existing pure
existence not even part of your self-image because the self
image has been erased so what are these things really
take a look at your sensations right now without thinking
about them and get very curious and ask yourself what
are these things what are these sensations these colors these
sounds allow yourself to experience them as though you're experiencing
them for the very first time as though they're completely
new and fresh and alien to you take all the
beliefs and assumptions and opinions that you have and thoughts
about these sensations and just erase them all from your
mind as though they never existed and just feel the
sensations and wonder what are these sensations I mean what
are they really what are they why do they exist
how can they exist good and now imagine that these
sensations exist without an observer observing them without a you
feeling them but that they are just free-floating experiences that
they're just like a torrent of law experience without anyone
experiencing them so what this makes them is this makes
them the raw fabric of existence imagine that existence just
exists without reasons without logic without explanation without even an
observer without you what if you weren't some thing that
was experiencing life and all these raw sensations but that
what you call you was actually simply the sum total
of every raw sensation that's being felt right now that
you were not simply some aspect of these sensations like
the bodily aspect or the mental aspect but you were
the entirety the whole universe of sensations right now that's
being felt that's existing right now and imagine that you
could exist without being a you can you allow yourself
to not be any thing in particular not a body
not a mind not a thought not a word not
an image but on nothing can you allow yourself to
be nothing who are you really if we strip away
everything that we've stripped away if we strip away all
your possessions and all your friends and family and your
cultural influences in society and your traditions and your personal
worries and beliefs and emotions and thoughts remember all these
things are gone now they don't exist even the self
image the image you have of yourself in the body
occupying the body this also doesn't exist anymore even the
notion that you are experiencing my voice right now and
that you are experiencing sitting on this seat and feeling
that pressure on your butt and on your feet and
on your legs that it's not you feeling that if
we strip all of that away what's left if all
our opinions about reality are gone and all our preconceived
assumptions and all our thoughts and all our theories are
gone what's left don't think about it just experience what's
left can you allow yourself to experience reality exactly as
it is without any filters without any assumptions without any
thoughts without needing reality to be any particular way take
a moment right now to accept exactly what you're experiencing
it whatever it is even if it feels uncomfortable or
unpleasant or whatever just allow yourself to accept it completely
because this is reality this is existence itself good just
take a moment to feel this in silence and if
you're having any thoughts stray thoughts coming up allow yourself
to accept those two and just to feel those for
the raw feeling that a thought is thoughts feel a
certain way allow yourself to accept that very good the
question is what is your most essential and fundamental nature
who are you existentially what are you do you even
exist or is all that exists is raw experience without
even an observer experiencing the experience take a look without
thinking without any prejudice about how you believe reality ought
to be or how you believe it really is remember
leave those aside those are all erased and just bask
in that raw experience and accept whatever comes up can
you feel how calm and peaceful you are right now
being totally in the present moment can you feel how
pleasant it is simply to exist can you allow yourself
to just be happy right now with reality exactly as
it is don't you feel complete right now in the
present moment without needing anything at all don't you feel
perfectly confident perfectly secure perfectly content perfectly at ease without
needing anything you don't need a relationship you don't need
money you don't need a new goal you don't need
more personal development you don't even need enlightenment just right
now in the present moment allow yourself to be calm
and content and happy acknowledge to yourself that mere existence
is enough to be happy the mere fact of existing
you might not even know exactly what is existing who
is this entity that exists because we stripped away everything
that you thought was you all those things we've stripped
away those were not you including your self-image including the
picture you have in your mind of your body and
of the back of your head and of this entity
who's listening to my voice right now what if the
voice that you were hearing right now was not something
that you were hearing but it was something that simply
existed and that you were it you're not hearing this
voice you are the voice because you are everything that
is being experienced you are the entirety of experience there
is no Center to you wherever the experience is that's
where you are good I'm going to give you a
few more seconds to bask in that emptiness notice how
pleasant the emptiness is how fulfilling and how peaceful it
is good now on the count of three you're going
to take three nice deep breaths in at your own
pace and then you're going to open your eyes one
two three take three nice deep breaths and then open
your eyes good welcome back so that was a little
guided meditation and that's a meditation that can produce an
experience of no self now there's no guarantees everyone is
very different some people might have had a very powerful
experience of no self others might have had monkey chatter
the whole time and not really been able to experience
anything others might have been resisting the whole time or
coming up with objections or been feeling emotions of various
kinds or they may have been distracted not been able
to focus whatever if you weren't really able to focus
and you felt distracted in your mind was all over
the place then what I encourage you to do is
I'll encourage you to go through this exercise again as
many times as necessary until you can get up some
sort of real calm very peaceful very content state a
state that you might call no self a state where
you as an entity D materialize and when that happens
you merge with raw experience with existence itself this state
can only be experienced without any thoughts prejudices opinions assumptions
social roles that you play or any other images that
you have of yourself you can't be attached to any
of that you can't be attached to your emotions to
your thoughts your beliefs to your possessions to your position
in life the reality is that what you really are
whether you've experienced it yet or not is you are
nothing an emptiness which allows you to be reality itself
but what happens is that you I identify yourself with
a particular small section of this whole giant experience which
you call your body and your thoughts and your mind
you identify yourself just with this which precludes you from
being what's out there and so this distinction gets created
between I'm here everything else is out there but what
you'll notice if you go through these kinds of exercises
is that that distinction can blur and can merge and
actually can completely be erased not because it's some fancy
mental technique but actually because it's the truth and that
what your present existence and way of living is socially
your current life what that is is that's putting on
garments on top of the Invisible Man you are really
fundamentally essentially existentially really the Invisible Man but because the
Invisible Man can't be seen what you do is you
have to put on garments socks and jackets and pants
and shirts and hats and glasses and jewelry you do
this because when you put all those things on you
can look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself
that's me but what's very interesting is that it's also
possible to start stripping those things away take off every
one of those pieces to see that they're not essentially
you that in fact they're just little garments and artifacts
very silly little things very arbitrary little things you totally
you totally could have been wearing a different hat and
it would have made no difference to your essential nature
which opens the very profound question of what is your
essential nature if it's none of those garments and that's
the question that I want to leave you on in
this video that is the question of spiritual enlightenment that
is not a question that can be answered through logic
or through rationality or through theorizing or through philosophy or
religion or through prayer or any other external action it
can only be realized by honestly very honestly extremely honestly
radically honestly looking inside to see what's really there not
what you think is there not what you want to
be there not what other people told you is there
not what makes sense to be there but what's actually
there you
