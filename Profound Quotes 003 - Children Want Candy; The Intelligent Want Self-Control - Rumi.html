the intelligent wants self-control children want candy hey this is
Leo for actualised org and in this video we are
doing another profound quote and the quote here is coming
from Rumi and the quote goes the intelligent wants self-control
children want candy I found this quote to be so
deep so profound that I mean it really really inspires
me when I hear it because to me this is
this is this is the root of the problem with
most of humanity and the reason that people are not
getting what they want in life is because they are
behaving like children and that they are after candy rather
than what is truly important to be after which is
self-control so let's talk a little bit about this elaborate
on it and get you some more wisdom around this
profound quote so Rumi first of all who is roomy
roomy was a Middle Ages from the Middle Ages he
is a Middle Eastern philosopher / poet / mystic and
he has some some books that he published his poetry
and his poetry is all based around a very like
deep spiritual ideas it's based around enlightenment is based around
wisdom it's based around like the core truths of life
and like Mary deep psychological truths about about human beings
so he has a lot of very pithy eloquent profound
analogies and little short stories and anecdotes so if you
are interested in that go ahead and check out one
of his books you can Amazon it so that is
Rumi about what is it what about what about this
quote you know what can we say about it what
is so deep here well I think that most people
go through life and what they want is they want
stimulation they want excitement right and this can manifest in
all sorts of ways it can manifest in very very
unhealthy dysfunctional ways or it can manifest in more healthy
ways but either way it's still the search for candy
for stimulation and I have a video that talks more
about what is happiness you might want to check that
out for a very deep definition of happiness which will
dovetail nicely with this topic but what I'm talking about
here is the following so let's say that you're a
heroin junkie and you want a hit of heroin because
you think that it's gonna make you happy so let's
put that on one end of the spectrum there's that
then you know what's another so what's a step up
from that so there's heroin maybe a step up from
that is cocaine you're you're kind of like a cocaine
addict so that's a little better than heroin but still
pretty hardcore drug so then we move you up another
notch so what was that like marijuana pot okay maybe
your pothead not not terrible but still not a not
a really healthy way to live and the reason you're
doing that is again because you you want that stimulation
from that drug then the next step above that is
maybe alcohol the next step above that is maybe partying
the next step above that is stuff like video games
and television and sex or any other kind of activities
that you're doing because they're very pleasurable maybe the next
step after that is food overeating or eating food just
because it's making you happy using food basically as a
as an emotional prop up like an emotional crutch then
what's the next step from that we might say something
more like relationships the next step up from that might
be something like going to the gym and working out
hard at the gym but ultimately the reason that you're
doing that is because you're you're doing it for a
vanity reasons because you want to look good for the
opposite sex you want to be attractive you want to
be sexy so maybe it's that you know what's the
next step up from that it might be something like
trying to get a really good job trying to get
you know a nice a nice house and you might
say well those are really nice things because a house
that serves my family so it's very it's very functional
a job a job is because it gives me satisfaction
gives me fulfillment and you know gives me money I
like having money on I have in a nice car
nice having I like having nice things so you've got
kind of this spectrum of activities that you're doing from
from the very beginning here with heroin addict which is
completely dysfunctional basically completely life it's basically leading towards an
early death and then kind of moving your way up
slightly better slightly better slightly better forms of stimulus seeking
until you get to to this end which is maybe
like pursuing a really nice career which on the surface
it's very hard to to fault someone for doing that
but in the end all of this stuff all of
this stuff what you're doing is you're like you're looking
for a hint you're looking for a hit of drug
with heroin is very obvious what that drug is it's
literally heroin with something like a career or word something
like a relationship or a marriage it's a little bit
less obvious because it's more socially acceptable and it's masked
by but you know by all these other layers of
stuff and it's very easy to say well I'm marriage
I mean how can you fall to marriage it's not
a marriage a really nice thing in fact isn't a
marriage the source of true fulfillment and so you get
kind of caught into the into that into that trap
but in the end what is the difference between someone
who is seeking a marriage as an outlet for happiness
and fulfilment versus someone who is seeking heroin for that
same reason in the end there's not much fundamental difference
it's still the same thing what you're looking for is
you're looking for something outside yourself to make you happy
you're looking for candy and when you do that you're
a child psychologically you're behaving like a child you're behaving
in a juvenile a an unwise way so what do
the Y's want well the Y's want self-control the Y's
want self mastery and the reason they want that is
because well either they're wise enough to see that none
of these are gonna work ultimately that all of these
are basically the same and then just because you're moving
up the ladder here does not mean that you're gonna
actually reach what you're after so they might even they
might see it that way or they actually might have
experienced it themselves gosh had gone out and tried this
stuff and moved up that whole ladder and come to
experience and realize that wait a minute this actually doesn't
work and the problem is that if I'm not controlled
myself then it doesn't matter what I'm doing it doesn't
matter where whether I'm at a cool party whether I'm
where I'm Snowden snorting coke whether I'm having amazing sex
whether I'm in a really good marriage or whether I
have the best career in the world it doesn't matter
if I'm not control of my own emotions if I
don't know how to control my own thoughts if I
don't understand myself on a very very deep level not
just intellectually but practically if I can't control myself I
can't control my impulses then there is no chance for
me to be happy see the whys they understand this
and when they understand this and they kind of surrender
themselves to this idea it's it's a very powerful thing
and you want to make sure that you're getting to
this point in your life you want to make sure
that you're getting to the point your life where you're
surrendered to the idea that this other stuff even though
you can pursue it and there's nothing wrong with a
marriage per se there's nothing wrong with going to the
gym and there's nothing wrong with going up to a
party once in a while or having sex you know
that's all fine but you can't you can't really rely
on that and in the end everything that that is
all pointing to is you it's pointing to your own
self mastery and that if if you don't develop a
self mastery over your lifetime then no matter what else
you do it's not going to really get you to
where you want to be and where you ultimately want
to be is you want to be at a place
of happiness contentment just kind of quiet sober contentment with
your life undisturbed unreacted on frantic just very calm very
peaceful with what is that's where you want to be
and you want to have tranquility you want to have
serenity you want to be okay with how the world
is kind of the way you might expect like an
old Zen master or like a phoo master like imagine
that person like a 80 year old Zen master I
mean is that guy like chasing around looking for women
or is he like going looking for for for snorting
a line of coke off off the off the bathroom
counter or is he even like chasing for an amazing
marriage or is he even really going after some awesome
career no I mean he sees he clearly sees through
that and he's just like very calm very stable very
grounded in the present moment and that's where you want
to be and how did he get that way well
he spent years and decades developing self mastery self control
how did he do that he did that through meditation
through disciplined practice through reading through maybe through prayer maybe
through through contemplation through whatever whatever means but something that
was focusing him grounding him turning him in word rather
than turning him outward and that's kind of the approach
that you got to take with your life if you
really want to reach a stable level of happiness and
fulfillment right so be intelligent be wise want self control
right what self control forget about the candy the candy
you've tried the candy it's taste of good but you
know that it's just like a little hit of sugar
and that little hit of sugar is not enough to
get you to where you want to go so it's
time to leave the candy aside you don't need it
anymore it's not as tasty as you thought it was
self-control that's what's really sweet self-control is so sweet it's
sweet on a whole new different level it's sweet on
a whole new different scale when you start to move
towards it alright this is Leo I'll be signing off
