            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Vr69GZikub0' target='_blank'>Relative vs Absolute Truth</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Relative Truth</b>: Leo explains that relative truth refers to subjective facts that are context and perspective dependent. Examples are statements like "the sky is blue", which depend on human perception and can shift based on conditions such as time of day, location, and personal senses. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Velocity as Relative</b>: Leo explores the concept of velocity as relative, pointing out there's no absolute velocity because comparison requires a reference point. Velocity, which is the ratio of distance over time, is relative because both distance and time are relative concepts.
</li><li><b>Units of Measurement as Relative Constructs</b>: Leo further delves into the human-constructed nature of units of measurement that facilitate comparison and quantification, such as inches or meters. He explains the truth or accuracy of these measurements, even when used in scientific calculations, is relative and depends on agreed-upon units, methodologies, and interpretation.
</li><li><b>Relative Truth vs Absolute Truth</b>: Leo distinguishes between relative and absolute truth. Relative truths are based on comparisons and subdivisions of reality and can vary across cultures and beliefs. On the other hand, absolute truths cannot be subdivided or compared and exist in a non-dual domain.
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth and Present Moment Reality</b>: Leo suggests that absolute truth exists in the present moment and can be directly accessed. He encourages listeners to open their minds to the possibility that there's nothing separating them from absolute truth and that their experiences are the absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Paradox of Absolute Truth</b>: Leo explores the paradox of absolute truth, asserting that it can't be validated externally or proven wrong. He dismisses the common objections about dangers of pursuing absolute truth, asserting that it's different from beliefs. He criticizes scientists who dismiss absolute truth without fully exploring the universe.
</li><li><b>Non-Duality and Absolute Truth</b>: Leo explains that non-duality, which can't be validated by classic measures, is defined by being singular and sovereign. It's proven as true simply because there's no other perspective against which to validate it. Existence itself is absolute truth, and the absolute truth builds the foundation for relative truths. 
</li><li><b>Doubt as a Part of Relative Truth</b>: Leo argues that doubt falls within the framework of relative truth, not non-duality. He asserts that consciousness of absolute truth leaves no room for doubt, error, or delusion. He emphasizes that absolute truth cannot be validated by anyone else, it can only be known through one's existence, making reality itself absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth and Non-Existence</b>: Leo suggests that trying to define existence creates an imaginary opposite, non-existence, which doesn't exist. The absolute truth has no opposite and there's no relative truth in the absolute domain. Reality can only exist if it recognizes its own existence. 
</li><li><b>Delusion of Multiple Consciousnesses</b>: Leo argues that giving authority to imaginary others through the division of reality into multiple consciousnesses is the chief delusion. When the attachments to authority figures are cut off, our own minds and imagination become the absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Reality Determined by Individual Beliefs</b>: Leo discusses that reality is subjective and shaped by personal beliefs. The act of believing and imagining has an impact on our perception of reality. He warns against dismissing glimpses of different reality as hallucinations and encourages personal responsibility for constructing one's reality.
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth Beyond Language</b>: Leo emphasizes that the absolute truth cannot be fully expressed through language due to inherent paradox and contradiction. He distinguishes between lowercase absolute, representing concepts and ideas, and uppercase Absolute, which transcends concepts and symbolizes the ineffable reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding Truth and Cognitive Growth</b>: Leo outlines the developmental stages of cognitive growth. He acknowledges that those confined to the pre-rational stage of absolute truth as dogma are often perceived as bigoted. He argues that moving towards higher stages allows people to comprehend the symbolic nature of religious texts.
</li><li><b>Relative Truth and Science</b>: Leo explains that science often mistakes relative truth for absolute truth, by making factual statements based on measurable and observable aspects of reality, without considering reality's actual existence. Both relative and absolute truths are intertwined, not polar opposites.
</li><li><b>Misunderstandings in Applying Absolute to Relative Domain</b>: Leo warns about the dangers of misapplying lessons from the absolute domain to the relative domain. Misconstruing statements about the absolute frequently occurs, leading to false beliefs and actions that aren't in line with actual spiritual teachings.
</li><li><b>Common Misconceptions of Spiritual Teachings</b>: Leo addresses the common misconceptions that arise from loosely interpreting spiritual teachings, such as mixing absolute and relative domains or misunderstanding aspects of spiritual experiences like enlightenment or the dissolution of the ego. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Absolute Truth Perspectives</b>: Leo details potential misinterpretations of absolute truth perspectives. Misinterpretation could result in justification for unethical behaviors, neglect of personal growth, or dismissal of suffering. 
</li><li><b>Acceptance and Surrender to Current Reality</b>: Leo explains acceptance and surrendering don't mean curing all ailments or solving problems, but instead imply seeking practical solutions or accepting current circumstances. He warns against conflating the absolute and relative perspectives and highlights the importance of fair critique and dismissal.
</li><li><b>Relative Importance of Politics</b>: Leo states that politics, though operating within the relative domain, matter as most people won't attain higher consciousness. He warns against using absolute truth to justify ego-driven survival desires. 
</li><li><b>Impact of the Absolute Truth</b>: Leo highlights the profound influence of the absolute truth, stating it could recontextualize life aspects, reduce fear, hatred, suffering, and act as a foundation for a calmer existence. He also claims absolute truth as the ultimate source of happiness and life's answers.
</li><li><b>Validation and Application of Teachings</b>: Leo advises listeners to validate teachings through personal experience and to read books from other masters to gain confidence. He encourages practicing and applying the teachings independently without relying on external validation. He acknowledges his teachings as a modern, albeit not entirely free of corruption, form of religion.
</li><li><b>Relative Nature of Velocity and Scale</b>: 
</li><li>- The video provides an in-depth explanation about the concept of velocity, arguing that there is no such thing as absolute velocity. Instead, Leo Gura talks about how velocity is inherently relative. In everyday life, humans often perceive velocities as if they were absolute. However, this perception is false as it is based on a highly limited frame. Furthermore, velocities are relative to the earth, the sun, and the center of the Milky Way galaxy among others. Velocity, he suggests, relies on comparisons between two aspects or parts of a unified whole. 
</li><li>- Similar to velocity, Leo discusses how the concept of scale is also relative. Using examples like size of the universe, an elephant, and a mouse, Leo asserts that these measurements of size or scale are dependent on a person's point of view and the existence of something else to compare it with. If there is nothing to compare it to, one cannot definitively say whether such objects or realities are big or small. 
</li><li>- Relative truth in essence involves taking a unified whole, dividing it into two or more parts, and then comparing these parts against each other. Here, Leo asserts that reality in its entirety exists as one unified whole. When talking about size or scale, it becomes clear that these concepts are most useful when there are two or more things to compare. 
</li><li><b>Units of Measurement and the Nature of Time</b>: 
</li><li>- The necessity of relative truths becomes even more evident when Leo discusses units of measurement. These units, such as inches on a yardstick, are imaginary divisions the human mind has created. These divisions allow comparisons, facilitating agreement on relative truths like someone being two yards tall. However, these measurements can only be deemed true under specific conditions and assumptions, and if any element of this framework changes, the truth of the measurement may break. 
</li><li>- The nature of time follows a similar concept. Leo references a quote by Einstein wherein the scientist defines time as the thing that a clock measures, again highlighting the relative nature of this concept. This definition cleverly allows scientists to work with time without needing to truly understand its complex nature. All fundamental scientific units, Leo points out, are predicated on this idea. Despite the precision and utility of these units in calculations, scientists cannot definitively explain the intrinsic nature of these units, further emphasizing the relative domain of science. 
</li><li><b>Understanding and Limitations of Relative Truth</b>: 
</li><li>- Leo reiterates the importance of understanding the nature and limitations of relative truths. He emphasizes that these truths are reliant on numerous variables and comparisons. Acknowledging these factors helps prevent misleading assumptions and false notions of absoluteness. However, relative truths can immensely facilitate human existence and understanding of reality, even if they are inherently limited and context-dependent.
</li><li><b>Relative Truths in Science</b>: In the physical sciences, relative truths are often derived through comparisons and subdivisions of nature into smaller divisions which are measured and compared against each other. An example given is of units of measurements, where scientists know how to measure and compare units, such as meters or joules of energy, but cannot explain what these units fundamentally are. All truths in the relative domain are based on subdivisions of reality and comparisons.
</li><li><b>Time as a Relative Concept</b>: Einstein defined time as the thing a clock measures, but this too is a subdivision of reality. Time is measured based on subdivisions of a circle (e.g., the clock face) swept over a period, thus classifying it as a relative concept.
</li><li><b>Understanding Truth for Humans and Cultures</b>: All truths humans and cultures come up with fall into the category of relative truth because they involve subdividing reality into parts and comparing them. This includes religious truths, moral norms, and societies' systems and rules.
</li><li><b>Identifying Absolute Truth</b>: Contrasting from relative truth, absolute truth exists in a non-dual domain before reality is subdivided. It is singular and without an opposite, meaning it cannot be compared to anything else. When trying to understand absolute truth, one must be wary not to bring relative assumptions and questions into the non-dual domain since this would convert absolute truth into relative truth.
</li><li><b>Accessing Absolute Truth</b>: According to Gura, absolute truth is accessible at all times and under all circumstances, independent of context. There is no veil of perception separating humans from absolute truth, hence it can be accessed directly. He suggests that absolute truth is not some hidden reality behind what is perceived, but rather, the experiences themselves are the absolute truth. He urges listeners to open their minds to this possibility. 
</li><li><b>Clearing Misconceptions</b>: Gura cautions against misconceptions arising from scientific or materialist paradigms suggesting that humans are trapped in a bubble of perceptions unable to access ultimate reality. Instead, he posits that there is nothing separating humans from absolute truth and encourages his listeners to consider that appearances and experiences are aspects of absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>From Intellectualization to Awareness</b>: Gura highlights the difference between intellectually understanding these concepts and truly opening one's mind to access absolute truth. He encourages listeners to move from the mere contemplation of these ideas to actively opening their minds to the possibility of direct access to absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Opening the Mind to Absolute Truth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of actively opening one's mind to the possibility of accessing absolute truth. This requires more than simply thinking about the idea, but actively engaging with it. Without this willingness to engage, understanding and acceptance of absolute truth cannot be achieved.
</li><li><b>Addressing Skepticism towards Absolute Truth</b>: Often, people are skeptical of the concept of absolute truth and view it as a potential self-deception or hallucination. They question how one could be certain that the absolute truth they perceive is real and not just a product of their own mind. Gura explains that those who possess these doubts have not truly opened their minds to the potential existence of absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Singularity and Certainty of Absolute Truth</b>: Absolute truth, according to Gura, is intrinsically singular and unerring. It cannot be false, mistaken, or misled, since it self-validates its existence. This requires individuals to entertain the possibility of a reality wherein something can be absolutely true without the possibility of being wrong.
</li><li><b>The Problem of Closed-mindedness</b>: Those who are unwilling to consider or accept the existence of absolute truth will be unable to progress in their understanding. This closed-mindedness can limit their understanding and exploration of the universe. Furthermore, the skepticism towards the existence of absolute truth often reflects a lack of personal exploratory experience rather than a comprehensive assessment of universal truths.
</li><li><b>Differentiating Validation in Relative vs Non-dual Domains</b>: In the relative domain, truths are typically validated through consensus and cross-referencing (like in science). However, in the non-dual domain, such validation is not possible due to the inherent singularity and sovereignty of absolute truth. Attempting to apply validation techniques from the relative domain to the non-dual domain is a misunderstanding and can hinder access to absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Existence as Absolute Truth</b>: Gura emphasizes that the individual's existence is an example of absolute truth. One's awareness and consciousness of their existence cannot be doubted or incorrect, since existence alone serves as validation of the truth. This observation bridges the gap between the conceptual and experiential understanding of absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Absolute truth and existence</b>: Leo Gura argues that absolute truth, represented by existence itself, is a profound and foundational concept that most people take for granted while conceptualizing their relative truths and beliefs. He contends that proving one's existence is not possible because any potential proof has to occur within existence, making it a second order effect.
</li><li><b>Validating one's existence</b>: According to Leo, only individuals can validate their own existence, rendering any external validation flawed. By asking someone else to affirm one's existence, one already tacitly acknowledges one's existence. Leo emphasizes this as a demonstration of individual sovereignty and authority.
</li><li><b>Understanding absolute truth</b>: Leo suggests that individuals often block themselves from recognizing absolute truth because they lean on the framework of relative truth and dubiously dismiss the absolute truth. He suggests that doubting the existence of absolute truth is a form of self-deception that has to be confronted and transcended.
</li><li><b>Absolute truth and self-deception</b>: Leo proposes that self-deception arises when people experience a glimpse of absolute truth, but later dismiss it as an illusion or hallucination. He asserts that dismissing these glimpses is part of the relative truth framework, not absolute truth. As such, one must be open-minded to the possibility of absolute truth and piercing through every veil of deception.
</li><li><b>Absoluteness truths and relativity</b>: Leo underscores that absolute truths cannot be validated by others. He furthers this point by explaining the axiomatic nature of existence in that we affirm our own existence directly and unambiguously, in contrast to every other type of validation which, whether direct or indirect, relies fundamentally on our self-conscious existence.
</li><li><b>Reality as the basis of absolute truth</b>: Leo expounds on the idea that reality itself is absolute truth because it is the only entity able to recognize its own existence. The notion that reality only exists if it recognizes its own existence is used to argue that existence and consciousness are the same. 
</li><li><b>Defining existence and absolute truth</b>: Leo argues that defining existence inherently produces a non-existent opposite and moves understanding from the non-dual to the relative domain. This effectively converts absolute truth into a relative truth. Defining existence, according to Leo, means not being fully conscious of what existence is. Being fully conscious of existence means that it cannot be explicitly defined.
</li><li><b>Concept of Existence as Absolute Truth</b>: Leo Gura explains that existence itself is the absolute truth. There are no various kinds of truth within the absolute domain. While stories spun by the mind may constitute part of the absolute truth, they often result in misconstruals or misinterpretations due to a lack of consciousness or understanding.
</li><li><b>Questioning Self-Deception</b>: Gura argues that while self-deception may exist in the relative domain, upon being directly conscious of the absolute truth, it cannot exist. He encourages viewers to acknowledge this possibility and understand that, currently, they may not have actualized it.
</li><li><b>Leaving the Relative Domain</b>: Gura posits that understanding the absolute truth is impossible while remaining within the comfort of the relative domain. He insists that in order to comprehend the absolute truth, one must leave behind the illusion of the relative domain and inhabit the absolute, non-dual domain.
</li><li><b>Reclaiming Your Own Sovereignty</b>: The struggle to access the absolute domain is described as a process of detaching from the consensus reality constructed through culture and science. Gura suggests that people are afraid to claim their absolute sovereignty due to our inherent need for validation from external authorities. This leads to a reliance on external authorities rather than trusting one's own existence and perceptions.
</li><li><b>Your Reality is Constructed by Your Mind</b>: Arguing that reality does not exist independently of your existence, Gura suggests that your perception and understanding of reality are built by your mind. He warns that this could lead to a solipsistic understanding of reality where the mind can no longer differentiate between what is real and what is unreal, and uses these ideas to explain why different individuals perceive reality in radically different ways.
</li><li><b>Radical Acceptance of Absolute Truth</b>: Gura invites viewers to consider the radical possibility that reality is exactly as it appears to be, without hidden layers, laws or forces influencing it behind the scenes. He asserts that acknowledging this concept could help one understand that they exist as the absolute truth currently, and that this existence is the only thing that there is.
</li><li><b>Absolute truth and the construction of reality</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that our belief systems and interpretations of reality are malleable and largely societally influenced. Like how children grow up accepting the social narrative that they are humans, a human could similarly grow up believing they are an alien, given enough reinforcement.
</li><li><b>Interpretations of truth</b>: People can develop unique realities based on their deep-seated beliefs, regardless of how at odds these beliefs may be with societal norms. This subjective reality becomes their absolute truth because they've deeply internalized it.
</li><li><b>Experiencing absolute truth</b>: Gura underscores the possibility of people catching glimpses of the absolute truth through phenomena like meditation, psychedelics, or yoga. However, dismissive attitudes, such as attributing these glimpses to hallucinations, may prevent a deeper understanding or actualization of this truth.
</li><li><b>Embracing sovereignty and responsibility</b>: The route to actualizing absolute truth involves a high degree of responsibility and authority over the construction of your reality. Absolute truth is self-governed and accepting this idea propels you towards a more self-assured and confident existence.
</li><li><b>Potential misunderstandings and abuses of absolute truth</b>: Gura acknowledges that the approach to absolute truth can lead to delusions and harmful behaviors when misunderstood or misapplied. Nonetheless, he argues these negatives are also prevalent under the existing materialist or relative perspective of reality.
</li><li><b>The paradox and complexity of the concept of absolute</b>: Absolute truth, according to Gura, cannot be understood or expressed without paradoxes or contradictions. The word 'absolute' is a concept (lowercase absolute), while the Absolute (uppercase A) is the ineffable reality beyond concepts. 
</li><li><b>Distinguishing between absolute truth and dogma</b>: The importance of discerning absolute truth as reality from conceptions of absolute truth as dogma or religious prescription is underscored. This differentiation helps avoid the pre-trans fallacy - misconceiving the higher-level perspective of absolute truth as a pre-rational or dogmatic belief.
</li><li><b>Levels of human cognitive development</b>: Leo Gura posits three levels of human cognitive development which are the pre, middle (orange and green), and trans stages. The pre level is primarily dogmatic and literal in interpreting absolute truths marked by literal interpretations of religious scriptures. The middle stage is more critical and employs logic, science, and postmodernism to debunks the dogmas of the pre-stage, leaning towards the idea that truths are human constructions. The trans level, which is considered the most advanced, recognizes absolute truths behind religious scriptures that the middle stage missed.
</li><li><b>Conflating religious beliefs with absolute truth</b>: Gura points out the common misunderstanding that equating his use of religious terminologies to being a religious fanatic, emphasizing that such figurative language is used to point to absolute truth. This misinterpretation is termed the 'pre-trans fallacy.'
</li><li><b>Conceptual vs Being Truth</b>: Gura makes a clear distinction between relative (conceptual) and absolute (being) truths. Relative truths are situated within language, logic, or thought whereas absolute truths exist at the level of being. Using the Lego analogy, Gura refers to the physical Lego blocks as absolute truth and the castle, built using the blocks, as relative truth.
</li><li><b>Substratum of Reality</b>: Leo identifies qualia - colors, sounds, feelings, emotions, thoughts - as the essential components of reality, opposed to scientific concepts like atoms. He critiques the scientific viewpoint as having inverted the relationship between these elements and qualia, leading to the hard problem of consciousness in science.
</li><li><b>Relative Truth in Fiction and Reality</b>: Sharing a Sherlock Holmes analogy, Gura explains that while there are facts within fictional universes like Sherlock Holmes, these facts are relative, based on how the author writes the story. By extension, when science makes declarative statements about our world, it is essentially comparing and manipulating realities just like in fictional universes. 
</li><li><b>The Connection between Fiction and Absolute Truth</b>: While the aforementioned relative truths of Sherlock Holmes' universe are fictional, the way the story is 'imagined' reflects an absolute truth. Using the analogy of the physical book containing the story, he posits the book as a representation of an absolute truth that exists out of our consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Interrelation of Absolute and Relative</b>: Leo Gura points out that both absolutism and relativism on their extreme ends can lead to problematic worldviews. He argues that the absolute and the relative are not polar opposites, but are instead deeply intertwined and co-existing elements of one unified whole reality. People often fail to see both at the same time due to their close overlap with each other. Leo also emphasizes the importance of being mindful of which perspective one is speaking from, whether absolute or relative.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretations from Conflating Absolute and Relative</b>: Leo Gura warns against common misinterpretations that happen when people try to carry over the lessons from the absolute into the relative and vice versa. He provides different examples of relative truths that originate from glimpsing the absolute - these range from "We are all one" and "The brain does not exist" to "Reality is a hallucination". 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Misconstruing Absolute and Relative Viewpoints</b>: Misinterpreting these insights can lead to moral, attitudinal or practical errors in the relative domain. Leo explains different occasions where such misapprehensions occur, such as the belief that it's acceptable to steal if nothing is good or bad, or that one should not bother with life's practical tasks if life is fundamentally meaningless.  
</li><li><b>Ego Co-opting Glimpses of the Absolute</b>: Gura points out that the ego often co-opts glimpses of the absolute for its self-centered purposes, thereby distorting the truths obtained. He cautions viewers not to be hasty in applying lessons from the absolute to the relative domain, as it often leads to confusion, misunderstandings and misuse.
</li><li><b>Speaking from the Relative and Absolute Perspective Simultaneously</b>: Leo Gura clarifies that the relative and absolute aren't separate but overlap entirely. Therefore, when he is speaking, he's speaking from both the relative and absolute perspective. Understanding one's divine nature from the absolute perspective does not mean curing ailments or solving problems in the relative reality, but rather accepting them or seeking practical solutions. 
</li><li><b>Relative Truth Whilst Speaking about Enlightenment</b>: Leo's discussions about enlightenment, while rooted in the perspective of absolute truth, still acknowledge the relational circumstances of survival in the physical world. He emphasizes the need to respect and acknowledge the details, consequences, and practicalities of survival in the relative domain, whatever one's spiritual understanding.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation and the Dangers of Conflating the Absolute into the Relative</b>: Gura highlights the critical errors and dangers that can result from misunderstanding or misapplying absolute truths in the relative domain. For instance, the belief in immortality from the absolute perspective does not negate concerns for survival in the relative realm. Furthermore, illicit activities like stealing remain serious offenses, and neglecting personal growth or neglecting to address suffering remain significant issues in the relative sphere. He warns against spiritual teachers who neglect these details of the relative perspective.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Differences between Absolute and Relative while Striving for Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura explains that striving for enlightenment should not lead to the neglection of needs and issues concomitant with human life  the complexities of the relative domain. Upon achieving or glimpsing enlightenment, it is essential to recognize the persistence of the relative domain where illness, challenges, survival and responsibility still exist.
</li><li><b>Survival in Relative Domain</b>: In the relative domain, survival is a concern, which requires taking care of physical health, earning money, and fulfilling various human responsibilities. Although enlightenment might recognize the concept of immortality, it does not undermine the necessity for these relative domain activities.
</li><li><b>Monetary Aspects of Spiritual Teaching</b>: Charges for spiritual teachings can be justified by the need for survival in our cash-driven society. The non-dual understanding does not exempt one from the practical requirements of life, like eating and maintaining a shelter, which require money.
</li><li><b>Interpreting Absolute Truth in Relation to Religion</b>: Leo's perspective on the absolute truth or God does not validate specific religions. Mis interpretations can result from the conflation of terms like 'God' or 'Absolute' with religious beliefs.
</li><li><b>Conflation of Absolute and Relative Perspectives</b>: Misunderstanding the absolute and relative perspectives can justify inappropriate behavior and ignore the necessity for personal growth, leading to issues like cheating, unhealthy eating, and neglect of spiritual practices.
</li><li><b>Inputs on Suffering</b>: From the absolute perspective, the idea of suffering does not matter. However, in the relative domain, the alleviation of suffering is crucial as it affects our survival and living conditions.
</li><li><b>Illness and Acceptance</b>: Even when enlightened, one can experience illness due to genetics, lifestyle, or environmental factors. Embracing one's divine nature does not mean eradicating these ailments, but rather accepting them and finding practical solutions.
</li><li><b>Past, Memories and Birth</b>: When speaking about past experiences, birth, or parents, Leo is speaking from the relative perspective and a shared cultural understanding of reality. Despite being recognized as imaginary in the absolute sense, these aspects still hold relevance in the relative domain.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura discusses the practicality of distinguishing between absolute and relative realities</b>: A relative truth like having a personal past and identity is necessary for everyday conversation and practical functioning of society, but these truths are illusions from an absolute perspective. Such misconceptions can arise from both newcomers to the idea of absolute truth and those who have realized it, with the latter often dismissing the importance of relative truths. Leo emphasizes the need to acknowledge the significance of relative truths, as survival and most human activities are contained within this domain. 
</li><li><b>Importance of relative truth and its role in survival</b>: Everyone, especially those who recognize the existence of absolute truth, must adhere to relative truth to survive. It's what structures societal norms and basic survival needs like food and shelter. Even if absolute truth is realized, the human form remains, which is finite and requires certain survival activities for maintenance.
</li><li><b>Challenges with absolute truth</b>: The magnitude of absolute truth is often the reason why many avoid seeking it. To survive, we need to dissect reality into manageable pieces, constructing small, relative truths to manipulate our immediate reality. People often don't seek absolute truth as it doesn't seem helpful for dealing with their localized lives.
</li><li><b>Interaction between relative and absolute perspectives in life's satisfaction</b>: A narrow, localized existence may eventually become dissatisfying, pushing individuals to seek a more expansive life closer to absolute truth. While absolute truth negates the importance of lower-order needs like sex, money, or social status, the relative reality is that these needs hold most people back from enlightenment. A practical relative way toward awakening involves satisfying basic needs before transcending them.
</li><li><b>Value and importance of accessing absolute truth</b>: Despite seeming impractical for survival or daily life, accessing absolute truth is a profound life event that recontextualizes everything. It eliminates fear, hatred, and suffering while fostering a broader perspective on life. Comprehending the absolute truth offers a calmer, non-reactive lifestyle, and it's referred to as a foundational source of true happiness and the answer to life's questions.
</li><li><b>Contact with Absolute Truth</b>: Leo Gura discusses the benefits of experiencing absolute truth, emphasizing that it recontextualizes one's life, provides a profound understanding of reality, dispels fears and suffering, elevates happiness, answers life's big questions, and offers unparalleled beauty. He asserts its importance, especially for those feeling unfulfilled despite material success, observing that connecting with the absolute truth can ground individuals and provide a stable foundation for life.
</li><li><b>Role of External Resources</b>: Gura advises viewers to review other spiritual teachings to validate and buttress what he says. He recommends his book list as a starting point for this diverse exploration. He stresses the importance of individual experience and verification in understanding these teachings.
</li><li><b>Resources on Actualized.org</b>: Leo introduces resources available on Actualized.org, including a book list, life purpose course, blog, and forum. These resources provide support and guidance during the journey to understanding absolute truth. He mentions Patreon for those wishing to support his independent research and teachings.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as Modernized Religion</b>: Gura describes Actualized.org as a modernized, less corrupt form of religion, acknowledging that while the platform aims for purity and authenticity, it is not entirely free from corruption due to the inherent flaws and biases of being human. He encourages individuals to validate teachings through personal experience, suggesting this will reduce the impact of any potential biases or corruption.
</li><li><b>Thinking Independently</b>: Leo concludes by advising viewers not to blindly follow any spiritual teacher, including himself. The best safeguard against potential teacher corruption or biases, he says, is to test teachings oneself and adhere only to those that resonate with personal experience.
