hey Leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about correcting the stigma around psychedelics
[Music] you this is gonna be a in-depth multi-part series
aimed at addressing the issue of this stigma that surrounds
the field of psychedelics and to educate people about this
field and it's really quite a remarkable and amazing field
that we've only just begun to explore in this episode
I'm not gonna focus on talking about my own trip
reports I've talked about that in the past and I
will in the future but not here and I'm not
gonna talk about how to trip or the proper protocol
for which psychedelics to do or all the mystical experiences
that psychedelics can can lead towards that's not what we're
interested in here I just want to lay the foundation
for this field because it's an interesting field and most
people don't realize that it's a field and there's this
huge gaping hole in our education system which teaches nothing
at all about this field it doesn't teach about the
historical context it doesn't teach about the Anthropology it doesn't
teach about the botany of it it doesn't teach about
the chemistry of it isn't teach about the psychology the
psychiatry the clinical and medical studies and a lot of
new science that's being done this is a really cutting-edge
field that a lot of people I think underestimate and
the reason that is is because our culture has this
giant stigma around psychedelics as soon as you bring up
the word people immediately associate it with drugs and then
they dismiss you or they demonize you or they think
you've gone on the deep end or they think you're
a hippie or any one of these kind of stereotypes
and this is really unwarranted and I want to show
you that this is the case now maybe I'm preaching
to the choir some of you already are on board
with me with psychedelics but really I was quite surprised
when I started to release my psychedelic videos about a
year or so ago I got a pretty big backlash
from my followers and people would leave me comments and
they still leave me comments to this day about my
stance on psychedelics and really what happened with me is
that I started experimenting with them I really wasn't into
drugs at all I wasn't into psychedelics at all it
was just something that I stumbled upon in my research
because the thing that I'm interested in is personal development
and reality and so I'm always researching new stuff and
my stance on psychedelics before I tried them was basically
one of the common masses because you know what I
was raised in the same education system and by the
same culture that many people who denounced psychedelics have been
raised in and our education system is really hell-bent on
keeping kids away from drugs and this was programmed into
my mind from a very early age as it probably
was for you if you grew up in the United
States or I'm not sure how it is in other
countries but I'm sure that there are similar types of
programs and drugs on war that goes on here in
the US which also happen in Europe and in Asia
or wherever else around the world in westernized first world
countries that are rather modern but as we shall see
throughout this series is that actually almost all of the
negativity around psychedelics comes from just downright ignorant on the
people even the people who are teaching this stuff in
school they just don't know the fact is these people
who are anti psychedelics they haven't actually drunk done them
they haven't actually tried them and they are so hell-bent
on their beliefs about psychedelics without having any direct experience
of it that then that list leads to all sorts
of absurdities and where we're at now in our culture
is that the education system and what it teaches about
psychedelics is anti-scientific it's anti medical it's anti psychological it's
anti historical and really it's anti human as you will
see and we're gonna build the case for that this
episode is gonna be filled with a lot of evidence
and facts what I want to do here with a
series just to present a lot of just basic facts
because there's this whole like I said right and so
people don't know the facts by not knowing the fact
by not having the historical context by not seeing how
psychedelics fit in with everything else that we do in
culture and also by not knowing the latest clinical and
psychological studies that have been done just in the last
10 years this is all cutting-edge stuff this is gonna
completely change your mind and it's gonna dispel this stigma
because the reality is is that not only are psychedelics
not bad as they are stigmatized to be but they
are actually a hundred and eighty degrees opposite they're not
just neutral they're amazing and they are very important for
the development of the human race and maybe perhaps for
the survival of the human race but that's difficult to
appreciate before you really hear this case that I'm gonna
lay out for you and then you actually go and
try them for yourself the reality is is that in
our society in the West we have flagrant propaganda coming
from the government and from the business sector and from
the from education and from our culture and even from
our religions from judeo-christian religions that are that are very
conservative and Orthodox against psychedelics and they are filled this
propaganda is filled with lies and with dogma and it's
based on zero direct experience so we're gonna address all
that here but really I shouldn't have been that surprised
that there was a backlash because you know what um
until I tried the psychedelics I wasn't convinced myself I
was sort of closed-minded to it but the thing that
saved me from committing a great epistemic blunder here is
that I actually listen to my own advice about epistemology
and I keep my mind open and I listen to
feedback and I listen to comments and I investigate and
I explore and I question my own deepest held convictions
and beliefs and I know that just because I have
an opinion about something doesn't mean squat until I actually
go and try it out for myself and that's what
I do with psychedelics and then that's what that's what
changed my mind so see was wrong and I will
continue to be wrong in the future and there's other
stuff I've been wrong about in the past the key
is not to be perfect all the time with your
knowledge you're never gonna be perfect don't even try to
be perfect with your pursuit of truth the key is
to have the right guiding principles so that you don't
get stuck in your ignorance don't double down on your
ignorance that's the key mistake that people make and that's
the reason that I talk so much about epistemology I
talk about paradigms paradigm locks default positions true versus false
skepticism belief systems and and all this sort of stuff
and the reason we do a lot of that here
is because that's necessary to open your mind to break
out of a lot of this kind of cultural conditioning
that we're fed not just about psychedelics but about all
sorts of stuff and that's necessary for you to really
become highly conscious in this world it's not gonna happen
otherwise what I want to do here is I want
to start off the discussion by quoting from Terence Mckenna
again I already quoted him at the beginning here but
he was a pioneer in this field an early pioneer
and he was remarkable in his ability to articulate very
elegantly and very concisely the core issues surrounding psychedelics he
was a psycho not himself and also a brilliant writer
so here's what he says about psychedelics quote psychedelics are
illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you
may jump out of a third-story window psychedelics are illegal
because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally lay down models
of behavior and information processing they open you up to
the possibility that everything you know is wrong and he
also says quote part of what psychedelics do is they
D condition you from cultural values this is what makes
it such a hot political potato a political hot potato
since all culture is a kind of con game the
most dangerous candy you can hand out is one which
causes people to start questioning the rules of the game
and quote that's Terence Mckenna this in a nutshell is
the reason that this stigma exists and this is something
we're gonna explore later on in this series in the
second or third episode I'm not sure how many episodes
we're gonna need here because I need to protect a
lot of factual information to you but we're gonna get
into the the really the guts of why society likes
to demonize psychedelics so much it's not an accident and
Terence Mckenna tells us here why this is so what
we're gonna cover in this series here's a brief outline
for you we're gonna give you a lot of historical
context about how psychedelics were used throughout the last 10,000
years in human civilization and that they played a much
bigger role than is generally acknowledged we're gonna talk about
the medical benefits and some of the amazing clinical studies
and research that has been done and how psychedelics can
help with all sorts of issues from depression to anxiety
to end-of-life and PTSD and so forth we're going to
talk about common misconceptions and myths about psychedelics and we're
gonna dispel those we're gonna talk about why psychedelics are
demonized what's really behind that and we're gonna we're gonna
talk about the double standard that exists between other substances
that are legalized in society like Alcohol Tobacco opioids and
bad food and then we're gonna compare the risks of
all of these with psychedelics so that we can put
them into proper context and see whether making them illegal
is really justified as the government likes to proclaim so
that's our outline now let's begin with understanding and important
catch-22 about psychedelics this is something that a lot of
people who are just getting introduced to psychedelics we're hearing
about them for the first time don't fully appreciate this
catch-22 so here's what this is this is the sort
of circular logic which prevents people from opening their minds
to psychedelics and this catch-22 goes as follows I come
to you and I say hey psychedelics can transform your
life they really can they could be some of the
greatest experiences ever and then you say no leo psychedelics
are dangerous they will damage my brain they will give
me hallucinations they are just for recreation they will lead
me down the road to using hard drugs and this
whole this whole thing is just a delusion but where
is that notion coming from if you think about it
that notion is coming from your schooling your education and
from culture at large where did you pick up that
idea it wasn't from direct experience with psychedelics it was
from culture so you're depending and trusting on culture to
be correct now what I'm telling you here is that
culture is incorrect and in fact you'll be shocked at
how incorrect culture is but the catch-22 is that you
have to try psychedelics to discover this and of course
when I tell you Kay go try it what do
you say you tell me no Leo I'm not gonna
try because it's gonna it's gonna damage me but the
only reason you believe it damages you is because you're
believing your culture you see so you're locked into this
loop of circular logic and the only way to break
out is well there's two ways one in the most
direct method is to actually go try psychedelic for yourself
and do a scientific experiment and see you can easily
prove me wrong if I happen to be wrong by
trying to psychedelic in' and maybe maybe it'll justify all
your opinions about it or maybe the reverse will happen
what will happen is the reverse if you give psychedelics
a good go see one of the problems people do
is that they say oh well Leo I have tried
psychedelics when I was back in high school you know
me and my buddies we went to a rave and
we got drunk and wasted and had some mushrooms and
I tried a little bit of that and it was
it was bad I had hallucinations and a bad trip
and so now I have direct experience and I know
that they're bad no see that wasn't a proper evaluation
of psychedelics you did them when you were a kid
in a party setting with alcohol with a bunch of
other nonsense you didn't even know what you were taking
what the dosage was you were not prepared you were
not sure and so you experience something that you can
barely even remember all you can remember is that it
left a bad taste in your mouth that's not the
right way if you do them responsibly using the right
protocol at the right dose in the right setting with
an open mind and having the right context for what
you're experiencing that means doing some research reading some books
listening to me talk about non-duality and spiritual learning about
these things have that background foundation in place then you
will see that what I'm saying is very much true
and one of the most incredible epiphanies you will have
about psychedelics is that they will shatter your faith in
culture and in society which is precisely why they're so
dangerous and why culture and society doesn't like them yes
you can have amazing non-dual experiences you can have experiences
of God you can have experiences of various deities and
and you can experience oneness in connection with the world
you can also self reflect in a very deep way
and you can do real growth accomplish real personal development
by getting to the bottom of your addictions your neuroses
your bad behaviors your anxieties and and your hangups and
your limiting beliefs they can help you with all that
sort of stuff you can heal yourself both physically and
psychologically with psychedelics but and all those will be huge
revelations but perhaps not as much as the revelation that
everything that culture has told you about psychedelics is a
hundred and eighty degrees wrong it's the exact opposite it's
almost as though the devil got ahold of this field
of psychedelics and turned it inside out to serve his
purpose of maintaining the status quo hmm might that just
be an accident or might there be something a little
more deeper to that if you wash my Devil episode
then maybe you'll know that's the catch-22 so you have
to be very careful here not to reason in a
circle but to really be honest with yourself very objective
and to say okay this guy's telling me that there's
information that I don't know about their studies I don't
know about and that society has lied to me about
this stuff and to be honest I don't have a
direct experience of what he's talking about so I have
to keep an open mind he might be wrong but
maybe he's right see and maybe he's not just right
and that's just okay fine he's right but it's like
he's right and this information could transform my entire life
forever you see that's why this topic is so important
is precisely because of the potential that this topic has
for transforming you and everyone around you in all of
society and this is something that we need more than
ever now in the 21st century so the substance is
just to be very clear and specific that we're gonna
be talking about here and calling psychedelics are gonna be
things like DMT v Mao DMT LSD mescaline psilocybin or
magic mushrooms iboga salvia divinorum MDMA or otherwise known as
ecstasy these are all in this category I'm not really
gonna be talking about pot or weed or marijuana you
could call it a psychedelic or you could not I
mean edibles like edible pot is actually quite hallucinogenic but
generally smoking pot is not it's not done it's not
nearly as powerful as a true psychedelic and it is
really in a sort of separate category but what we
need to do is we need to make a very
clear distinction between all these substance that I just talked
about and heroin cocaine crack and meth quaaludes and any
other kind of weird hard drugs that exist out there
these here are recreational drugs and they need to be
very clearly distinguished from psychedelics and see one of the
first mistakes or actually maybe it's not a mistake that
our culture has made is lumping all of these together
into one category in our education system we try to
treat all this stuff as just drugs and not just
in our education system but even legally the the DEA
the US federal government classifies DMT and LSD and psilocybin
as schedule 1 substances the exact same category as heroin
cocaine and crack believe it or not meth actually meth
from what I can recall if my memory serves me
correct meth is actually scheduled to so the federal government
says that DMT and LSD and psilocybin is worse than
meth which if you have any experience with this field
just goes to show you how ridiculous that is there's
a lot of ridiculous things in the DEA guidelines but
we'll talk more about that later but anyways see our
education system and I can understand where it's coming from
it has lumped all these things together because our education
system it's number one priority is what it's not the
spiritual evolution of mankind or of our kids it's not
higher consciousness consciousness is not even taught in school you
can go to school for 12 years you will not
hear the word consciousness let alone all the stuff that
goes into it all the subtleties of it nor will
you hear the word personal development our school system has
loved all this together because our school systems number one
priority is just to give kids the basics they need
to have a job and to not be homeless and
to have a little bit of education and to not
get sidetracked and to not become heroin junkies and that's
good nothing wrong with that of course we don't want
kids becoming heroin junkies and so of course we tend
to lean towards the side or air in the car
in the side of caution and we shouldn't say well
just keep kids away from drugs entirely we don't want
to split hairs too much about this stuff but see
damage is done there because in this sort of sloppy
black-and-white way of thinking we really fail to see a
big difference between these kind of substances and why they're
used and how they're used and what their potential is
see heroin doesn't have the potential to enlighten you heroin
doesn't have the potential to make you a more self-aware
human being whereas DMT and LSD do and heroin is
extremely addictive whereas LSD and DMT are not addictive at
all and that's something we'll cover more as well so
we need to make this very clear distinction here otherwise
this whole field gets muddied up and any time people
talk about psychedelics those who are not in the know
just hear it as drugs it's like olio you're talking
about drugs you're just doing drugs you're just justifying your
use of drugs actually I'm very anti-drugs not only am
i anti heroin and cocaine and and meth and all
this sort of stuff but I'm even anti alcohol and
anti smoking and tobacco and anti prescription drugs and I'm
anti eating sugar and drinking soda and caffeine I don't
even I don't even consume caffeine I mean I do
a little green tea so that technically has caffeine in
it but I don't I don't like guzzle down coffee
or any of this kind of stuff right so I
actually carry my dislike for drugs over into a lot
of other fields to me there's no distinction really between
drugs and for example television or reading tabloid magazines or
getting addicted to pornography are getting addicted to the Internet
or getting addicted to greasy food to me all this
stuff is just addiction and then there's different degrees of
it and psychedelics are really a whole nother ballgame now
let's start by talking about the very deep historical context
here to put all this into perspective to see the
big picture once you got to understand here and this
is again something that's not taught in school at all
is that you can find psychedelic plants by the dozens
and hundreds on every single continent in the world every
single culture from the beginning of prehistory we have evidence
that they have partaken of psychedelics and this is what
I want to show you a lot of evidence for
it's really quite mind-blowing when you start to study this
stuff because none of this stuff is talked about anywhere
you don't see this on the evening news this isn't
talked about in magazines mostly this isn't talked about by
your family by your co-workers it's not taught in school
so where else would you get this information other than
that if you were interested in you actually went and
did this open-minded research see what you got to understand
is that human beings for about ten thousand years have
been living in cities and building civilizations but before that
we were hunter-gatherers and as hunter-gatherers we relied on our
environment to live this was a matter of survival this
was a matter of natural selection evolution this was serious
stuff these days we live in our comfortable cities and
we're very disconnected from nature we're disconnected from the stars
we don't even see them in our cities were disconnected
from the earth were disconnected from building shelters from hunting
animals from gathering berries and mushrooms and and identifying plants
when you take this into account you realize that actually
herbalism was one of the earliest sciences that man developed
before there ever was a notion of science herbalism is
the science of distinguishing making fine distinctions between all sorts
of different kinds of plants and the environment that you're
living in because we lived in forests and we lived
in savannas and grasslands and we lived in jungles so
no matter where we lived or even in the deserts
there were critical plants to our survival there and these
early herbalist soar medicine men they would go out there
and they would have to test through trial and error
and at great peril and danger and risk all these
plants personally by taste testing them testing them on their
people and seeing all the survival benefits that could be
gleaned from herbalism so they had to go out there
and they had to learn which berries we could eat
which mushrooms are edible which ones will kill you which
which vines we can cut open and get water from
which leaves we can rub on our wounds to cure
an infection or which flowers we could brew to make
a tea to help with an upset stomach or to
cure the plague or to help with pregnancy AC or
to stop bleeding so these were very serious matters and
if you take a look at modern surviving native tribes
hunter-gatherer like tribes which live in Africa which live in
Aboriginal Australia which live in the Amazonian rainforest basically all
over the world in Indonesia these types of tribes exist
you can see that these people are very very reliant
on herbs and plant life also animal life of course
to their knowledge of it and they're very fine distinctions
of it in order to survive which is the exact
opposite of us today in modern cultures and as modern
cultures we like to think that oh well we're the
sophisticated ones they're just like savages primitives living in the
forest running around naked with a loincloth or even less
but the more you start to study these savages and
these primitives you realize that actually they have a lot
of wisdom and intelligence and there are also very spiritual
people and also you start to study them and you
see all these guys don't have things like depression or
anxiety I see they don't have suicide they don't have
heart heart disease epidemics they don't have ADHD problems with
their kids you see so you start to see that
and say hey maybe they are the intelligent ones and
were the backwards ones maybe we have it 180 degrees
in the opposite direction maybe the devil is playing a
trick on us mmm that's an interesting possibility and it
just makes perfectly logical sense that 10,000 years ago even
a hundred thousand years ago our ancestors would be experimenting
with every possible plant that was in their environment and
we even see primitive very primitive notions of herbalism at
work in our cats and dogs if you have a
cat or a dog who is sick you can see
them go I had a cat once and she would
go and she was sick she would actually nibble on
some grass some blades of grass that grew outside and
that would help her to to purge and to get
any bad food out of her system see that was
a very primitive form of herbalism but of course us
humans we took it to the next level because we're
much more resourceful than that so let me show you
some of the evidence for this and it's really quite
remarkable I'm gonna be flashing a lot of images here
for you as I'm speaking these will be images of
various cave art and Egyptian hieroglyphics and all sorts of
interesting examples that we see um from history so first
what I have for you is I have one of
the earliest known clear depictions of psychedelic use in primitive
cultures this is from a cave in Alma in modern-day
Algeria this cave is called the Cecilia's year cave and
they're in that cave there's this picture of what looks
like a bee shaman I call him a bichon because
he looks like he's wearing a sort of a bee
mask in this striped suit and this shaman is holding
mushrooms in his hands and has mushrooms growing all around
his body very very clear what you see here you're
gonna see two images you're gonna see one image of
the original cave painting which is a bit worn out
it's kind of hard to make sense of it and
then you're gonna see a much clearer and sharper pencil
sketch of the original cave painting guess how old this
is this cave painting has been dated to be 9,000
or 6,000 BC so there's a there's a big gap
there because the radiocarbon dating is is not perfect but
it's 9,000 to 6,000 BC plus ad 2,000 years of
AD to that which means that this is an 11
to 8 thousand year old cave painting and already we
have this very clear use of psychedelic mushrooms we also
have examples of psychedelic use within ancient Egypt and you
better believe that ancient Egypt was not just your ordinary
civilization they weren't just like us they weren't just concerned
about Commerce and living ordinary lives they were a very
spiritual culture very clearly and they invested a lot of
their resources towards spirituality and that was not just primitive
beliefs that was something deeper when you started to study
ancient Egypt it's really quite amazing what you start to
find there and especially if you've done some psychedelics and
you can connect some of these dots so what you'll
see here I'll show you a picture of this ancient
Egyptian what's called the Tree of Life they call this
the Tree of Life this was a spiritual symbol for
them this was very important in their culture and what
this tree of life was was the occasional Attica I
also want to show you a picture here of the
actual acacia plant it's a tree or like a giant
shrub this bush and what's special about acacia is that
it contains high concentrations of DMT and minut concentrations of
five Meo DMT now this acacia bush is quite prevalent
all around the world it's found in South America it's
found in Europe it's found in the Middle East it's
found in Africa I believes and there's a lot of
varieties of this acacia mimosa trees acacia are these are
all in the same category and all of them contain
various degrees of DMT now is it an accident that
the Egyptians revered the acacia tree out of all the
trees you know why didn't they reveal that Revere the
palm tree why was an appalling tree the tree of
life but rather the acacia bush after all there's not
much special about the acacia tree it doesn't look very
special it looks like a bush if you wanted to
revere a magnificent tree you could find better trees you
could find oak trees palm trees and all sorts of
stuff like that which is much more grand to look
at but perhaps not as psychedelic so what we are
theorizing here and we don't know this for sure but
there's a pretty good chance that the Egyptians tested out
this acacia in all its various forms eating it grinding
it turning it into powders turning it into concoctions brewing
it steeping it fermenting it and smoking it and all
the other things combining it with all sorts of other
stuff just to see what kind of properties it has
and there's a good chance they stumble upon its DMT
effects we're not sure exactly how but that's a little
speculative but since they worship this tree it's not that
far out of the realm of speculation especially when you
take into account the other things that I will cite
to you here in a little bit other examples of
the acacia that's been used in other cultures so it's
not just limited to Egypt but while we're on the
topic of Egypt let me mention the Blue Lotus here
are some pictures of the Blue Lotus and I want
to show you the actual picture of the Lotus as
it exists in the in the lily fields in the
water but also how the Egyptians depicted it because the
Egyptians also revered the Blue Lotus you can see it
in a lot of their temple paintings and in their
hieroglyphic I guess you'd call them reliefs where they they
show this this blue lotus being picked and being used
and being revered and the Blue Lotus while it's not
a very powerful psychedelic you're not gonna trip balls on
it but it does put you into a sort of
dreamy like trance state it does warp your consciousness a
little bit and it actually has strong afro diac qualities
and they would use it for their Egyptian orgies and
we actually have a picture here of a classic Egyptian
orgy and you can see the blue lotus flower above
the head of the woman who is having sex with
the man every depiction of the woman has a little
blue lotus flower over her head which I've pointed out
with red arrows so that's very interesting also interestingly the
the classic the classic poems of the Iliad and the
Odyssey if you remember the Odyssey if you read that
in high school or something then you remember towards the
end of the Odyssey Odysseus and his men they land
on the island of the Lotus Eaters and the Lotus
Eaters basically are people who get stuck on that island
and they eat these lotuses on the island these these
lotuses just sediment is this this delightful trance and they
never want to leave the island again they get entranced
for life and they get enslaved by this Lotus well
that pretty well describes what the Blue Lotus is like
although it's a exaggeration of it and we know that
ancient Greece and Rome were very very strongly influenced by
the prior civilization of Egypt so it makes perfect sense
that Homer would have adopted that tale from maybe stories
that he heard about how the Egyptians used the Blue
Lotus and of course the Egyptians probably used it for
sex and for for festivals and for parties and for
banquets and for all sorts of fun stuff not necessarily
in spiritual uses but maybe also in spiritual uses too
probably a combination actually because in these primitive cultures that
were these sharp distinctions between recreation and festivals and spirituality
all this stuff was holistically combined together in a seamless
way also we have the story of Moses from the
Old Testament and of course you know the classic story
of Moses where he sees the burning bush and the
burning bush is God speaking to Moses giving him signs
which leads him to go on and to lead his
people and to found Israel and to to really advance
Judaism well what happened there what is the burning bush
the burning bush in the Old Testament is none other
than the acacia tree that's what it was supposed to
be so wasn't an accident that did Moses just was
he just walking along the long side of the road
and just happened to bump into a burning bush maybe
or maybe what happened was that these ancient peoples knew
about acacia knew about the DMT and the spiritual effects
and that they actually had rituals for burning this bush
for smoking it for inhaling the fumes maybe for mixing
it into concoction with other stuff and that's where this
idea of the burning bush came from on the other
side of the globe we have Chile and Argentina where
they have found archaeological evidence of snuffing pipes for snorting
yopo yobbo seeds yopo seeds come from a tree which
is actually similar looking to acacia they have these paws
these long pods in these pods or seeds you can
break them out they're very flat looking you can see
a picture of it here and these yopo seeds can
be ground into a fine powder mixed with snail shells
and soda in order to give it the right consistency
and texture and then it can be snorted very powerfully
snorted up your nose and the these natives they still
do it to this day this is a classic ritual
that they have these yopo seeds they contain DMT five
mio DMT and bufotenin in various percentages and we have
evidence of these snuffing pipes with trace amounts of this
yopo which go back to 2130 BC and you can
see you can find videos and images of these natives
which still have these practices to this day they take
these long pipes fill them full of a lot of
yobbo and then they just one native will blast it
you have to actually like a blow dart blast it
into the nose of the other native and powerful shock
that just blows up your nose because you need a
lot of this yopo in order to get the full
effects because it's not very pure the concentration not very
high so they need to like stuff a gram of
that stuff up your nose which is not easy to
do we also have evidence from that part of the
world from Peru for example of very early use of
the San Pedro cactus which contains mescaline and we have
evidence of this dating back to 8,000 600 BC through
to 5,600 BC so in that range is the earliest
use of peyote there that's been found I mean not
peyote but San Pedro peyote is the next one I
want to tell you about that's also a cactus that's
found in the Americas especially in the Mexico region and
in the southwestern US region and the earliest peyote use
that has been found is in chula cave on the
Rio Grande River in Texas and this has been carbon
dated to three thousand seven hundred eighty BC to 3000
660 BC and these peyote buttons were so well preserved
that scientists were actually able to take them and to
do an alkaloid extraction and they were surprised that they
were able to get almost as much of the active
ingredient from peyote the mescaline as they were from modern-day
peyote buttons and these were five thousand-year-old peyote buttons and
they were still psychoactive after 5,000 years that's quite remarkable
and of course peyote ceremonies are a classic ritual that
is done by Native American tribes throughout the US and
they are still done to this day and the monnet
t'v tribes in the u.s. actually have a legal right
to do that because they're they have sort of different
laws that govern them than American citizens another interesting example
that I found is from Scotland there's a there's an
ancient archaeological site they're called skara brae which is being
excavated and their what they found evidence of is not
psychedelics so much as they found this hallucinogenic alcohol they
actually found an alcohol that was brewed out of wheat
but it wasn't ordinary alcohol it also contained very powerful
and downright deadly psychoactive plants like henbane hemlock and belladonna
and this these plants can kill you but they're also
there they're not so much a psychedelic as they are
like delirious but those were infused into this alcohol and
evidence of this alcohol this psychedelic alcohol dates back to
3000 180 BC to 2500 BC and you can see
a picture here of the excavation of skara brae so
the Scot lenders knew how to really party and how
to get drunk with the right kind of alcohol not
the the weak piddly stuff that we serve today speaking
of which we also have very compelling evidence from Greeks
and Romans that their alcohol was also this kind of
hallucinogenic alcohol they talk about wine a lot in Greek
and Roman stories and tales and we know that they
drank a lot of wine but what's also very interesting
about that wine is that we tend to assume that
it was just like regular wine just grape juice right
well not quite so fast because the Greeks and Romans
right about tales where men would go drunk and blind
and mad even could kill themselves by drinking too much
wine and you would think well how could they get
so drunk just from regular wine especially since the Greeks
and Romans did not drink pure concentrated wine they always
water their wine down significantly fifty or eighty percent of
their wine was diluted with water so how could you
get mad drunk or even kill yourself on that kinda
looted wine well maybe it wasn't ordinary wine and we
know this because wine can only have up to 15%
alcohol content in fact it's impossible to produce a hard
spirit like vodka or Everclear or rum or gin or
any of these very high proof kind of alcohols it's
impossible to produce them without the process of distillation through
fermentation you can only get it up to about 15%
and after that it Peaks so you need to invent
distillation when was distillation invented it was invented in the
late Middle Ages in the early Renaissance era in southern
Italy in Europe so we know for a fact that
the Greeks and Romans did not have distillation so what
that leads us to believe and there's other evidence for
this is that they infused their alcohol just like the
Scot lenders did thousands of years before them with perhaps
mushrooms henbane hemlock and who knows what other kind of
herbs existed there are so many psychoactive herbs in the
world it's mind-blowing in fact what I want to do
I brought my book the encyclopedia of psychoactive plants now
to really appreciate this you gotta feel how heavy this
book is this thing is a true encyclopedia it probably
weighs around 5 pounds you could kill someone with this
book and it's just got pages and pages of pages
of every single plant that has any kind of psychoactive
properties whatsoever on the planet that we know of and
that's only out that we know of there's a lot
that we don't know of yet so just goes to
show you how much stuff that could have possibly had
been infusing into this alcoholic beverage also speaking of the
Greeks and Romans we have the illusion mysteries I've spoken
about this in the past this is a really remarkable
thing the illusion mysteries was a religious cult or sect
that existed which was very very popular in ancient Roman
Greece and it lasted all the way to the demise
of the Roman Empire in 580 but it lasted for
2,000 years before that so this goes back to 1500
BC and the losing mysteries was this religious right this
temple in aloose where all the Greeks and Romans would
gather they would go there and they would drink this
substance called the kikiyaon this substance was made out of
fermented wheat but of course not just wheat it also
had some kind of psychedelic effect and the some researchers
have done a lot of research on this trying to
figure out you know what could have been the active
ingredient in this cake he on because the Greeks and
Romans who took this drink talked about having ecstatic visions
of spirits and deities and all sorts of religious experiences
so it was clearly a very powerful drink not just
fermented wheat there was something more to it a secret
ingredient what was that secret ingredient well it's thought to
be forgot urgh ah is a fungus a deadly fungus
that grows on wheat you'll see a picture here of
what ergative wheat looks like usually when you have or
got on wheat it can be deadly so it's very
important that if you're growing a lot of wheat which
of course the Greeks and Romans did and the Egyptians
did is you have to be careful with not consuming
this organized wheat with this fungus on it because if
you do it could actually kill you there's examples of
where people got killed by it or they actually go
insane or crazy it's a very toxic fungus but what
is hypothesized by researchers is that the Greeks and Romans
could have learned a method for how to distill the
alkaloids from this forgot substance because our God is actually
how LSD is made out of so modern LSD is
synthesized from her God but modern LSD requires very complicated
lab equipment to create you can't just do it in
your home and the Greeks and Romans probably didn't have
that technology but they could have found some kind of
primitive way to extract the good stuff and then basically
put it into their fermented wheat drink their cake Eon
and then basically what they had is liquid LSD drink
and if you've tried LSD you know how power that
can be even in very tiny doses so it seems
like the Greeks and Romans caught on to that pretty
early and they were using this drink this cakey on
in the illusion mysteries for two thousand years and this
was one of the most important rituals that all the
big-name Greeks and Romans partook in emperors drank this drink
at these rituals important philosophers like Plato and Aristotle participated
in this other writers like umm Cicero and maybe Plutarch
so there's there's examples of these these people participating in
these illuzzi and mysteries so this was quite popular with
the aristocrats in Greece and Rome this wasn't just something
that was like a little little-known cult this was a
big thing it was a cult but it was a
big cult innit lasted for a very long time of
course in the Indian subcontinent we have evidence for a
lot of different psychedelic use as well and one of
the oldest texts that we have surviving in human history
is the Vedas the Hindu Vedas and there in particular
they have the Rig Veda which praises this psychedelic substance
or drink this concoction called soma what exactly soma is
we don't know it's speculated that it could have been
the Amanita muscaria mushroom or psychedelic magic mushrooms or maybe
a combination of various kinds of herbs and psychoactive plants
that we don't know that it's been lost to history
but this soma is mentioned as a sacred and revered
drink and the Vedas especially the Rig Veda all of
this there's a rich tradition there of spirituality and mysticism
which is directly related to that and this goes back
to 1500 to 1200 BC very old also we have
Freemasonry Freemasonry is a lot misunderstood in popular culture today
but it traces its roots back all the way to
ancient Egypt and one of the symbols Freemasonry has a
lot of symbolic language that they that they use one
of the symbols they use frequently is the acacia branch
you'll see a picture of it here and of course
you're familiar with the acacia so why did the Freemasons
Revere and symbolize the acacia branch so much well it
stands for liberation and for freedom and for spirituality and
for truth in certain cultures it's called the tree of
truth or the vine of truth that will be ayahuasca
is the vine of truth they call out until then
if we go to South America again into Mexico we
have the Aztecs and we have the Mayans and there
we have evidence from the conquistadors when the Spanish invaders
came to conquer the Aztecs and the Mayans they ran
across teonanácatl which literally translates in the Aztec language as
the god mushroom and the Spanish conquistadors they discovered these
aspects participating in these mushroom rituals and also the Mayans
participated in mushroom rituals and here I'll show you some
pictures of the Mayan mushroom stones which are these sacred
carvings which clearly depict mushrooms and also with the Mayans
very interestingly is that they did mushroom enemas and you
can see that I'll show you a couple of pictures
here of Mayan reliefs and carvings with mushroom enemas is
depicted so you can see these guys were not shy
about their their botany they would stick these plants in
every orifice that they could just to see what kind
of effects they could have quite amazing of course if
we go further down in South America we see the
Amazon region has a rich tradition of psychedelic use including
ayahuasca ayahuasca is the vine of the gods the vine
of truth it's this fine which is cut and then
mixed with mimosa leaves and bark and all this is
put into a students all brewed together and then this
drink this nasty drink comes out of it that you
drink and then this sends you wants a very very
deep psychedelic trips and that of course is very popularly
still done today it's done there by the natives and
actually there's a whole tourism industry of Americans and Westerners
going to Peru and instead Brazil and the Amazon and
doing this ayahuasca also doing that yopo that I told
you about but that's not all we also have psychedelic
lichens in Iceland for example I recently learned about a
psychedelic lichen these lichens they grow on the shores of
Iceland on the rocks there and certain lichens if you
pick them and then you you actually can boil these
stones with the lichen on top of the drink that
stone juice that will make you very very stoned and
some of the trip reports from the ISA Icelandic lichens
say that it's one of the most powerful trips you
could have more powerful than LSD and DMT and some
other stuff and this is one that isn't very well
known and requires a lot more research we also have
witchcraft of course witchcraft is much misunderstood these days but
the witches really were women who were interested in astral
projection and channeling and having spiritual visions and out-of-body experiences
and one of the ways in which they facilitated this
is with flying ointments and what is flying ointment a
flying ointment is fat which has animal fat which has
been reduced down and mixed and spiced with various psychedelic
and poisonous deliriant plants like henbane Mandrake datura belladonna and
possibly others maybe psychedelic mushrooms all that stuff is mixed
into this into this cream this joint Minh tanned this
cream is rubbed on your temples it's rubbed into your
armpits can be rubbed into your vaginal area and then
this actually gets soaked in absorbed through your skin and
then this will give you a hallucinations and visions and
various spiritual experiences it's helpful for channeling is helpful for
lucid dreaming it's helpful for out-of-body experiences that sort of
stuff of course in ancient India we have also evidence
of the use of datura the datura plant which is
used in witchcraft as flying ointments was also used by
ancient monks and Yogi's in India and actually there's sometimes
depictions of Shiva which is the main God of Hinduism
who represents nothingness absolute nothingness or ultimate enlightenment Shiva's sacred
plant is called the datura and the tour datura is
a very interesting deliriant it's actually quite dangerous it's potentially
lethal you definitely don't want to experiment with it at
home and it's not just gonna give you hallucinations this
thing will make you flat-out insane mad like stark raving
mad for weeks this stuff is really really powerful so
you don't to screw around with it it's also poisonous
you have to prepare in a special way so you
don't kill yourself but there's evidence of this being used
in ancient India sometimes you see depictions of Shiva with
a with a datura flower in his crown and the
datura flowers the sort of white trumpet like looking flower
of course in Siberia we have the original shaman the
word shaman comes from the Siberian shaman who were the
Siberian medicine man their word shaman is the local were
there for a medicine man and the Siberian shaman are
notorious for preferring to work with Amanita muscaria mushrooms these
are also poisonous mushrooms with the red caps and the
white polka dots which everyone has seen but you probably
haven't eaten or even known that you could have eaten
them but in that region of the world these mushrooms
can be eaten and they have psychoactive properties they also
have deliriant qualities to them they're also poisonous if you
don't eat them properly and so what the siberian shaman
would do is that he would actually eat the mushrooms
himself then he would urinate out into a cup or
a dish and then he would serve his urine to
all his followers all his initiates and they would drink
his urine why is that because his body would process
all the toxic deliriant stuff from the Amanita muscaria and
then he would pee out the the more pure psychedelic
chemical substances it doesn't actually deteriorate through your digestive system
he would pee it out and then his followers could
drink that urine with the more pure Amanita muscaria compounds
in it without the toxins he would be like the
filter for the toxins he would take one for the
team quite literally and then they would drink it and
then they would have their trippy experiences of course we
shouldn't forget Africa in West Central Africa to this day
exists the booty native tribe and these booty rely on
a very very powerful psychoactive called iboga it's actually a
a root bark that they gather from this tree small
tree like a bush and then you can you can
grind up this root bark and then you can ingest
it and i boga is a potentially lethal psychedelic but
it's also very very powerful it'll knock you off your
feet you won't be able to walk for days it
lasts for like 42 hours or even more and it
gives you very very powerful spiritual visions and this is
part of the bootys spiritual tradition to this day they
do these ceremonies not only do they do these ceremonies
this is their rite of passage for young men they
give it to the young men that gives them a
lot of this I boga so much that it almost
kills them and they go into this deep trance they
go through this whole ordeal they come out of this
experience completely changed and then then from that on from
that point on they're considered adults and part of the
adults in that tribe so they give this to their
teenagers very interesting of course we also have evidence of
hashish use hashish is like the flowers of the marijuana
plant which can be very potent and we have evidence
of that being used in ancient India we have of
it being used in in the Middle Ages in the
Arab countries in fact we have the assassins if you
don't know where that word assassins comes from it actually
comes from the arab assassins who would drink various kinds
of powerful alcoholic beverages and would smoke hashish and then
they would they would use that to go out there
into a into a fury and kill and murder people
that's where we get an assassins for them also we
have this plant called syrian rule which is prevalent in
the Middle East and Syrian room has very mild psychoactive
properties by itself but it turns out to be one
of the most powerful potentiate errs of other psychedelics so
for example if you take mushrooms two grams of mushrooms
and you combine it with a gram of Syrian rule
the Syrian rule will transform your 2 grams of mushrooms
into a 20 gram dose 10 to 20 times as
powerful just by sprinkling some Syrian ruin there it's actually
quite dangerous to do you don't want to screw around
with Syria in ruin other psychedelics just because it can
potentiate them so much so you want to be very
careful but actually there are these combinations that you can
make with syrian ruined mushrooms and other stuff which which
can take your trips to a whole new level and
the the ancient tribes and peoples who live there knew
about Syria and Russia Andrew also has the property of
this deep red color they would use Syrian route to
also dye their carpets and their rugs this bright deep
red we also have the plant salvia divinorum which is
native to the Mexico region and the Mexicans have been
have been using it and smoking it for spiritual purposes
probably for a while we don't know for how long
also Morning Glory seeds are also found in that same
exact area and they all have also been used by
by natives of that region for foreign tripping and a
very interesting plant that I think has a lot of
potential is phalaris grass phalaris grass is this grass that
you see here on the screen I'm gonna show you
a picture of it it's a very ordinary looking type
of grass but what's so special about it is it
has very high concentrations of five amiyo DMT and also
some amount of regular DMT as well this phalaris grass
grows in Europe Asia North Africa and America he's found
homeless on every continent it's hard for me to imagine
that native cultures to these areas who were growing up
around this grass never fully appreciated its its psychoactive properties
I would bet that they found ways to smoke it
to grind it to extract it to do whatever with
it to to get high although we don't have any
you know direct evidence from the archaeological record that I
can show you on that so that's the historical context
hopefully you can start to see that psychedelics have been
central to spirituality to religion and to civilization and to
human culture for the last like literally fifty thousand years
we have cave paintings that go back fifty thousand years
ago and there's speculation that these cave paintings might have
actually been painted by people on psychedelics because there's a
lot of trippy stuff depicted on these cave paintings so
this could have been the origins of civilization that could
have been the origin of human art it almost certainly
was the seeds or the catalyst for human spirituality and
mysticism and that ultimately led to religion of course I'm
not saying that's like a telex were the only cause
I'm not saying that spirituality can only be done through
psychedelics that's not true at all I do not believe
in terence mckenna's stoned ape theory he had this theory
that oh well basically humans became conscious and fully human
because of their use of psychedelics I don't know if
I buy that completely but I do think that psychedelics
played a key role in catalyzing spirituality and mainstream religion
because the reason I don't believe in the stoned ape
theory is because you don't need psychedelics to have a
very deep spiritual experience if you just sit down and
practice certain breathing techniques certain relaxation techniques certain focusing and
visualization techniques with your mind like it's done in yoga
and many other mystical traditions you can have all these
experiences you can channel you can go out-of-body you can
do astral projection all this sorts of interesting stuff without
an ounce of psychedelics but I think the psychedelics make
it a lot quicker a lot more effective and a
lot easier to distribute through a culture it's a lot
easier to just give someone some mushroom and then have
them experience exactly what you're talking about rather than having
to invent a language and to work through trying to
explain something that's really not explainable in words so I
think that that's really where they played the crucial part
of course we also need to talk about the medical
benefits of psychedelics which are a key puzzle piece in
correcting this stigma the first thing you need to know
about the medical aspects of psychedelics is that they have
very very low toxicity levels and are generally very safe
they are not addictive and in fact they are anti
addictive which means that they cure addictions which means that
they are self-correcting and that if you get if you
do too many psychedelics basically they themselves will tell you
to stop to do psychedelics so the lethal potential of
psychedelics many of them like LSD mushrooms and so on
is so low that you couldn't even possibly consume a
lethal dose almost impossible you need to eat over a
hundred pounds of mushrooms to kill yourself you would need
to eat over a thousand tabs or doses of LSD
to kill yourself whereas if you take a look at
apps aspirin or caffeine or even water you can kill
yourself with just drinking too much water if you drink
a couple of gallons of water straight down you can
kill yourself people have died from that if you consume
too many aspirins a couple of bottles too much you'll
kill yourself that's not the case with most psychedelics now
does this mean that psychedelics are perfectly safe and that
dosage is already relevant no not at all you can
certainly freak yourself out on psychedelics they can certainly destabilize
you mentally and psychologically if you take a too much
of a dose that you're not prepared to handle and
that can be a pretty traumatic experience so dosages are
still important there's still potential for abuse with psychedelics I'm
not saying there's not but you have to take into
account that there's potential for abuse with almost everything you
can abuse a car you can have use a gun
you can abuse potato chips you can abuse ice cream
you can kill yourself with food so yes realistically there's
a risk with everything what we need to do is
we need to find a balance and what I'm saying
is that our culture is totally out of whack we
have swung our pendulum so much to one direction that
we have disconnected ourselves from our own origins from nature
from herbalism and from spirituality and instead what we do
is we come up with all these antidepressants and ritalin
for our kids because they're stuck on ADHD mode all
the time and they're you know they're running around frantically
they can't focus and as it turns out these antidepressants
and this Ritalin and stuff this is more addictive than
psychedelics and it's actually proven to have less effect than
psychedelics so let's now talk about the medically proven met
amazing results the psychedelics have been shown to have perhaps
the most amazing evidence we have coming in is when
it comes to addiction it has been clinically they've demonstrated
now in numerous studies and in numerous clinical practices that
I boga mushrooms LSD DMT ayahuasca that these have powerful
anti addictive properties and that these actually are the most
effective tool for curing people of heroin addiction cocaine addiction
smoking addiction and alcohol addiction did you know that the
founder of AAA broke his addiction to alcohol not through
the 12 steps primarily but through LSD he did it
because he took LSD and actually LSD was one of
the key ingredients in his 12-step program but of course
the government outlawed LSD and so he had to remove
it from his program and some now eh-eh-eh has been
defamed the most important element of eaa the LSD has
been removed and that is truly the most important element
because LSD and DMT and and mushrooms these have been
shown to work exceptionally well for people who have alcohol
addiction more effective than almost anything else in particular ibogaine
is the most promising case here it's a very very
powerful psychedelic and it has very special properties that are
very helpful with addiction and it's particularly effective for heroin
addicts as also is five Meo DMT because it's also
very very powerful now why do psychedelics have this anti
addictive properties is it just because you take a magic
pill and some chemical mumbo-jumbo happens in your body and
then all of a sudden you're free not quite i
boga has a little bit of that going on but
there's an even important element the most important element of
the psychedelic is that it raises your consciousness it makes
you more aware it gives you the ability to self
reflect in an unbiased way about your own life and
to see where you're [ __ ] up and what
your neuroses are and sure enough people who are addicted
to crack and heroin and meth and all this kind
of stuff and alcohol the reason they're addicted is not
just because they're addicted they're addicted because they have [
__ ] up lives they were abused they were neglected
they bullied in school they were molested you know they
faced all violence gangs all this kind of stuff which
then made them so psychologically neurotic and screwed up that
they needed some crutch and they found their crutch to
be heroin or some other kind of drug but then
of course that doesn't solve the problem that just makes
the problem worse so what the ibogaine or the five
mio DMT can do is it can get you to
to look back at your life with consciousness and then
to work through that stuff in a very well effortless
way you could say in one sense it's effortless another
says it's not effortless is you can reflect on that
stuff and then you can gain sort of conscious traction
over it to the point where you can just let
it go and there has been an amazing success rate
with ibogaine and with five Emil DMT for curing heroin
addicts these are hardcore addicts who've been living on the
streets for 10 to 20 years and they've tried all
sorts of cures that have not worked for them but
when they try I BOGO or five Meo they have
a 50% success rate of quitting and never coming back
to heroin which is amazing if you know anything about
this field so for addictions these substances are amazing and
the reason they're amazing is because they raise your consciousness
and as I've talked about in my addiction episodes and
I've talked about elsewhere you know what is human growth
what is personal development what is it all about it's
about becoming more conscious the more conscious you become the
less neurotic you are unless you overthink and this helps
with addictions this helps with depression with anxiety with PTSD
with autism with with relationship problems with anger problems with
all of this and right now we have study after
study coming out which is showing exactly this we have
clinical evidence that's showing that psychedelics are very effective against
depression more so than anti-depression medication and they are not
as unhealthy as antidepressant medication I need to press has
all sorts of side effects it's also very addictive you
can't just stop it you have to gradually wean yourself
off otherwise you have suicide risks all this kind of
nasty stuff you don't have any of that with psychedelics
and they're more effective against depression why is that because
it raises your consciousness opens your perspective gets you unstuck
from your shadow and from your ego it's also proven
to be effective with social anxiety it's proven to be
very effective against PTSD when other treatments don't work right
now mushrooms and MDMA and LSD are being tested on
guys from coming back from the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan who have PTSD and it's proving very effective for
them they're to the point where we're looking at having
actually a legalization of these substances for curing specifically PTSD
in clinical settings these substances are proven to work to
help with autism with end-of-life for example cancer patients who
are going through terrible chemotherapy and pain and fear about
the prospect of dying and then the mushrooms or the
LSD or the MDMA can help with that MDMA is
very effective for solving marriage problems and relationship counseling that
would otherwise end in divorce helpful against anger problems and
basically any neurosis you can imagine again why is that
because we're raising consciousness when you raise consciousness all that
[ __ ] gets autocorrected that's how it works there
are a lot of amazing researchers today working in this
field these are serious these aren't just hippies and New
Agers these are serious academics serious scientists serious phd's one
example that I'll give you is Rick Doblin who runs
the Maps program it's a nonprofit organization which has been
running for over 20 years that works closely with the
US government to get approval from the FDA for clinical
treatments legal clinical treatments using LSD MDMA mushrooms and ibogaine
for clinical cases of Russian anxiety addiction PTSD and so
on and right now they are in the process of
doing trials proving to the FDA that these techniques work
scientifically with double-blind controlled studies repeating them very carefully and
it looks like in the next 10 to 20 years
we're gonna have a lot of breakthroughs and some of
these clinical techniques will be approved and legalized in the
US but of course there are other countries besides the
US for example ibogaine clinics are proving very successful in
Canada Mexico and Costa Rica where they are legal in
the US I began as a Schedule one substance I
believe so it's not legal here there are no clinics
here but these clinics in Canada and Mexico and Costa
Rica are having amazing results with hardcore addicts and in
fact if you have a friend who is a hardcore
addict or even just addicted to alcohol and you see
that he is killing himself slowly with his smoking or
his alcohol tell him about ibogaine clinics tell him that
it's worth his time pay a couple thousand dollars fly
to Canada fly to Mexico fly to Costa Rica do
a week-long retreat there with this ibogaine it will change
your life forever and you'll kick these addictions in a
way that you never imagined possible that's real you can
do that right now you can research that online and
find these clinics I'll also mention dr. yo dr. Octavio
Rettig r ett IG who is a world-famous medicine man
and shaman from Mexico and Mexico actually five mio DMT
is legal for clinical use and so what he is
pioneered is he is pioneered the gathering of toad venom
from the bufo alvarius toad which contains five Meo DMT
and bufotenin in its in its glands and in the
venom that it has and they extract it and then
you can smoke it and you can have very powerful
trips with five mio DMT and bufotenin in there and
this guy himself Octavio Rettig he used to be a
heroin addict for many years and the only thing that
worked for him is smoking this toad venom so he
smoked this totem he turned his life around he became
a real doctor he has an MD and now he
is an ambassador for the UN and he has traveled
to over 90 countries around the world providing this treatment
of the toad venom he collects it and then he
helps people to smoke it in a sort of ritual
setting one-on-one sessions in small group sessions and he's had
amazing success literally provided it to thousands of addict hardcore
addicts and treated them in Mexico and everywhere around the
world I've actually had a guy on my forum who
heard me talking about Octavia Rettig and then he actually
bumped into him in Europe and drove down there did
the experience said it was amazing and so that's that's
that's one example that I have I'm sure others have
done it but that's the one that I've gotten kind
of a testimonial back from pretty cool so he's getting
amazing results with with his work there's also the work
of stanislav grof who was a pioneer with LSD research
he was an MD and a psychiatrist and a psychologist
who worked in the in the 50s and 60s and
he's still alive today and he's done a lot of
work showing just how effective LSD and these kind of
psychedelics can be for psychotherapeutic purposes and also another guy
along that line is a Ralph Metzner who is a
Harvard PhD and psychologist and a psychiatrist and he has
also worked and on a clinical practice where he provided
five in the O DMT and and LSD and other
substances and did it in a psycho therapeutic context and
has gotten amazing results there and this is just the
tip of the iceberg I could stand here and talk
for hours and hours about all these amazing guys doing
amazing research both clinically and scientifically right now you gotta
understand this is a totally cutting edge field this field
has only existed for about 60 to 70 years since
the 1950s and psychedelics have been outlawed for research purposes
in the u.s. for most of that time since the
late 60s and early 70s so if the research was
not being blocked the last 40 years we would have
a lot more research but nevertheless there are still courageous
and intrepid pioneer researchers out there doing this research both
in the US and in their countries and so stuff
is changing and we're discovering more and more and more
about the amazing powerful effects of these of these substances
and I'm sure that over the next 10 to 20
years you're gonna see a lot more research coming out
that's gonna just add on top of this pile of
everything that I'm saying here so that's the medical piece
of the puzzle pretty freakin big pretty important think about
all the people we have addicted to opioids right now
we're talking about the IP opioid epidemic in the u.s.
well a lot of that could be alleviated if we
had a proper system of distribution of psychedelics and a
proper context and culture about how to use them and
that's not to mention all the other addictions that we
don't even call addictions in our society people are addicted
to porn people are addicted to Internet to their cell
phones to sex to all this sort of stuff and
these psychedelics will help with all of that not just
with heroin addiction think about how much of a boost
in consciousness a substance like iboga or five Meo would
have to give a person to get them to quit
heroin like that cold turkey that's [ __ ] amazing
that's a testament to how big of a shift in
consciousness you can have so if it can do that
for a heroin addict imagine what it could do for
you as a not heroin addict cuz you're still struggling
with all the same basic life problems of a heroin
addict I mean for heroin addict his problems are just
a little bit worse but you still have the same
problems you don't like how you look you have social
anxiety you're too introverted you have OC OCD you have
ADHD you have various fears and quirks and all this
sort of stuff and you procrastinate it to all of
it and you don't know how to fix yourself that's
what personal development is here for but then again you
do this personal development and it's so tough and it's
a grind and it's difficult and you don't really know
how to have an Enlightenment experience you keep trying you
keep trying but you're not having one well that's the
perfect place where a a substance like thymio or mushrooms
can come in and just give you a little nudge
in the right direction they are a catalyst it's important
to understand that I'm not saying they're a replacement for
spiritual practices they're not a replacement for personal development they're
not a replacement for reading and listening to audiobooks and
for eating healthy and all that kind of stuff they
are catalysts they are one tool in your toolbox so
of course I talked about the ancient uses of psychedelics
but you should realize that we have all these modern
uses of psychedelics in Peru and in Brazil today you
can do ayahuasca and yopo and people are doing it
both natives and Westerners and they're having amazing results and
you know they're not becoming criminals their mind is not
going insane these substances are not you know destroying families
there we have various churches actually in the u.s. we
have the Santo dime a church and the UDV Church
which are the only two churches that I'm aware of
which have a legal right to provide DMT in the
form of ayahuasca to their followers because they actually had
big court cases the UDV Church case went all the
way up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
ruled that they are allowed to consume ayahuasca but only
them and Santo diamond in certain states so you can
actually join these churches and drink ayahuasca and they do
that legally and they're having success with that and they
actually give it to their kids to drink give it
to their teenagers to drink not just adults of course
Native Americans to this day are doing peyote ceremonies and
they involve their teenagers in that in Mexico natives do
mushroom ceremonies today in Mexico Octavio Rettig is doing these
five amiyo ceremonies today legally and it's working great in
mexico canada costa rica we have these ibogaine ibogaine clinics
and they're working great and they are legal there in
africa the beauty tribe uses i boga to this day
and it works great for them in nepal to this
day they use datura various Yogi's and saints they have
a secret cult therefore using tuturro in india also they
use hashish and marijuana in various ways as well the
Yogi's do not just guys who are hippies these are
serious hardcore mystics and they are they are transforming themselves
and transforming the lives of everybody around them by increasing
their consciousness through these substances which is not to say
they don't abuse them I'm sure some of them abused
them as well you can read the works of Carlos
Castaneda which talks about modern-day uses of of these psychedelics
so it's just not true that these substances are not
possible to use responsibly they're being used responsibly all over
the world with great success with enormous success but most
people just don't know about it and this is stuff
you don't hear about in mainstream culture so this concludes
episode part 1 we're gonna have a part two and
maybe even a part three because there's so much information
here and even this episode turned out to be very
long but this sort of like an information dump I'm
dumping all this stuff on you so you can kind
of just jump into the deep end and just start
to see like oh my god there's so much stuff
that I wasn't taught all this factual information you can
go and follow up and I encourage you to go
follow up on this read the books get an encyclopedia
start reading this stuff there's so much information there browse
around online and start to notice how this stigma that
you have that around psychedelics just starts to dissolve in
in light of all the hard scientific evidence and all
the other anthropological evidence that we have and all the
psychological evidence and then of course to really sense the
deal you gotta go try it yourself and then you
will prove to yourself beyond a shadow doubt that this
stigma is completely ass-backwards alright that's it for this one
please remember to click that like button go check out
actualized org check out my blog check out the forum
check out the life purpose course check out the book
list I have books there about psychedelics and I'll be
adding more in the future and just stick around for
the next episode so that we can conclude this entire
train of thought there's still a lot of stuff very
juicy stuff that I want to say on this topic
but that will be coming next week you
