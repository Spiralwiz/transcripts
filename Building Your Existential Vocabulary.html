hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about building the basic vocabulary for
understanding life [Music] you now at first glance this may
sound like an odd topic but what I want to
share with you is actually a very simple but powerful
technique that I have discovered really I've stumbled upon in
my own life and I've been implementing it and I
found that it's quite effective for deepening your understanding of
life and the way that it works is by getting
you to think and contemplate about the basic building blocks
the most fundamental concepts or words that make up life
and what this technique involves is you just looking up
basic words in the dictionary it's really that simple here's
how the technique works you're gonna run across some ordinary
but fundamental word which points to a basic or fundamental
concept about life something like reality or the word existence
or the word awareness or the word self or reason
or experience etc and there's a long list of these
that I will help point you towards as we go
here but anyways you're gonna find one of these words
and then what you're gonna notice to yourself is that
hey have I ever actually looked up the definition of
this word in the dictionary I mean yeah I think
I know what reality is I think I know what
awareness is it seems obvious it seems self-evident why would
I even need to look something like that up but
this is where it's a little counterintuitive you force yourself
to look it up anyways because you realize hey you
know what actually I've never bothered to look it up
before and so then what you do is you do
a google search for the definition of this word and
you use multiple dictionaries which are available easily online not
just one but multiple dictionaries because they do offer different
perspectives and definitions which are important for deepening your understanding
of these concepts and then what you do is you
take those definitions you copy and paste them into your
digital notebook and you keep a log of all this
terminology and over time you build up a long catalogue
of hundreds of these words with all the definitions from
multiple dictionaries and then what you do is you just
sit there and you contemplate and you think about it
and you think about how does one word connect with
another word and how are these definitions and concepts really
working under the surface and that's the whole technique don't
underestimate the power of this technique it might sound kind
of silly and odd but again I'm telling you your
language is much more important people realize your vocabulary is
very important to how you think your vocabulary influences what
you're able to think and then what you're able to
think influences your reality people underestimate that the way that
I stumbled upon this technique for myself is that I
just noticed one day that hey you know most people
when they look up words in the dictionary they look
up complicated exotic flowery sounding words SAT words million-dollar words
like supercilious words that you use to impress people words
that make you sound very academic and intelligent and while
they're busy doing that what they're not doing is they're
not looking up the most basic words because they assume
that there's no worthwhile reason to look those up because
they think they already know what those things are but
actually they don't and that's the whole trick to it
that's how the mind tricks itself is it assumes that
it knows the basics when actually it doesn't these basic
words correspond to the most fundamental and basic concepts or
building blocks of life words like time matter energy these
aren't just words these are very basic and essential concepts
and these basic concepts it's not just a matter of
do you know what you're talking about when you're talking
about time or space or existence or awareness but actually
these fundamental building blocks they shape your metaphysics and the
funny thing about metaphysics is that most people will say
oh well leo i don't care about metaphysics I don't
do metaphysics I'm not interested in metaphysics and see the
trick though with metaphysics is that when you don't do
metaphysics you still have a metaphysics and it's that same
way with philosophy you think you don't do philosophy and
therefore that you have avoided philosophy no actually what you
have committed yourself to when you don't do philosophy when
you don't do metaphysics is the default metaphysics of your
society and your culture and you said no Lea I
don't care about metaphysics and philosophy that stuff doesn't it's
not important to me I just go about my life
I earn my money I earn my living I do
the stuff I you gotta do I care about success
and and all this kind of you know real down-to-earth
stuff not your airy fairy metaphysics stuff but see what
you don't understand is that as you're doing all that
actually you've absorbed the metaphysics of your culture and now
that runs and shapes your entire life and what you
call reality what you really believe is solid reality which
cannot be questioned and which there is no more reason
to do metaphysics towards because it's all settled actually that's
not settled at all it only feels settled to you
because well you haven't really bothered to consciously explore metaphysics
or philosophy that trips a lot of people up it's
really interesting that if you take a look at what
school and colleges teach you when it comes to vocabulary
they never really ask you to look up the basic
definitions of things like reality and this should actually strike
you as very odd and backwards if you think about
it because really if you think about it what should
we be teaching first graders and even 10th graders or
twelfth graders we should be forcing them to go into
the books and to look at what is reality what
is time what is space what is energy but none
of these things are actually encouraged to be explored by
our education system instead what our schools emphasize is the
emphasize learning complicated fancy SAT words very exotic and flowery
vocabulary which if if you had the same high school
experience and college experience that I did then you spent
a lot of your time memorizing these words and some
value comes from that your vocabulary and your ability to
think complex thoughts generally increases from that but still you're
lacking the basics and really if you want to have
the most powerful vocabulary possible it's not in the flowery
words and it took me a long time to realize
that I was actually very seduced into learning all these
big fancy words and then after I got out of
college because I was using all these fancy words in
my philosophy papers and in all my essays and stuff
that I wrote in college and I would get great
grades and my teachers would Pat me on the back
for for being able to put all these complicated words
in there and make it sound very academic but then
when I got out into the business world I realized
hey all this flowery stuff is just complete nonsense it's
[ __ ] and this whole game that academics play
of of writing complicated ideas and complicated long sentences that
are half a page long that just run on and
on and use semicolon after semicolon after semicolon and use
all these complicated terms to describe things that actually what
this is masking is their inherent fundamental ignorance about the
core building blocks of reality and it makes it seem
like you're you're really doing something important when you're putting
all these words together when really you're just jerking off
into a paper cup that's what that is that's the
one of the problems with academia now I've been meaning
to talk to you for a while now about just
how powerful languages when it comes to self-actualization and when
it comes to existential inquiry and thinking about reality this
is is greatly underappreciated by most people just how central
language is to how you think and how much it's
influenced by culture and that language is really a game
and that language has limits and yet most people don't
know this they don't realize the limits of language even
many philosophers of language and linguists themselves fall into the
trap of language because see language is connected with thoughts
connected with the mind and the mind is the most
trickiest thing that we know of in existence and it
has a million ways to trick you into deceive you
and it doesn't matter how intelligent you are or how
big your IQ is or how big your your word
repository is your vocabulary you will get tricked by language
and you will get tricked by the mind that thing
is almost guaranteed to happen unless you're very careful about
studying the the limits of language so in the future
I'll have more episodes about language but let's start with
this very basic thing right here and let's make the
following simple point I want you to notice that perhaps
yourself and many people around you suffer from the problem
of having sloppy vocabulary and what I mean by that
is that we talk about things without knowing what we
are really saying people talk about God people talk about
physics people talk about existence people talk about awareness people
talk about happiness and emotions and all this sort of
stuff but yet they never bothered to think about what
these concepts are the mind is murky about many of
these essential concepts I want you to notice that in
yourself and in other people as an example of this
how we can be sure this is true what I'm
saying is that if we take the average person off
the street and we ask them something very basic like
what is existence what you're gonna get as your typical
answer is a lot of hemming and hawing and the
person not being able to articulate what existence really is
or what they're gonna do is they're gonna talk in
circles they will use existence to define existence itself which
really doesn't tell you anything about existence although it makes
you feel like you know something about existence when you
really don't and the same thing goes for time or
space or matter or energy it's really odd it always
struck me as very odd when I was doing physics
and physics class in high school that science actually is
very deliberate in not defining and not carefully investigating the
most elemental building blocks that compose science so for example
if you ask your physics teacher what is time what
is space what does matter what is energy they will
give you circular definitions which really say nothing at all
which sort of hides the fact that we could really
don't know and then this is a real deep problem
and it's worth thinking about because the way that science
works is it sort of uses variables to shuffle numbers
around formulas around but yet the essences of the things
that the variables represent the scientists don't actually spend a
lot of time thinking about because actually they say oh
well Leo that's metaphysics we don't know anything about that
and that's like doing philosophy doing metaphysics that takes us
down the wrong road and so we are just pragmatic
scientists all we care about is we just care about
creating this technology and making sure that it works and
in a certain sense there's value in that because you
actually can get pretty far oddly enough you can get
pretty far manipulating time counting time measuring time doing calculations
and running GPS satellites with time with out actually knowing
what the [ __ ] time is it's quite remarkable
that actually you don't need to know the substance of
anything in order to manipulate it in the same way
that you don't need to know how your car works
in order to drive your car and in this sort
of same fashion a lot of scientists don't actually know
anything real about reality what they know is they know
a lot of ways to conceptualize it as a variable
and then to manipulate and play with those variables and
that has produced a lot of technological breakthroughs and in
a sense that's good and you might say well Leo
what's wrong with that sounds like science is working perfectly
but actually there's a there's a very deep problem at
the core and then that problem is all the loose
ends that actually exists within science which are so carefully
hidden by most active scientists and academics that it gives
you the illusion that science is more complete than it
actually is when in fact science doesn't have a good
handle on things like time matter energy space or existence
itself or consciousness and awareness or qualia and phenomena or
human experience and then you have all these sorts of
things like the mind-body problem and all these tricky problems
in philosophy which scientists just leave to the philosophers and
they don't really concern themselves much about but eventually it
comes back to bite the scientists in the ass so
anyways coming back to our topic of vocabulary it's important
for you to learn how to articulate some of these
basic concepts because articulation is not just about being able
to communicate it to somebody else although that's a huge
benefit and if you ever want to teach any of
these self-actualization principles to people if you ever want to
teach non-duality you want to be able to communicate with
people you want to be able to persuade your friends
about what we're talking about here then learning how to
be articulate about this stuff is is very important but
also articulation is first and foremost for you for clearing
up your murky mind that's what it's really about when
you force yourself to to really explain what the hell
something like existence or time is and then you struggle
with that and you start to realize you have to
see like wait a minute I'm just playing word games
I'm saying time as this but I'm just using other
synonyms to define it and really I'm not saying anything
so what is time or what is existence I'm just
spinning my wheels here that's very important for you to
see because you start to see that language could maybe
be a game and it's a way to actually hide
our ignorance and pretend as though we know more than
we really do I want you to notice that there's
a big difference between knowing something implicitly and explicitly implicitly
is the way that most people know most things which
means that they haven't bothered to really articulate it to
explicate it to make it clear because the way that
most people use language especially if you're a native English
speaker for example all these words like time energy existence
you take them completely for granted these are words you
just picked up when you are very very young and
you never bother to think about these words at all
you took them as just hey they're just Givens this
is just how life is I think I'm actually more
sensitive to this because I'm not a native English speaker
I came here from Russia when I was seven years
old and I had to really struggle for a good
ten years to learn the English language and for a
while there for those ten years all the way up
to high school I was behind the curve my Anglet
my my English language skills my vocabulary was worse than
the average American and I had to work really hard
there was a long time there for maybe a span
of 10 years where I was just constantly constantly learning
vocabulary drilling myself on vocabulary looking up definitions of a
lot of stuff until now I think my my my
English is better than most Americans English and through that
process I got a more of an appreciation of the
importance of really being explicit about knowing that the meaning
of a word it's not enough just to know the
meaning of a word intuitively just by the seat of
your pants the way that most people know you got
to bother to really look it up and that's just
a matter of being lazy most people are just so
lazy they run across a word that they don't know
and they just say oh well I don't know it
so it's not very important and then just go on
but see what I force myself to do is I
actually made a rule with myself back in high school
early high school and then I I kept up with
it for for all of high school in all of
college basically is that every single new word that I
didn't know that I ran across I would force myself
to immediately not sometime later but immediately look it up
in the dictionary and that forced me to learn all
these words until I got to the point where it's
very rare that I'm reading a book and there's a
word in there that I don't know and chances are
if I am reading a book and there are a
lot of words in there that I don't know that's
a badly written book I can tell very easily but
that's a academic book and I just I usually sigh
when I run into those kinds of books because these
people are not writing very clearly and if you notice
the way that I like to talk and communicate in
my videos is I actually keep my vocabulary very very
simple I don't use a lot of fancy flowery vocabulary
even though I easily could I was very good at
my verbal SATs I could through all sorts of fancy
words at you million-dollar polysyllabic words that will leave you
scratching your head and make me sound very academic but
also what it'll do is it actually it will reduce
the clarity I can speak like a philosopher to I
can write like a philosopher you know how I used
to write in philosophy class I would write those long
ass your typical academic philosopher type sentences which were very
formal and we're very very long very complicate you have
to sit down and decode this stuff and what I
actually had to do is and I'm still doing this
because I'm actually planning to write a book and so
what I'm doing is I'm actually training myself to write
in the most simple that I can like very very
clear and straightforward which is the exact opposite of the
trend in modern academic philosophy the trend there has been
just so much complexity that you have to sit and
study some of these philosophers books for years you have
to spend years to study one book just to understand
what his basic ideas were when in fact once you
understand the ideas they can be easily summarized within a
couple of sentences and usually by the time you get
to to that point you realize those ideas are worthless
and rather rather rather unsophisticated and unadvised and there are
many flaws in those ideas but it took you a
couple of years of study maybe the entire PhD program
to learn what that philosopher was talking about it's really
a ridiculous state of affairs so I try to keep
my communications very simple and very clear and what you
notice is that the most conscious the most enlightened teachers
the most masterful human beings who have the deepest access
to reality how do they communicate extremely clearly extremely simply
that should be a clue that should be a lesson
to you if you're in college and you're participating in
this academic game of mental masturbation outward playing other people
when you really know a thing you don't need a
lot of complex words you can explain it very very
simply you can explain to a child that's the ideal
not what they teach you in universities these days so
anyways let's come back here to the topic and so
what I was saying is that there is a difference
between knowing something implicitly versus explicitly and there's a difference
between having a solid grasp of a concept versus a
Loog loose and vague grasp of it big difference because
when you have and you bother to go through the
process of developing a solid grasp you see that language
and the mind are a lot more slippery than you
ever assumed and that a lot of stuff that normally
people take for granted you can't take for granted anymore
and then you become more and more interested in the
fundamental building blocks of reality and you see that actually
this illusion that we have in mainstream society that we've
got reality understood that actually this is just an illusion
the foundation is rotten it's hollow inside so anyways enough
about that let me now get to the meat of
one of what I want to point you out here
which is the list of all the words to get
you start it so you might be wondering okay leo
so how do I apply this technique well it's really
easy to apply you just google the definitions but the
key to this technique is that you have to know
which words to search the definitions for and you have
to actually notice it when they come up in your
everyday life and then you have to do the search
quickly don't leave off the search for the next day
or later tonight do it right now immediately while you're
thinking about the concept so here's some a list of
words to get you started reality existence being hallucination magic
time energy matter and mass reason perspective truth God emotion
concept psyche science religion delusion illusion what's the difference we
knows - when should you use the word delusion versus
illusion consciousness absolute relative wisdom spirit I'll make a comment
about this when Rives still have more of the list
to give you but spirit is very interesting and also
the the word God is very interesting because a lot
of people especially a rationalist and an atheistic Allah minded
people they will criticize God and spirit and spirituality and
religion as as this sort of nonsense fluffy wishful thinking
sort of stuff and yet when you're talking with these
people you very quickly realize that they never even bother
to look up the definition of these words they don't
even know what these words mean they are they're spending
a lot of time and energy arguing and denying concepts
and words that they've never even bothered to look up
or to think about when you think about that when
you realize that it's actually it's it's shockingly ignorant shockingly
ignorant and yet these people often claim to be the
champions of science what's perhaps most scandalous of all there's
a fancy word for you right there is that people
who claim to be the champions of science haven't even
bothered to look up the definition of the word science
and to think about what science actually is how it
works what it means and what the limits of science
are limits of science Leigha what limits of science that's
the whole problem is you've never really studied that you
never thought about that now of course just looking at
the definition of science is not gonna get you all
the way to what I'm talking about just looking up
a definition in your basic dictionary it's a good start
for contemplation but you got to go a lot more
deeper than that your average dictionary is not gonna tell
you the limits of science that's something you have to
spend that you know really literally years studying I've I've
devoted a decade of my life or more to studying
the limits of science because I actually care about what
science is the more you care about science the more
you will study the limits of science so let's keep
going with the list we mentioned the spirit how about
the word ecology I love that word ecology insight on
my blog the first thing I have on my blog
is actually a definition that I compiled from multiple dictionaries
for what the word inside means and if you go
and you just look at that and you read it
and think about it just for a few minutes you
realize how profound of a definition that is and I
also go out of my way to list all the
synonyms for the word insight and it can be also
very helpful in trying to increase your vocabulary not just
to define a word but to also compile lists of
all the synonyms so you start to see the interconnections
of all the words and that's what language is this
giant infinite web of interconnected words and that's something I'll
talk about in the future when I talk about econstruction
when I talk about Jacques Derrida when I talk about
post-modernism and I talk about some of the important lessons
from the philosophy of language that we have discovered in
the last hundred years it's really a a remarkable field
that is so little talked about a little understood by
common people and yet it's so central to your understanding
of reality so anyway insight creativity paranormal I love that
word that's a really good one to look up philosophy
psychology mind integrity profound basic evil virtue excellence confusion logic
theory knowledge awareness experience belief universe epiphany enlightenment go look
up the definition for enlightenment that in and of itself
can be enlightening depression love self meditation contemplation thought perception
essence skepticism substance what is substance intelligence that's a really
good one what is intelligence evolution suffering karma mysticism a
cult and on and on and on and on it
goes this list can be thousands of terms long I
just wanted to give you the tip of the iceberg
here some juicy stuff that you can start off with
and if you just go and you spend a couple
of hours searching for the definitions of all these terms
and compiling your own log already you will get a
lot of aha mini aha moments and insights and your
your appreciation of language and of these essential concepts will
deepen and the more obvious a word is the less
you think you need to look it up the better
it is for you to look it up so look
up even the most obvious words like am is I
and B as in to B or B in those
are really good and for extra credit if you want
to make this an even more powerful technique I recommend
that you also look up the etymology of the word
and what Arab ology means is it's the historical context
of where did the word come from because language is
interesting language evolves and words take on new meanings and
words take on subtle different gradations of different they will
take they have different connotations they can have positive and
negative connotations and sometimes those change words can have multiple
meanings and there could be subtle differences between those meanings
and if you really want to become really good with
your mind really good at understanding things it's really important
that you take these subtleties of language seriously and that
you study them so etymology kiemce can be important it
tells you what the origin of the word is and
also for extra credit look up the Greek and Latin
stem words the prefixes and suffixes that make up a
lot of English words now if you're not using English
here to do this you could do this in any
language but I'm mostly talking about in English but for
English so many of our words can actually be kind
of broken down into the Greek and Latin components and
those can can teach you a lot about what this
concept represents and why it's called the way that it's
called and it can give you some some deeper a
little hidden nuggets and insights into the word and I
think it's very important that you actually do keep a
journal of this stuff and that you don't just look
it up and forget it but you actually bother to
copy and paste or to write some of this stuff
down in your journal all of that is going to
make this technique more powerful and that will be the
extra-credit stuff and also look up the synonyms and look
up the antonyms so synonyms are the other alternative ways
to say the same thing but again every synonym has
its own flavorings and its own connotations and radiations and
subtleties and the antonyms which are the opposites of those
words and what I recommend for you is to try
this out and then make this a lifelong habit make
a commitment right now that for the rest of your
life whenever you run across a basic fundamental word which
represents a building block of reality and of life you
will bother to look it up look up words like
sex and love and relationship and happiness and sadness and
money and all this sort of stuff that usually you
would not consider these to be vocabulary words make that
commitment and just imagine how many concepts you will explore
over the rest of your life imagine how much deeper
your understanding of these things will go and then your
overall understanding of life and also your ability to communicate
to articulate and to think about these things clearly both
for yourself and publicly as you go forward and you
probably will want to teach our kids about some of
these concepts teach your friends teach your family talked about
it with your with your spouse your girlfriend or your
boyfriend your co-workers and so forth this is a very
low investment activity this is not something you need to
spend an hour doing every single day like meditation it's
not going to take up a lot of your time
I recommend that really in reality how this is gonna
work if you make this commitment it's a it's a
very low energy commitment you're gonna be spending literally like
maybe five minutes a day or even just five minutes
a week looking up one or two of these words
per week and at first it's gonna seem like oh
that's so subtle it's so little it's not gonna be
a big change Leah why even waste time talking about
why I waste the whole episode talking about this stuff
it just seems like such an insignificant topic but see
your language in your vocabulary affects how you think and
here we're talking about the most basic vocabulary the most
basic concepts these will forever shape and color your relationship
to reality across the board in everything in your relationships
in your pursuit of enlightenment in your pursuit of self-actualization
in your business life and in pursuing money you know
whatever it is you're doing it's all gonna play a
subtle role and over time it's gonna snowball so for
the first year you might not see huge benefits from
this but it's such a low investment it takes so
little of your time all you have to do is
just to remember to do it and not be lazy
and now every day you got a smartphone so it's
so easy to look this stuff up it was a
lot harder 10 20 years ago when you actually had
to maybe carry around a dictionary and those dictionaries were
incomplete and you couldn't get multiple dictionaries and those dictionaries
didn't offer you any etymology they didn't offer you any
synonyms or antonyms or any of that kind of stuff
nowadays is so easy to find websites that do all
that stuff for you it's a it's remarkable one of
the most amazing things about the Internet is that we've
got that at our fingertips now so use that tool
and just imagine how much that's going to snowball then
in five or ten years you will become an expert
at all these concepts and that's it that's the whole
technique now if you're a non-native English speaker actually this
technique is even more important for you because you've got
catching up to do you need to be doing this
more and more and more every single day I want
you to make a commitment that every single time you
encounter an English word that you never heard before or
that you're not quite sure what it means you look
it up immediately that's one of the best ways to
master the English language or for that matter any language
that you're trying to master just keep doing that keep
doing that you'll notice that in 5 5 10 20
years you are gonna become an expert much better you
can have a much deeper understanding of the language a
much more much more appreciation of the language than the
native speakers do because they take it for granted so
in conclusion what this technique will do is it'll make
you a much better intellectual and it'll teach you how
to be a better thinker now be careful not to
fall into the following trap is to assume that Haley
oh but enlightenment is the teaching that we should stop
thinking and if the mind is the problem the mind
is the enemy and that therefore because we're pursuing enlightenment
here and we're talking about non-duality often because of this
I don't need to learn how to be a clear
thinker I can just half-ass my thinking I can be
a sloppy thinker that's a trap do not make that
mistake enlightenment does not mean that you need to not
be a thinker or to be a sloppy thinker there
is no contradiction between enlightenment and becoming a clear thinker
and a good intellectual it might seem at first that
these things are contradictions and it might seem at first
when you're starting to pursue enlightenment that yeah of course
you're gonna meditate and you're gonna try to calm your
monkey mind down and you're not gonna try to over
things and when you are meditating or self inquiring for
example you might need to shut off your mind for
the next hour or two completely and if you're at
a meditation retreat maybe you want to shut off your
mind for the next ten days nothing wrong with that
but that does not conflict with becoming a good thinker
and there's no benefit that you get from remaining a
sloppy thinker you can do both the same time you
can pursue non duality you can also clarify your thinking
and actually the two will synergize and actually what I'm
talking about here will will make you better able to
to question existentially you will start to see the limits
of thinking the limits of language and then that will
open you up to have these non symbolic experiences of
reality which will be very powerful but then you know
what you come back anyways you come back and then
you probably want to teach people you want to talk
to people you want to communicate to people clearly anyways
you want to think you want to be able to
write those are very critical skills to your success in
life and that's it so if you like that please
click the like button right now don't forget to click
that helps me with the videos and then come check
out actualize that org check out my blog I'm posting
a lot of advanced and interesting insights on the blog
check out the forum check out my life purpose course
check out my book list and more stuff to come
the last thing that I'll say here is that you
know lately late lately I've been stuck in this sort
of paralysis when it comes to actualized org in my
work because actually there is I've reached the point where
there is so much profound stuff yet to share that
I have not shared with you that I can't get
any work done because I'm too excited by it it's
so big I don't even know where to begin it's
like I have all of reality to share with you
to communicate to you to analyze to break down to
give my commentary on to point all this stuff out
to you about life it's so [ __ ] big
there's so much to this you might seem like oh
it might seem like to you ollie oh you've already
covered all the important topics now you're just scratching the
bottom of the barrel No if it seems that way
it just seems that way in reality it's just days
I actually find it it's getting harder and harder for
me to shoot these videos in a sense in a
sense it's easier because I'm getting better at talking without
filters but also in a sense it's getting harder because
well the quality bar is rising I always want them
to be better and better and better and so it
just you know you got a point of diminishing returns
um so there's that you know in the early days
I didn't I didn't care about quality nearly as much
I just wanted to get the stuff out there but
also it's because now my understanding is becoming so much
more holistic that it's like there's there's so many interconnections
between all these topics so many interesting interconnections and yet
I don't want to repeat topics so I'm trying to
think about how do I carve out all these topics
so that I present them to you but then they
don't overlap too much so you don't get bored so
I'm not saying the same things over and over again
because I hate that I hate it when teachers just
say the same [ __ ] all [ __ ]
time that's one of the things that upsets me about
non-duality teachers they just teach the same [ __ ]
every time I tried to put out new content every
single time and minimize overlap and that's actually quite challenging
to do you know it wastes a lot of my
mental energy to do that but more than that what
I'm paralyzed by is just how amazing some of these
subtleties of this work are and the subtleties are so
challenging sometimes to articulate and to to get people to
appreciate so a lot of my time is spent wracking
my brain about how to how to present these things
on a sort of a silver platter to you so
it's it's clear it's simple it doesn't repeat itself and
then that trips me up because it's daunting you know
sometimes I know a topic I know it kind of
intimately but then it's one thing to kind of know
it it's one thing to come out and just ramble
about it but I don't do that I don't just
stand up here and ramble I have a very specific
structure and plan for what I want to say I
want to have specific points that I want to hit
I want to be very comprehensive in the way that
I cover a topic which is why my topics are
always so long and I try not to repeat myself
but that's also very challenging to do and so anyways
I just wanted to share that with you as I'm
going through that those are some of the challenges that
I face you don't really need to know about those
challenges but hey I'm putting it out there so anyways
I'll see you next week with more you
