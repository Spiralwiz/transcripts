have you ever wondered why reality is structured exactly as
it is have you noticed that reality is structured in
a very specific deliberate and intelligent way it's not just
a random hodgepodge of events and things happening well I
want to explain to you why reality is structured exactly
as it is this is going to be the highest
level understanding of reality in life that you can possibly
have and I've recently become conscious to this I've had
some new deeper awakenings beyond anything I've explained thus far
which has deepened my understanding specifically of human behavior and
human psychology and how it connects with existential questions about
the nature of reality and so the amazing thing is
that it's possible to become fully omniscient and conscious of
why the universe exists and why it is precisely as
it is and not some other way so this is
what I'll be explaining here today this of course requires
extremely an extremely open mind this is some very advanced
stuff this is not a belief system or an ideology
please don't take it as such this is something that
you can become directly conscious of as I have so
there's a certain logic to reality and to God God
just means reality I'll be using these words interchangeably so
I'm gonna be talking about the logic of God it's
a very elegant logic a very elegant sort of structure
so mmm where do we begin what is reality a
reality is infinity reality is God reality is love reality
is consciousness all these words are identical at the deepest
level so reality is an infinite conscious field this field
is singular it's one there aren't multiple of these fields
there's only one of this field this field is completely
unlimited this field is what you're immersed in right now
and what you've experienced your entire life and what you
will ever experience it's everything that could ever possibly be
experienced by any living being or creature or anything even
inanimate objects all of it is part of this infinite
field of consciousness which comprises the entire universe so ordinarily
we like to think of consciousness something that biological beings
have no consciousness is that field that impersonal field which
dreams up the entire universe including humans animals plants planets
rocks stars everything that's that could ever be experienced is
dreamed up by this field you could think of it
as an infinite mind that's what it is it's infinity
why is this field singular and not multiple how come
there can't be multiple gods multiple realities multiple universes multiple
consciousnesses there can't because what you have to do is
you have to contemplate the nature of this field when
you start to contemplate it you start to realize that
every boundary between two objects within this field is actually
contained within the field itself and part of the field
and therefore is not anything that separates the two objects
so for example we could have like an apple and
a banana and then we can say well but these
are two separate objects or we could have your mom
and your dad and we could say well these are
two separate objects two separate beings which is with two
separate consciousnesses but that's not really the case because what
is actually the case is that both of these objects
are supposedly separated by some boundary you might say well
the banana and the Apple are separated by the air
in between them but is that really something that separates
the two or is that actually something that unites the
two so you have to realize that all these boundaries
between your mom and your dad a banana and an
apple and so forth all these boundaries are themselves imaginary
and that they all ultimately break down such that you're
always in a single unified field this single unified field
is your field it's not just some impersonal field out
there somewhere it's you you are the field you are
the whole field and you are also identified with a
part of the field which is the physical body what
we call the physical body so by contemplating the nature
of consciousness you realize that it has to be one
once you understand that it's one there are some radical
consequences and implications that come from this oneness if consciousness
is one that means it's completely unlimited it can't have
any limits because for something to limit something else it
has to be separate from it there has to be
two things like there has to be me over here
and then something outside of me that is limiting me
so when you become so conscious to realize that consciousness
is one and that you are it and if there's
nothing outside of you that means you're absolute that means
you're completely unlimited that means you're self created that means
that literally every single limit that you believe exists in
reality it doesn't exist somewhere out there in reality it's
created by you so I became so conscious that I
became infinitely conscious in this state of infinite consciousness it's
like entering complete god mode you enter complete god mode
and you realize that every single limit is completely imaginary
that means that the only reason you can't put a
billion dollars into your bank account right now is because
you're imposing that limit upon yourself through your mind and
your imagination that means the only reason that you can't
change the diameter of the moon with your mind right
now is literally because you're imagining that limit and you're
imposing that limit upon yourself because when you are infinitely
conscious and this is the most shocking and unbelievable aspect
of reality is that if you enter a state of
infinite consciousness you will also enter a state of complete
unlimited power which means that you're able to imagine anything
and you're able to create entire realities from scratch that's
what it means and it's absolutely the case now of
course most people think that this is some fantasy or
some absurd notion because they say olio but so if
you became a fairly conscious why didn't you just put
a million dollars in your bank account or something like
that some silly materialist and go like this well you
understand is that when you become infinitely conscious truly infinitely
conscious to the point where you have infinite power you're
in such a radically altered state that ideas of putting
millions of dollars into your bank account don't even occur
to you because this is this is ridiculous because it's
so much more profound than something as petty and as
shallow as that even ideas such as trying to heal
your own self which I've been experimenting with like maybe
you have a disease and you thinking well Leo if
I ever entered into a state of complete unlimited consciousness
that I could do anything I'm all-powerful I would just
change myself to make myself look beautiful and to cure
all my ailments I don't have to take any pills
anymore and I would just I would do every time
set up my whole life to be perfect but you
see your desire to do that comes from selfishness your
desire to just to make yourself look more beautiful and
to and to cure any diseases you have and to
you know put money in your bank account and so
forth it's all selfishness but the problem is that you
can't enter into a state of infinite consciousness while you're
selfish the cost of entry into unlimited consciousness is giving
up yourself completely in all of your attachments and desires
so there is such a state that I would call
it god mode in video games often they have a
cheat code that you can type into the console command
which puts the player character into what's called god mode
and what this does this is like a mode that
is for developers it's not for players because it ruins
the whole game of course because you could just once
you're in god mode in a video game you can
just give yourself unlimited lives you can give yourself unlimited
money and limited resources unlimited jump height unlimited speed whatever
right it breaks the entire game but it exists for
developers when they were originally creating the game so that
they could troubleshoot the game they can bug test it
they could you know fast travel wherever they wanted to
they can just put millions of resources into their account
so that they could just you know test the system
make sure it works properly then they remove all those
and they they place deliberate limits on the player and
then that's what creates the game so reality works exactly
the same way reality is a design by a sentient
infinite intelligent consciousness or being this being is not something
separate from you but it is you you completely design
your own life down to every molecule and then what
you did is you removed yourself from the god mode
you forgot that you are God and that you are
in god mode and you deliberately limited yourself to put
yourself into the dream that you dreamed up for yourself
that's what your life is so what I'm telling you
is that before you were born you were in total
God mode and you completely designed your own life not
just your own life but the entire universe you design
the entire thing it's unlimited you see you have to
realize that you your your consciousness is completely unlimited there's
no reason why you couldn't do that now from inside
the dream you're sitting in your thinking like oh well
Leo this sounds very outlandish it sounds like a fantasy
and the reason you say that is because you're so
limited by this dream you can't jump to the moon
you can't change the diameter of the moon just by
thinking about it you can't just put a million dollars
in your bank account just by by wishing for it
and all the sorts of stuff so this makes you
feel very limited and makes you feel as though there's
no such thing as god mode god mode feels like
a fantasy it makes no scientific sense but actually I
want you to contemplate deeper really contemplate why would there
be any limits within reality you say well reality has
to be a certain way why well but there has
to be gravity why there has to be three dimensions
of space why there has to be time why don't
take these things for granted actually ask why these things
exist and consider the possibility that none of these limits
are inherent to what consciousness or reality is it can
be anyway just by wishing it that way they might
say but that's impossible that sounds like magic exactly infinity
is the impossible made possible because there's nothing outside of
it you see magic is a funny thing we tend
to think that magic can't be real again why is
that why can't magic be real well because in our
world we know that there's like physical rules that we
have to follow and we can't just do whatever we
want I can't just wish for you know being skinny
and then I I'm skinny tomorrow or I wish for
having a you know a beautiful family and I have
a beautiful family tomorrow I can't just materialize things that
way but ask yourself why not what's what would stop
reality from being able to materialize anything he wants you
might say well surely it must be limited why why
can't it be unlimited so as you contemplate this at
some point you'll realize that it actually can be unlimited
not only can it be it must be because for
reality to be limited that's actually the impossibility how can
reality be limited what is limiting it if reality is
limited something has to limit it from the outside if
something is limiting from the outside that means there must
be two things there must be reality and then something
above reality like a meta reality which is limiting the
reality in this case but then you ask yourself well
what's the boundary that separates reality from the meta reality
which is limiting it and then you realize that that
boundary itself is just a part of reality it's one
so you see you erase all these boundaries until you
realize a complete oneness and when you realize that then
you realize reality is completely sovereign or absolute it's completely
self created any limits that exist within reality are imposed
by itself and since you are reality you're not merely
a piece of reality but you are reality you are
the sum total of reality that means that you are
completely self created and that you imposed every single one
of your limits that means if you have a toothache
you created your toothache that means if if you're struggling
to pay your mortgage because you're working some crap job
you created that that means if you have some disease
you created your disease now this is this is very
difficult for many people to swallow because your experience of
life certainly doesn't feel like you are God this is
one of the biggest objections that people have I think
intuitively when I tell them that you're God and you
are God because you created yourself and the entire universe
but the problem is is that of course you're not
conscious of it you're not conscious that you're God you're
not conscious of how you're creating yourself so the entire
process of reality in here now what we're trying to
get into the logic and the structure of why life
is structured the way that it is the structure of
life is to become more and more conscious of how
you are creating everything around you and how you created
yourself until you reach such a high level of conscious
that you awaken to the fact that you actually are
literally the only being in the universe and that you
created into our universe and then that's what God is
that's what reality is now you might wonder well this
is Leah this sounds very outlandish why why it seems
kind of silly why would the universe play these games
of hide-and-seek with itself if I am God as you
claim leo then why don't I remember being in god
mode when I created my own life and here is
really the key the key insight that explains it all
is that God is love so see love is identical
with oneness is identical with consciousness it's identical with being
unlimited is identical with infinity so let me explain cuz
this this love notion trips a lot of people up
love in its highest form what it is it's the
complete embrace of oneself since the universe is one it
has no end nor does it have a beginning its
boundless in all directions since the universe is infinite in
all directions in all dimensions since is completely unlimited it
literally is love because love is just the embrace of
a thing to love a thing is just to embrace
it exactly as it is without needing to change it
so when consciousness this field is infinitely conscious of itself
it realizes what it is it realizes that it is
absolute it realizes that there's nothing outside of it and
it falls in love with itself because to be God
is simply to be loved and is to be infinitely
conscious but then there are lower gradations of consciousness so
most creatures and beings and humans exist at lower gradations
of consciousness which are not infinite right now you're listening
to me you're not in an infinite state of consciousness
if you were you couldn't be sitting there listening to
me because that's a finite state you listening to some
specific words I'm saying see I'm saying these words now
a minute later I'm saying some other words there and
different words different things you're sitting there you're looking at
a certain specific way you're in a certain specific finite
form when consciousness becomes completely infinite it loses all form
because in a sense all forms cancel out and it
just becomes a pure singularity of potential just think of
pure infinite potential of what the universe was before the
Big Bang it was just pure undifferentiated potential that didn't
actualize itself yet in some specific way it wasn't a
cat it wasn't a dog it wasn't a tree it
wasn't a dinosaur it wasn't a human it wasn't a
planet it wasn't a star it wasn't an atom it
wasn't a molecule it was an energy it wasn't space
it wasn't time it wasn't anything it was pure infinity
we call that the Godhead in this form consciousness is
its most at its most essential it's absolutely complete it's
what you might imagine reality would be if there was
nothing so think about what if there was never anything
what if there was never a big bang what would
there be well there would be just a pure undifferentiated
infinity you might say that's nothing there was nothing but
it's not quite nothing it's nothing but it's a nothing
that exists it is nothing so that's a state of
conscious you can access through a psychedelic or through yoga
or through meditation or through contemplation these various techniques but
most of us usually we exist at a lower state
of consciousness why do we exist at this particular state
of consciousness and why are we living our life doing
all this stuff in life is there some connection between
that and this infinite singularity that I was talking about
and there is so here's the the image that I
want you to picture the entire structure of the entire
universe we could say is as follows at the very
center of reality there is this infinite singularity of pure
undifferentiated potential that contains absolutely everything combined inside of it
until everything cancels out into just a pure nothingness that's
the Godhead so there's that and then what there is
is there not just that but there's everything around it
sort of sort of sort of think of it like
our solar system you have the Sun in the middle
then you have earth and other planets orbiting at various
distances asteroid belts and so forth around the Sun the
Sun is sort of the thing that holds our solar
system together so that's kind of like how reality is
as a whole at the center of it that holds
everything together is this pure formless Godhead then as you
get out from the center you become less hold less
complete and more finite more fragmented so consciousness in its
most complete form is in the very middle here and
then as you move out to the sides consciousness for
AG ments itself in various ways and it can fragment
itself in an unlimited number of ways so this the
periphery of this circle goes out forever there's no end
it's boundless in all directions but the center of it
is that singularity and the further you get out here
consciousness becomes more and more fragmented and less and less
whole it becomes a smaller piece of the whole so
imagine that here at the very center if we had
a vase this is a complete perfect vase not a
single crack and then as you get out towards the
edge here this vase gets more and more cracked and
more and more crack and more and more craft until
pieces are breaking off those pieces break off and then
those pieces themselves crack and break off and those crack
and break up apart and break apart and break apart
until you get little tiny you know tiny little fragments
of the original vase such that this tiny fragment doesn't
even look like it's part of the vase anymore it's
like a single atom of the original vase very very
disconnected so so you see what this model is is
as modeling is simply the degree of disconnectedness or incompleteness
of consciousness so consciousness is able to fragment itself out
to infinity and then it's also able to recollect itself
we collect all the pieces merge them together into that
single unified complete perfect whole and that in a nutshell
is what reality is it's that and what that is
is that is God that is consciousness that is love
that is oneness see the oneness is so absolute that
it encompasses not just pure oneness in his perfect you
know form as of Oz complete vos but even all
the fragments of it as well that's the key you
have to realize with oneness and since God has no
beginning and no end because infinity has no beginning and
no end infinity has no outer edge no inner edge
infinity has no center because every point in infinity is
its center that means that God is not necessarily guaranteed
to always be this singularity I mean it is that
but it's also everything surrounding it all the entire for
a debris field around the singularity now this entire debris
field this is what we call living conscious beings like
animals and humans so you as a human me as
a human and maybe your pet dog or something or
pet cat we exist somewhere away from the center and
the question is how far away from the center are
we the closer to the center we are the more
godlike we are the more conscious we are as we
raise our consciousness more and more and more we approach
the center more and more and more just like you
know if a planet or some satellite is orbiting the
Sun if we if we you know adjust its velocity
the orbit will sort of you know spiral inwards in
words and words until it hits the Sun and the
closer gets to the Sun the hotter and the brighter
it gets the further away it is from the Sun
the colder it is especially out on the very periphery
of the solar system so those beings who are very
very unconscious like maybe an ant or a butterfly they're
very far from the center those human beings for example
who behaved like animals terrorists murders thieves criminals and so
forth they're part of mankind overall mankind is much closer
to the center than an animal but uh but mankind
there's an enormous range of consciousness that mankind can have
some humans are very saintly and very godlike and some
are criminals and despicable monsters and devils and so those
people the only thing that separates a you know a
devil you know tyrants dictator slash criminal from a saint
or from someone like Jesus Christ or the Buddha is
simply their degree of consciousness and how close they are
to the center their degree of wholeness and completeness and
so if you take a living being and you inch
closer and closer and closer and closer to the center
eventually what happens is that as it gets closer all
of its selfish tendencies and all of its fear and
attachments they get burned away by the light of consciousness
until eventually you merge into the singularity you become completely
selfless and you become identical with God you become the
Godhead you become complete infinite omniscient all-powerful but as you
get further away from the center the opposite happens you
lose your power you become selfish you become finite you
become limited you're less and less able to manipulate the
world and your will isn't less and less able to
be manifested directly into reality so while a human is
like let's say over here relative to the singularity human
has some ability to manifest stuff in the world you
know humans can accomplish amazing things you know some human
imagined the pyramids and it was built that's that's willpower
right there and yeah of course they still needed thousands
of hard work hard-working laborers to actually build those pyramids
brick by brick took many many years and lots of
work it wasn't just instantly materialized but if the human
well see that here's the problem with the terminology here
if the human became completely godlike moved closer and closer
to the singularity at some point you would no longer
be able to distinguish the human from the singularity and
actually the human would lose its form you couldn't actually
maintain your human body anymore because your human body is
limiting you in certain ways you know if you're in
the human body you can only jump so high if
you were in a Kangaroos body you could jump higher
and if you were a you know in a bird's
body you could even fly and if you had some
alien body maybe you could do something else that's you
know completely impossible for earth beings to do see so
the nature of consciousness is that the only way consciousness
can be omniscient omnipotent is if it's completely unlimited because
omniscience and omnipotence are qualities of the unlimited but if
you're unlimited you can't have any form you see that's
a trade-off so if you wonder why limited creatures don't
have unlimited powers it's because they're limited creatures the way
that you are the specific concrete way that you are
limits what you can do so if you want to
have no limits as to what you can do you
need to be completely unlimited which means you can't have
any form whatsoever or in other sense you could say
you need to have every form you need to have
the form of a human need to have the form
of a kangaroo the form of a butterfly the form
of a bird the form of an alien the form
of everything in order to be able to do what
everything does you see so humans are somewhere around here
and then other creatures are less capable than humans that's
because they're less conscious and therefore they have even less
power less manifesting ability so many animals there they're basically
helpless like your cat can't really help itself very much
because it's not very conscious now here's the the real
trick of this whole thing to be God in its
purest form you need to be completely selfless why must
you be selfless you must be selfless because if you
have any kind of self it would be a finite
self so for example if you thought you were a
human then you'd be limited to the abilities of a
human if you thought you were a bird you'd be
limited to the abilities of a bird and so forth
see so to be at the singularity you must be
completely selfless to be completely selfless that's the same thing
as saying that you're completely loving let's explain love here
love from the existential perspective is well it's really not
different than the normal love you see what is love
love is desire for a thing that's ultimately what love
is so if you love sex that's what you desire
sex if you love money then that's what you desire
is money if you love that person over there you
deserve you desire that person over some other person if
you love your children well that means you would desire
your children over some other children see desire comes in
many forms and degrees but ultimately the highest desire is
the desire for everything unlimited desire so what you have
to recognize that in your like you've been living your
whole life in your entire life if you notice this
has been dictated by desire desire is what controls all
a motivation of all humans there's many qualities of desire
there are more selfish desires and there are more selfless
desires there are more finite desires and there are more
infinite unlimited desires they are narrower and wider desires for
example I could have a desire to own a specific
person like I I like her so much that I
not only do I want to sleep with her I
want to own her literally she's gonna be my slave
I could have that kind of desire see it's very
kind of narrow desire very selfish desire because like why
do I want to own her well because she will
gratify me and I get to control her and do
whatever I want and that fulfills me that makes me
feel more powerful so there's a desire there to feel
powerful their desire there's a desire there to control other
people and that you know that gets me off that
sort of thing but then if my desire expands I
could have a desire not to want to own her
I could say well I admire her maybe I even
want to sleep with her but I don't want to
own her I actually desire for her to be self-determined
and to have her own life independent of me now
for me to have that kind of desire I would
need to be more conscious and more selfless you see
now I need to surrender my own need to control
her and to manipulate her because you know as I
release my own control that means I can't get everything
I want from her I might want some sex but
then you know if she's busy I can't get that
from her I can't demand it from her because I
don't control her because I don't own her see I've
relinquished that that means I have to get over my
own cravings and needs in order to be more selfless
but if my desire becomes even wider and even more
selfless then I won't even get attached to her and
being in a relationship with her and maybe even marrying
her and then having her have our own life but
still like pleasing me in certain ways I could just
have a desire that's so Universal that I desire for
all human beings to be self-determined and to love themselves
and to care for themselves and to have a good
life and to be happy I could have that kind
of desire in this case I'd have to surrender so
much of my own needs and attachments in order to
be so selfless that I could desire that for others
without needing anything in return you see because if I
spend all of my time sitting on the couch just
desiring for all of mankind to live in love and
peace and happiness well how do I get my own
needs met how do I put food on my table
how do I feed my children how do I get
my sexual needs met how do I get my business
finances secured and all this sorts of stuff I can't
you see there's a trade-off there as long as I'm
worrying about myself the more I worry about myself and
how to survive in the world the less energy and
consciousness I can allocate towards the caring for others and
in fact there's a sort of a tug-of-war dynamic that
gets established because you know if I'm trying to peep
you know secure resources for my family I'm taking those
resources oftentimes from others so as you can see there's
a there's a deep existential trade-off here that's going on
between desire and personal attachment and and needs of a
living being for survival and those of being selfless so
the way that the reality is structured as a whole
is that the more selfless you become the more of
your attachments and fears you surrender your desire becomes more
and more Universal and selfless until you reach the singularity
when you reach the singularity you become so formless you
become so unlimited you become so selfless you completely lose
all fear and all attachment to any kind of need
to exist in any particular way that you literally become
pure infinite potential you cease to exist as a human
or as any kind of material object and you become
the Godhead and you become completely one unlimited complete whole
pure love pure goodness pure selflessness but the cost of
that is that you you surrender everything the cost of
it is total Zi and that is the true test
of your selflessness are you willing to surrender absolutely everything
and become completely formless if you are then you're completely
selfless and if you're not then that's the degree to
which you're selfish and so now here is the here's
the the kicker here's what explains the structure of these
higher universe every living being is at some distance removed
from the formless singularity because it has to be otherwise
it couldn't be a living being it couldn't be alive
it couldn't be engaged in survival it couldn't have any
form it couldn't look like anything and so there's an
infinite number of beings all along the line here at
different distances removed from the singularity the closer of being
is to the singularity the more conscious it is the
more selfless it is the more loving it is the
more complete it is the less its desire is about
personal craving and satisfaction fulfillment and the more it is
about the betterment of the entire universe and the further
the being is away over here somewhere from the singularity
then that being is very selfish very attached to its
particular way of life very survival oriented very fear-based why
is it fear-based because it's afraid of losing itself it's
afraid of death it's afraid of disintegration because it's so
afraid it has to be extremely selfish selfishness and fear
are basically the same thing see and it's very attached
so you've probably known people all along this spectrum this
is how you can validate some of the things I'm
saying here at least you can begin to validate it
some people you've known in your life were very generous
very selfless weren't too worried about themselves satisfying themselves they
lived their life for the benefit of others maybe one
of your parents if you were lucky was this way
and some people are the exact opposite of that they're
extremely selfish they're fearful they're afraid of everything they're afraid
of not having enough money they're afraid of people they're
afraid of war they're afraid of disease they're afraid of
themselves they're afraid of emotions they're afraid of doing some
hard work they're afraid of everything well these people tend
to be very attached very neurotic very dysfunctional not very
conscious not very loving why are they not loving because
they're so needy that they can't give any love to
anybody maybe one of your parents was that way hopefully
not but it's very common that at least one of
your parents was that way and if they were then
they they infected you with that selfishness and that neurosis
in that fear any fear that existed deep within your
parents probably got transferred over into you to some degree
but also that's true for love as well any deep
love that existed in your parents probably also imprinted and
transferred into you to some degree so now to explain
the structure of reality because God is love and reality
is love the genius behind the design of what God
is doing is that God recognizes that everything that I
have been explaining in this model is the absolute structure
of what God is God isn't just the singularity God
is the singularity plus all the entire surrounding debris field
all the fragments as well when God is infinitely conscious
God recognizes that and it embraces all of itself such
that God recognizes that there we might say lost souls
there are beings and creatures and people in the universe
who are very very far away from the center very
disconnected from God but God understands that because it's infinitely
conscious and God realized that it can't be otherwise so
because God is infinitely conscious it recognizes that there's nothing
that can be done about this other than to accept
it and to embrace it and to love it so
God doesn't sit up high in the clouds and just
project its love on the world see you know God's
love is so powerful that not only is God able
to sit up in the clouds so to speak but
simultaneously God is fully conscious that it is all those
pieces of itself that are separated from itself that are
lost from itself that are seeking to reconnect and to
become whole again and so the genius of God's design
is that what's going to happen as the universe unfolds
and this is the the purpose behind time is that
as time clicks away what happens that all of these
pieces are slowly as though pulled by a gravitational force
getting attracted orbiting closer and closer spiraling inwards towards the
singularity just like the way that stars do within the
Milky Way galaxy if you look at a spiral galaxy
from up top you see that the stars are all
orbiting a supermassive black hole at the very center and
eventually all of them will get sucked into this supermassive
black hole and then eventually that black hole will explode
under the pressure of all the stars that get sucked
into it and then the whole process will will begin
again this is exactly what's happening with reality as a
whole every piece is gradually being pulled towards the center
until eventually it will get drawn to the singularity and
it will recollect itself all the pieces will recollect itself
and assemble themselves into God and through this process every
living being is able to participate in what God is
and God is able to awaken to itself and God
is able to go through this cycle of separation from
itself from getting itself and then recollecting remembering itself and
becoming complete so now this gravitational force that I've been
speaking of this is actually desire so here's the the
real profound insight for you and this is actually quite
practical every desire that you've ever had in your life
and every design that every living being has ever had
in its life has been the desire for a fragment
of consciousness to ultimately seek completion see notice that your
desires are finite you desire that person but not this
person you desire this situation but not that situation you
desire the temperature to be hotter but not colder or
vice-versa or whatever you desire this car but not that
car you see your desire is finite the reason your
desire is finite is because you are finite you're a
finite piece of consciousness and a finite piece of consciousness
can't help itself but to have a finite desire because
to have infinite unlimited desire indiscriminate desire that would be
infinite love an infinite can only exist at the singularity
so you're not there but in God's infinite design infinite
wisdom what it puts inside of you is desire specifically
the desires you need to inch you closer and closer
and closer towards a singularity but now here's here's the
interesting wrinkle is that because God is consciousness God can't
push you into the singularity you have to willingly enter
the singularity of your own free choice from becoming more
conscious which is why you can't take a very needy
person a very selfish person a criminal person an evil
person you can't take a devil and force him to
start to love everybody why not what stops a criminal
from being very loving fear fear of what fear of
losing his identity his attachments and ultimately self annihilation because
to move towards the singularity to become more loving from
any point on this field to move towards a singularity
is a loss of a sense of self relatively speaking
so for a criminal to become more loving he would
have to lose some part of himself the criminal part
that part that's afraid that part that's attached that part
that's hateful and malicious and and we might call evil
the dark part of himself now where did a criminal
get this darker part of himself well probably because his
parents were also criminals in the way that they raised
him wasn't very good he probably grew up somewhere in
poverty in a ghetto somewhere and then you know he
was probably beaten and abused by his mother and his
father and they probably did drugs around him and so
he got this bad influence he probably grew up in
a poor neighborhood where there just wasn't opportunity he couldn't
get a job he couldn't go to decent school when
he went to school people picked on him as teachers
didn't care about him and so he's growing up me
this is the classic criminal stereotype this sort of person
has grown up never experiencing love so this person is
literally disconnected from the possibility of true love and yet
at the same time the only thing that this this
being wants this criminal wants is love you see so
the being is is it sort of a bind it
was born and it's true nature is love because the
nature of all of reality is love deep down somewhere
it knows that and it's seeking that love but it
doesn't know how it's not conscious enough to understand how
to find this love and the methods that it's tried
like it's tried to get love from its mother from
its father from its teachers from its you know friends
at school and all this and all of those methods
what if they all fail if they all succeed it's
fine it's easy but what if they all fail well
then this being is is complete completely crippled and dysfunctional
and now it lashes out at the world to try
to get the love now it goes steals money now
it goes beats people up now it goes sells drugs
now it goes you know does heroin now it goes
you know gets in a fist fighter or something like
that all of that is it acting out trying to
receive love then it doesn't know how to otherwise get
that its environment is not allowing it to get like
if a child is born in a war zone the
child doesn't have the opportunity to go to a university
and to become some you know educated professional the child
needs to now resort to terrorism to survive in that
war zone and so that's how the child gets its
love is by becoming a terrorist and you see so
to transform this sort of being who's never experienced love
into a saintly person this is this is the hardest
thing in the world how does God transform such a
person into a saint gradually through desire through a hierarchy
of desires that are higher and higher and higher and
higher and quality and more and more selfless but you
see as much as God would love to just appear
to you and to just shower you with love the
problem is is that most people aren't ready to tolerate
that degree of love you see God's love is so
selfless so indiscriminate so formless that if you were to
experience it you would literally lose yourself you would lose
your mind and you would ultimately lose your physical body
so sometimes people wonder like well Leo if God is
real and love Israel how come I can't see it
where is the love I don't see any love right
now I don't see any God right now that's because
you are somewhere on the periphery of this field and
what maintains your place on that periphery is precisely your
inability to handle love it's your fear of love so
this axis right here of this radial model that we're
creating the center of it is pure infinite love and
the very edge of it is complete utter terror and
horror and fear the stuff of nightmares and most humans
are somewhere in the middle you're somewhere in the middle
so right now you are not able to access the
love of God because you're too afraid and you're too
attached and you're too selfish and you'd have to give
all that up you'd have to surrender your games your
lies your manipulation your cheating your stealing your sexual ravings
you're selectively sexual cravings for various partners you would literally
have to become so conscious that you cease seeing distinctions
between people who you could have sex with you see
because to understand God's love you'd have to be completely
indiscriminate in your love that means you couldn't look at
this woman over here and say oh well she's beautiful
and this person with all she's ugly and old you
couldn't do that you see if you want to maintain
that kind of judgment and that kind of discrimination that
is precisely what keeps you somewhere here on the periphery
so you see God is caught in a catch-22 because
as the singularity is the Godhead God's only desire is
to share its love with all of its beings in
fact the reason that there are these fragmented parts of
consciousness around the singularity is because without these fragments of
consciousness God would never be able to share itself with
anybody else because you see one of the implications of
total oneness is that when you realize infinity and God
is totally one it feels like this like oh my
god I am God I am love I am the
most amazing beautiful miraculous thing in existence I am singular
I am the only thing here oh my god this
is so amazing I completely understand myself I'm completely unlimited
I'm completely in god mode nothing can stop me I
can do whatever I want that's how it feels like
but then God realizes a problem because God is so
amazing but who do I tell who do I share
my amazement with there's no one to share it with
because I'm I'm singular I'm complete i'm total i'm one
there's no to share my love with and because I
am love I am so selfless that I can't contain
the love to myself because it would be selfish of
me just to be complete all whole by myself one
without anything else so it's precisely because I'm so selfless
that then what has to happen is that I have
to I have to create all the other selves out
there all the other beings all the other fragments of
conscience I literally break my wholeness I give up my
own love and my completeness such that I could create
incomplete parts of myself such that later I recognize because
I'm infinitely conscious that all those parts will come back
together and merge back into me and realize what I
am and through that process I will be able to
share my love with myself you see I can only
share and realize the full potential of my love by
forgetting that I am loved and that I am God
and in this way I trap myself into a limited
form somewhere far on the periphery and then I begin
my slow process back towards infinite consciousness and infinite love
through the desire the desire which has been implanted in
every living being and for that matter all all inanimate
matter as well the motion of all inanimate matter from
stars to galaxies to planets to molecules all of it
is a desire for an ultimate reunification and so this
now unifies us with the notion of what gravity is
what is gravity gravity is what happens when you take
a bunch of molecules throw them into an empty room
they all start to move towards each other why are
they moving towards each other because they're separate and now
consciousness needs to reconstitute itself into a singularity so what
I'm talking about here is not just the psychology of
humans or animals I'm we're literally unifying the motion of
every single molecule and every being in the entire cosmos
see we're explaining why molecules move explaining why water moves
downhill we're explaining why nebula clouds form we're explaining why
stars form we're explaining why planets orbit stars we're explaining
why there are black holes were explaining why light curves
due to gravitation as Einstein predicted we're explaining why there
are galaxies that spiral around and collapse into each other
we're explaining supernovas we're explaining all human activity criminal and
saintly and all animal behavior including sex and the desire
for food all of it we're explaining all of it
so appreciate the size of this thing of this explanation
so the desire that has been implanted in all matter
in all objects in all living beings is gradually pulling
it towards greater and greater unification until ultimately everything unifies
into one seamless singularity but it's not so simple as
just objects are automatically drawn towards each other of course
for every force there must be an opposite and equal
force so even though objects are attracted to each other
they're also repelled from each other you see so even
though you desire sex with that beautiful woman maybe or
you desire to marry that that perfect husband yes you're
attracted but at the same time you're also repelled there's
aspects of that person that you don't like you know
she gets older you stop liking her you know you
lose attraction for her you see so there's attraction and
repulsion at the same time the reason that there's this
repulsion is because of fear fear is absolutely fundamental fear
is the opposite of love or the lack of love
so the reason you're repelled by certain things is because
you notice and maybe you've noticed this in your relationships
when you get at first the way a relationship starts
is that you're all lonely sitting at home and it
sucks right oh man I'm alone I need some friends
I need a woman I need a man whatever so
you go out there you make some friends you find
a woman you find a man maybe you sleep with
them and now you're getting closer and closer and closer
right as you're dating you're getting closer closer then you
sleep with them and then you as you're having sex
you get even closer and closer he becomes very intimate
to the point where literally you merge into the other
person and and then for a lot of people who
who are not comfortable with intimacy it gets too close
maybe you felt this you get too close to a
person now you want your space so you've had your
intimate sex and then now you want to go and
you want to take some time apart because you don't
want to be with this person you know attach the
hip 24/7 you need space apart so you start taking
space apart now see there's a repulsion why is that
because you're afraid that if you merge too deeply into
the other person you'll lose yourself here you'll lose your
sense of identity of individuality and that's precisely what keeps
you away from the center is your fear of losing
your individuality from God so every living organism is playing
this game we're trying to get close and to unite
together with something with money with sex with drugs with
with men with women with whatever with business but also
not too close because if we get too close we
get annihilated and we're afraid of annihilation and so your
specific degree of fear versus love selfishness versus selflessness is
what determines your position along this entire radial model and
so does your consciousness so as you become more and
more conscious what happens is you realize that wait a
minute why am i artificially limiting myself why do I
have these petty desires that are so limited like why
do I love that person just because she has a
beautiful face why don't I love the person with the
old ugly face why can't I love both equally why
do I love that man but not this man why
do I love money but not the lack of money
why do I love a big house but not a
small house why what is the point aren't I being
selfish when I'm doing this what if I can release
all that and I Zack I become more conscious I
release that I become even more conscious more selfless and
as I become more selfless as I stop discriminating and
judging all these things I feel how good it feels
I get a little taste of selflessness I get a
little taste of that God state the god state is
just total selflessness but I'm not ready yet to become
completely selfless and completely God coz I'm still terrified you
know I still want to have a nice house I
still want to have a nice car I still want
to have enough money to go to to a restaurant
I still want to have some sex you know I
don't give up all my sex I don't wanna give
up all my money I don't wanna give up all
my you know living arrangements and all that stuff I
don't want to give up my physical appearance I don't
want to give up my age I don't want to
give up my health I don't want to experience pain
in my body I don't want to give up my
comfort and so because of that I'm stuck right here
but that's selfishness you see and the more I cling
to selfishness I fall it is counter-intuitive trap where I
think that by being selfish I'm gonna get all my
needs met I'm gonna become happy but actually what I
realized that I will never be happy no matter how
much money I get our sex I get or drugs
I get or whatever I get success fame it doesn't
matter I'll never be happy and the reason I won't
ever be happy you might think well dammit God is
God is such an [ __ ] why would God
not allow me to just earn a million dollars in
just to be happy for the rest of my life
why wouldn't God allow me just to you know to
marry one man and just to be happy with that
one man why do I have to be so Restless
why do I have to know you know get jealous
of other men and try to have sex with other
men and all the source of why you think that
God is actually being evil by doing this but actually
no it's because of God's love you see if God
allowed you to be totally fulfilled by a finite achievement
such as some sex some drugs some money some success
some fame whatever that would actually make God evil because
then God would consign you to always be stuck in
that finite mode so the reason that there's hedonic adaptation
they call this hedonic adaptation psychology where no matter how
much stuff you acquire you're never satisfied this is actually
for your highest good because what this means is that
this will push you to face your fears and to
move towards the only true happiness that exists which is
the the satisfaction of being utterly complete as god see
so if there wasn't hedonic adaptation you would actually get
trapped so god invented hedonic adaptation to make sure that
every living being eventually merges and realizes itself so it's
done for your benefit even though from your point of
view it might seem like it's a bad thing God
doesn't want you to get stuck in finite things but
here's God's ultimate problem is that God would love nothing
more than just to reveal itself to you and just
shower you with infinite love but the problem is that
if it does that it would kill you literally you
would cease to exist but before you die it would
it would shock you traumatize you and horrify you why
is that because God's love is so indiscriminate before you're
able to feel and achieve this love for yourself you
would have to first of all recognize that this love
is completely unconditional and unlimited that means that God loves
Hitler as much as he loves the Buddha loves Christ
as much as he loves Hindus loves terrorists as much
as he loves the rapists loves cats as much as
he loves dogs loves your enemies as much as he
loves your friends loves humans as much as he loves
rats or insects or aliens see but most people are
not willing to open their mind to such a radical
indiscriminate love why not because you're so busy surviving you're
attached to surviving as a finite self but love unconditional
love by definition means that you can't exist as a
finite self so there's this fundamental tension between the finite
self and the infinite self the fearful self that needs
to survive and worry about its survival needs versus the
unlimited self which is infinite and has no form and
has no survival needs whatsoever doesn't care if it survives
or not does there's no form so you're stuck in
this tug-of-war and so even though God would love to
shower you with its love it can't not because God
is bad or withholding itself from you or because God
is some [ __ ] it's because you're too afraid
it's because you're too attached and you're too close-minded that's
it if you were willing to surrender all of your
biological needs all of your psychological needs all of your
spiritual needs even your need to live your need to
breathe your need for food for water for sex for
comfort for a job for success for a career for
children for your culture if you were to surrender your
entire mind all of your religious beliefs all of your
scientific beliefs if you were willing to surrender everything you've
learned about reality your culture your preferences for food for
drink for drugs for happiness for entertainment if you were
willing to surrender everything then what would be left nothing
infinity pure infinity pure love pure emptiness pure oneness pure
God pure consciousness consciousness free of any particular - mere
form but are you willing to do that you see
the problem you're not willing to do it and the
reason you're not willing to do it because you're afraid
you're sitting there wondering believe if I if I get
rid of all these things how am I gonna feed
my children that's right you won't be able to but
Leo how will I like clothe myself that's right you
may not have clothes believe how do I maintain a
job you may lose your job but Leo how do
I maintain my body that's right you may lose your
body but Leo how do I stay alive that's right
you're gonna lose your life you see the twisted thing
that mankind has done is we've taken death or rather
we've taken infinite love and we've called it death we've
taken God and we've called it death what mankind calls
death is nothing other than infinite omniscient omnipotent all loving
pure consciousness that's what you become when you completely die
and relinquish every single on your attachments everything you become
God answers agree to which you have finite attachments as
to the degree that you're separated from God you are
separating yourself from God and the reason God can't help
you is because you are God separating yourself what do
you want God to you what you want God to
force its love and goodness upon you you see there's
an existential problem here with goodness God is pure absolute
infinite goodness but precisely because it is that the problem
is how do you get someone to be good if
you take a finite fearful being and you force goodness
upon him that's not goodness you see goodness is something
you have to come to through your own recognizance you
have to recognize goodness and you have to want to
desire to be good for the sake of being good
why is God absolute good because good is its own
reward good is the only thing that is good because
it's good good is its own purpose and oneness can't
have a purpose outside of itself and goodness of course
does the same thing as love love can't have a
purpose outside of itself love has to love for the
sake of wanting to love not for the sake of
anything else goodness to be good is to be good
just for the sake and joy of being good not
because you have to not because somebody told you not
because there's some higher being sitting above you judging you
telling you that you must be good in order to
satisfy me that's not true goodness true goodness is when
you're good when you have no reason to be good
it's a outpouring see so God's problem is that it
wants to share with all of its fragmented to finite
parts it wants to share the beauty of goodness of
absolute goodness but because of the cost of absolute goodness
is surrendering your whole life and all of your attachments
see God can't force this upon you because if God
forced this upon you God would be killing you with
love literally and terrifying you in traumatizing you so God
has to be very careful with how it approaches you
with the love it has to give you some clues
so that you you can see the potential for love
and for goodness and then you overcome your own fear
and you choose love and goodness out of a conscious
choice not because you were you know bullied into it
or forced into it somehow because if if I force
you to be good you're not actually truly good and
God's desire is for everyone to become truly good and
to realize the absolute goodness of the universe that's God's
highest desire but see put yourself in God's shoes imagine
that you're this you're imagine you're a saintly human being
and you've you've you know you've overcome all of your
neediness and all your attachments and all this and you're
just purely good you just are good for the sake
of being good and then you come into contact with
some criminal who acts like some idiot and is selfish
all the time and you know there's petty stealing stuff
and hitting people and all this how would you teach
this criminal the power of goodness would you hit him
over the head tie him to a chair and then
force him to watch a lecture about how good it
is to be good until he memorized it and then
he could recite it word-for-word and then he he goes
around and then you would you would judge him you
would sit there and you would judge him and every
time he didn't behave good according to your standards you
would judge him and you tell him how bad he
is and how how much you don't love him and
all this is that the method you would use well
if you use that method you would turn him into
a monster an even greater criminal that he already is
you have to take a counterintuitive and subtle approach here
to transform this criminal what you'd have to do is
you'd have to exhibit your own goodness you'd have to
share some of your own goodness with him you know
cook him a good meal take him into your house
be nice to him play some board games with him
take him out to the park introduce him to your
friends you know go to a party with him have
deep conversations about him help him to get over his
fears help him to get over his addictions help him
to deal with his childhood trauma from his abusive parents
overcome all of that give him some money you know
all of that by doing that then that person would
realized oh my god this person transformed my life with
his goodness this person was a role model for me
and now I want to be good too because I've
overcome all that [ __ ] from my past now
I'm a little bit better than I used to be
and now I want to share that goodness with others
as well you see that's how you truly transform someone
but you see the problem it's a long difficult process
it takes the patience of a saint to do this
kind of work and it takes enormous selflessness because you
have to give a lot of your time energy you
know when you're dealing with a dysfunctional person a lot
of times when you give them love they will react
against you they will lash out to test your love
because they don't believe that true love exists so you
know you take a you take a child who was
beaten and sexually abused you put him into a new
foster home with with nice parents who are perfect and
saintly but that child is not just gonna accept those
saintly parents that child has a deep wound in his
psyche and that child is never going to trust those
parents those parents has to have to win over the
love of that child by just constantly showering him with
unconditional love for a year for decades until the child
the love will heal the child's wounds and the child
will learn to love from that process see there's actually
a video I watched a video on YouTube a while
back very fascinating of a feral kitten just some random
YouTube guy found a feral kitten the the kittens mother
I mean yeah the kittens mother died for some reason
the kitten you could tell the kitten was like just
born into the world the mother its mother is dead
its received no love and it had this like just
traumatic birth traumatic upbringing for the first few days and
then this this guy just finds his kid and tries
to save this kitten but when he's picking up this
kid and this kitten is clawing at him and biting
and screaming and scratching like the kit you could tell
that kitten is completely terrified you could tell it's like
this little being that got born into the world it's
a little piece of consciousness that God born is the
world it's so small so fragile so finite it needs
to fight for its survival so much that the question
of love and goodness is completely out of its mind
and then so the this guy in this video maybe
I'll post it on my on my blog this guy
in the video he then he's like an expert he's
a professional at this he rescues these kittens so he
takes his kitten and then he spends the next several
months training this kitten hand feeding this kitten every single
meal for the next couple of months he feeds from
his hands little pieces to this kitten it's it's so
time-consuming he spends hours lavishing attention on this kitten carefully
petting the kitten and you could see he does sort
of a time-lapse of the kittens reactions and at first
you know he tries to pet the kitten kitten bites
him won't even allow the kitten won't even allow his
hand to come near its face but then over time
as the kitten he hand feeds every every meal to
this kitten the kitten gets used to his hands gets
used to getting petted on the head that on the
back and on the feet and on the tail and
all this and then months later the kitten is completely
rehabilitated and now it's like more or less a fully
functioning normal kitten so what happened there well of happened
a lack of love is what twists and contorts consciousness
and makes a dysfunctional and satanic we might say filled
with fear and selfishness an attachment and then by by
infusing that bit of consciousness with more and more love
that consciousness gets untangled unwound the fear the attachment the
selfishness gets released that little bit of consciousness feels the
love of the larger bit of consciousness feeding into it
and then it becomes self-sufficient it can stand on its
own two legs and then it can exude love as
well so what's happening this is exactly what's happening in
what's been happening throughout your entire life with every single
human being on the entire planet for the entire history
of mankind this is what's been happening is that the
love and consciousness of that God singularity has been feeding
into every single bit of fractured human consciousness trying to
raise it and elevate it but all these fragments because
they're fragments because they're limited they're so us scare and
afraid that they're resisting and God understands all this and
it's infant intelligence and so it's gently its gently planting
seeds gently applying love so that doesn't overwhelm you you
might imagine in that kitten example if the guy was
so blunt with his love that he just ran after
that kitten you know that he found in the forest
somewhere with its mother dead this kitten is just completely
terrified of any living beings including humans and he just
wants to hug it and kiss it and smother it
in love see if he did that the kitten would
be completely terrified and it would bite a man dude
freaked out and it wouldn't work so he has to
apply the love gently and that is what God is
doing with you it's giving you subtle clues it's been
giving you subtle clues your entire life the problem is
that you you are scared you're attached you're extremely selfish
and you're not conscious that any of this is going
on you just think you're living in some physical reality
you just think your life some some human that evolved
from some monkey that's just doing some dumb stuff in
the world and you you numb yourself out you numb
your consciousness by watching television playing video games you distract
yourself from your true mission here which is to become
more selfless surrender attachments give up your fears face your
fears and to open yourself up to love opening up
yourself up to love requires consciousness it must be done
consciously it's not enough to just go gorge yourself at
a buffet stuff yourself with greasy food it's not enough
to just go have a bunch of unconscious sex with
a bunch of people one-night stands it's not enough just
just go hoard a bunch of money on Wall Street
you need to consciously understand why selflessness is superior to
selfishness as you act more and more selfishly what happens
is that the selfishness starts to backfire on itself you
start to notice through trial and error that this selfish
way of living that you've been trying just doesn't produce
the fulfilment and happiness that you want that you know
is possible for you and so that forces you to
relinquish that selfish behavior and then to push yourself out
past your comfort zone beyond your fears into a higher
mode of being a more selfless mode of being and
you do that you get the reward of love and
the reward of being good and selfless which is its
own reward it is the highest reward there is no
higher reward in life than love just it's a question
of how deeply how deep is your love and how
how wide is your love the deeper and wider it
is the more of a reward it is until it
becomes infinite and at that point the reward becomes infinite
I've experienced states of infinite love that are so infinite
that I'm left writhing around on the floor in an
infinite orgasm these are orgasms that would make sexual orgasms
pale in comparison see the Godhead itself is as though
in an infinite orgasm forever because it's completely in love
with itself all the parts are completely fused and merged
into one seamless totality that's the Godhead it's infinite orgasmic
love forever imagine how good it is to have sex
with the most beautiful person you've ever seen pretty good
right now imagine you can keep having sex with that
person your favorite person forever forever with no limitation no
end and your orgasms have no limit completely unlimited unlimited
in degree in in depth in length in every dimension
unlimited and you can have as many of them as
you want you can string together as many of them
as you want until they turn into one continuous never-ending
orgasm that's one person now imagine that your consciousness becomes
so infinite that it stops discriminating between different people who
you could have sex with so you're now you're now
you're having sex not just with your favorite most beautiful
you know supermodel but you're having sex with every beautiful
supermodel who's ever lived but then your consciousness goes beyond
that it becomes even more loving more indiscriminate now you're
having sex not just with the supermodels but even with
the average looking people and then you become even more
selfless and you realize wait a minute why am i
limiting myself why don't I have an orgasm with every
living human who's ever lived on the entire planet no
matter what they look like and so you do that
and you're in the endless orgasm with all of them
and then you realize wait a minute why am I
only limiting myself to to the females let me also
include the males and so you include all of them
and then you realize wait a minute why am i
living myself to two humans why don't I have an
infinite orgasm with every single living being on this entire
planet wait a minute why am i living myself to
just living beings why don't I include the entire ecosystem
of this planet as well and so you merge into
that and then you say wait a minute why this
planet why not the solar system why not this the
Milky Way galaxy why not the entire universe why not
every single thing possible why don't I emerge every single
thing possible into one and I become it forever that's
true love that's infinity that's the Godhead you see but
to do that what would have to happen you'd have
to completely surrender everything about yourself you'd have to surrender
all of your criticisms all of your hatreds all of
your judgments all of your pettiness all of your ideas
all of your beliefs all of your ideology every group
of people you hate your racism your sexism your homophobia
you'd have to surrender everything and you have to surrender
your desire to to survive as a finite thing you'd
have to surrender your biological impulses you have to surrender
the desire for sex so the only one keeping you
from God is yourself and of course the only reason
that is is because you are God only God is
powerful enough to fool itself into believing that it's not
God and to keep itself from infinite love through fear
and through imagination and through dreaming and through illusion and
the reason God structured this entire thing this is not
an accident dissolved by design the reason it's designed this
way is because imagine if you were an unlimited omnipotent
all loving being and you had all the time in
the world and you could create and design anything what
would you create and what would you design what would
be the only worthwhile thing to create love what would
be the only worthwhile thing to share love so then
by that logic the only thing you would create is
that which maximizes the sharing of love in the universe
and the way you would do that is by creating
finite parts of yourself that don't remember the love that
are disconnected from the love such that then they can
experience the joy and the gift of discovering love so
the structure of the entire universe is designed such that
every living being discovers infinite love and that's what we
call death are you getting all this is it making
sense to you now why you're here precisely why you're
here I want you to understand why it is that
you're exactly where you are in your life and not
somewhere else you are where you are because you have
to be there and God completely understands why you are
where you are God is not separate from you God
is looking through your eyes right now stuck in that
limited frame of consciousness that you're stuck in and God
is trying to gently wake you up by sending you
little bits of love by by injecting you with some
passion and some desire notice what all of your desires
in your entire life have really been about what you've
really sought is you've sought a sense of completeness that's
really what you want in your life you don't really
want money you don't really want sex you don't really
want a fast car you don't want a big house
you don't want to live in another country all of
those things were just things you thought you needed in
order to feel whole and complete and at peace to
be satisfied to feel loved to love your own self
that's the only thing you've ever wanted you've wanted to
be unlimited and infinite so your entire life from your
very birth you've been searching for God not realizing that
he's right here he's right there see you've been pursuing
God God unconsciously and that can never work you can't
reach God unconsciously because God is infinite consciousness you see
you might say Willie oh but if God was so
loving why wouldn't God just create humans in such a
way that they would just instantly recognize God God can't
do that because that would be to force an unconscious
thing to be conscious that's impossible consciousness is the only
thing that can become conscious of itself so if you
don't realize that you're God and that you're loved and
that your infinite nobody else can because you're the only
thing there is you're it you have to awaken to
itself God has to awaken to itself stop thinking of
God as some other up there somewhere who's better than
you or higher than you or more powerful than you
it's you but you're stuck in your own self you
have to get over yourself in order to actualize yourself
as God and then it'll all be crystal clear and
you'll completely understand why it had to be this way
it makes complete and perfect sense it's a design of
the most brilliant order it's infinitely brilliant all of God's
intelligence is going towards awakening itself which is the same
thing as to say towards the sharing of its love
with all beings it's uh it's a lot of responsibility
to know this information because once you know this information
now you sort of realize your trajectory you understand what
all human development is about what all self-help is about
and it becomes very clear what your path should be
if you want to move towards God the problem is
that a lot of people love to distract themselves they
orbit around the center but they never they never move
their orbit towards the center you see there they're just
comfortable spiraling around and around and round forever and like
I said God can't force you to to move towards
the center you have to want to do it yourself
through your own recognizance you have to recognize that oh
I'm a [ __ ] idiot for staying out here
when I could be closer to the center and it
feels just like taking a rocket ship and flying straight
into the Sun in fact to make it even more
of a poignant metaphor imagine that you are a vampire
and we put you on a rocket ship and we
angle that rocket ship straight into the Sun and we
fired away how are you gonna feel as a vampire
you're gonna be terrified because sunlight is the thing you
fear the most and the closer you get to the
Sun the more light there's gonna be the more it's
gonna burn what is it going to do though it's
going to burn out all of your impurities all of
your selfishness all of your fear until eventually the rocket
ship will actually enter the Sun burn into it and
then you will merge and you will become one with
the Sun and you will radiate the light of the
Sun the infinite light of the Sun that's what life
is about and then the only question is how far
away are you from the center and then how how
willing are you to move towards the center and then
what are the action steps you got to do to
kind of close your orbit in closer and closer and
closer until eventually you you burn up into the Sun
and are you willing to do that at all because
I would probably estimate that 98% of humans are not
willing to actually go all the way to the singularity
they're willing to approach get closer and as you get
closer your life gets better and society gets nicer people
treat each other better but uh but that final step
to completely extinguish yourself into that singularity you're gone forever
you become nothingness forever you cease material existence that's that's
tall order most people are not willing to surrender absolutely
everything to get that and I'm not saying you should
you see because if I forced you to do it
if I guilted you just at all you're a bad
person because you don't want to go all the way
you don't want to kill yourself you don't want to
turn into God you're you're a devil is he fine
if I took this tack then I would be forcing
you and that wouldn't be right because I'm conscious enough
to understand that I can't force you to to enter
the singularity the only thing that can enter the singularity
is God itself so you will have to transform yourself
into God literal God to enter that singularity and the
only way you're gonna do that is through a gradual
process of development and growth and raising of your awareness
and consciousness and love so here's one very practical takeaway
I have for you from all this abstract metaphysical talk
how do you get rid of attachments how do you
fundamentally grow yourself at the highest level not by disciplining
yourself and forcing yourself to do stuff in life not
by telling yourself oh I have to read books all
I have to meditate all I have to do what
Leo says oh I have to watch another video oh
I have to go to the seminar I've to go
to this workshop I have to do this retreat I
have to do these psychedelics I have to do all
this stuff in order to get to someplace that Leo
talks about know that's that's a neurotic way of going
about it and it's not gonna get you all the
way if you want to get all the way the
way you get there is through love fill yourself with
the love that the world has denied you the love
that you didn't get from your parents from your siblings
from your teachers from your colleagues and friends from your
ex-partners and lovers and spouses from your failed projects from
your failed businesses from your failure to pursue money or
fame or success all that love that you fail to
get figure out how to give it to yourself and
as you do you're gonna become more and more satisfied
more and more of your needs are gonna get met
you're gonna become less and less needy less and less
selfish you're gonna recognize the power of love and goodness
and then you will then start to act that way
and as you start to act more loving and more
good you will attract more loving and better people around
you that love will create an echo chamber where the
love you broadcast out gets reflected back at you which
then just gives you more passion for love and then
you want to be even more loving more selfless and
it creates a positive feedback loop and in this way
you overcome all of your problems in life you move
towards the center and whether you ever reach the center
or not I don't know that's up to you if
you want to go that far but regardless just understand
that the process of self development is is moving towards
the center from the periphery this applies both individually and
collectively so individually for your personal life but also collectively
like we talked about spiral dynamics for example models such
as that what is fall dynamics but just society collectively
moving towards the singularity relinquishing more and more fear and
attachment that's all that these spiral stages are about relinquishing
fear detachment how do you really push fear one by
facing it and realizing that it's an illusion - by
facing it and letting it pummel you and letting it
burn and send you and burn out all your impurities
3 through love the more love you receive the less
fearful you're gonna be the only reason you're fearful of
stuff is because either people didn't give you the love
that you desired or you didn't know how to give
yourself the love that you needed so one of the
things I'll be emphasizing a lot in future content of
mine is how to fill yourself with the love that
the world denies you that is the crucial skill you
got to learn and I'll have much more to say
about that I'll have some practical exercises for you and
so forth but it's very possible to do and the
reason fundamentally that it's possible to do it is because
you are loved love is what you are so you
don't need love from the outside you just need to
remove the obstacles in your own mind which are preventing
you from generating your own love that's the real beauty
of this work that's what makes reality so wonderful is
that it's a nonzero-sum game in the sense that love
is infinite you are loved and so you're able to
give yourself the love that you crave you just have
to know how because if you go into this with
this attitude of like well yeah leo says I need
love but hey and then you tell your spouse hey
you're not giving me that love that leo says I
need so because of that now I'm like I'm gonna
act like an [ __ ] and I'm justified like
an [ __ ] because Leo says that I will
keep acting like an [ __ ] as long as
I don't get the love that you're supposed to give
me no you don't get it you got to take
responsibility for giving yourself the love that your spouse or
your parents or your boss or your coworkers are not
giving you because if you're expecting others to give you
infinite love bellow of God well you're you're always going
to fail you're always gonna keep going around around the
circle because the whole point of realizing infinite love is
to realize that it's you infinite love is not something
separate from you it's completely your nature it's more you
than the molecules that are making up the cells in
your body that's what you got to realize I want
you to think about what your life would look like
if you no longer were selfish if you no longer
approached it from the frame of what's in it for
me in every situation so you enter a relationship or
a marriage it's no longer about what can she do
for me what can he get for me you go
into a business it's no longer about what can my
customers earn me so I can buy a big house
for me and my family when you go to school
it's not about what can I learn how can I
make myself the smartest person in the world but it's
like how this be about me being selfless and so
on in every situation in your life imagine if you
were selfless imagine if you had no needs imagine if
you were able to love and to exude and radiate
love in every situation in your life imagine how you
would feel imagine what that might look like imagine what
things you'd have to surrender to achieve this imagine what
fears you have right now would need to be faced
and conquered imagine what attachments you have right now where
you need life to be this way or you need
this person to be that way or he to control
this situation here imagine what you would have to let
go of in order to be loving in all these
situations that is a vision of your future should you
choose to pursue love you don't have to you can
keep being selfish but also recognize that as you're being
selfish you're creating your own suffering it's not that the
world is inherently full of suffering and pain no it's
that the way that you are living in the world
and the attachments you have and the way that you
insist things must be for you to be happy that
is what's creating your misery and suffering so the real
question is what do you have to let go of
that you're not willing to let go of that you're
clinging to in order to free yourself to be selfless
loving good and happy that's the secret to happiness and
now it's very apparent why most people around us are
not happy that they're just pretending because who amongst us
is really willing to undergo this process to a deep
degree and really willing to surrender a whole giant chunk
of themselves very few people are you willing to surrender
99 percent of your attachments cravings beliefs judgements criticisms habits
no you're completely attached all that stuff which is why
you keep suffering and your life keeps being as frustrating
as it always was and this is difficult work it's
not easy it's not easy to surrender this stuff not
at all and sometimes I makes me doubt how far
I'm gonna go on this journey because sometimes I see
you know what a fuel what if what a full
realization of my potential would be like and it's terrifying
it's terrifying how much stuff I would have to give
up there are so many you know petty things that
I want to cling to it's terrifying but that's also
what makes life so real this is real work here
learning how to love the world and oneself is the
only work in the universe of any value so what's
really going on with the universe is that the universe
is learning how to love itself that's all that's happening
God is training itself to love itself with the ultimate
conclusion being that once God has fully trained itself to
love itself it becomes its highest form which is just
love and God and everything that I've explained here that
is what God is it's not merely what God is
doing it's not merely God's plan it's not merely God's
designed for humans that is the structure of the universe
that is the structure of God that is the very
manifestation an epitome of love love is not just some
substance love is both the substance of the universe consciousness
but love is also the structure of it the fact
that the substance is being used to create structures which
then help every part of the field of consciousness to
recognize itself as love that is the very definition and
expression and manifestation of love to love is to help
others to love to love is to not leave anyone
behind without love is to create a reality in which
every piece of reality gets to participate in the highest
form of love by making sure it will go through
the ultimate reunification now how many lifetimes it takes you
to reach this ultimate reunification I don't know it's gonna
vary person to person being to being it might take
you a hundred lifetimes I don't know it might just
take you one it depends on how selfless and fearless
you are if you're totally selfless and fearless you can
do it in one lifetime but if you're resisting and
you're selfish and you had a bad childhood and you're
being lazy about it then you can keep orbiting around
for four lifetime and lifetime in life time playing all
sorts of games and it's God's love to allow you
to do that because you see if God forced you
to relinquish all of your fantasies and dreams and games
and hallucinations that wouldn't be very loving you have to
come to God God is not going to come to
you that's the mistake that many materialists and atheists and
scientists make is they think oh well God will just
we'll just uh cost me if God if God exists
God will just accost me and you know despite all
my skepticism in my closed mindedness God will just thrust
himself into my mind no it can't be that way
because you are God you have to open your own
mind to the fact that you're God and then that
creates some space and some possibility so there you go
that's the structure of all of life hope everything is
clear for you now now you have all the answers
now all you got to do is you got to
go actualize it easy right all right I'm done here
please click that like button for me come check out
my website you'll find my blog with exclusive content exclusive
videos you'll find the forum you'll find the book list
you'll find my life purpose course the final thing I'll
say is this I think it was Einstein has a
famous quote where he said something like the most incomprehensible
thing about the universe is that it's comprehensible that's a
very good quote one of the things that's astounded me
the most in all of my awakenings is just the
fact that I have been able to achieve infinite degrees
of understanding some enlightenment teachers will poopoo the idea of
understanding and they will say oh you don't need understanding
that's just a that's just a function of the ego
mind just you know sit in silence and meditate or
whatever or southern fire understanding is some sort of illusion
no I'm what I'm here to tell you is that
no understanding is not an illusion consciousness the very nature
of consciousness is that it's capable of infinite self understanding
and since you are consciousness you are capable of infinite
self understanding and it's it's very sad it's very sad
a sad state of affairs that you are going through
life without ever experiencing infinite self understanding the universe understands
itself completely your job is to connect with that understanding
as a human your human mind can connect with the
mind of God they can merge into into one such
that then everything becomes clear to you you understand why
things are happening the way they're happening it's an amazing
achievement so don't let people tell you that understanding is
worthless or understanding is impossible or understanding is something that
the Eagle mind is doing no there is a certain
logical structure to reality and to God you can cog
NIH's it you can understand it and the reason you
can is because you're unlimited and any limits you have
they're they're completely a function of your own imagination it's
just a question of becoming more and more conscious and
unraveling layers and layers of your imagination because your imagination
goes very deep all the way to the rock-bottom of
physical reality itself which is also imaginary something you're imagining
but unaware of how you're doing so you can unravel
that entire thing and you can get to the bottom
of it and you can get access to incredible insights
and understanding and wisdom which then you can use to
restructure your entire life and then you can become as
we talked about superhuman you
