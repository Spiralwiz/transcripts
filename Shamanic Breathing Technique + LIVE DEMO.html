I want to share a really powerful healing technique with
you healing through briefing psychotherapy through breathing and even tripping
just through breathing breath is a really powerful tool a
really powerful spiritual tool but also just for therapy and
just for healing and most people they don't know how
much healing they have to do and how much their
emotional blockages are holding them up so this technique that
I'm going to show you here today is really good
at releasing emotional blockages that are deeply wired inside your
subconscious mind most people don't even know that they're there
you'll be surprised at what you'll discover by practicing this
technique very very powerful and it doesn't take years like
with meditation to get somewhere you will have incredible results
just after one or two trials that's how powerful it
is now the technique I'm going to be sharing with
you is sort of my own bastardization and my own
little invention that I was experimenting with based off of
the work of Stan Grof now stan grof is a
really interesting character he is an MD and also a
psychiatrist and a psychologist who is a one of the
founding fathers of transpersonal psychology and he was really instrumental
in the 1950s and early 1960s in doing the first
clinical trials of LSD he was sort of one of
the few early pioneers in clinical psychology and psychedelics and
pioneering how to use psychedelics specifically for helping very disturbed
people psychotic people schizophrenic people suicidally depressive people and you
know the whole gamut of problems that people have so
he started to do these trials and this was in
the 1950s and 60s where psychedelics were still legal and
we didn't really know what LSD was so he was
experimenting and trying all this stuff out and he administered
LSD in a clinical setting to hundreds probably thousands of
patients and he took meticulous notes and archived everything and
just did a whole study and for him his entire
paradigm was blown because he was a he was a
doctor a researcher he was in academic he was from
that field of that whole kind of materialistic Western pet
rationals paradigm but the things he was discovering with all
these LSD treatments that he was giving people that people
were coming back and they were telling him about all
sorts of crazy stuff that they were seeing on LSD
they were having near-death experiences and out-of-body experiences and spiritual
experiences and all sorts of trauma because these very disturbed
individuals as it turns out of course no big surprise
that they're so disturbed because they had a lot of
trauma in their childhood and a lot of it they
might have even forgotten about they didn't even know some
of them had trauma during childbirth and they didn't even
remember that but then when they sort of taken this
LSD a lot of this stuff started coming out their
shadow started coming out and that proved to be very
therapeutic for them but then of course the government cracked
down in the late 60s because of this sort of
hippie counterculture revolution the abuse of psychedelics the government crackdown
and all psychedelics were outlawed and of course that meant
that as a legitimate researcher and a academic clinical setting
he could no longer do LSD research so he had
to stop and that was a great shame that set
us back that's the humanity back a good 50 to
100 years that was a huge shame but he was
so moved by his discoveries that he wanted to invent
some alternative a substitute how can we find a substitute
that doesn't require people to go look for psychedelics and
he invented holotropic breathwork so that's his technique he actually
coined the term politics is method he trains practitioners there's
workshops that are held around the world and in particular
in California around the United States but they're available all
over the world where you can go to these workshops
and it's done in a group and people sit there
in that workshop for a couple hours and they do
this deep breathing and so it's it's a sort of
lying on the floor doing this deep breathing in and
out in and out until you start to experience psychedelic
like effects and it's very very powerful and if you
watch some videos online if some of this type of
holotropic breathwork like crazy [ __ ] goes on in
these sessions the deep breathing is done for such a
long time for an hour or two or even three
that it completely sends the person into this altered state
where they can be lying on the floor writhing around
as though they are possessed by a demon like this
[ __ ] is scary it doesn't happen everybody like
that but to some people it happens you can go
to some pretty wacky and far-out places just by doing
this breath work so these workshops are available and I
encourage you if you're curious about that and you want
to experience this very deep therapeutic process in a group
setting where you have a lot of support because it
needs a lot of support for emotional you know for
emotional assistant because a lot of emotions comes up then
go ahead and try it out research you can you
can read about it on his website you can find
these workshops and try that out but of course you
know I like to do solo personal development work so
although these workshops are great and I do go to
workshops various kinds and I do go to seminars I
do learn from people and group settings and those can
be very illuminating but I like techniques that I can
do completely solo so I'm not reliant on some facilitator
or having to go somewhere to do something so what
I sort of did is I came up with my
own variation that I do at home and that's what
I'm be sharing with you here I don't call it
holotropic breathwork that's stan grof thing that's his word what
I'm gonna be showing you here we can call it
shamanic breathing I'm gonna share this technique with you but
before I do a couple of things need to be
said first is that people consistently underestimate the power of
the breath they think the breath is just like olio
breath breath everybody just breathes every but he no how's
it breathe you know how can you possibly get some
sort of deep healing or some kind of psychedelic LSD
like state from just breathing well that's because you haven't
really practiced deep breathing breathing is something that needs to
be mastered and in fact I'll be releasing some episodes
in the future just about how to breathe properly that's
a whole topic onto itself here I'm not gonna get
into all the different facets of briefing we're just gonna
show you this technique but what you need to understand
is that breath is integrally linked to the function of
your mind and your body and in many languages the
words breath and spirit are actually coming from the same
root and they're at Amala G goes back thousands of
years and there's a good reason for why breath and
spirit are synonymous in a sense because the breath was
used in many spiritual traditions going back thousands of years
for accessing spiritual realms of course the best example of
this is yoga and the pranayama that is done within
yoga but also other traditions shamanism there are many different
versions of shamanism out there and I'll be releasing an
episode about shamanism as well soon but shamanism also relies
on breathing it can not not all shamanistic modalities but
many of them do so the breath can be used
for shutting off the mind the breath is one of
the most effective methods you have for shutting down your
monkey mind if you're one of those people who can't
stop to think overly conceptual like I am you're always
thinking about stuff and you're a DD and all this
then learning breathing techniques can be really powerful for that
it can help your meditation breathing is also very effective
for emotional healing and psychotherapy because something happens when you
breathe very deeply you get a lot of oxygen into
your brain and into your body and then all of
your tension and all the deeply-held emotional trauma that you've
had in your life all of that it's residing and
it's held in your body that starts to get released
and that can be very therapeutic it can be more
powerful than years of psychotherapy with with some sort of
psychiatrist and it can be more powerful than psychiatric medication
and what's really cool about it is that it actually
gets to the root of the issues and it releases
them without you necessarily having to consciously work through that
stuff so you're sort of you're getting massive benefits and
at the same time you're not having to think through
too much of it so it's it's a great way
for releasing trauma it can release trauma that otherwise you
would never be able to release just through journaling or
just through contemplation it can be good for opening up
chakras the breath can be used for pumping energy into
your body for warming up your body and just getting
yourself more awake and alert the breath can be used
for accessing altered states of consciousness and ultimately the breath
can be used for accessing non-duality and having even enlightenment
experiences so there's a lot to this thing that's simple
on the surface this breath but if there's a lot
to it so this breathing technique that I'm going to
show you is for home use but you have to
be very careful so I got to issue some warnings
here and I'm not kidding around because this technique is
so powerful that you have to heed these warnings it's
extremely powerful it can cause hallucinations it can cause panic
attacks it can cause outbursts of Rage anger it can
cause immense fear even terror fear of death you might
encounter your own death you might start to feel like
you're dying you will surface deep emotions and trauma with
this technique almost guaranteed if you practice this technique this
will happen and depending on your background this can cause
a real problem for you because if you've been abused
if you have sexual abuse physical abuse if you've been
bull you know all sorts of trauma and sometimes it's
minor trauma sometimes maybe major trauma this stuff will start
to surface that's why it's healing that's why it's therapeutic
but that can also be dangerous because then people get
freaked out because this stuff is surfacing but they don't
know how to deal with it which is why in
the Stan Grof holotropic breathwork you're in a group environment
and you have facilitators who are helping you to deal
with the emotions with with the trauma when you're at
home and you're doing this well it's sort of like
you're tripping at home on LSD there's nobody to help
you so you got to be able to be mature
enough to handle any emotions or any kind of trauma
that comes up so be careful about that I also
got to warn you that money you might experience out-of-body
experiences which are very profound and utterly shocking and mind-blowing
and you won't know how to deal with it and
even this this breathing technique can be physically dangerous if
you misuse it if you strain yourself too much or
if you have some kind of medical conditions or psychological
conditions this could destabilize you so you got to be
careful in fact I have to issue this warning by
using this technique you are agreeing that I'm not legally
responsible for any physical or psychological harm that you may
cause yourself you agree to breathe and do this technique
easy and gradually gradually ramping up and increasing your time
and not to over strain yourself do not do this
technique if you are pregnant if you are mentally unstable
if you have breathing problems if you have heart problems
or if you have some kind of other special unique
disability or physical condition or disease you know be smart
about this but if you're a normal individual don't let
this freak you out you're gonna start gradually and you
can see how you handle it it's not gonna be
too bad and then you can experiment with it and
see where it goes so here's the technique for shamanic
breathing first you want to clear out your sinuses so
go blow your nose go to the rest so you
don't need to do that while you're in the middle
of this session you're not going to be interrupting it
for 30 whole minutes and drink some water to moisten
your mouth and your throat because you're gonna be breathing
through your mouth also I recommend you get some chapstick
and you apply it to your lips especially the corners
of your mouth here because you will be breathing through
your mouth for a whole thirty minutes straight and so
your mouth can get dry your lips can get dry
and have problems so do that then create a comfortable
space on your floor get a nice flat carpet or
something that you can lay out on lots of space
so you can stretch out your arms and your legs
with no obstructions and nothing that could you could bump
your head into or hurt yourself and then spread out
a blanket or something comfortable and some pillows that you
can lie on the floor so you can be lying
flat on the floor and you're going to be doing
the breathing there so get yourself comfortable then get a
timer and set it for thirty minutes that's what you're
going to start with and then later you can increase
that to longer durations but start with thirty minutes and
I recommend playing some music of course you can play
different kinds of music what's most recommended is some kind
of relaxing yoga type of music or meditation type of
music or perhaps even better is a drumming type of
music tribal drumming so you can go online find some
tribal drumming so make sure you got that and start
your timer and then as you start your timer you
can just start breathing as you're laying there comfortably relax
your whole body you can be laying on the floor
and then you just start breathing through your mouth and
the breathing is very simple but there are a couple
of rules what you got to do is you got
to breathe equally in and out for the same amount
of time I'll show you in a second and you
got to make sure that there's no pause between your
breaths so it's gonna look something like this not like
this you notice the difference the first time I was
doing it there was no pause as soon as I
breathe fully in I then breathe fully out and as
soon as I breathe fully out I breathe fully in
so it's just continuous without stop and of course you
want to make sure you're not just breathing into your
chest but also down into your belly you're gonna do
that non-stop for 30 minutes it's important though that as
you do this you don't go too quickly and you
don't overstrain yourself so here would be an example of
going too quickly don't do that pace yourself slowly like
that and also don't breathe so deeply in or so
completely out that you hurt yourself like don't fill up
your your lungs in your belly completely like not like
this don't over exaggerate it don't strain your muscles and
also don't breathe out so much that you completely empty
everything just nice and steady and consistent and deep but
not strained relax to relax your whole body stretch out
your arms like this and your legs so you're kind
of like laying on the floor like a starfish and
that's it and you do that until your timer rings
and that's the whole technique incredible stuff will start to
happen after the 10 minute mark after the 10 minute
mark it's gonna get quite difficult to keep doing the
technique your mouths gonna get tired your throat is gonna
get tired you're gonna feel that your head is starting
to spin because your Sajid oxygenating your your brain and
your body so much you're gonna start to feel tingling
in your fingers and in your extremities and then by
the 20 minute mark this is gonna get even more
pronounced and more pronounced and by the 30 minute mark
you're gonna be in a state that you've never experienced
ever in your life under any situation it's gonna be
completely unique it's gonna be sort of like a psychedelic
but still different you're gonna feel very different for me
personally I mean I can't speak to how it's gonna
feel for you but for me personally it was like
really weird stuff happens I stopped being able to feel
my fingers everything is tingling sometimes my arms and hands
get numb my my feet and and legs get numb
and there's this sort of like pins and needles sensation
sort of like your arms or your legs are falling
asleep you start to get that but now it's happening
because you have too much oxygen in your body your
brain starts to tingle and stuff starts to move and
it's just like you're experiencing this altered state and it's
really interesting and it's gonna involve both your mental domain
but also your physical domain and it's all gonna be
kind of like blending together the physical and the mental
these boundaries are gonna start to be breaking apart and
it's not all necessarily going to be pleasant it can
be extremely pleasant but it can also be challenging because
you feel like you have all this energy in your
body that's kind of shifting around and moving you have
this kind of burning sensation in your muscles and like
we're just really weird you feel really weird and you
want to like why they're out on the floor you
might start to experience emotions coming up you might start
to experience weird memories from the past coming up maybe
traumatic memories maybe happy memories you might become emotional and
you know the full spectrum of emotions as possible from
ecstasy to to pleasure to excitement to frustration to agitation
to anger to fear curling up into a ball into
the fetal position you know you might have itching and
burning and clawing and you might start speaking in voices
you might start crying all sorts of weird stuff could
happen so be ready for that be especially ready for
old trauma to surface emotional stuff to surface the key
there is you just want to after your thirty minutes
are over you just want to lay there for a
good 10 20 minutes on the floor and just be
mindful of how your body feels so after your 30
minutes is over for the next 10 minutes you're gonna
be in this altered state and it's gonna be very
powerful so just watch it reach its peak and then
watch it slowly taper out and come down so after
about 10 or 20 minutes if you're slaying on the
floor eventually gonna come back back back down to baseline
if you have watched my episode called the dark side
of meditation you want to make sure you go watch
that before you try this technique it's gonna prepare you
for all the stuff that's going to come up in
that episode I talked about the kind of dark stuff
that can come up for from meditation and so this
technique is gonna give you exactly that it's sort of
an accelerated version of meditation imagine you take a year
of meditation you cram it into 30 minutes that's sort
of what you're gonna be getting here and so of
course all the same sort of side effects can come
up and you need to know the possibilities so they
don't freak you out and take you by surprise and
you also need to know how to deal with them
so I talked about that in that episode how do
you deal with them it's actually very simple you just
do nothing you just lay there and you just are
mindful of it and you let it happen without resistance
surrender to it don't resist don't hold back don't tell
yourself it's wrong don't judge yourself none of this sort
of stuff all right you have to reframe any negative
emotions that come up or any kind of disturbance that
comes up or any trauma as a good thing that
is what's telling you that it's working that how therapy
works therapy doesn't work with you going into a therapists
office and just sitting there and talking and just talking
about positive stuff that's not therapy therapy is you going
in there talking about all your deepest darkest secrets and
all the skeletons in your closet all the stuff you
did wrong all the stuff you hate about yourself all
the ugly stuff all the shadow stuff so of course
that's also gonna happen here just without the therapist and
without all the talking you need to appreciate that understand
that and not overreact to it that would be the
mistake he's so sure saying oh my god I was
abused as a child and this thing happened to me
and that thing happening no just accept it allow it
forgive yourself love yourself and you'll be good and understand
that whatever state you're in whatever trauma you're having if
you're feeling sad or angry or whatever understand that that's
gonna pass it's probably gonna last for a good 10
20 minutes and it's gonna pass it might last for
a few days if you had some very deep trauma
might last for a few days but it'll pass you've
got to remind yourself it's gonna pass and once it
passes you will have healed that wound within yourself that's
psychological wound that emotional wound and then from that point
on you'll be operating on a higher baseline psychologically your
consciousness will slightly rise as a baseline you'll be at
a new baseline of consciousness probably not drastically new you're
not gonna become enlightened but you're probably gonna be a
little bit a little bit more calm a little bit
less neurotic this is how neurosis leaves your psychosomatic system
neurosis is wired in the mind but also in the
whole body and this is what you're doing you're releasing
it you're purging it you're literally exercising these demons and
you might have some really deep demons that need to
be exorcised so don't be surprised if some weird [
__ ] goes down that's okay don't judge yourself and
also I'll warn you expect an ego backlash to happen
the day after and the week after doing one of
these sessions by ego backlash I mean that you're gonna
now reach a sort of a new state of awareness
but then the ego wants to kick back kick you
back into your old way of being so homeostasis kicks
back in and so your mind will try to drag
you back down so be careful about that and make
sure to just stay mindful of the ego backlash this
technique is great as a supplement to your meditation practice
although I wouldn't say it's a replacement it's a good
supplement it's also a great supplement if you're doing psychedelics
again I wouldn't say it's a replacement it's not identical
to psychedelics psychedelics are very powerful and I highly recommend
them for people who are serious about growing themselves and
becoming conscious but this is a great supplement one of
the reasons it's a particularly great supplement to psychedelics is
because with psychedelics before you can get to the really
profound insights about the nature of all of reality and
God and existence and all this sort of stuff before
you can have those deep enlightenment experiences first usually with
psychedelics you have to deal with your emotional trauma and
baggage and for many people they have so much of
this baggage that a psychedelic is too powerful it's too
much it freaks them out so with this breathing technique
because you have more control over it you can stop
at any time you want you can use this technique
to purge a lot of trauma and emotional stuff do
that for a few months maybe and then you can
try psychedelics and then you'll be ready for going to
the very deep existential insights on psychedelics so that's it
for the technique now I want to show you an
actual live demo of how I do this obviously not
the full 30 minutes but here you go here's a
live demo of how to do this breathing and how
to set up your your situation there all right so
here we are for the demo of this shamanic breathing
as you can see I've laid out a nice open
clear space here for the breathing session I put a
comforter down here that's what this is just to make
it more comfortable because I mean lying here for 30
minutes or 60 minutes or 90 minutes and let's begin
it's real simple I have a timer here so I'll
set 30 minutes on my timer and put that over
there and then you want to have a blanket and
some pillows just make yourself as comfortable as you can
this is all about comfort you don't need to be
austere here and you're gonna want to turn your lights
down so it's comfortable you could even use some sort
of mood lighting or candle light which is nice and
then you'd want to play your your drumming music I'm
not going to play that now I just want to
show you the breathing technique and how I kind of
lay myself down so arms out legs out just very
comfortable you can close your eyes and then you start
your timer and here's what the breathing will look like
and that's it I'm already starting to feel a little
bit lightheaded and dizzy of course that's only uh less
than a minute and you'll be doing that for a
thirty or sixty or ninety minutes straight without stopping it
is quite challenging even doing thirty minutes for the first
time is difficult you might need to start with only
fifteen minutes or 20 minutes and then ultimately work up
to thirty that's kind of what I remember doing and
there you go not really much to it do that
for a few weeks do that for a month until
you're you're comfortable thirty minutes then ramped it up to
forty minutes 50 minutes 60 minutes try to get beyond
sixty minutes you can even go up to ninety minutes
and even beyond that just be careful especially when you're
getting into the 60 minute 90-minute ranges be very careful
because you're gonna get be getting into very deep states
and since you're doing it solo you're not quite sure
what's gonna come up make sure that you can handle
whatever's coming up so as you're doing this you want
to ramp yourself up gradually the same way that you
would with psychedelics all right and also I recommend that
do this on the weekends when you don't have a
lot of obligations give yourself a day of integration time
after this stuff happens especially if you do a very
deep and long 90-minute session you probably don't want to
be going to work the next day on some important
project early in the morning because emotional stuff will come
up you'll have weird dreams you might wake up crying
or or screaming or afraid or happy or whatever you
know who knows what's happening so just give yourself time
probably the best time to do these sessions would be
on Saturdays speak which let me give you three different
ways that you can use this technique how you can
structure it into your schedule so the first way is
commit to doing it once per week for an entire
year sort of the way that you would do therapy
or life coaching you would do it on a weekly
basis so this is sort of your own private way
to do psychotherapy on yourself in a physical integrated way
not just through talking so you commit to and you
just do it once let's say you do it every
Saturday for the next year that's 52 sessions and then
over time you know you're gonna build it up to
90 minutes plus or whatever that can be really powerful
after a whole year of doing that if you're like
the ordinary person I would pretty much be willing to
bet that you're gonna walk away a year from now
you are gonna have a much more stable psyche you're
gonna purge a lot of old anger and fear and
judgment and just all sorts of neuroses and tension from
your body that that's been stuck there for a long
long time you're gonna you're gonna be a brand new
person a year from now just from using this technique
especially if you are someone who has a lot of
trauma and emotional baggage that you have not worked through
yet this can be a life-saving technique potentially for you
life transforming a second way to do it is to
do it once per day for an entire week so
you're gonna say okay this week it's kind of like
Shark Week Shark Week instead of instead of Shark Week
this is breath week shamanic reading week and so every
day you're gonna be doing one of these sessions and
then of course after a whole week of that then
you want to give yourself time to relax maybe take
a few weeks off and then do another week so
under this scheduling scenario maybe you spend one week per
month doing this sort of process and the third option
and perhaps the most powerful is to cram it all
into one day so the way you do this and
this is similar to what they do with the holotropic
breathwork workshops is they do three of these sessions per
day so here what you would do is first you
would build yourself up to like a long 90-minute session
make sure you can handle that then you would schedule
and take a whole day off nothing but breathing work
for this day in the same way you would if
you were tripping on LSD you would take the whole
day off basically can't do anything it takes all day
so here what you would do is you would do
a morning session of 90 minutes then you take a
couple hours break eat a light breakfast or whatever after
your breathing is done take a take an hour to
to relax to integrate to work through the emotions and
stuff then in the afternoon you do another 90-minute session
then take another couple hours off have a light meal
dah dah dah do that stuff integrate and then finally
the third session in the evening ninety minutes in the
evening and that will be all of it packed into
one day and that can be very powerful so in
this scenario you're getting the most concentrated potent version of
this you're probably gonna release a lot of emotional stuff
so you definitely want to make sure that you have
the next day off so do this on a Saturday
for example if Sunday is all for you and and
there you go and of course you want to give
yourself plenty of time after that to relax so take
a couple of weeks off and then maybe maybe do
one of these one of these really intense days every
two weeks or every month and that can be sort
of your way of growing yourself add this in with
all the other stuff you're doing so don't replace meditation
you still want to maintain your daily meditation practice still
maintain your self inquiry practice maintain other practices this is
more of a sort of a potent you know one
time shot sort of deal that you do on a
weekly or monthly basis lastly I will just recommend that
you actually go and try out some of the holotropic
breathwork workshops if they're available in your area definitely try
it out it's a different situation when you're doing it
at the workshop you're doing it with a group of
people all simultaneously you're being guided they play certain types
of music for you they give you special instructions there's
special food so the whole thing kind of comes together
in the sort of retreat situation which is unique and
different than what you're doing at home there's gonna be
pros and cons and you might find well you almost
definitely will find that at the workshop it's gonna go
deeper the only challenge is that you got to you
got to go find the workshop it has to be
in your area you have to pay for it there
only happening a couple times a year so the scheduling
of it and its availability might be limited so check
out online what's available in your area if you're in
the United States if you're in California should be easier
if you're in Europe I think they have some options
in Europe and other places you're probably gonna be out
of luck but try it out and just compare for
yourself and see what works I think you'll you'll gain
valuable lessons from doing it in a group environment you'll
see the kind of stuff that's happening with people crazy
stuff will be happening all around you in one of
these workshops that you probably won't see at home with
yourself and that in and of itself will be will
be very eye-opening for you so that's basically it please
click the like button for me and come check out
actualize that org that's my website I got resources and
cool goodies for you there I've got exclusive stuff that
I post in my blog check that out the forum
has unique content as well and you can contribute and
ask questions and stuff and get help also check out
the life purpose course check out the book list that
I have lots of good resources there and lastly just
stick around and start doing this technique start focusing in
all of my episodes when I tell you a technique
that is your gateway to the results it's not all
the stuff I talk about the theory I talk about
is not gonna get you real results it's a necessary
step but it's not gonna really get you the life
transforming results that comes from doing the technique and this
particular technique might be especially good if you're stuck in
your mind if you're a very rationalist person if you're
a scientifically minded person if you're an atheist and you
don't believe in all this New Age mumbo Joe all
this Airy fairy whoohoo stuff start doing this technique it's
very simple there's nothing whoo-hoo about it but you might
be surprised at how much it opens your eyes and
opens your mind to a new set of possibilities because
you are gonna start tripping just from oxygen alone and
you will start to experience some very weird stuff which
is gonna start to break down your materialist paradigm your
rationalist paradigm and that's gonna be an important first step
for you you see because when I talk about mystical
experiences and I talk about God and I talk about
spirit and I talk about soul and this and that
the this language to most people this language falls on
deaf ears because you need to have a reference experience
for what that word is talking about and most people
they don't have a reference experience for it so of
course what they do is they say Oh Leo this
is just some sort of fluffy nonsense so sort of
unscientific nonsense no it's not unscientific at all you just
need to have the reference experience we're talking about altered
states of consciousness and if you haven't had one of
those well I feel sorry for you and I want
you to start to have those so do whatever you
can to start having those having these experiences is one
of the most important factors for starting to do really
deep growth and even if you're doing this breathing technique
and it doesn't get you some mystical mystical state you'll
just start to experience energetic and therapeutic healing which in
and of itself will start to open up your mind
you will start to experience dimensions of life facets of
life that are beyond the rational beyond the logical and
you will see the power of working with your body
you will see the power of energy blockages and how
significant that is to your happiness into your success in
your to your well-being and then you will start to
reassess your whole perspective will change on some of these
more advanced techniques the biggest challenge I have with presenting
advanced spiritual techniques or personal development techniques to people is
that most people will not do them because they cannot
believe that they will work because they sound so hokey
so simple and so stupid that a scientific rational assigned
will never accept that this could really work so how
do you overcome that problem by actually doing it put
your money where your mouth is stop being a lazy
atheist or a lazy rationalist or a lazy armchair scientist
thinking that you know everything just because you you read
some scientific theories you know you don't know anything you
got to start to do these techniques to actually experience
how little you really know and that will be a
great launching point for your whole journey into self-actualization and
stick around with me for more because I'll be presenting
more of these sorts of techniques to you as I
discover them in the future you
