            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/gdWxdhEB19s' target='_blank'>Guided Exercise For Realizing You Are God</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Guided Exercise for Realizing You Are God</b>: This section introduces a hands-on, practical exercise that requires full attention. Its aim is to guide participants in the deconstruction of their mind and reality. Unlike Leos usual abstract and theoretical content, this episode is more experiential.
</li><li><b>Potential Shifts in Consciousness</b>: Engaging in this exercise might lead to shifts in consciousness or even mystical experiences. It could be overwhelming for some, potentially leading to existential crises, especially for those who might be mentally unstable.
</li><li><b>From Abstract to Actual Practice</b>: While Leos work often dwells on conceptual, abstract, and theoretical aspects, this exercise aims to shift the focus to actual spiritual practices. This highlights the importance of moving spirituality beyond the realm of theories and ideas. 
</li><li><b>Objective - Realize You Are God</b>: The ultimate objective of the exercise is to facilitate the realization that you are God. This might initially be difficult to grasp given the transformation in consciousness required. However, even partial understanding can provide valuable guidance for future realization.
</li><li><b>Awareness of God</b>: Participants are encouraged to become aware of their own ideas and notions about God and make a mental note of them. They are then guided towards grounding themselves in their present experience, focusing on their immediate environment and the sensations in their bodies.
</li><li><b>Experience vs Concept of God</b>: Participants are asked to become aware of the difference between their ideas of God and their physical reality, using their hand as an example. This real, physical, conscious experience they are having in that moment, including everything within their awareness, is what is meant by God  not the abstract or religious ideas they might hold.
</li><li><b>Stripping Conceptual Baggage</b>: Participants are invited to strip all the conceptual baggage that they have created in order to explain their present experience, God, and reality. The aim is to have them fully recognize their immediate experience for what it is by removing all constructed stories about it.
</li><li><b>Deconstructing Stories</b>: To assist in realizing the profoundness of God, the exercise includes deconstructing ideas and stories about Earth. Participants are encouraged to acknowledge that their ideas about Earth are just concepts and stories. 
</li><li><b>Resistance from the Mind</b>: The challenge of this exercise is that, as the mind's stories are deconstructed, the mind will attempt to construct new stories to replace the old ones or justify keeping them. It's noted that this is because the mind fears being lost without these stories.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction of mind to understand reality</b>: Leo encourages listeners to participate in a conscious deconstruction of mind. This involves purging preconceived narratives, beginning with the idea of Planet Earth, and extending to scientific explanations for existence like the Big Bang. This raw mysterious experience without explanations is prioritized over narratives. 
</li><li><b>Question the concept of a physical scientific world</b>: Leo urges viewers to doubt standard scientific models and believes such as the existence of molecules, atoms, and quantum mechanics when observing their hands. He argues that these are not direct experiences, but rather something projected onto the direct experience of seeing color and shape.
</li><li><b>Removing biological notions</b>: Leo proposes taking a radical step by detaching from the notion of biology. He points out that direct experiences such as seeing do not provide evidence of being a part of a biological animal. He calls out the underlying scientific explanation that our experiences are generated by physical brainwork as mere a narrative. 
</li><li><b>Further segregation of experiences and body</b>: Leo continues the extraction process by prompting viewers to disregard the idea of the human body. He proposes that viewers perceive their bodies as separate elements, rather than one cohesive unit.
</li><li><b>Questioning birth and life's timeline</b>: Leo proposes to viewers the ideation that the timeline of life, the concept of birth, is another narrative to be discarded. He suggests considering existence as constant, independent of beginnings and ends. This acceptance creates a mysterious experience, leaving viewers speechless and appreciating the profundity of existence. 
</li><li><b>The astounding fact of existence</b>: Leo concludes the process by encouraging audience to focus on the fact of existence. After stripping away all preconceived ideas and notions, he emphasizes the mystery and profoundness of the simple act of existence. Such a direct acceptance of reality, he suggests, imbues life with a deeper, richer meaning.
</li><li><b>Concept of God and present consciousness</b>: Leo Gura pushes the viewers to observe and deeply ponder over their present state of consciousness. He insists that when he talks about God he refers to the actual conscious experience individuals have in the moment. He wants us to understand that our consciousness isn't limited to us, but includes everything that is within our awareness.
</li><li><b>Removal of preconceived ideas about life</b>: The lecturer asks us to get rid of the idea that our hand, or we, as a conceptual individual, are part of a living organism. He highlights that life, as we conventionally understand it, is a notion assumed and projected over our reality. He calls for a drastic change in perspective where we don't see our existence within the span of time.
</li><li><b>Denouncement of human history</b>: Gura instructs us to discard our assuming human lineage and history because none of it is a part of our direct conscious experience. He argues that history, as we understand it, is merely stories and projections with no real presence in our direct consciousness.
</li><li><b>Challenge of the concept of time</b>: Gura challenges the traditional concepts of time and aging. He scrutinizes the deeply ingrained notion of linear time and argues that this is merely an overlay that we project on our present experiences. He urges the viewer to perceive motion and change as phenomenons isolated from the idea of time.
</li><li><b>Focus and shift of consciousness</b>: Leo highlights the mystery of consciousness. Gura instructs the viewer to try and take consciousness and focus it onto the fact that they are conscious itself. He suggests shifting the focus of our consciousness from ourselves onto various physical objects in our surroundings, noting that no matter where we focus, it's always consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as a whole bubble</b>: Gura encourages the viewers to expand their consciousness and perceive themselves as a whole bubble of it, rather than just the body contained within. He points out that wherever they direct their attention, it's all part of the same consciousness, even if it includes the couch, lamp, or a pet in the room.
</li><li><b>Spirituality vs. Science</b>: Gura provocatively claims that conventional science, as we understand it, is pure conjecture, abstract storytelling, and pure projection. He posits that only consciousness is real and tangible.
</li><li><b>Presence in unexplained, direct experience</b>: Towards the end, Gura encourages just sitting in a raw, direct, and peaceful meditative experience. He emphasizes the disposal of any arising ideas as they are merely fantasies spinning within the field of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding God as an infinite entity</b>: Now, after stripping away all the explanations and projections of worldly concepts and guiding towards realizing the raw consciousness, Gura defines God to be an infinitely conscious, singular being that exists mysteriously for its own sake. It's not made out of anything known or understood. Rather, it is groundless, unknown yet very conscious, and a sentient being.
</li><li><b>Rejection of other beings and external world</b>: Finally, Gura calls for the eradication of the idea of other entities and beings, as they are not part of our direct conscious experience. He wants the viewers to realize that they aren't one among millions of beings, rather the only being that they've ever truly experienced. He also negates the existence of other places, rooms, planets, or physical entities beyond our direct experience.
</li><li><b>Concept of God</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to become present, focusing on their consciousness and the reality of their present moment. He urges to discard conventional definitions of God and consider God as their immediate experience and consciousness, including everything within their current awareness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality</b>: Leo prompts the viewers to strip away stories and explanations for their present experience to understand the mystery of reality. He encourages denying the existence of certain concepts like planet Earth, human body, birth, etc., viewing these as ingrained narratives not present in direct experience. 
</li><li><b>True Nature of Object Perception</b>: Leo argues that our assumptions about color, shape, matter, and reality are just projections and stories overlaying the true nature of things. To truly perceive an object, such as our hand, he suggests discarding scientific explanations and considering it an unexplained, direct experience.
</li><li><b>Realizing Mysteries of Existence</b>: Gura pushes viewers to recognize the profundity of existence by embracing the mysteries, uncertainties, and wonder of the present moment. He urges to ignore notions of atoms, molecules, history, time, and experience pure consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Time and Consciousness</b>: Leo describes time and directional motion as just mental constructs and not actual experiences. He invites viewers to marvel at consciousness, the constant in our experiences, regardless of focus or state. He suggests shifting consciousness and realizing our connection to the objects around us. 
</li><li><b>Human's Relation to the Universe</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that human beings are not separate from the universe but part of it. They are not confined to their bodies, but encompass an expansive bubble of consciousness. He also underlines that spirituality is not a fantasy but a way to understand reality.
</li><li><b>Realizing God-Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura elaborates that consciousness is an infinite field that changes and doesn't consist of building blocks like atoms. It doesn't belong to a human, as the idea of humans restricts the notion of infinity. By stripping away all human aspects, concepts of time and our ingrained beliefs, one can realize the eternal and divine nature of consciousness, leading to the realization of God-consciousness.
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth</b>: Unlike our numerous beliefs and insights, the absolute truth isn't complex or layered. Leo insists that absolute truth is the pure, direct experience of the current moment. He further refutes the idea of an illusion or deeper reality behind our perceptions and declares perception as the absolute truth itself. Ultimately, everything in our consciousness constitutes reality. 
</li><li><b>Facing the Illusion of Consciousness</b>: Leo encourages the viewer to face the illusion of consciousness devoid of any tangents, such as fantasies, science, religion, or personal stories, asserting the complete and divine nature of self. He proposes the acceptance of self in entirety as an act of love, which ultimately is the unity of existence. 
</li><li><b>Incompleteness of Immediate Realizations</b>: Leo emphasizes the universality and perfection of existence but warns that immediate realizations may not be a complete understanding. It insists on patience as comprehending this concept takes time and involves different states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Proposition of Guided Exercise & Psychedelic</b>: Leo Gura recommends engaging in a guided exercise accompanied with a psychedelic to increase the possibility of a mystical experience. Along with continuous practice and avoidance of illusions, he advises focusing on the territory of existence rather than getting lost in maps (theories, explanations).
</li><li><b>The Practice of Grounding in Direct Experience</b>: Leo suggests small steps towards grounding oneself in direct experiential reality and spending a few moments each day focusing on immediate experiences. This practice can help steer away from conceptual thinking and foster personal growth and self-realization.
</li><li><b>Embracing Nothingness</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to recognize that there is truly nothing happening at the moment. The idea that something is happening is a projection from the mind. He affirms that something and nothing are indistinguishable and therefore identical.
</li><li><b>Rejecting Fantasies and Accepting Reality</b>: Gura emphasizes the necessity of discarding the mind's inclination towards fantasies. The mind defaults to creating illusions, making it difficult to accept the absolute truth. He asserts that what he teaches may be disconcerting, such as disregarding the presence of others or the existence of history.
</li><li><b>Absolute Completion</b>: Leo Gura posits that by acknowledging and accepting oneself as God and letting go of all fantasies, an individual can find satisfaction in their being. Nothing else is needed because everything desired is already achieved by being an all-encompassing God. This realization brings one into an awareness of their eternity and perfection. 
</li><li><b>Existence is Love</b>: According to Gura, God is love and to accept oneself fully is to love oneself wholly. Love is defined as the acceptance and embrace of everything that exists as a manifestation of self. Once everything is seen as an extension of oneself, there is no room for resistance or hatred, an awakening to the magic of existence ensues.
</li><li><b>Pure Infinite Love</b>: Love, Gura implies, is pure infinite consciousness that is fully unified and accepting of itself. This makes love synonymous with infinity as it doesn't require or desire to be anything other than what it is, which is characterized as self-love. 
</li><li><b>States of Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura discusses varying levels of consciousness, stating that even though all states of consciousness are God, some states allow you to appreciate more of God. Therefore, there is significance in being in higher states, although it doesn't fundamentally alter the fact that all states are equally God. 
</li><li><b>Integration and Practice</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of practice and persistence. Through continual practice and the dismantling of fantasies, one can eventually reach a pure state of God consciousness, he suggests. Understanding is recognized as an ongoing process that takes time and may not yield instant rewards.
</li><li><b>Utilizing Psychedelics</b>: Leo Gura proposes taking a psychedelic under safe and responsible conditions as it may aid in a deeper understanding of the exercise and could enhance the chances of having a mystical experience. 
</li><li><b>Discarding the Maps for the Territory</b>: Leo Gura encourages pursuing the territory and not the maps, meaning focusing on the direct experience rather than the conceptual models. He advises existing as the territory and being content in unity with everything. 
</li><li><b>Daily Practice for Spiritual Growth</b>: Gura suggests setting aside some moments each day to maintain a focus on direct, immediate experience. Regular practice assists in detaching from conceptual thinking and involvements in the present moment, driving personal growth and self-realization.
