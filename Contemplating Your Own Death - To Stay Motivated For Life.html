hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about contemplating your own
death how to use death to stay motivated for life
in order to do effective self actualization work I think
that it's very important to have a keen sense that
your life is short and just how short it is
and I think that this is one of the things
that people at large are missing our friends are missing
this our parents are missing this people who pissed their
life away are missing this very important element in their
life they're not really conscious of the fact that they
only have a little bit of life left they're not
conscious of the finality of their life and they're not
conscious of the fact that there's only one there's no
second chance there's no warm-up round this is it that's
one of the really fascinating things about life is that
we're just born and that at some moment we just
happen to become conscious self conscious and we realize like
well here I am I guess I'm here I don't
really know where I came from or how I came
into existence but I must be here and I can
reasonably assume that I probably won't be here for very
long given what I see around me given that I
see death all around me I see animals dying plants
dying things dying cars getting crushed in automobile accidents and
airplanes getting destroyed and blown up and so we see
wars we have a rich history of death and destruction
over the last several thousand years alone so just looking
at all this stuff you start to scratch your head
and say hmm I'm probably not going to be here
for much longer and there is no real reason for
me to assume that I would ever get a second
chance and there's actually a rich history of this so
in philosophy and Eastern traditions and other contemplative traditions for
thousands of years has been a rich history of pondering
and contemplating one's own death Marcus Aurelius comes to mind
from the ancient antiquity Greek and Roman times the Roman
Emperor Marcus Aurelius he has a work called the meditations
where he has these ruminations about how short life is
and he puts everything into perspective by contemplating the thing
about his death a lot it's kind of like his
personal reflections on life really inspiring work to read if
you've never read it I highly recommend it so Marcus
Aurelius was really be he was a stoic he was
really big on this idea of thinking about your death
a lot because when you think about your death it
puts everything else into perspective it takes a lot of
the pettiness that people are usually engaged in and it
makes you go like oh why am I doing this
petty stuff in the cosmic grand scheme of things on
the cosmic scale it makes no sense to be wasting
the short little sliver of life that I have on
doing these petty things such as gossiping or stealing or
cheating someone or screwing someone out of a business deal
or speaking badly of them or whatever it might be
and Marcus Aurelius would use that to ground himself so
that's a really great example also the Buddha the Buddha
is a classic Eastern example of what happens when an
individual really seriously contemplates and reflects on the fact that
his life is going to end and that he's only
got one of them and then he's got to make
the most of it so when the Buddha realizes he
went on a mission to actually find something that can
transcend death and then that led to his enlightenment and
then from there a bunch of stories and traditions got
made and so on and so forth but I think
this is a very important point and for me I
think one of the things that has given me a
leg up in my life I feel is that I
have been philosophical and I have been reflecting on the
fact that life is pretty miraculous I don't really know
the forces that got me to where I am but
here I am somehow I exist somehow I'm conscious we
human beings with all our signs have still not figured
out exactly or even at all what consciousness is what
it relates what's in relation what it writ what its
relationship is to to matter and how all that works
there's still much we need to try to understand about
that but you know I just think about that and
I also from a very early age I've just had
this sense that this is it this is the only
chance I have it's kind of like going golfing and
you only get to play one game of golf and
that's it it's like you've got 18 holes and those
are the only 18 holes you're ever going to play
in your entire life so when I am conscious of
that I'm not always conscious but when I am conscious
of that it's like man every stroke that I make
in this game of golf this 18 holes that's it
there's not going to be anything else that's it and
then after that what some traditions say that there's an
afterlife ah we can't strictly be sure because once you're
dead you can't come back and tell us but here's
the thing I think that there is a danger about
this afterlife idea and one of the dangers is that
it has you think like well I'll get a second
chance it's okay if I [ __ ] up here
in my first chance because this is just kind of
like the warm-up all the good stuffs going to come
later now that's a that's a dangerous bet to make
pretty dangerous bet to make I've never thought that way
I always assumed because I say you know if there
is an afterlife okay good that'll be like a nice
little bonus but I have to assume the worst and
the worst is this is all that there is and
I only got this one chance so I want to
make the most of it right I want to make
sure that when I get to the end of this
life I can say yeah I did this and I
did that and I try different things and I can
die reasonably happy because I understand that I had limited
powers but I did the most I could and I'm
proud of my life and I contributed to the world
and I grew myself and I experienced all the richness
of the world that there is as much as I
was humanly able to within reason and so now I
can die happy and that's always kind of been a
motivating force for me is that that's kind of what
I'm shooting for on the big picture with all the
plans that I make in my life I kind of
run it through that filter like am I going to
be proud of myself at the end of my life
for having done that but I get the sense that
most people don't do this in fact I know most
people don't do this because what most people do is
they distract themselves from death death is something that actually
takes a mature ego to be able to contemplate its
own death most egos are so fragile and so neurotic
that they don't want to think about this at all
they press the off button or they look the other
way to distract themselves or whatever and we distract ourselves
with food with television with sex with relationships with marriage
with kids with family with business with career with making
money with spiritual quests with whatever and not all this
stuff is bad and that's what makes it distracting is
because some of these things are legitimately good it's legitimately
good to go to the gym and it's legitimately good
to have a business that helps the world and it's
legitimately good to have a family and to take care
of your family and be concerned for them and spend
a lot of time making sure that your kids are
growing up properly that stuff is good but you got
to make sure that you're not using that just as
a smokescreen from taking a look at what's really lurking
under the surface and what's under the surface is this
deep existential void that you have in your life that
you're trying to Phil with all this stuff that you're
doing but it never quite gets filled because in the
end the fear of death is always lurking and there's
nothing really that you're going to do to fix that
at least not in any conventional activity that you're doing
in your life so in that sense is a distraction
what I want to do here is I want to
do a little guided visualization that will help put you
in touch with your own death to get you a
real palpable sense of what I mean about contemplating death
and we're going to do that in a second here
what I want you to do is I want you
to get a piece of paper and a pencil or
a pen and have that handy right now next to
you before we get into the visualization because at the
end of it there's going to be some stuff that
I'm going to want you to write down and not
be distracted running around looking for paper so pause this
right now go get the paper and pen and then
come on back okay good so you should have that
now I'm going to guide you through this it'll be
a pretty quick 10 or 15-minute visualization something like that
but the the other point I want to make before
I get in there is is this in my own
life as I started meditating more just doing meditation and
as I'm doing more enlightenment work trying to understand really
what my consciousness actually is and it's a whole can
of worms that I can't go into here you can
see my videos about enlightenment spiritual enlightenment for that but
what I've been noticing is that now every day almost
not every day but maybe at least a couple of
days a week especially now that I'm in my 30s
I just turned 30 this year uh-huh I think about
my death a lot like I wake up and I'm
like well another day has gone by it just flew
by I'm already 30 I've only got maybe 30 more
years left if I'm lucky what am I doing with
this time it really focuses my my mind on what
I need to get done and it helps me to
get rid of all the fluff and distractions in my
life which are robbing me of this little time that
I do have all right so let's do this visualization
so go ahead and sit with your back up straight
on chair get comfortable get relaxed and close your eyes
okay good take a moment to get in touch with
the feelings and sensations in your body whatever you feel
is there you don't need to make anything up just
notice what's there notice the pressure of the seat on
your button on your legs notice the sensation on your
feet the soles of your feet notice any feelings in
your torso and upper body area in your chest while
your attention is on your chest notice that it's breathing
in and out at its own pace and just overall
get a sense that you are your body get a
sense of the entire envelope of skin that surrounds what
you think of you your body and just notice that
your present right now and that what you are fundamentally
is that you exist these sensations are changing every second
but these are real sensations this is the most real
thing that you have about you is these sensations get
in touch with that also get present to any sounds
that are around you maybe some birds chirping or some
cars driving or the air conditioning humming notice sounds notice
the sound of my own voice that's also happening in
the present moment and that's another sound and it's changing
every second notice any mental images you might have or
mental sounds that you might hear which would be thoughts
notice the internal dialogue in your mind if there is
any and just allow all of this to be exactly
as it is allow it to happen right now in
the present moment get into real time so to speak
start to wonder what is all of this these sensations
sounds thoughts images feelings in the body all of these
things are sensations so just start to wonder as your
eyes are closed start to wonder what are these sensations
really do I really know what they are and resist
the urge of your mind to jump in and give
you a ready-made answer leave the question a little bit
open and just allow yourself to savor those sensations good
now what I'd like you to do is to imagine
yourself before your birth what was that like who do
you think you really were before you were born before
you were conscious before you even had this body and
any of these sensations what do you think you were
try to imagine that the best you can and notice
that whatever you were for you there was no such
thing as space and there was no such thing as
time and there was probably no such thing as sensation
and there's probably no such thing as even consciousness and
now just recognize that that was your state of existence
not for a million years not even for a billion
years not even for a trillion years but literally for
infinity you exists it existed as that entity which I
will call nothingness you existed as that for infinity forever
for an eternity and now think of the moment when
you were born and actually think about the moment when
you first became conscious of yourself and you have your
first childhood memories so that was the moment that you
came into existence as you presently know yourself and then
you lived through all that and then you got to
where you are today imagine yourself kind of running through
life all the way to today however many years that
was maybe it was 15 years 20 years 30 40
50 years something like that notice how quickly that time
flew by and now what I want you to do
is to imagine and just notice and become aware that
every night when you go to sleep and you go
into deep sleep who do you become when you're in
deep sleep when you have no dreams at all you
have no memories at all you basically return to your
original state which is this nothingness with no dimensions no
sense of time no sensations no awareness of any kind
notice how freaky that is it's almost as though every
night you go to sleep you are dead and it's
almost as though every morning when you wake up you
are reborn now estimate how much time you think you
still have left in your life so whatever age you're
at now assume that if you're a healthy individual you'll
probably live to 65 or 70 years so how much
do you have left what do you have 10 years
20 years 30 years 40 years left pick a number
that you think is realistic and now imagine going to
sleep the way that you will later tonight and never
again waking up you go to sleep like you always
do but you never again wake up ever you never
again experience anything not even space not even time not
even blackness there's not even an experience of blackness or
darkness it's just pure nothing really feel what that's like
to be nothing so to speak and just notice to
yourself how sad it is that you will never again
get to experience anything that you experience for their short
little window of time that you were alive what are
you going to miss the most you're not going to
see colors anymore you're not going to get to see
the world anymore you're not going to get to smile
anymore or feel good in your body anymore you're not
going to experience the richness of life in any way
at all get in touch with that notice how final
this is there is no second saving grace there's no
redo here there's no undo button when you go to
sleep and you finally go to sleep and you don't
wake up notice the finality that is there that's it
it's lights out forever notice that what you have right
now is the most miraculous the most mysterious the most
beautiful the most remarkable thing that you could possibly have
which is simply existence what you have is you have
the ability to exist in a very rich way not
in a one-dimensional way not in a two-dimensional way not
in a three-dimensional way but in a trillion dimensional way
you have colors and sights and sounds and all these
experiences that you can have and everything that comes with
being a human being that's conscious you have all of
that at your disposal your experience and your existence is
a rich one it's not a faint one it's a
very vivid one and now just recognize and become very
conscious that this is your one chance this is it
what are you going to do with it what's worth
doing with it what would your life look like if
you honored this miracle and this remarkable opportunity that you've
been handed somehow we don't even know how this opportunity
came your way but however it came your way you've
got it just take a last few moments to really
soak in the finality of win this thing hold when
this whole thing will end and it will end so
just take that in as a reality that you're not
going to escape and also I would suggest instead of
being afraid of it or worrying about what's going to
happen to you except this is a beautiful aspect of
life is that you have been given this remarkable little
window the sliver of time and that's not something to
be fixed or changed but that's fine and perfect just
the way it is and notice that the only thing
you need to do to not be afraid of it
is to simply live the best most rich life that
you can and that if you just live the most
rich life that you possibly could no matter how long
it is whether it's ten years or a hundred years
if you just do your best then that's going to
be enough you don't need anything more you can then
die in peace and you can accept your fate okay
good I'm going to count up to three and when
I get to three you're gonna wake up and open
your eyes and come back alert and refreshed one you're
starting to slowly wake up to here we coming more
present and out of Fantasyland three open your eyes and
wake up nice and refreshed here present in this moment
and out of your head good welcome back so that
got you a little taste of what contemplating death is
all about this is not a morbid thing this is
a very powerful spiritual experience this grounds your entire light
this gives priority to your entire life so go ahead
and take out that piece of paper that you had
and your pencil or pen and I want you to
write down the following questions and then you're going to
answer these questions immediately after I tell you to pause
so here are the questions number one what would I
miss the most about life what would I miss the
most about life number two what do I want to
get out of this life what do I want to
get out of this life number three what is really
worth doing what is really worth doing and number four
what isn't worth doing what isn't worth doing okay those
are your questions go ahead pause this recording right now
and answer those questions while the visualization is still fresh
in your mind and you're still in that emotional state
of higher consciousness right now you have this window of
opportunity your consciousness is expanded so here is where the
gold can be gotten so jot down some answers to
these questions right now all right pause it go alright
welcome back so you answer those hopefully that was insightful
for you I want to just give you a couple
of last points and a few ideas for how to
keep up this practice in the future and a couple
of more questions right so the idea here one of
the biggest lessons that I think you can take away
is to stop doing petty [ __ ] in your
life all of us to waste a lot of our
time and energy in life by doing petty things that
we would not otherwise do if we were fully conscious
of the fact that our life is short and it's
singular you only get one and when it's going to
be over it's going to be over forever so this
is why you have to keep reminding yourself it helps
you to get rid of the pettiness in your life
the gossip the criticism the bickering the fighting all the
petty stuff you do so here's a question I want
you to write down an answer after this video is
complete the question is how am I being small-minded how
am I being small-minded think about that not just with
people but I want you to think about how you're
being small-minded with your overall strategies and objectives in life
for example you if you have a goal to buy
yourself a Ferrari or some fancy car just ask yourself
is that really a large minded goal or is that
a small minded goal and if you have a goal
to start your company and make it go public and
to earn three hundred million dollars ask yourself is that
a small-minded goal or is that a large minded goal
I'm not talking about ambitiousness here or what other people
think of you or quote-unquote success in the external world
I'm talking about what is large minded in the context
of the fact that your life is going to be
over very soon you probably won't care about having 300
million dollars if you're going to die next week nor
will you care about your Ferrari that's a really good
question and the second takeaway that you can get from
from this is think about how you could reorganize your
life so that it is more aligned with the fact
that your life is singular and it will soon be
over how can you actually change the structure of your
life I'm talking about deep structural changes so maybe you
should quit your whole career maybe you decide like man
if I really think about this then I I can
see that my career is just uh it's just a
sham it's just complete empty ah just monkey business I
would rather be going doing something over here instead that
would be a deep structural change that you can make
your life based on this higher consciousness awareness or maybe
you decide that you know this person that I'm in
a relationship with that I'm married to what what am
I doing with this person it makes no sense when
I put it into the larger context and that makes
you decide to break off that relationship and so on
and so forth so here's my question that I want
you to write down for yourself you can ask later
at the end of this video it's this how do
I need to reorganize my life how do I need
to reorganize my life and this is one of the
most difficult questions you can ask yourself it's a very
scary question because we're afraid to make huge changes in
your life we're afraid to say that man I spent
the last 20 years in this relationship and it's just
going nowhere or I spent the last 30 years building
this business and now I see that it's just a
sham but you have to be able to make these
tough self honest assessments when you're trying to self actualize
this is this is why self honesty is so important
and it's emotionally difficult to do it you need courage
to be able to do it I'm going to give
you now an exercise that I want you to do
for the next seven days to really drive all these
points home here every day for the next seven days
every single morning first thing in the morning I'd like
you to do the following thing and it only will
take you less than five minutes I want you to
wake up and I want you to immediately think or
have some sort of reminder there by your bedside that
tells you to start to think about the fact that
your life is singular and that it's finite it's going
to end and once it ends it will be over
forever and you're never getting it back and you're never
getting a second chance I want you to go through
that thought process for seven days straight in the morning
and then I want you to do this one sentence
completion exercise you can have a piece of paper or
notebook and every day you're going to do this again
and again and again for seven days straight so you're
going to complete the following sentence it goes like this
if I was more conscious of my death I would
blank if I was more conscious of my death I
would blank and your job is to fill in that
blank and what I want you to do is I
want you to quickly rattle off ten different completions to
that sentence you're not going to spend a lot of
time trying to come up with the perfect answer you're
just going to rattle off ten quick responses whatever comes
to your mind and the way you're going to do
it is like this you're just going to read the
sentence that I gave you and then where it comes
to your mind you can write that down so I
would ask myself like this if I was more conscious
of my death I would have more sex okay that
popped into my mind I'm writing it down then I
would ask was okay if I was more conscious of
my death I would find a new job and then
you write that down or whatever it is and just
write ten of those down and you do that for
seven days straight so you can have 70 responses and
that's it and then I just want you to soak
in that energy and I want you to feel how
powerful that energy is and you're going to tap into
something that the Buddha tapped into you're going to tap
into that energy that Marcus Aurelius tapped into and a
lot of other remarkable people in the past have tapped
into who use this idea of contemplating our death to
motivate ourselves and to focus ourselves in life all right
this is Leo I'm signing off go ahead post me
your comments down below please click like button share this
video with a friend and lastly come check out actualised
org right here this is my website I have free
stuff on there I have some exclusive stuff that you
can't get anywhere else so check that out I have
a course on life purpose I have a book list
there and also I have a free newsletter I want
you to really stay onboard with Ashley org and with
creating an extraordinary self actualized life for yourself my vision
for you is that you really take these psychological principles
that I share with you very seriously and you become
a student of this you start to see the power
of mastering your own psychology and then mastering your own
life and using your life to your fullest because in
the end we're all really desiring deep down inside is
we want to die happy we want to die knowing
that we've lived the best possible life that we could
have and after spending many years in my youth warn't
wondering about how can I do this how can I
accomplish this kind of lofty abstract goal what I discovered
is that it's through learning these psychological principles which I'm
delivering to you for free on a weekly basis if
you stick with me every single week and you keep
watching this stuff and you become a student of your
psychology and you start doing some of these exercises and
then you even go beyond what I tell you to
do what you're going to discover is that a kind
of life is available for you that's so beautiful and
remarkable and powerful that it's outside your present reality at
the moment but you can work your way to it
through baby steps and the process of working your way
there is really one of the most beautiful things in
life one of the most people things in life is
just growth and self improving it's self actualization that is
its own reward but then of course you know it
brings you a lot of the more quote unquote material
tangible rewards that we also want all the kind of
creature comforts of life that comes automatically when you master
your own psychology so you get all that stuff plus
you get the higher consciousness stuff of living a remarkable
high conscious life that's the best that you can do
in life you can't really do much better so it's
worth I think investing a little bit of time every
week to put yourself on track with that and it's
difficult I know how easy it is to fall off
track so actualize that or get here to help you
to stay on track so sign up and I hope
to see you soon you
