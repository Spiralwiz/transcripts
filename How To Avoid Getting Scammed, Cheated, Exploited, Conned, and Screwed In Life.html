[Music] how to avoid getting exploited cheated scammed conned and
screwed in life in this episode we'll be looking at
the psychology of con artistry and scams this is going
to be a practical episode with many useful tips that
will save you thousands of dollars and maybe even hundreds
of thousands of dollars throughout your life so this is
worth listening to i have actually quite a bit of
personal experience with this is a bit of a personal
episode for me um which i'll get into here in
a moment but before we get into that i want
to tell you a story actually there's going to be
a lot of interesting stories throughout this episode so stay
tuned for those some of them will be amusing entertaining
the first story i have for you is i was
at a enlightenment intensive this was maybe five years ago
or so i was in canada in the toronto area
doing a week-long sort of meditation and contemplation retreat and
there we were sharing stories um and it was interesting
because there was a man there about in his in
his 40s who uh was sharing stories about his family
life and he was sharing certain traumas that he went
through growing up in canada there he came from a
family of of hunters and trappers they would trap all
sorts of animals his father and his brothers and so
he was part of this and he was telling me
about uh this one particular incident where he was telling
me the the craftiness of the fox and i still
remember to this day it was a very poignant example
so he was talking about how tricky these foxes are
and what a fox will do a fox will walk
up to a house you know near the forest and
let's say there's a house cat that lives on this
property and the fox will start to jump up and
down and get all playful trying to play with this
cat and the cat usually the cat would be afraid
of the fox uh but but here the fox is
jumping up and down and acting all playful because it
wants to play with the with the cat at least
that's what the cat perceives and so the fox is
jumping up and down and it's rolling around kind of
frolicking and the cat lets down his guard and the
cat gets closer and closer to the fox the fox
is jumping up and down the fox is getting closer
and closer to the cat and the cat also gets
into a playful mood and then finally when the fox
is close enough to the cat the fox just jumps
up jumps on the cat grabs him by the skull
and just crack crushes and cracks his skull open and
that's how the fox hunts see what you'll notice if
you observe animals in the animal kingdom is that animals
in nature use trickery to survive all the time whether
it's the fox or some sort of camouflage snake or
many many other creatures that do this and actually human
beings in this sense are not that much different human
beings have turned deception into an art form and into
a survival strategy and what you should know is that
life is full of people who will cheat scam and
con you if you're not careful and if you're as
naive and gullible as this house cat so what you
have to recognize is that there are foxes out there
and you got to be craftier than the fox to
avoid getting your skull cracked open so people weaponize cunning
and intelligence now even though that's the case you have
to be careful not to take the things that i'm
saying here and become overly paranoid and overly cautious but
uh you do have to stay vigilant against this sort
of stuff and so this episode will sort of prepare
you because i i feel like a lot of people
are very naive about these things and they're very susceptible
to being cheated scammed conned and exploited by others who
are crafty and have turned this into a a lifestyle
for themselves a career so to speak so this episode
will help you to become um more wise to the
kind of tricks that can be played on you and
so here i want to i want to share with
you another amusing story and this is a story of
a man named victor lessig les lustig victor lustig who
uh was a very uh successful and uh popular con
artist and he is known as the man who sold
the eiffel tower so here i'm going to read you
a bit of a a passage from wikipedia about victor
lustig and his con with the eiffel tower so quote
in 1925 lustig traveled back to france while staying in
paris he chanced upon a news article discussing the problems
faced with maintaining the eiffel tower which gave him inspiration
for a new con at the time the monument had
begun to fall into disrepair and the city was finding
it increasingly expensive to maintain and to repaint it part
of the article made a passing comment that overall public
opinion on the monument would move towards calls for its
removal which was the key to convincing lustig that using
it as part of his next con would be lucrative
so after researching what he needed to help him utilize
the information from the article lustig sent to work preparing
the scam which included hiring a forager to produce fake
government stationery for him once he was ready lustig invited
a small group of scrap metal dealers to a confidential
meeting at an expensive hotel whereupon he identified himself to
them as the deputy director general of the ministry of
posts and telegraphs in the meeting he convinced the men
that the upkeep of the eiffel tower was becoming too
much for paris and that the french government wished to
sell it for scrap but that because such a deal
would be controversial and likely spark public outcry nothing could
be disclosed until all the details were thought through lustig
revealed that he was in charge of selecting the dealer
who would receive ownership of the structure claiming that the
group had been selected carefully because of their reputations as
honest businessmen his speech included genuine insight about the monument's
place in the city and how it did not fit
in with the city's other great monuments like the gothic
cathedrals and the archde triumph during his time with the
dealers lustig kept watch on who would be the most
likely to fall for his scam and found his mark
in andre poisson an insecure man who wished to rise
up among the inner circles of the parisian business community
as poisson showed the keenest interest in purchasing the monument
lustig decided to focus on him once the dealers sent
their bids to him arranging a private meeting with poisson
lustig convinced him that he was a corrupt official claiming
that his government position did not give him a generous
salary for the lifestyle he wished to enjoy believing the
sale of the eiffel tower would secure him a place
amongst the top businessmen poisson agreed to pay a large
bribe to secure ownership of the eiffel tower however once
lustig received his bribe and the funds for the monument's
sale he soon fled to austria lustig suspected that when
poisson found out that he had been conned he would
be too ashamed and embarrassed to inform the french police
of what he had been caught up in yet despite
his belief he maintained a check on the newspapers while
in austria his suspicions soon proved to be correct when
he could find no reference to his con within their
pages and thus he decided to return to paris later
that year to pull off the same scheme once more
however when when lustig attempted to call another group of
dealers and had managed to find a mark among them
willing to buy the eiffel tower the police were informed
about the scam and he fled to the u.s to
evade arrest and quote that's from wikipedia and he went
on in the united states to make further cons which
you can read about on his wikipedia page quite fascinating
so these are the kinds of tactics and maneuvers that
con artists engage in and there's a lot of variations
on this which we'll be discussing and i'll show some
share some tips with you for how to avoid this
kind of stuff there's actually a great movie that i'm
reminded of from the 1980s a 1988 movie called dirty
rotten scoundrels uh with steve martin and michael kane which
is sort of sort of a comedy movie about two
con artists who are trying to uh out do one
another and trying to con some poor young lady of
her um of her you know life savings um so
that's a great movie to watch on this topic uh
but now to bring it to more of a sort
of a personal point uh the reason is this issue
is personal for me is because actually i grew up
in a family where uh where we had a lot
of con artistry and um my dad was a bit
of a con artist and he he conned people and
companies and governments out of hundreds of thousands and millions
of dollars and this is how we survived and i
have a lot of crazy stories of the kinds of
cons and exploits and scams that he would do i
won't be sharing all of them uh there's quite a
lot there to share i could talk about that for
hours but uh the only reason i bring it up
is because it gave me a very early exposure in
my life as a kid i grew up in this
kind of household where this is how survival happened and
it gave me uh early exposure to how cons and
scams work and it made me very very savvy to
this kind of stuff and so i feel like i
have some unique insights and i feel like a lot
of people are just so naive because they didn't grow
up in that kind of household so they don't understand
the mind of a con artist where i saw that
firsthand for me it was like almost like learning a
language you know you learn a language when you're really
young you just absorb it and you pick it up
and you see how it really works and then you
can speak it fluently without even having to study it
and i feel like a lot of people have missed
out on that and that's why they're easy marks uh
and so i want to share with you some of
the sort of like tips and insights that i learned
from observing this uh very intimately and they were very
uh well i should say not very but there were
pros and cons to this kind of childhood the pros
is that it made me very vigilant and aware and
it made me nearly immune to being conned it's very
easy for me to see through cons and through con
artists which is why for example it's like it's it's
just so painly obvious to me with trump for example
that he's a con artist the way he behaves is
exactly like a con artist but it's funny to me
that a lot of people don't see that and they
just fall for his cons so that that was the
positive the negative though of growing up that way is
that it made me somewhat distant it made me cynical
it made me overly suspicious and it created some trauma
within me um and it took me years to overcome
some of that trauma and maybe there's still some of
that left that i'm still working through it also instilled
in me some bad habits because in my family lying
cheating stealing and low integrity behavior was very very commonplace
and you were just expected to play along with that
and it took me many years to overcome that and
to shed some of those bad habits and in the
end this sort of lifestyle ended up destroying my family
um so it has terrible consequences so i definitely don't
recommend living this kind of lifestyle it's it's very dysfunctional
and um it leads to bad stuff but like i
said most people are naive to this kind of stuff
especially in first world countries i find that people are
actually more savvy in third world countries where this sort
of con artistry is more common but in first world
countries in like nice neighborhoods in america i feel like
people grew up in these sort of like comfortable cloistered
suburbs and they don't know what it's really like to
get caught or scammed because that kind of stuff just
doesn't exist there or you grow up so sheltered from
it that then you become very susceptible to being conned
and i feel that a lot of people who are
raised in honest households where this kind of behavior is
unacceptable or considered immoral they can't even imagine the mind
of a con artist and i can help you to
understand that cons and scams are inversely proportional to one's
level of development and consciousness the less developed you are
the less conscious you are the more open you are
to using cons and scams to get by in life
and to turn that into your career with no moral
qualms about it because this is just how you survive
in the same way that you know when the fox
is being crafty in the way that it hunts the
fox is not feeling guilty about it this is just
the way the fox survives this is how it hunts
and so it is for a lot of con artists
and scammers out there which is why uh in third
world countries actually countries like china india russia nigeria and
elsewhere like that uh scams and cons are extremely common
and in those kind of countries if you want to
grow up in those kind of countries like you're going
to be exposed to that kind of stuff very early
on and you're going to become very savvy to it
and this is why a lot of times when first
worlders travel around to third world countries they get scammed
and conned so easily these are very common kinds of
stories you know some rich americans go to china or
to russia to india and they get caught up in
a con because that kind of stuff is not as
prevalent in america although of course it exists here but
it's way way worse in a country like china india
or russia so what you must understand is that cons
and scams are how low consciousness people survive it's a
survival strategy so don't try to take it too personally
desperate people people who are desperate to feed their family
they will lie cheat and scam their way into doing
that and if you're into cons and scams yourself or
your family is it's crucial that you commit to reforming
yourself or to extricating yourself out of that toxic family
situation because living the life of a con artist or
even adjacent to a card artist having a con artist
or scammer in your life whether it's a family member
or a friend something like that will ultimately end up
destroying your life these people cannot help themselves they don't
like to change they keep coming up with new cons
and scams and so you need to be able to
distance yourself and if you are part of that you
have to stop doing that otherwise it will destroy your
life and so really this just goes to the sort
of classic buddhist principle you know one of the buddhist
principles is right livelihood it's important if you want to
live a good life and you want to develop yourself
and grow your consciousness and all this and become successful
and happy in a genuine way that you understand the
importance of this principle of right livelihood there are right
ways to make a living in the world and there
are wrong ways to make a living in the world
and this is not a moral judgment this is simply
a consequence of karma if you live in the wrong
ways karma will come back around eventually it'll boomerang on
you and it'll get you and you will lose your
all your wealth all your success uh your reputation you
will lose your friends your family and maybe even your
life if you get caught up in this kind of
stuff on the other hand if you practice right livelihood
and you work hard and you're honest in the way
that you work you don't scam people you don't cheat
people then this is the true path towards success and
towards happiness i've actually had even though i am pretty
savvy to being con and scammed i still had experiences
in my life growing up where you know early experiences
where i got duped in various ways i'll share some
of those with you so for example um one of
the earliest experience i can remember maybe i was like
10 years old and there was i was into video
games at that time and i had all these video
game magazines and every one of these video game magazines
they seem to have like this two-page full ad inside
the um magazine at the time this was back in
the mid 90s or so where there was like a
sweepstakes you can send them five dollars and enter the
sort of sweepstakes and then what they would do is
they would have a grand prize and on this two-page
ad they would show you the grand prize and the
grand prize was like this ultimate entertainment system that you
could get it included like a big screen tv and
a satellite dish and like a stereo system with surround
sound speakers like you know like the works and like
a bunch of different video game consoles just like everything
you got like the full i don't know that was
probably like a 10 or 20 000 like full home
entertainment system like at that time to me like as
a young kid i'm like oh my god i love
this thing i just want that entertainment system right so
of course i'm going to enter the sweepstakes and the
way that it worked is that you send them five
dollars and then what they would do is every month
they would send you like a little puzzle in the
mail this was back in before the internet in the
mail they will send you this puzzle you have to
solve this puzzle on like a paper it's like a
sort of like a word puzzle you solve it and
then you send it back to them and every time
the every month basically the puzzles got harder and you
have to keep solving them and solving them and solving
them and also you kept paying them more and more
every month and then as you you know as that
progresses eventually i think that was supposed to work is
that people were supposed to like fail the puzzles and
then they drop out drop out drop out and the
last man standing in the in this whole puzzle scheme
or game ends up winning the grand prize that's how
it was set up but it was very sneaky the
way it was set up because they didn't tell you
up front that you would be investing more and more
every month they made it seems like oh it's only
five dollars but then with every puzzle they would sucker
you in because they would like raise the stakes of
what you would win they would say oh okay so
you paid five dollars last month but if you want
to win an even better entertainment system with like you
know we'll include a second satellite dish or we'll include
a second game console or something like that then you
pay another five dollars and of course you want that
so you now you know you there's that sunk cost
balance so you pay another five dollars and then the
next month they up the stakes even more then you
pay another five dollar and you keep doing that and
doing that i didn't lose a lot of money in
this thing but uh this was formative for me because
actually at the time i showed this to my dad
before i entered into this sweepstakes and he he told
me that this is just a waste of time and
a waste of money i didn't believe him so i
did it anyways uh but then as i get got
suckered into it more and more and more eventually i
realized that wait a minute what am i doing here
what are the chances that i'm actually gonna win this
thing the chances were of course zero and probably nobody
won that entertainment system it was just a way of
getting money out of people and uh and so eventually
i realized that and that was important for me because
i saw how i got sucked into it i saw
how my own desire for this entertainment system was used
against me i saw how they kind of baited me
in with that sunk cost fallacy getting me to pay
a little bit more every month and getting me all
excited about it um and so i didn't end up
losing a lot of money probably not more than 100
which is really nothing but that taught me such a
valuable lesson uh at such a young age and then
for the rest of my life i would avoid these
sorts of sweepstakes and similar schemes another funny story i'll
share with you is that when i was a little
bit older maybe like 14 years old um this was
the early internet days like the late 90s um and
somehow i got sucked into a scheme for buying property
on mars uh this was this was hilarious so some
company set up a website during the very early internet
era where they started selling property on the planet mars
and the way they framed it on their website is
that like we have the official rights to sell property
on march of course they didn't basically anybody can set
up a website you can still set up a website
today claiming to sell property on mars but anyways they
would have like an actual map of you know of
mars and they would actually show you a little a
little square of where your property would be and then
you send them like 100 or something and then they
actually send you a certificate sort of it looks official
right it's got a like a foil seal on it
and it's got someone's signature on it it looks like
a diploma almost like the sort of like official certificate
or deed of your martian property and of course the
the pitch was the way they pitched it to is
like you know mankind is good you know has already
been to the moon the next place mankind is going
to mars and wouldn't it be nice to already like
you know have a piece piece of that action a
piece of that property like what's mars real estate gonna
be worth a hundred years from now you know it's
gonna be worth millions so get in early you know
get on on the ground floor and i was so
naive and i think my brother my brother was into
it too i think at the time i can't remember
maybe a friend a brother a friend i don't remember
who but somebody else was doing this with me and
um and so we just kind of like we we
had this fantasy in our minds that oh you know
we're going to own a piece of martian property how
cool would that be so we ended up doing that
and of course later i i realized of my own
recognizance just how absurd and ridiculous that whole scheme was
of course nobody is authorized to sell property on mars
um i'm sure there were many different kinds of websites
that were you know self-appointedly just selling this kind of
stuff anyone can can make some certificate claiming that it's
official but of course in reality the way that property
on mars is going to work is that whoever gets
there first and gets to defend that property that's who's
going to really own it and in fact i think
there's like international treaties that say that no country can
clay claim to lunar property or martian property it's going
to be based on a sort of like first come
first serve basis so anyways yeah that's that i got
scammed a little bit there too another scam that i
experienced was that uh i would go to subway when
i was young probably around the same age maybe 15
years old i would go to this subway and there
was a little box there where you can drop your
business card or something where they offered a chance to
win a free gym membership so anyways i put some
kind of business card in there with my name on
it and then i got a call back like a
month later telling me that i won a free gym
membership to like 24 hour fitness it was like a
300 value of gym membership i'm like okay cool that's
that's awesome i wanted to go to the gym at
that point hadn't really been and couldn't really afford it
so i got all excited about that but then when
i actually came they're like okay so you have to
like now come in to the gym and we'll set
you up with the membership and all that stuff we'll
get all set up for you so i come in
there trying to get all this stuff set up and
then as that's happening they start to upsell me they
don't just give you a free membership no strings attached
they start to upsell you and then eventually what ends
up happening is that by the time they're done upselling
you and they they fill your mind with all these
you know upgrades and other things that you can do
you end up owing them like 300 so really then
what i realized is like oh so that that little
box at subway with the free gym membership that was
that was not them giving away a free gym membership
that was actually them using that as like an advertisement
for their gym and then even when you win the
free membership they're gonna earn money on you anyways not
to mention all the other business cards that they gather
you know they probably gather a hundred or thousand business
cards over a month and then they get to like
email all those people call all those people and upsell
to all those people so i realized that it was
a scam or um sort of like an elaborate marketing
strategy that preys on your desire for something free which
is which is one of the patterns that you'll notice
with these kinds of scams uh then later when i
was maybe 24 years old i actually got scammed through
a phishing email i had a a yahoo at the
time yahoo had like an advertising platform i had an
advertising platform account through yahoo and i got an email
into my inbox saying that like something is going on
with my account i need to click this link and
log into my yahoo account to make sure that everything
is on board and so i quickly did that and
then not realizing the link that i clicked on was
a phishing link like it it led to some website
that looked like yahoo but it was like a fake
yahoo i logged into it and really that website stole
my login information for my yahoo account my account account
was linked to my bank account because i was using
that to pay for various kinds of ad campaigns and
and then like the next day i noticed that five
thousand dollars was missing from my bank account and the
reason that was because they got my login information for
the yahoo account then they use that yahoo account to
make some sort of big purchase and then somehow siphon
the money to themselves so i actually ended up getting
a charge back i called my bank and i was
able to get that reverse so i was able to
get that money back but um but that was the
only time that i got phished through an email this
was this was very early you know now people are
sort of like aware of how phishing emails work but
back then this was still very early and so i
didn't i didn't know what phishing was and now i
know so i got scammed that way i got scammed
and basically robbed of twenty five thousand dollars later a
few years later after that from a uh by a
by a business partner that i was doing business with
so basically uh my first online business had to do
with generating leads for the insurance industry and so i
was generating leads and sending them to to another company
that was reselling them and so they were kind of
our middleman we were using them for that and um
what ended up happening so we were sending them hundreds
of leads over the course of a month and these
leads were pretty pricey each one of our leads that
we generated was like 110 dollars per lead and we
would be sending hundreds of these leads every week so
over a month we might send them 500 leads a
thousand leads times 110 each so you know it adds
up and they would only pay us at the end
of the month and um from the very beginning i
suspected this would be a problem because i'm wondering like
well what happens if we terminate our relationship uh we're
going to be owed for like a month worth of
leads and what's going to be the incentive of this
company to pay us for for that because the lead
generation industry and the online marketing industry they're pretty shady
there's like shady characters you just certain industries just attract
people with low integrity and so i i knew that
the the business partner i was dealing with there wasn't
really high integrity and i suspected that they wouldn't pay
us and sure enough that's exactly what happened after we
terminated our our business um they ended up owing us
for like a thousand leads and it was about twenty
five thousand dollars and i actually had to do a
lawsuit against them in canada the other problem is that
they were located in canada so i'd actually fly to
fly to canada i have a whole episode from years
ago where um when i talk about this and and
so basically i got scammed for twenty five thousand dollars
i flew to canada i had to argue the case
in a canadian courtroom myself i didn't have a lawyer
i had to argue with myself luckily i ended up
winning the case but even though i won the case
and i was awarded the 25 000 i was never
able to get it back because it's one thing to
win you know an award legally and it's another thing
to be able to collect it especially from another country
so i lost out on 25 000 there um another
interesting scam that comes to mind is that i remember
my brother and i were into online games and uh
we were into this game called eve online i think
it still exists it's kind of an old game though
um but eve online is like notorious for scammers because
it's sort of like a libertarian fantasy on eve online
it's all like player versus player competitive online multiplayer gaming
and people are notorious for running scams there anyways uh
i remember for christmas i brought bought my brother a
christmas gift of like some amount of eve credits like
it was a couple million eve credits this was maybe
10 10 years ago or so and i gifted him
this and then and he was really into the game
at that point and he was going to use the
credits to buy himself some like cool ship and other
cool stuff in the game and i think it was
like i might have paid like 200 for that couple
million eve credits at the time and then um and
then i found out from him a few days later
that he was going to buy himself this great ship
part of this guild that was supposed to be helping
him to to secure this great ship in the game
and then it was actually an elaborate scam they ended
up scamming all the money he lost all the in-game
credits that i gifted him and um and then he
quit the game because he was so frustrated with the
scam and if you read about eve online this is
just the tip of the iceberg of the kind of
scams that and and cons and the kind of machinations
that happen with eve online it's it's like a libertarian
hellscape there i mean everybody's scheme against everybody else and
that's just sort of like the the ethos of the
of the community and um yeah you will have people
in the game infiltrate guilds and be part of of
these guilds because guilds are very important they will be
part of these guilds and they will spend years infiltrating
guilds to finally you know backstab them sabotage them and
like rob them of all their money and then basically
destroy whole guild from years of secret covert like espionage
work it's quite brutal and um and uh you know
very like real in that sense it's not like a
game it's like real life and then another story that
comes to mind just recently my mom was telling me
about some relatives we have back in russia and my
uncle he took his um he basically took his life
savings and he wanted to buy a condo in russia
in moscow so he purchased a condo it was going
to be a new development they were building a whole
new high-rise where one of the build one of the
condo units would be his he paid them for it
he paid them cash up front and then um the
company went bankrupt and years have passed now and he
still doesn't have his condo and he probably never will
that kind of stuff is extremely common in russia very
easy to get scammed out of your life savings that
way so these are just sort of a a random
collection of stories from my own life i'm sure you
have some of your own uh but it's these kinds
of examples that made me even more savvy to being
conned and scammed and exploited so anyways now let's move
on to the actual tips for how to avoid these
kinds of scams because really this is pretty serious uh
if you're not careful with how you manage your finances
and if you're very naive and gullible you can easily
lose your entire life savings you can lose your retirement
you can get screwed over in various kinds of investments
you can lose your house you can lose your condo
you can lose your car your boat you know very
high value assets there are like it can this kind
of stuff can destroy your life if you're not careful
so it really is worth spending some time contemplating how
these kinds of cons and scams work and making yourself
immune to them because i'm telling you this can save
you hundreds of thousands of dollars throughout the course of
your life all right so here's a list of the
top areas where you can get conned and scammed this
is an important list because if you're going into these
areas dealing with these particular domains of life you should
be extra careful extra savvy extra vigilant about getting scammed
so any kind of large cash purchases a car a
house a boat this kind of stuff especially if you're
paying money up front if you're making big deposits if
a lot of money is involved tens of thousands or
hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars you've got to
be super super careful because there's always going to be
connors and scam scammers when big money like that is
at play next is the domain of business partnerships and
legal contracts you can get easily screwed over with any
kind of legal contract that's why you have to read
them carefully don't just take someone's word on a legal
contract it's not just okay to just sign a legal
contract you have to read the whole thing especially if
you do any kind of business if you're engaging in
any kind of business partnerships where it's you and some
other company that you're partnering with you have to be
very careful with how those partnerships are negotiated how the
terms are set when you're going to be paid you
have to be extra careful about situations where you're delivering
goods to somebody and then they're promising to pay you
30 days or 60 days afterwards right because they could
go out of business or they could run out of
money or they could just decide not to pay you
and how are you going to enforce that in many
cases you can't or it might take you years and
years in a courtroom to enforce it or it might
cost you tens of thousand dollars of dollars to hire
an attorney to enforce it and even then you might
not be able to get your money back even if
you win the lawsuit so be careful there the next
category of of thing is investments wall street crypto nfts
celebrity endorsements and real estate all of these are rife
with scams and cons and people trying to get your
money and especially nowadays with crypto and nfts there's so
much scam potential there it's like the hot new thing
but probably 90 of crypto and nfts are just pure
out scams pump and dump schemes and so forth so
you have to be extremely careful which is not to
say that crypto is invalid or that there's no legitimate
use to it or some legitimate use to nfts but
just like the hype and the mania that you see
right now uh around crypto and nfts you can tell
that most of it is way over inflated um way
over marketed and a lot of it is just scams
and people are losing thousands and even millions of dollars
in these scams and in general any kind of investment
products especially exotic new investment products that promise you a
lot of return on your investment watch out the next
category is loans credit cards payday loans and financial instruments
of various kinds these are rife for exploitation the next
category is insurance health insurance life insurance annuities car insurance
home insurance travel insurance the entire insurance industry is extremely
sleazy scammy the way they craft the insurance contracts a
lot of times you may not get what you think
you're going to get in terms of payouts for your
insurance there's all sorts of caveats and ways that they
will screw you over so watch out for that a
lot of money is made in insurance and basically insurance
is a scheme for exploiting people that's why people who
work at insurance make a lot of money because you
don't have to work very hard but yet you can
make a lot of money through selling insurance it tends
to be a very shady industry and in general you
should watch out for these industries that are shady and
be extra extra careful when you're doing business with those
kinds of industries the next category is marketing ads sales
discounts freebies free promotions the way pricing is done on
products coupons rewards cards rewards programs all this kind of
marketing stuff that is trying to save you money uh
actually all of it is designed to make money for
these companies so whenever you're being promised that oh you're
going to save a lot of money with this coupon
a lot of money with a sale a lot of
money with this discount just think about it a little
bit like why would some giant corporation who doesn't know
or care about you be trying to save you money
they're not trying to save you money they're making themselves
money so if they're trying to save you money if
that's what they're pitching to you you have to start
to think how that's actually making money for them and
a lot of times their marketing programs and campaigns their
ads they're very deceptive they try to lure you in
with sort of fake cheap pricing sales and discounts and
all this then there's upsells that they do they promise
you freebies to get you in then once you get
your freebie then they upsell you or they have extra
charges extra fees etc etc and that's how they get
you so always be wary of of sales and deals
that seem too good to be true because that's that's
them baiting you in that's the little bait that they
put on the hook to hook you the next category
is business in a box solutions and get rich quick
schemes this is huge the get rich quick scheme industry
is one of the most shadiest and scammiest industries because
people who want to get rich quick these are the
perfect marks these are the perfect gullible fools to con
these kinds of people they're desperate they want money fast
and then they're gonna they're gonna pay or do anything
to get their money fast or to get some business
in a box idea or solution or system and then
of course none of these things are gonna be sustainable
none of them are really gonna work and you're not
actually going to get rich quick you're going to lose
all your money what little money you have you're going
to lose all that and end up with nothing that's
generally how these get rich quick schemes work they prey
on on the desperate and the gullible the next category
is passive income schemes or promises of passive income where
you have to do any work but you get money
every month and mlm schemes multi-level marketing schemes these are
notorious notorious scams basically their pyramid schemes the next category
is door to door salesman you have to be careful
because of course the door-to-door salesman comes to your door
tries to sell you something and then you're never going
to see that person again you're never going to be
able to return the product the warranty who are you
going to call for the warranty like that kind of
stuff speaking of which the next category of exploit and
scam is money back guarantees warranties and testimonials a lot
of companies offer money back guarantees that they don't actually
honor you should basically expect that if somebody is offering
you a money back guarantee on some product they're probably
not going to honor it you should also expect that
most warranty programs are scams and a lot of warranty
programs will not be honored or if they will under
very strict conditions with a lot of caveats and a
lot of exceptions and exclusions and then you should also
understand that a lot of testimonials that you see online
testimonials various kinds of products they're just fake so you
shouldn't trust testimonials or if they're not fake they're extremely
cherry-picked and they're not representative of the actual results the
product will deliver for you the next category is employment
negotiations and basically any kind of contracts employment contracts and
so on so when you're negotiating your salary with an
employee any kind of job contract make sure you get
it reviewed by your attorney make sure you read all
the fine print and look at all the ways that
the contract could screw you over or that you could
be screwed out of your salary your bonus your you
know whatever is promised to you the next category is
lotteries sweepstakes and free giveaways these are notorious scams and
a waste of your time and your money that's the
bottom line with those you should just immediately avoid any
lottery sweepstakes or free giveaways for the rest of your
life nothing good will come from that even even winning
one of these lotteries sweepstakes or free giveaways you think
you actually won but you didn't you didn't win you're
gonna actually end up losing in the end the next
category interestingly enough is self-help the self-help industry is actually
notoriously scammy and exploitative the self-help industry and also the
business seminar industry there's a whole industry for teaching people
how to start their businesses and becoming financially independent and
um the way that this kind of stuff is sold
and taught is very scammy they do a lot of
upselling they use various kinds of pressure sales tactics to
get you to buy more and more of their courses
their products their books their seminars their workshops eventually you
end up investing thousands of dollars tens of thousands of
dollars in these very expensive courses that promise you that
you're going to become a great entrepreneur or they're going
to show you some secret technique for how to corner
the market or whatever um and that's going to pay
you great dividends and then of course it doesn't pan
out unfortunately a lot of the self-help industry is stage
orange spider-dynamic stage orange and a lot of them use
high pressure sales tactics to upsell you on self-help products
that you don't really need that are way overpriced and
they know how to get you to buy that stuff
the most self-help industry seminars are designed first and foremost
using this kind of structure in order to to slowly
lure you in into buying higher and higher priced courses
and they end up wasting a lot of your money
this way the next category is everything related to sex
and to love see and this is such an obvious
one because sex and love we crave this so much
these are like deep cravings that every human being has
to be loved and to have sex and so of
course this makes us very susceptible to being conned and
scammed and exploited in this domain and there's like sub-domains
of this domain so you have to be very careful
about not getting exploited in sexual relationships when you're dating
in intimate relationships when it comes to pornography the purchasing
of pornography porn sites porn sites that have a lot
of like shady scammy stuff like a lot of times
you enter your your credit card number into a porn
site they will sell your credit card number they will
overcharge you that kind of stuff uh strip clubs are
notorious for um for robbing you of your money exploiting
you conning you strippers are really good at that strippers
have better game than than puas prostitutes if it comes
to prostitution that's that's a very shady industry where you
can easily get scammed and exploited and the pickup industry
even though i've taught aspects of pickup and i have
a lot of experience with pickup i also like when
i entered the pickup industry i was very very aware
of how shady the industry is how shady the coaches
are it attracts sort of like the scum or the
bottom of the barrel type of people the people who
sell pick up material sell pick up courses market pick
up to you promise you to get laid with girls
all this sorts of stuff i'm not saying that pickup
doesn't work a lot of the advice is great but
you have to be very careful because of well honestly
the coaches that are selling pickup products and services a
lot of times they are gaming the guys more than
they're gaming the girls because their attitude towards women is
is pretty shallow and they game women and they manipulate
women and of course that attitude that then just translates
to the guys who are the customers who also want
to learn how to manipulate women so people who are
into manipulating a lot people who are trying to teach
you how to manipulate women you have to understand that
these people have no ethical qualms they will also then
use those same tactics to manipulate men to get them
to pay a lot of money so they will lie
they will exaggerate they will promise you things that aren't
true and they will exploit you so be careful and
if you're a woman you have to be careful with
the um with pickup guys who are into pickup because
they will manipulate you and exploit you and and basically
use you for sex that's the classic one classic draft
for women another domain where you can get scammed and
cheated is with hidden fees and monthly subscriptions and more
and more companies are moving to these monthly subscription models
whether it's video games or software services or whatever else
and that's how they get you joining any kind of
fringe communities or groups cults religion spirituality uh oddly enough
funnily enough there's a there's a lot of exploitation scamming
and calling that comes within the spiritual community and the
new age community so you have to be extra careful
there and that one is is particularly devious because the
new age community and the spiritual community it seems like
oh well you know spirituality in the new age it's
it's non-dogmatic it's not ideological it's beyond religion it's not
like an orthodox religion um and it's all about love
and it's about all about sort of like community and
being together and having compassion and being conscious all this
sorts of stuff right you get all these ideas in
your head and then of course that makes you the
perfect target for scams and exploits once you're you're a
part of such a community uh i've heard in many
many cases where spiritual communities and cults leech tens of
thousands of dollars from their followers and members basically brainwashing
them and it becomes especially easy because you know as
part of the new age and spirituality you can say
that oh you know material material concerns aren't important right
and then so it's like well if material concerns aren't
important then why don't you just give me all your
money that's how it kind of works and then if
you're brainwashed into that you might actually do that you
might actually say yeah why do i need my life
savings why don't i just give my life savings to
this guru he needs it to enlighten the world something
like that the next category is doctors dentists alternative medicine
mainstream medicine miracle cures and other kinds of new age
cures so the medical industry is extremely exploitative and scammy
and it's funny because they screw you on both ends
you can kind of divide the medical industry into two
halves you've got the mainstream traditional orthodox kind of like
western medicine that you find just you know normal doctors
and hospitals and insurance companies they have they have designed
basically in the united states and in many other countries
too the health insurance industry is designed in such a
way to be like a cartel that screws you over
for any kind of medical complication that you have and
service that you need it's so baked into the system
that most people don't even realize that it is a
cartel and it's it's completely a rigged game um [Music]
these insurance companies are overcharging they're denying coverage for various
kinds of conditions the doctors are corrupted and influenced by
the pharmaceutical companies who pay them to pitch their pills
and products um a lot of times these doctors are
so corrupted that they end up they end up selling
you and prescribing to you pills and medications that are
dangerous or that you don't even need or that will
harm your health long term just because they're incentivized to
do so by the big pharma companies their marketing campaigns
and so forth so there's that whole problem within mainstream
medicine but then you say well okay so screw that
that's all sort of like very corporate and you know
corporations are greedy we all know that so then you
make this you kind of swing your pendulum towards the
alternative medicine field the other half of this equation and
sort of like the new age community and there they
promise you various kinds of miracle cures and natural remedies
and ointments and basically snake oil um they prey on
your hopes and they prey on the the fact that
oh you know this is this is an all-natural way
you know and we're not very corporate here so we're
not going to screw your cause we're not some big
giant greedy big pharma company but actually what they're selling
you might even be more dangerous and even worse than
what you find from some big pharma company um and
this is actually been very very obviously the case with
what happened with covid so see a lot of people
have reacted against the covet vaccines by thinking like well
the cova vaccines are manufactured by the government and by
big pharma and by like these giant corporations which only
care about profits that's true a lot of these companies
only care about profits and there is corruption in those
industries and in the government that's true but then they
say like they kind of swing their pendulum to the
opposite end and they just go for like miracle cures
and unscientific treatments like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or you know
whatever other you know alternative treatments there are out there
that it's actually even worse it's worse than a vaccine
and so people are very confused about this like they
take they're reacting against the corporate mainstream media or government
or corporations and then they end up painting themselves into
a corner where they're more like new agey or alternative
medicine and that actually ends up hurting them even more
right just because just because the giant corporations are are
hungry for profits doesn't mean that your alternative cure is
actually healthy or good for you or scientifically valid so
you have to be careful you have to use nuance
another domain where you can get scammed and exploited is
of course politics and within media talk radio fox news
alex jones tugger carlson people like this these are grifters
who are selling various kinds of like right-wing ideologies and
of course it's not exclusive to writing ideologies you can
see this with left as well but it's very very
blatant with right-wing ideologies they sell you right-wing ideologies and
then they use that to get donations from you to
get you to be politically active to participate and so
a lot of the stuff that we saw over the
last five years with the whole trump maga phenomena was
basically a giant scam and con that was perpetrated by
trump and his lackeys and sympathizers on like 30 percent
of the american population that's what's so amazing like in
history when we look back on the trump era 50
years from now 100 years from now that whole you
know four years five years of trump and the maga
movement and the whole you know storming of the capital
and the big lie about stealing the election and election
fraud and all this sort of stuff like all of
that and all of trump's antics it's all going to
be just seen as one giant con basically a con
artist was able to fool 30 of the american population
into blindly supporting him that's pretty remarkable and of course
the only reason that was possible is because of the
low consciousness of far right ideology you can easily use
far-right ideology to [ __ ] people to manipulate them
and to basically turn them into political zombies where they
end up acting on your behalf to do despicable things
like trying to overturn democracy or storming the capital and
that's precisely what makes right-wing ideology lower consciousness than left-wing
ideology now i'm not saying left-wing ideology can't be hijacked
and used for selfish and nefarious purposes it can but
less so than right-wing ideology and that distinction is lost
on a lot of people because they want to make
a false equivalence between left and right but they're not
equivalent as i've explained elsewhere uh another domain is social
media friend requests and emails so you have to be
very careful with phishing emails you have to be very
careful on social media people trying to become your friend
messaging you out of the blue trying to slide into
your dms or whatever else a lot of times they
have an ulterior motive they don't really want to be
your friend they want to get something out of you
they want to scam you in some way they want
to manipulate you in some way another domain is tourist
situations when you're a tourist traveling around you're at a
disadvantage because you're naive you're in a new country there's
probably a language that you don't know how to speak
or fully understand and so you're inexperienced in a new
place and that makes you very vulnerable and a lot
of times tourists get scammed by locals by various kinds
of businesses timeshare programs and other kinds of scams that
tourists fall for another domain is the dark net drugs
and psychedelics of course the entire drug industry is very
shady and if you're going to be purchasing illegal drugs
through the internet or even semi-legal drugs through the gray
sort of market um research chemicals and this sort of
stuff you have to be extra careful because a lot
of times these are scams or exploits and they will
steal your money and of course on the dark net
if you're gonna be using the dark net um that's
notorious for all sorts of scams and the last domain
is when companies close and go out of business you
have to be careful when your company that you're working
for as a salaried employee is on the brink of
going broke you have to be very careful that you
get your money from them you get your salary from
them as soon as possible and you don't do any
free work for them with you know promises that they'll
pay you back later because in practice they won't in
fact this happened to my brother he worked for an
online startup company in texas he worked for them for
like five years as a programmer and it was obvious
that the company was not doing well financially and that
they were they were bleeding money every year and you
know him and i we talked about that and i
always wondered like you know where they're getting their money
from they had some wealthy investors i think from the
middle east or something like that but in any situation
where your business or your company that you're working for
is not actually generating profit itself but is relying on
some sort of external investor you can tell that eventually
the money is going to run dry the investor's going
to pull out and what ends up happening is the
company has no more money to pay its employees and
so sure enough that company went broke after about five
years the investors pulled out um and my brother lost
a month or two of of work that he did
for them under salary he just lost that money because
they couldn't afford to pay him so be careful about
that all right so that's the list of domains um
now let me give you a list of examples of
like sometimes there's an outright con or scam but other
times you get exploited in more subtle ways and i
want to give you some examples of this so you're
that you're kind of savvy about this like for example
i really noticed this recently when i was buying a
house i bought my house a couple of years ago
right in the middle of covet actually a little bit
before covid and it was interesting because it was my
first time buying a house and it was a big
purchase and um i went into it very eyes open
very careful because you know anytime a big purchase is
involved where you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars
you have to be very very careful because you know
you can get screwed in many different ways so i
went to the situation with my eyes open but even
so um i could see how i was being exploited
in various ways like one of the ways that they'll
exploit you when you're buying a new house not an
old house but like a brand new one that they're
building for you which is what i'm buying is a
new construction what they do is the way they sell
it to you is they sell it to you by
showing you a model of the house so usually they'll
have three or four models which are houses they already
built that are just completely decked out they're decked out
with fancy tile fancy wallpaper fancy wood trims and fancy
backyard and lunch like fancy lighting fancy furniture like everything
like these houses so what's funny is that let's say
a house like in a neighborhood of new construction you're
looking to buy a house that maybe cost 600 000
on average right that's what they want to sell you
but the models that they show you those houses are
decked out with an additional double that amount of decor
upgrades and so on so when you're walking through a
model for a six hundred thousand dollar house what you
have to realize is that actually that model cost the
builder 1.2 million but of course you walk through it
you're so amazed like oh my god this house is
amazing this is what i'm going to get for 600
000 a house like this incredible of course i want
to buy it and then when you get your real
house it doesn't look nearly as nice because it doesn't
have all the upgrades but when you sign the contract
and you made the deposit you were if you're naive
you were assuming that your house was going to be
somewhat similar to this million dollar house this model that
they showed you so i knew that was the case
but even still like it's it's so difficult not to
get um hypnotized by these new house models because they're
they're just so gorgeous they're so well done they're so
well decorated so one of the techniques that i use
to to kind of ground myself in reality when i
was buying this house is first of all i asked
them to go see actual houses that they were selling
to customers so it's one thing to look at models
because those are all decked out with furniture and trimmings
and stuff it's another thing to actually say show me
a house that you just finished building that's not decked
out yet with no upgrades in it you go and
look at that that's actually what you're buying and there's
going to be a night and day difference between those
two so that helps to get you a realistic idea
of what you're paying for furthermore like i actually went
with the real estate agent who was selling me the
house i went with her through one of these model
houses and every item in the house i would point
to and say is that standard or is that an
upgrade so like is the flooring in this house standard
or upgrade and she would say it's an upgrade it's
like is the backyard standard or upgrade it's an upgrade
is the lighting the canned lighting in the house is
that a standard or upgrade oh it's an upgrade so
like everything was an upgrade of course and that gives
you an idea of you know of what you'll actually
be getting and then of course i would also ask
i asked for an itemized list of every possible upgrade
and what it costs so i got like a a
50-page document that contained literally every possible upgrade that the
house could have and what it costs and so i
sat through and i looked through it very meticulously just
to get an idea of what it would actually cost
for me to make the upgrades that i wanted on
my house and in the end i actually came out
on top and i got the kind of house that
i wanted and i'm pretty happy with the house that
i bought but like i was i was very meticulous
in fact i was so meticulous that the the lady
who was telling me the house she's like oh my
god like you're the most meticulous person you're like the
most anal person who's ever purchased a house for me
like she was making fun of me but i knew
while she was making fun of me for that like
i knew the importance of doing that because if you
don't do that if you just kind of bumble in
there like a fool um you're going to get screwed
other subtle exploits the food industry is great at exploiting
you you'll notice that have you noticed that when you
purchase a bag of chips at the store potato chips
or you purchase a bottle of supplements or you purchase
a bottle of like olive oil a lot of times
the packaging is designed in such a way to make
the package look twice as large as actually what you're
getting in the package like you can get a bag
of lace potato chips that's this big but only half
of it is actually filled with chips that's a subtle
way that laze is exploiting you right because they could
make the package exactly the volume of the chips but
if they did that you would actually you wouldn't want
to pay as much for it because subconsciously you would
think like why am i paying that much money for
such such a small bag of chips if you're paying
you know five dollars you want a giant bag of
chips subconsciously this all registers in your mind and all
of these companies know that uh sometimes when you buy
a bottle of olive oil if you look underneath the
bottle of olive oil there's like a giant like dimple
in there that goes like halfway up the bottle so
you think you're getting a bottle like this but actually
the the bottom inside of it is carved out like
a third of it is carved out so you're really
you're only getting two-thirds of what you thought you were
getting uh supplements are also like this you can get
a bond a bottle of pills that's a supplement that
looks like this big like you know a bottle of
vitamin c or something and then you open it and
like a third of it is empty why do they
do that because subconsciously this gets you to pay more
money than you otherwise would another subtle exploit for example
is college textbooks college textbooks are deliberately designed to exploit
college students to sell you a new textbook for some
ridiculous amount of money every single year by just you
know changing a few parts of the textbook nothing substantial
is being added to it so that you couldn't even
buy old used books because you know the the teacher
and the curriculum is going to use the latest edition
with you know assigning homework assignments from that latest edition
they changed the homework assignments and the numbers so that
you couldn't use the old editions to get you to
you know pay them more than you should in a
certain sense the entire university system is like a scheme
to exploit students by getting them to get loans and
this is especially true for for many private universities especially
true for online universities talk about a shady industry online
universities there you go and the kind of loans that
they want you to get on their behalf to pay
for their shitty education uh the medical industry with the
the way that hospitals bill you um it's it's absurd
i mean it it basically should be criminal like i
remember i wanted i needed i was i was having
a bad reaction to some antibiotics that i took a
year or two ago and i actually called i was
thinking i might need to go to the emergency room
for some of the reactions i was having and i
called a few of the hospitals in my area just
to find out like what would it cost without insurance
because i didn't have insurance what would it cost to
go to the emergency room and it's so galling because
you call the receptionist there and you just want to
know you know what does it cost just to get
a basic admittance into the emergency room and they don't
they don't give you a price and they actually teach
the receptionist there to [ __ ] you about why
they can't give you a price i mean they know
how much it costs this is not a mystery to
them this is something they do on a daily basis
um but of course they don't reveal the prices to
why so that once you go there then they can
charge you some ridiculous amount and then you can't dispute
it you didn't even have an option to to shop
around they don't want you shopping around emergency rooms they
want you just to go to the nearest emergency room
when you have an emergency and then because you have
an emergency since it's an emergency you don't have the
luxury of shopping around see i was trying to shop
around like early before my emergency got so severe that
i had to go there i was trying to do
a little shopping around beforehand but they don't want you
doing that why because then they can't they can't charge
you the maximum rates they don't want you thinking about
what it costs they also don't want you thinking about
how overpriced it is other subtle exploits you should be
careful of is in intimate relationships both for men and
for women there are certain kinds of women who will
exploit men for financial favors and then there are certain
kinds of men who will exploit women who are gullible
enough who fall in love with them then those men
who are deadbeats will exploit those women you know to
get money out of them to pay for their loans
and so forth so you have to be very careful
not to mix your love life with your finances make
a clear separation between these two if somebody truly loves
you if you're in love with a man or a
woman then you might think like well because i love
her or because he loves me we should be able
to just share money freely back and forth and it's
okay for me to to buy this thing and for
him to buy this thing and for for me to
take out alone on his behalf this kind of stuff
like no as soon as you mix your love with
finances that's going to ruin your love you see true
love is not going to require you to take out
a loan true love is not going to require you
to buy some expensive thing like some really expensive jewelry
or some expensive fancy vacation like if a woman really
loves you she's not going to require those things of
you and and if a man really loves you and
respects you he's not going to be trying to get
money out of you if your partner is doing that
that's a huge red flag huge red flag so those
are just some examples of like subtle exploits that are
i wouldn't call them scams per se but they're definitely
exploiting you in subtle ways and a lot of times
these subtle exploits they're so subtle and they're so systemic
i would call it a systemic scam in which the
people that are playing part of the system and actually
actualizing the scam the people themselves who are doing that
they don't even know the scam they're participating in so
for example when i call a receptionist at an emergency
room and ask her you know what are the can
you give me an itemized list of what it costs
to get admitted and various procedures that i might need
and she says oh no sorry sir like we don't
do that because of xyz reasons see she's giving me
some excuses that someone higher up from than her has
designed deliberately some businessman designed these excuses and then trained
her to give these excuses to me and when she's
giving those excuses it's not that she's consciously scamming me
she doesn't even understand what she's doing she's participating in
this hospital emergency room system which is orchestrated as a
scam a systemic scam that is so systemic that the
the individual participants the receptionist the janitor that works there
um the nurses and even the doctors in the emergency
room they're not fully conscious of the scan that's being
run by the emergency room they think they're just doing
good work and in a certain sense they're just doing
good work they're just following orders and they're doing their
little part in a giant machine which is ultimately preying
on people who have health emergencies same thing for example
with with like the university system most of the people
working in a university are not con artists or scammers
the professors aren't con artists the guidance counselors aren't con
artists um the administrators in the university are not con
artists but together it all comes together in such a
way that the loans of the university wants you to
take out the overpriced textbooks that they want you to
buy and other things like that that is all part
of a a systemic scam that is being run and
it's really a survival strategy for the university so you
have to you have to understand that there's ways to
get exploited and screwed in life which is not necessarily
done consciously just by some evil malicious uh sociopathic individual
or con artist you know the classic con artist like
victor lestig a lot of times you'll get scammed and
exploited in more subtle ways in more systemic ways where
there's not going to be one manipulative individual that you
can easily blame who's at fault and so when it
comes to these kinds of systemic scams health insurance life
insurance hospital system university system various kinds of charities government
organizations fall into that category so to get good at
not being scammed you have to become good at judging
character because fundamentally con artists manipulators scammers cheaters grifters they
have it baked into their character it's an attitude and
you can learn to sniff that out you can develop
an intuition for it so here i'm going to give
you a long list of ways in which you can
start to sniff this out so for example if you're
promised grandiose promises or lots of promises and the person
tends to exaggerate and to boast this is a red
flag if someone is promising to make you rich quick
or to bring you lots of business this is a
red flag if somebody is overly slick very charismatic a
really good storyteller very extroverted just like very um has
a very captivating personality very eloquent dress is very nice
as a great style all of these are a red
flag now of course a lot of times people just
dress nice and they're extroverted and they're eloquent and they're
normal they're not they're not con artists and they're not
going to scam you but it's definitely a red flag
you want to um you want to be careful about
because eloquence and style and this kind of flash and
this kind of like smooth talking this is a great
way to let down your guard that allows you to
be scammed because then you start to trust the person
you develop a rapport with the person you feel like
they're your best friend you feel like they're such a
good storyteller they're so funny so eloquent they're so stylish
they're so charismatic that you forget about the actual substance
of the business deal you forget about the nitty gritty
details you forget to ask hard penetrating questions and then
you end up getting screwed in general you ask the
question does this sound too good to be true and
if it sounds too good to be true that's a
red flag you have to also get good at sussing
out low intel intellectual integrity people some people just have
low intellectual integrity they don't care about the truth and
that's a huge red flag when someone doesn't care about
the truth doesn't value the truth that basically gives them
license to engage in deception and falsehood so it's important
to figure out the person you're dealing with the company
you're dealing with do they value truth and if you
if they don't that's a huge red flag and you
should not be doing business with them you should not
be in a relationship with them you should not be
in a partnership with them because truth is the foundation
for everything if you don't have truth you're going to
have falsehood you're going to have illusion delusion lying cheating
[ __ ] that's the opposite of truth it also
helps for you to be able to assess a person's
level of ego development and if you want help for
how to do that i have several video series i
have my entire spiral dynamics video series that helps you
to understand cognitive development and uh and then i also
have a three-part series called the nine stages of ego
development which explains the susan cagroider model if you study
that model and you go through some of those stages
yourself you you become good enough that you can actually
see what stage of development an individual or even a
corporation or a group of people are operating from what
spiral stage and what ego development stage and this this
gives you a a good idea of how likely it
is that these people will try to exploit you the
lower the stage the lower the level of ego development
the more exploitative and scammy these individuals or groups are
going to be and even just like if you're trying
to get into into an intimate relationship it's really good
to be able to assess your partner's level of spiral
development and ego development and if their level is too
low like you shouldn't be having sex with this person
you shouldn't be turning them into your girlfriend or boyfriend
you shouldn't be marrying them certainly you shouldn't be having
children with them and yet a lot of people just
overlook this and then they you know they have sex
they become girlfriend boyfriends they get married they have children
by the time all that's done um it's too late
they didn't they didn't assess the person's level of development
and now they're they're wedded to this very low consciousness
low level of development individual and there's there's really nothing
you can do to solve that other than to leave
and by that point you're so invested it's very difficult
to leave very painfully another red flag is are your
emotions being manipulated so look how this works fear greed
lust hunger anger laziness desperation love these are the emotions
that are used to separate you from your money another
red flag is is a shortcut being promised are you
being promised some sort of magical shortcut to avoid doing
hard work if you are see what that really is
is the con artist preying on your laziness most people
are so lazy they don't want to work hard they
don't want to work for years and decades to earn
their wealth they want some quick solution they want a
shortcut they don't want to go to the gym and
work out for six months to lose their weight they
don't want to change their diet they don't want to
learn some deep skill set that's going to take them
a decade to master they want some shortcut and then
those shortcuts are what you're sold and of course most
of those shortcuts don't work and they end up disappointing
you or even worse they end up wasting your time
and even hurting your health your wealth and your happiness
so beware of when a thing sounds too easy or
too fast it usually isn't true ask yourself the question
what is the true cost of a thing a lot
of times it's people get scammed because they don't appreciate
the true cost of things like what's the true cost
of being healthy and fit in reality the true cost
of that is changing your diet learning about nutrition going
to the gym working out every single day caring about
your health that's the true cost that's the kind of
stuff that nobody wants to do that everybody wants us
sort of a magic shortcut around or like what's the
true cost of being financially independent and having a passive
income the true cost of that is not a thousand
dollars purchasing a thousand dollar course to become financially independent
you can just see that it doesn't add up the
true cost of of having an actually sustainable stable passive
income uh to get that usually you'd have to work
your ass off for five 10 20 years to get
something like that and something like that is worth hundreds
of thousands or millions of dollars nobody's gonna sell that
to you in a course for a thousand dollars another
way to make yourself immune uh to getting scammed is
ask lots of nuanced questions and be very detail oriented
ask a lot of questions to the point where you
start to annoy the person annoy the salesperson with your
questions let them be annoyed get all the details you
need because it's in those details that you start to
see contradictions and problems you start to see the [
__ ] things don't add up ask for full pricing
a lot of times you go into a situation and
the way the system is designed is that you you
feel uncomfortable or you almost feel bad for asking about
the full pricing of a thing like a lot of
times you go to a dentist and the dentist is
offering you certain services once you're into that in the
dentist chair they will offer you upgrades and you know
additional services and you're just afraid or embarrassed to ask
for the full price before you okay the procedure and
a lot of times they screw you over that way
so make a rule with yourself that you're not going
to agree to any procedure or to any kind of
purchase unless you have the full price beforehand so if
a doctor wants to prescribe you medicine ask them the
price first before you agree to the prescription if a
dentist wants to do a procedure on you ask him
the full price ask him to to print it out
on a piece of paper so you have it before
you agree to anything and if they don't want to
give it to you or they're giving you excuses which
a lot of times they'll do they'll give you excuses
like oh we don't know the true price so like
oh we'll have to talk to insurance or we can
we can discuss that later let's look like don't settle
for for those kinds of excuses get the full price
and if you don't get the full price they don't
want to give you the full price they don't know
the full price tell them then then my decision is
no i'm not purchasing that another question you should ask
yourself when you're investigating these situations is like is this
sustainable a lot of these solutions that are sold are
simply unsustainable and it's pretty obvious a lot of people
they don't have a mind or an eye for sustainability
for me personally whenever i go into a business deal
or i'm considering some investment or uh a partnership with
somebody or whatever i'm always thinking about sustainability is this
sustainable long term because most scammers and con artists are
very short-term thinkers they're not thinking long term about anything
they're not thinking about sustainability they're sort of just they're
looking for some sort of house of cards that looks
like it's sustainable but then it'll collapse as soon as
you pull one of the cards a little bit it
all falls down always contemplate what's in it for them
if somebody is proposing to bring you a lot of
business to make you a lot of money to give
you a great investment idea you always have to wonder
what's in it for them they're not doing it because
they're selfless and altruistic come on what's in it for
them a lot of times what you'll discover is if
you ask that question you can you can start to
see what's in it for them and then you realize
that actually what's in it for them is that they're
they're leaching from you they're gaining more from this relationship
than you are from this transaction from this sale from
this business deal from this partnership they're benefiting more than
you are but they're hiding it from you another helpful
hint here is the principle that actions speak louder than
words words are not honest signals it's very easy to
[ __ ] with words it's easy to exaggerate to
over promise to um to put a positive spin on
on a situation or a product or service with words
so when you're going into a serious negotiation or considering
a serious purchase or something like that never just listen
to the words of the person look at their actions
how do they behave the principle here is that talk
is cheap what are words really worth you can use
words to say anything to sell anything to put a
positive spin on anything what matters is how the person
behaves how the product or service actually behaves that's the
substance look for the substance not the cheap talk talk
is cheap it's very easy to take any bad investment
and to talk it up with fancy words and make
it sound as though it's the greatest thing ever you
have to look into the actual fundamentals of the investment
not the words around it the next tip here is
don't rush into things fools rush in be patient be
deliberate do your research go read go educate yourself do
the due diligence before you jump on board or sign
a contract or sign a check or enter your credit
card number or agree to a purchase or whatever beware
of time sensitive sort of pressure tactics a lot of
sales people and marketing systems will use this on you
they will try to give you a you know a
discount that's only valid for the next 24 hours you
know purchase in the next week otherwise the price is
going to go up these kinds of tactics so a
principle that i've stuck to in my life is that
any time that a business or a marketing campaign or
whatever salesman tries to pressure me into making a quick
decision act now or i'm going to lose out the
answer for me is always no if you're going to
pressure me and if you need me to buy your
product within the next 24 hours the answer by default
is going to be no i'm not buying it i'm
only going to buy it if you give me the
as much time as i want to sit contemplate research
and think about it and if you're not going to
give me that time then the answer is just automatically
no and you can tell that to you know to
the salesperson you're dealing with and a lot of con
artists use this tactic because usually a con is like
a house of cards that is in the process of
collapsing so they don't have a lot of time they
need you to act now they need you to purchase
now because if you wait a few days you're going
to be too sober and their scheme and all their
fancy talk is going to collapse another tip is to
get multiple opinions perspectives on a thing and to shop
around don't buy the first car don't buy the first
house don't get married to the first girl or boy
that you fall in love with shop around see what
the alternatives are if you don't know the alternatives then
something bad can actually seem good when you have nothing
else to compare it against get multiple perspectives talk to
other people who have made these kinds of purchases or
have been involved in these kinds of schemes that you're
considering look for reviews independent reviews not the reviews and
testimonials that are published on their website you have to
find reviews and testimonials yourself from people who have used
this product or this service or have done business with
this person who can vouch for for this company this
service or whatever right independent reviews the next tip is
to check for narcissism sociopathy and mental illness personality disorders
these are deeper topics that i don't have time to
go into here but um people who are con artists
tend to have certain personality defects and traits like narcissism
sociopathy um machiavellianism this is called the dark triad mental
illness personality disorders trauma abuse from childhood this sort of
stuff so you can learn to kind of suss that
out and this is especially important if you're talking about
romantic relationships sexual relationships don't fall in love with a
narcissist a sociopath a mentally ill person someone with borderline
personality disorder this will destroy your life if you fall
in love with someone like this or if you get
married to someone like this or if you have children
with someone like this uh just another general principle here
to make you immune to being conned is know your
own values and stand firm on them set clear boundaries
my life purpose course shows you how to find your
values once you find them then you have to learn
how to how to how to be firm about them
and set boundaries i'll have a whole episode about how
to set boundaries and then another adjacent principle here is
uh don't be too nice and friendly when you're engaged
in these sorts of business transactions don't be a doormat
you have to be willing to say no no is
a very powerful phrase a lot of times when we're
in a sales or business situation we're too scared to
say no we're afraid to be confrontational like you're sitting
in your dentist's chair in his office and he's doing
some procedure on you and then he says well are
you interested in this extra procedure let me do this
on you too and you're afraid to say no and
so you just say yes because you want to be
polite and friendly and you don't want to be confrontational
you have to stop doing that you need to muster
the courage to say no to people if you are
dealing with somebody in some business situation and you see
a few red flags and then finally it comes to
like making a decision are you going to buy this
thing or not are we gonna do business or not
if you see those red flags that should already put
you in the in the sort of default position of
no if there's red flags present like two or three
or more red flags the answer should always be no
no should be the default and yes should be only
in those situations where everything seems to be going well
and a lot of times it's the opposite a lot
of times it's like for people who are overly nice
and friendly their default is yes to everything and no
only in the most extreme situations you need to turn
that around upside down and uh in general um a
lot of people don't like conflict uh don't like to
conf to get confrontational with others and i include myself
in that um i was non-confrontational for a long time
overly friendly overly nice always saying yes to everything and
i had to retrain myself in that and i had
to make myself more willing to be confrontational because otherwise
i just saw myself getting exploited and i was sick
and tired of that so if you're sick and tired
of that then stop being a doormat i'll have i'll
have an episode on how to stop being a doormat
and how to say no that's powerful saying no is
very powerful another tip here for you is be extra
careful when you're in third world countries if you're traveling
to china russia india and honestly most parts of the
world that are outside of like the first world western
democracies you should immediately be on guard as a tourist
in these places for scams there's a whole industry in
all these countries designed just for scamming uh naive gullible
people like you inexperienced people like you who don't know
the language don't know the culture don't know the customs
don't know the traps uh here's some more tips be
extra careful with promises of bonuses and promises of future
profit sharing this is a classic way to get screwed
if your boss or your company or your business partner
says that hey work for me come work for me
for for months and for years and at the end
of that don't worry like right now your salary is
low but at the end of that you'll get a
bonus once our product ships to i'll give you a
bonus and then we'll share revenue and profits with you
once we succeed once we make the the big sale
once we launch the product i'll pay you back and
then you might be tempted to say oh yeah bonus
that sounds really nice you know profit sharing that sounds
really nice and then in reality you're never going to
see that the chances of you getting the bonus or
the profit sharing that you were promised are probably less
than 10 so don't work for people don't give people
months of your time for vague promises of bonuses and
future profit sharing and even if you do get your
bonus it might be a a pitiful little amount and
those future profits that are going to be shared with
you you don't know how much they're going to share
with you like it's that's at their whim they might
share zero they might share one percent you know it
might be pennies like don't don't work for people because
you're putting in hard labor for months on just vague
promises of some kind of profit or bonus which could
be anything or nothing and usually it's nothing beware when
you're in a business negotiation situation or sales situation and
you're being given a large range for example they might
say purchase our course and we will help your business
increase roi return on investment from fifty percent to two
thousand percent see it's a large range it's a very
vague promise increasing our way from roi from fifty percent
to two thousand percent that's that's a huge range the
reality is that you're not gonna get two thousand percent
you're probably not even gonna get fifty percent the low
end of that range so when people give you large
ranges like well you know like if you come to
work for us your salary could be anything between thirty
thousand dollars and a hundred thousand dollars that's a huge
range when someone tells you something like that you always
take the low end so what they mean there is
that your salary is gonna be thirty thousand dollars not
a hundred thousand dollars they put a hundred thousand dollars
in there just to make it seem like it could
be something higher but usually what you end up getting
is the very lowest of the range so be aware
of these large ranges it's a it's a manipulation tactic
uh beware of the following phrases that you can commonly
hear these are red flags i'm definitely going to dot
do dot whatever this is a dead giveaway of somebody
over promising you something whenever words like definitely absolutely for
sure certainly no doubt when these kinds of words are
used these are all red flags if someone says i'm
definitely going to do something in my mind what that
means is what they mean is they're probably not going
to do it it's exactly the opposite right it's like
if someone says i'm absolutely going to show up at
6 00 p.m for our for our coffee in my
mind i'm thinking they're probably not going to show up
at all because if you were going to show up
you wouldn't need to to sort of like amp it
up with these sorts of words like absolutely definitely for
sure certainly you don't need to say that if you're
going to show up you're going to show up you
don't need to hype it up uh another phrase that's
a red flag is i'm looking out for you beware
when someone says that to you i'm looking out for
you or another one you can trust me just trust
me on this when someone says just trust me on
this what they actually mean is you can't be trusted
they can't be trusted if someone says i'm looking out
for you what they really mean is they're looking out
for themselves if someone tells you don't worry leave it
to me i'll handle everything what they really mean is
leave it to them to handle everything for their own
benefit not for your benefit if someone says believe me
don't believe them if someone says ah but what do
you have to lose you have nothing to lose what
that actually means is you have something to lose there's
always something to lose whenever someone tells me oh you
have nothing to lose just try this it's obvious they're
bullshitting me so just be aware of these common salesy
markety bullshitty tactics beware of emotional stories from strangers overly
emotional stories that tug at your heartstrings this is emotional
manipulation beware that beware of what's called fomo fear of
missing out so a lot of times to get you
to act fast and to buy something immediately a story
is presented of like this is the greatest thing and
it's only gonna last for a limited number uh number
of days short amount of time act now or you're
going to lose your chance fear of missing out fomo
anytime you feel that kind of pressure to act the
default answer should be no i'm not investing i'm not
buying i'm not doing business with you beware of deflection
and changing the subject for example you're asking some penetrating
questions you're asking nuanced questions and then you might get
ridiculed for that or some the salesperson will somehow deflect
change the subject to talk about something else rather than
answering your questions that's a red flag if you're dealing
with somebody uh expect you should have an expectation that
they give you direct answers to your questions if they're
deflecting if they're dodging and weaving and changing the subject
or they're cracking jokes and stuff like that without actually
giving you definitive answers to your questions then the default
answer to them should be no then we're not doing
business then i'm not buying another very powerful principle is
when it comes to lending money never lend money to
anyone it's very simple never lend money to anyone especially
your friends and your family and your romantic partner make
a principle that you're not going to mix finances with
love because see people who are close to you friends
and family and your lovers and so forth they can
make you feel like oh but if you love me
then you should lend me money because you know we're
so close i understand why you wouldn't lend money to
a stranger but we're family or we're sleeping together so
of course you should trust me to lend me money
no no as soon as you lend money to somebody
you love like a brother a father a mother a
sister a cousin a friend a lover that immediately changes
the dynamic of the relationship from one which is just
based on on love and um [Music] and genuine care
and compassion for each other to a business transaction why
would you want to do that if they truly loved
you they wouldn't put you into a position where you
where your relationship with them now becomes financial see a
high quality person is not going to come to you
asking for a loan even when they really need it
they won't do that to you because they value the
relationship too much and the final point here is uh
you have to make a distinction between the facade or
the surface of a thing versus the substance of a
thing so there's like the facade or the surface of
a product or a service or a relationship or a
partnership the facade of it and then the actual substance
of it like when you're talking about an investment right
like you're investing into a house there's the facade of
the house and then there's actual substance of the house
the structure of it is it a solid house is
it built on a solid foundation is it properly constructed
is it in the right location is it's going to
hold it is it going to hold its value what
is the quality of the materials that are used in
the construction this is the substance and then the surface
and the facade is like you know the the you
know like the landscaping outside the house and various kinds
of marketing gimmickry and whatever sale is happening right now
and they're promising to take 50 000 off the top
of the of the price you know this guy this
is this is the facade of it you have to
always go go to the fundamentals to the substance of
a thing and even when you're dealing with people there's
the facade of the person and then there's the substance
of the person their true character what they're really like
when they are not on so to speak when they're
not trying to manipulate you what are they really like
what are their values what are their standards for behavior
what is their level of integrity how much do they
care about the truth how much do they really embody
love these are the substance and the facade is like
what they look like the makeup they put on the
the uh maybe the the funny stories they tell the
kind of suit they wear this is the facade that's
not the important stuff you have to be able to
see through that stuff like you know how well they
dress that's a facade like you can have a horrible
person dress really nice so you can't judge a person
by how they dress and likewise you can have a
horrible person tell you interesting charming stories and crack jokes
with you and build a sort of a friendly rapport
with you a horrible person a psychopath can do that
but the substance there is that it's a psychopath with
this pleasant facade so beware of these facades and don't
make excuses for all these red flags if you are
going into a situation whether it's a relationship a partnership
a business deal a sale whatever and you notice three
let's say three or more of these red flags that
should automatically put you into the default of no and
then make it put the burden on that person or
that party to then change your mind maybe maybe these
red flags are not a deal breaker maybe you're just
you know a little bit overly cautious but so what
it's better to be overly cautious than to get screwed
in this case so the default after a few red
flags is no unless that person is is willing to
do some work and and address the red flags you
can bring up the red flags of them see how
they react to them maybe they can address maybe they
have some legitimate justifications or excuses or maybe there's some
miscommunication that's fine then you can still go forward but
by default unless they address it it's a no see
like for example you go into a situation and the
salesperson says okay you you have you have to decide
to buy this house in the next week that's a
red flag that would be a red flag for me
and then maybe i would say well i'm interested in
this house but i don't like being pressured so um
why do i have to do it in next week
that seems contrived and artificial do you have a good
reason for why it has to be next week or
are you just saying that because you want me to
buy this buy the house right see and if they
can if they can address that and they say well
yeah honestly we already have like we have somebody who's
already looking at the house so if they buy it
before you then you're going to lose this house like
and if they're not lying to you that can be
legitimate you know that can be a legitimate thing maybe
you know in a hot housing market you don't have
a lot of time to buy a house sometimes uh
but also a lot of times they can just lie
to you about that so you have to kind of
suss it out and see is the time sensitivity truly
legitimate or is just some [ __ ] marketing tactic
sales tactic um so that's what i mean by these
red flags um in general sales people con artists and
scammers they prey on your emotional vulnerabilities and your egos
desires needs weaknesses and insecurities do you see how this
works because the human mind is not primarily run by
logic and reason it's mostly run by emotions most purchase
decisions are made on emotions not on cold logic and
facts and science and of course all marketers advertisers sales
people and con artists understand this either explicitly or just
intuitively they understand this but you know a lot of
marketers are actually taught this explicitly these days a lot
of marketing courses will teach you that you know to
make a sale you have to prey on the fears
and insecurities of your customers like literally that's what they
teach you they're shameless about it so con artists tend
to prey on the inexperienced con artists prey on the
desperate con artists prey on the greedy and the lazy
con artists prey on the impatient and con artists play
on your fear these five things are huge lack of
experience desperation greed and laziness impatience and fear and if
you have all of these combined together you're the perfect
mark but even just one of these will be enough
to to scam you so the root solution here to
make yourself immune from being scammed is to take care
of that gain massive experience be well educated stop being
desperate and needy in the situation that you go into
because if you're gonna be desperate that's the surest way
to get screwed over because then you have a choice
see if if you get stabbed in the gut you're
in a desperate situation you need an emergency room right
[ __ ] now you don't have time to shop
around for emergency rooms so you're just going to get
taken to the nearest emergency room and of course they're
going to screw you over on the billing because you're
desperate see what you should have done is you should
have researched these emergency rooms before you got stabbed not
afterwards then you wouldn't have been desperate but that requires
that you look forward you have to have like a
vision a long time horizon when you're planning out your
life if you're just sort of like reacting all the
time in your life you're constantly desperate you're putting yourself
in desperate situations like you don't have enough money so
you got to go get a payday loan which is
going to screw you over or you're desperate for sex
so you go and you make some deal with a
prostitute and then she screws you over you see how
this works or you're desperate for love and a boyfriend
and so you fall in love with with the first
guy you sleep with and then he screws you over
see how that works and then if you're greedy and
you're lazy of course that makes you a really easy
mark if you're impatient too and if you're afraid when
you're in the grip of fear it's very easy to
um to sell to you and that's what most marketers
and advertisers do is they prey on your fear going
through extreme life changes makes you the most vulnerable to
scams and cons a lot of times for example cults
and religions they have an entire marketing strategy designed around
this they specifically look for people who are vulnerable who
are going through an extreme life change for example they
will look for alcoholics they will look for drug addicts
they will look for people who just got divorced they
will look for somebody who just lost someone in their
family somebody died you know a parent or child of
theirs died now they're very vulnerable now you can sell
them on any kind of new age cult any kind
of miracle cure or a course or like let's say
uh somebody just got diagnosed with a terminal disease cancer
or something like that this person is so desperate that
they will they will pay money for any kind of
miracle cure at that point so if you're in a
vulnerable place in your life if you're going through an
extreme life transition through a divorce through a death in
the family through a loss of your job through a
career change through the loss of your business bankruptcy right
there are entire professions and industries designed to prey on
people like you going through that specific situation there are
entire industries designed to prey on people who just got
a cancer diagnosis there are entire industries looking to exploit
people who just got divorced or going through a divorce
there are entire industries that are looking to to brainwash
people who are addicted to substances because they're very vulnerable
the best way to avoid getting scammed is to have
a strong character low ego develop yourself educate yourself be
non-needy be detached from outcome be fearless be hard-working have
intellectual integrity be experienced be patient be long-term oriented and
be principled have principles that you live by and in
general don't be so survival oriented be oriented towards something
higher than just survival or just pure utility in other
words become more conscious and more integris this is the
ultimate solution to getting scammed and exploited by others lack
of consciousness leads to illusion and self-deception unconscious people are
very easily manipulated their minds are easily controlled their minds
can be filled with all sorts of stories and ideologies
and belief systems that basically turn these people into zombies
and human beings have been controlling other human beings in
this way since the dawn of time so you should
be wise to this and not let anybody manipulate you
like that and the way you do that fundamentally is
through all the ways i just mentioned above i mean
first and foremost by raising your consciousness developing yourself working
hard and being experienced and well educated i want to
make a specific point here to to women you ladies
need to be extra careful about guys scamming you in
the domain of intimacy and love there are categories of
men out there not all men but some men who
prey on this because once you ladies have sex you
fall in love it becomes a chemical addiction for you
and um and basically men are are gonna almost say
anything to you to get laid and so um once
you fall in love with them then it's very easy
for them a lot of times to manipulate you especially
if you don't have a firm sense of your own
values and how to set boundaries a lot of women
fall into this trap of being overly compassionate in a
feminine way overly loving overly loyal to the point where
men just exploit that because you fall in love with
them and this can destroy your whole life for some
women this is the whole story of their life is
that they fall in love with some guy or a
series of guys who just um take and take and
take leech and leech and leech and leech and suck
you dry and leave you hanging in the end so
i want you to be very savvy about that which
of course is not to say that you should be
paranoid and not fall in love with men it's just
that before you fall in love with them really assess
their character who are you falling in love with who
are you sleeping with really assess their character look for
these kinds of red flags and get good at saying
no get good at setting boundaries i'll have episodes specifically
about that in the future about how to say no
how to stop being a doormat how to set boundaries
because this is this is huge and of course men
also suffer from this problem but um in the domain
of romance especially women suffer from this problem you should
know that there's two types of bullshitters in the world
there are those that know that they're full of [
__ ] like the con artists and then there are
those who believe that they're actually good people and that
they're you know they're true believers so to so to
speak they don't even realize that they're bullshitting you like
that receptionist in the emergency room that you call to
ask for prices she's gonna [ __ ] you and
she probably doesn't even recognize that she's bullshitting you and
in fact in a certain sense um the most common
situation is people bullshitting you without recognizing that they're bullshitting
you because they've bullshitted themselves the true hardcore con artists
like the donald trumps of the world they can certainly
screw you over pretty bad if you run into one
of these people but they're pretty rare the majority of
people are not like donald trump they're not proper con
artists but they participate through their complacency and lack of
consciousness and lack of care they participate in systems of
exploitation without even seeing what they're doing they're cogs in
a machine so the bottom line is that fools get
scammed and if you want some more clarity upon that
uh check out my episode called what is wisdom in
that episode i make a distinction between wisdom and foolishness
that's a powerful episode you can connect it here with
this episode with what i just said about fools getting
scammed like ask yourself the question kind of like this
why do fools get scammed why is it hard to
scam a wise person contemplate that there's something valuable that
you can get from contemplating that and then and watch
that episode about wisdom to see what is meant by
wisdom versus foolishness and why fools are so prone to
getting scammed and um and and that's what you see
with the with the trumpism mega phenomena of the last
five years if you actually watch interview interviews with trump
supporters his most rabid fans watch interviews it's very fascinating
from a psychological point of view i'm not i'm not
being partisan here you know when i'm talking about trump
and [ __ ] on trump i'm not being partisan
like i'm treating him as a sort of a psychological
case right like um stop caring about democrats republicans just
just like look at his character look at how he
behaves and also look at his followers and how they
behave and the reasons they give for why they follow
trump and why they love trump and what you'll see
is that these people are [ __ ] fools these
maga people are [ __ ] fools and that's precisely
who a con artist like trump would fool is a
fool they're not wise people they're not well-educated people it's
not an accident that the mega crowd one of one
of the clearest demarcations of the mega crowd from um
from not is that they don't have a college education
because the more educated you are the wiser you become
the less of a fool you are and it's no
accident that trump himself is not a very well-educated person
it seems like he hasn't read a single book in
his life but he's an amazing con artist so what's
funny is that what the funniest thing about trump is
like how like it's amazing how far he he got
in life and how little uh blowback really he's gotten
for the incredible cons that he's run i mean he's
probably one of the best con artists uh of all
time literally of all time one of the best connors
of all time and what's funny is that his supporters
don't see it because they're so blinded by ideology and
partisanship and their political biases and their hatred for liberals
and progressives and democrats and socialism and all this sort
of stuff they're so blinded by that by the content
of that that they don't see the structure see my
episode content versus structure for that distinction they don't see
the structure of trump as a con artist and a
lot of times people are debating or arguing about trump
like in a political discussion they're like well should we
vote for trump or for biden but you know like
trump is better at these things and then biden is
better at these things on sort of like they're discussing
this on a sort of like a policy level or
a character level like that but like but what's missed
in that kind of discussion is that biden is not
a [ __ ] con artist trump is that's the
most important distinction and that ends the entire discussion it
doesn't even matter what the what the foreign policy is
with the domestic pilot like none of that [ __
] matters you cannot have a [ __ ] con
artist as a leader of your country that's that's that's
like a recipe for catastrophe that's the worst possible thing
is to elect a con artist as the leader of
one of the most powerful countries in the world and
the fact that people don't recognize that simple point is
both funny and tragic at the same time it's very
tragic it's very depressing it shows us the the the
lack of fundamentally the lack of education of the american
populace that they fall for this kind of [ __
] because if our populist was better educated nobody would
fall for for trump's [ __ ] or maybe in
the single digit percentages maybe five percent of the population
maybe nine percent but no more than that the fact
that 30 to 40 percent of the american population actually
thinks that trump makes a good leader is deeply disturbing
and not because of some political partisan reasons it they
just they lack a basic recognition of a flawed character
see now whatever criticism you have of joe biden or
hillary clinton or whatever else you might say oh they're
dirty politicians and all politicians are the same no not
all politicians are the same there's a difference between a
[ __ ] con artist and a typical run-of-the-mill politician
like joe biden politicians can lie they can exaggerate they
can make false promises yeah this is all standard for
politicians but then you have a [ __ ] con
artist you see the difference that's a huge difference if
you cannot see that difference you're really lost in life
you're in a really bad place and if you're denying
this difference you are utterly blinded bipartisan bias because what
i'm talking about here is not a partisan thing it's
it's not a matter of democrat or republican or whatever
um you could have a con artist on the progressive
or the democratic side and if we had one i
would be saying the same thing about him or her
but like hillary clinton is not a con artist in
the way that trump is and the fact that people
cannot make that distinction many intelligent people many political analysts
and so forth literally cannot make this distinction that is
deeply problematic and that's not because i like hillary clinton
but also what you should understand about people like trump
is that it doesn't make much sense to morally judge
con artists and scammers in the end he's just like
a fox he's doing what a fox does it's a
survival strategy so moral judgment here isn't the solution the
solution is just to become lies to the khan also
i should note that this episode is not licensed for
conspiracy theories and cynicism i also see a lot of
that so i see that there's a big mistake that
people make is that they can listen to this episode
and say oh okay yeah leo i agree with you
yeah there's so many con artists and scammers and bullshitters
out there in the world like all the politicians are
con artists and the the ceos the connors the billionaires
the millionaires the corporate elites they're all con artists all
scamming me they're all in on it and then you
become so cynical from that this would be a mistake
a very deep mistake just because there are some scams
within the self-help industry or within get-rich-quick schemes or within
pickup or within religion or within politics it does not
mean that the entire domain is a scam it does
not mean that you shouldn't read self-help books it does
not mean that you shouldn't go out there and buy
business courses there are great business and marketing courses out
there not all of them are sleazy get-rich-quick schemes it
does not mean you can't learn valuable dating advice from
pickup for example it does not mean that there's not
truth within religion for example even though there's a lot
of [ __ ] within religion so you have to
be nuanced here don't become cynical um actually the majority
of humans are fairly honest decent good people who are
not looking to scam you or to con you in
some business deal most people do honest business there are
some bad apples maybe five percent maybe 10 percent are
bad apples but but the the majority 90 95 is
good stuff uh so don't become too cynical here don't
get paranoid about this stuff by default you should be
friendly and open i don't want you going into every
business situation like paranoid that you're going to get screwed
over and cynical that that you're dealing with a con
artist this would be a mistake because the majority of
people you're going to be doing business with are not
con artists but you do want to be on the
lookout for these red flags and also if you do
get scammed um it's not the end of the world
reframe it as a learning opportunity every time you get
scammed or exploited or cheated even if if it's for
ten dollars you know you clip a 10 coupon and
then they end up not honoring it yeah you got
you got cheated for 10 or whatever use that to
learn your lesson really what you want to avoid is
the major scams when you're dealing with tens or hundreds
of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars when you're
dealing with your retirement savings the purchasing of a large
house or a car or some sort of annuity product
or a life insurance product right or getting a giant
loan in these situ these are the real the real
disasters you want to avoid the little scams where you
can scan for ten dollars here 100 there consider these
as just like lessons for how to avoid getting scammed
on the really big stuff so if you lose a
thousand dollars it's not a big deal actually if you
truly learn the lesson from losing that thousand dollars that
will be well worth the thousand dollars that was scammed
from you reframe it as like oh i paid a
thousand dollars to learn how to never get scammed again
because if i didn't learn that lesson i would have
gotten scammed for a hundred thousand dollars in the future
in my life because i would have been naive and
gullible that reframe is important also i don't want you
to use this kind of notion of a scam as
an excuse to not explore new domains and take risks
than to grow be careful being too risk-averse too cynical
and to naysaying uh i've taken quite a few risks
in my life that have panned out well for me
um i've gotten enormous value from certain shady domains and
businesses that you know if i would have said just
like oh well all of these people in this industry
are all just bullshitters i'm not even going to look
at this industry i'm not going to participate that would
have actually set me back i'll give you a few
examples of that for example when i first got into
online marketing this was like 15 years ago i got
into search engine optimization i did some of that and
there was a very crucial turning point very distinctive turning
point that led to my becoming financially independent and what
happened was that i was researching search and optimization just
getting my feet wet and then i ran into on
some online forum i ran into some some random indian
dude from india who made a promise to me that
he can rank my website number one for like a
popular search term in google this was 15 years ago
um and if he could do that that would mean
thousands of dollars of profit for me that was that
was huge right um and uh at the time i
was kind of desperate i i needed some way to
make a business work i didn't know how i was
desperate so on the one hand i needed i needed
his promise to pan out on the other hand i
was simultaneously very skeptical that he could fulfill on this
promise and he he wanted like a thousand dollars up
front so i was so desperate that i paid him
a thousand dollars and um and he did some behind
the scenes manipulations and stuff um with my website to
help me to rank on google and um i'm not
talking about actually i don't worry i'm talking about different
website and so anyways he did that for me and
um and what turned it was so funny um how
it panned out because what happened was that it took
him months to to finish the work and he was
doing the work in a very slow lazy way i
got very impatient with him with how he was doing
the work and so eventually um we actually kind of
got like in a fight and i ended up firing
him and sort of like losing my thousand dollars but
so in that sense you might say well it didn't
pan out but what did happen was that i did
see that he was able to raise my position in
the google search results not to the top but i
was able to see how he affected it and just
that possibility was enough to open my mind the idea
that if he could do it a little bit imagine
how well i could do it if i if i
did it myself if i stopped outsourcing this to somebody
else and so and so that's what happened is um
i fired him i forgot about the thousand dollars because
there was some bigger prize and the bigger prize was
that i was going to learn how to do seo
like really for myself so i learned how to do
that and from that i ended up earning hundreds of
thousands of dollars so you see that kind of risk
actually panned out even though it's a shady guy in
a shady industry the search engine industry is very shady
notoriously very shady um see if i was too cynical
i could have been like oh well this guy is
promising me too much and it's a lot of money
up front and he's a shady guy it's a shady
industry so you know [ __ ] that i'm not
even gonna try if i did that i don't know
i would be nowhere right now so a lot of
times it's better just to take action and even to
fail in your action rather than just be cynical and
just do nothing doing nothing is oftentimes the worst possible
thing you could do it's even worse than taking a
gamble uh a similar thing happened with the with when
i got into pickup you know when i got into
pickup i immediately recognized that pickup is a very shady
low consciousness low integrity industry with many toxic dysfunctional people
that was very clear to me but i was also
able to sort the wheat from the chaff and i
recognized that even though most the guys who are in
pickup are dysfunctional they're sex addicts they're traumatized they have
very bad relationships with women i can still learn certain
principles of attraction and improve my results with women and
yet avoid all the toxicity you know leave that behind
i would be able to take the baby out of
the bath water and leave behind the bath water so
to speak and so that's that's basically what i did
and it was enormously beneficial for me um but see
that requires such nuance i don't know how to explain
that because like a lot of i'm sort of hesitant
to recommend pickup to people in a certain sense because
a lot of people just kind of like jump into
it and they will absorb all the toxic elements of
it without being able to separate the wheat from the
chaff which is unfortunate another area where i took some
risk that panned out for me is with with spirituality
the pursuit of spirituality and awakening there's there's so much
[ __ ] within the new age circles within spirituality
within religion right and a lot of like atheists and
rationally minded scientifically-minded people they will look at the whole
spirituality community and the whole spirituality genre or domain they
will just they will dismiss the entire thing and they
will say like well leo why should i take the
risk of meditating so much and studying spirituality like it
seems very risky it's got huge time investment and then
like what am what am i going to get in
the end for it isn't it all just like a
bunch of mental masturbation and wishful thinking see it can
seem that way and so then what do you do
you act lazy you don't meditate you don't do any
spiritual practices you don't do any spiritual reading so forth
and then and then you got nothing basically you got
nothing you go nowhere right you risk nothing and you
gain nothing um but what happened with me with spirituality
is that i went into it i i made some
strategic risks um experimented a lot and then ultimately found
the holy grail so it's it's funny how sometimes in
life you will find just diamonds and gems floating in
a pile of horseshit and so i'm just giving you
these examples because i don't want you to become so
cynical that you become inactive it's very easy to say
that oh all all get rich quick schemes and passive
income schemes they're all just scams and i'm gonna do
nothing or like oh all these pickup coaches talking about
how they're having sex with these hot girls oh it's
all just fake [ __ ] and and the only
way to have sex with a hot girl is to
have a you know a big dick and a giant
jaw and have like a perfectly symmetrical face and so
because i don't have that because i'm short i'm gonna
do nothing it's like oh well spirituality promises you god
and enlightenment all this stuff but like it's all just
wishful thinking and [ __ ] and uh you know
love isn't real god isn't real none of this is
all and then you're so cynical that you do nothing
i don't want you to fall into that trap of
cynicism it's better to try something and fail than just
to do nothing because at least when you're trying stuff
and failing you're getting feedback it's pushing you you have
something you're moving towards and then you can adjust course
if one thing fails then you can move on to
the next thing something adjacent to it that might succeed
right but if you're sitting there doing nothing you can't
do anything with that you see and if you're mired
in cynicism that can be almost worse than doing nothing
because then you're sitting on your couch and you're criticizing
everybody for everything that they're doing wrong and you know
you're criticizing corporations you're criticizing the the media you're criticizing
the politicians you're criticizing religion you're criticizing everything and that
becomes your whole life you're just online criticizing people and
but you're not doing anything constructive you see it's way
better to do something constructive than to do nothing or
to be cynical even if your constructive thing is a
bit naive and foolish and you end up failing the
first few times you do it but then you know
as you fail you do it something constructive you learn
how to be constructive in more effective ways sometimes taking
action and getting scammed is better than doing nothing at
all and don't forget god is the biggest scammer and
con artist god scammed itself into thinking that it isn't
god but it's a human sitting there right now listening
to me illusion and deception these are fundamental mechanisms of
how consciousness and the universe functions you are dreaming up
reality reality is a giant scam that you're playing on
yourself for more on that go check out my episode
my three-part series called self-deception part one part two part
three where i talk about the the the fundamental nature
of self-deception why it's so important to the structure of
reality and also in the future i'm gonna have an
episode about illusion specifically we're going to talk about illusion
and the role that illusion plays within the structure of
reality it's fundamental to how consciousness works so the bottom
line is embrace the trickery of reality see reality is
a tricky thing it's not straightforward reality is full of
full of illusions and appearances and facades that mask what's
really at the root and so just in general i
want you to become savvy to this to this kind
of distinction between the appearance of a thing versus its
core its substance and to stop being fooled by appearances
in the future i'm going to release an episode i
think called how to assess bad character we've touched upon
in this episode but i specifically wanna wanna focus in
on on that because really if you develop the capacity
to to assess bad character in others this is going
to save you so much misery suffering heartache and financial
loss in your life so i'm i'm working on a
list of how to assess bad character stay tuned for
that we'll talk about that and that will dovetail with
with this episode about how to avoid getting conned of
course because if you're gonna says bad character that is
like eighty percent of the work of avoiding getting conned
and uh one final thing i wanna give a little
shout out to a youtube channel called uh coffeezilla coffeezilla
it's a great channel run by a couple of guys
who basically the whole channel's premise is that they call
out various kinds of con artists and scammers and grifters
within especially the sort of get-rich-quick field within the self-help
field maybe even with a little a little bit of
spirituality with crypto nfts this sort of stuff so they
do a lot of like expose videos uh great channel
funny entertaining also useful and practical if you watch some
of their videos like they really do breakdowns of how
these grips work how these get rich quick schemes work
how people get exploited from and lose you know tens
of thousands of dollars falling for these kinds of schemes
online so if you want some like the actual practical
examples of all the stuff i've been talking about here
sort of in the abstract they got really practical examples
they will actually give you names of gurus and business
coaches and others who are you know scamming people and
bilking them of thousands of dollars so um it's a
great channel go check them out and that is that
so now you should be set for life to avoid
getting conned and scammed this is like this episode is
really like what i would want if i had a
son i would force him to watch this episode as
he was growing up and then going off into adulthood
because i just know how easy it would be for
him to get scammed and exploited in the world and
so i would say just like here son watch this
this will prepare you this was this will inoculate you
against all the trickery that humans have come up with
to separate you from your money and i hope it's
had the same effect on you you
