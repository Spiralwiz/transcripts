            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/W7bRGzFt2oE' target='_blank'>Why Am I Depressed - The Shocking Truth Behind Your Depression</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Depression as an Epidemic</b>: Leo from Actualized.org discusses the increasing rates of depression, particularly in developed countries. The primary cause, according to him, is bad psychology and a lack of personal development. He acknowledges that there can be clinical and physiological causes of depression but insists that the majority of cases come from poor mental states and lack of personal responsibility.
</li><li><b>The Influence of Genetics on Happiness</b>: Leo refers to studies indicating that around 50% of a person's happiness level is determined by genetics. Despite this, he emphasizes the importance of individuals taking responsibility for their own mindset and psychological state, which he argues is more crucial to overcoming depression than solely focusing on clinical treatments.
</li><li><b>The Role of Self-Absorption in Depression</b>: Leo identifies excessive self-absorption and a strong identification with oneself and one's problems as significant contributors to depression. This concept, while difficult to comprehend initially, is potent and offers a new way to understand and approach depression. He suggests that deep-rooted patterns of negative thinking and a negative self-image are what primarily drive feelings of depression.
</li><li><b>Methods to Overcome Depression</b>: To address this, Leo suggests practices such as deep meditation and contemplation towards enlightenment, stating that by undertaking such practices over the time, one can start to become more aware of their self-absorption and reduce depression. He emphasised that recognising and challenging these subconscious beliefs is essential to breaking the cycle of negativity and finding fulfillment within oneself.
</li><li><b>Psychology and Biology of Depression</b>: Leo stresses that while clinical and genetic factors can play a part in causing depression, it's crucial to also consider one's psychology. Even for those with a clinical diagnosis, he argues, improving psychological health can still significantly enhance one's quality of life.
</li><li><b>Concept of Victimhood and Self-Acceptance</b>: He further discourages projecting oneself as a victim, and instead, encourages taking responsibility for one's state, for the most part, as he claims that the majority of us create our own depression. True fulfillment, he points out, comes from self-acceptance and self-love, rather than external validation and societal expectations. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Development</b>: Leo suggests that individuals need to take responsibility for their personal development and looks at depression from a broader perspective. According to him, tackling depression requires improving one's psychology and mindset, thereby increasing personal development. He emphasises the importance of having a strong sense of purpose and being committed to serving others in managing depression.
</li><li><b>Depression and Relationship Problems</b>: Struggles with relationships can stem from a need for external approval and love, resulting from a belief of not being good enough as one is. The negative cycle of neediness, insecurity, and failed relationships can contribute to feelings of depression.
</li><li><b>Subconscious Beliefs and Depression</b>: Subconscious beliefs, developed from past traumas or experiences, can influence depression. These beliefs operate on a subconscious level that can affect a person's feelings, decisions, and relationships. 
</li><li><b>Meditation as a Solution to Depression</b>: Meditation can greatly impact depression by fostering present-moment mindfulness. By letting go of past and future thoughts and focusing on the present moment, one can experience a natural state of bliss and happiness, counteracting depressive feelings.
</li><li><b>Depression and Integrity with Personal Values</b>: Living in contradiction of personal values can contribute to feelings of guilt, laziness, and procrastination, which can feed into depression. Adherence to core values promotes well-being, while divergence from them can lead to depressive symptoms.
</li><li><b>Inauthenticity and Depression</b>: Inauthentic or fake behavior can contribute to depression. Being untruthful with oneself or others can result from the problems related to ego and undermines personal confidence and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Depression and Society's Expectations</b>: A large portion of depression can be attributed to societal pressures and expectations, and a resulting desperation to live up to these standards. This often leads to individuals failing to be sincere with their emotions, instead choosing to conform to external expectations. There's a lack of understanding that fulfillment cannot be obtained externally; rather, it comes from within. 
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Fulfillment</b>: One significant hurdle most individuals face is the fear of failure, disapproval or rejection, ultimately leading to an inauthentic existence. Chasing aspects of life viewed as successful by society's standards often leads to dissatisfaction as they do not necessarily align with personal happiness or fulfillment. Understanding and exploring actual happiness and how to attain it is necessary.
</li><li><b>Solutions for Combating Depression</b>:
</li><li>- <b>Introspection and Ego Understanding</b>: The first step to overcoming depression is recognizing that the individual is responsible for their emotions and that the ego significantly contributes to their depression. This requires repetitive exposure, awareness, and acceptance.  
</li><li>- <b>Meditation</b>: Daily meditation, for at least twenty minutes, is strongly encouraged as an effective tool for managing depressive symptoms. Building this habit and adopting it long-term is beneficial. 
</li><li>- <b>Exercise</b>: Regular physical activity can be as effective as antidepressants in combating depression, with longer lasting results after stopping. Unlike medication, the effects of exercise continue to improve mood beyond the period of activity. 
</li><li>- <b>Living with Purpose and Values</b>: Following a routine, identifying your values, and setting goals aligned with these values is beneficial. Having a strong sense of purpose and a desire to help others makes one less prone to depression. 
</li><li>- <b>Enlightenment and Spiritual Work</b>: Commencing and committing to deeper meditation and spiritual practices can lead to enlightenment, which empowers individuals to tap into their natural, blissful state. This significant shift can help overcome depression. 
</li><li><b>Living an Awesome Life</b>: The goal should not only be to overcome depression but also to envision and pursue an extraordinary life filled with huge goals and a powerful purpose. It involves living authentically, mastering psychology, and essentially being in control of your life. Resources to aid in this process can be obtained from Actualized.org. The ultimate objective is to live a fulfilled life where depression becomes a thing of the past.
