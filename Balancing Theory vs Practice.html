hey Leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about balancing theory versus practice
[Music] you this topic of theory versus practice is foundational
to your success with this self-actualization journey so today what
I'm going to do is I'm going to teach you
basically a superpower this ability to balance between the two
to understand the nuances because this is a very nuanced
and tricky topic and yet it's critical to your success
in life in many areas from business to relationships to
your spiritual life and so forth and the sad thing
is that almost nobody understands the nuances of theory versus
practice and I'm going to tell you a lot more
than merely that you need to be practicing more so
a lot of you listen to me and by its
very nature anything you listen to is theoretical right so
all my content in a sense is theoretical now of
course some content can be more theoretical and abstract than
other content which can be very practical but nevertheless a
lot of people get caught in this trap of mental
masturbation where they just listen to a lot of theory
but then aren't able to implement and take action on
it that's not really what I'm going to be talking
about today I'm going to share some much more profound
things with you although that problem right there is a
very big sticking point that probably a majority of you
have so make sure you don't fall into this trap
of over theorizing see most people get the balance wrong
here they're either too theoretical in life or they're too
practical in life and both of these take into their
extremes get you stuck and create their own set of
problems so what's the problem with excessive pragmatism a lot
of people like to pride themselves on being a pragmatic
person I'm a pragmatic person as though that's somehow a
virtue it can be a virtue but as soon as
you think of yourself as a pragmatic person well that's
a person right there that I can almost guarantee you
is stuck and they are stuck in the following ways
basically they're living a shallow existence they're they tend to
be very materialistic to be very selfish they tend to
always be chasing after experiences because that's what that's what
the code word I'm pragmatic means is that I'm chasing
after gross experiences in life because what else does that
mean for the average person that's what they mean by
pragmatism they have no really big picture understanding of life
nor do they care about that they don't see the
value in that because they hate that's just theory it's
just theory it's just philosophy why do I need that
since I'm a pragmatic person and of course these people
are not able to tap into the power of spirituality
almost at all because they're lost in pragmatism and in
this sense they've really sold their soul to the devil
one way to think about this notion of selling your
soul to the devil is that you just become highly
utilitarian and pragmatic in life to the point of becoming
Machiavellian and then you cannot be satisfied with life so
that's the problem of pragmatism now the problem with theorizing
that's also problem the excesses of theorizing lead to armchair
philosophy mental masturbation arguing and debating criticizing others as though
arguing debating and criticizing really gets you anywhere it leads
to paralysis by analysis it leads to fantasies of all
sorts getting lost in concepts without realizing that you're lost
in concepts it leads to the problem of not recognizing
that the map is not the territory that all your
models are not reality itself and that the the meal
is not the menu this is a huge problem for
theoreticians they don't really cognize this and it also leads
to lack of real-world results so you might have a
lunch of good theories about how the whole world works
and what you're supposed to be doing and what other
people are supposed to be doing and what's moral and
what's the more you have all these theories but then
in your own life you're not demonstrating it and again
even with theoreticians they still lack big picture understanding because
the probability of additions is they all didn't over specialize
in one area and then they don't see the bigger
hole that they're missing out on so they also don't
have the big picture and they're also not able to
tap into the power spirituality because spirituality is about actuality
not theories not concepts not models not maps not just
philosophy but real philosophy which means embodiment so those are
the two extremes most people tend to cling to one
of these poles and they actually create an identity out
of this like I said with the pragmatic person they
really you know pride themselves on their pragmatism and the
theoreticians pride themselves on their theory their reasoning abilities their
rationality yeah I call these people the rationalists so what
needs to happen here is that you need to start
to see how the two both theory and practice interpenetrate
and how they rely upon each other and that they're
both necessary and that really what's optimal here is a
dynamic flow between the two it's like a dance your
theory must be able to inform your practice and vice
versa and you must be able to control the flow
almost think of it like some sort of like high
school physics device where you have like a glass bubble
on this end and a glass bubble on this on
the connected by a tube and you've got water moving
between the two and you've got like a little valve
here that can control the flow of water between the
two and so what needs to happen is you need
to strategically be able to shift the balance depending on
your context depending on the situation in life you need
to be able to shift this balance so the water
flows and stays in the right proportions in this system
and doesn't fill up one end or the other end
too much see and you got to be able to
control that valve in the middle you got to be
able to leverage theory against practice and then practice against
theory jumping back and forth between the two now this
is a rather complex issue there's some nuances here so
it's going to take some explaining and I've racked my
brain about this for a while now as to how
to explain some of these nuances because it's quite tricky
to explain to someone who hasn't done a lot of
philosophizing on this matter so the way I decided to
explain it is just by telling you that you need
some specific abilities within this domain of theory versus practice
there are about 15 of these abilities that I've identified
so firstly you need the ability to theorize in the
abstract without concern for any pragmatic issues or the value
of theory C so the problem with a lot of
pragmatic people is that when you ask them to theorize
or to think about something abstract they'll immediately have a
knee-jerk reaction say oh well but what's the point it's
just going to be theory anyways and I'm a very
pragmatic person so I don't need the theory let me
just go take a bunch of action and solve the
problem that way or they say well but this is
this theory you know what's the value of the theory
like Leah why should I pursue and care about truth
truth is some lofty philosophical notion why do I need
to care about the truth what value is it I
mean is it going to is it going to like
get me more money is it going to get me
more sex is it Devon get me a better house
if not then why should I care about truth see
this is a huge trap for these sort of pragmatic
people you need to allow for the possibility of theorizing
without knowing whether something valuable will or won't come of
it because honestly you don't know at first you start
to theorize you might theorize and your theories might have
no value and no use to you and you you
see no practical application for it but then years down
the road you will find a practical application see also
another problem here is that if you're always concerned about
just personal value for yourself out of any kind of
mental activity that you do then it's like you don't
give yourself any kind of room for anything significant to
blossom in your theorizing right in the same way that
if I was running a business and my scientists my
research team came to me and said hey can you
allocate some more millions of dollars to our research and
development department and I would just you know be a
very pragmatic CEO and I would say well is it
going to like increase our next quarterly profit and you
know the researcher looks at me and says well no
why would it do that it means it's research we
don't know what's going to come out of the research
but we know that if we increase research and development
that in a couple of years we might have some
breakthrough technology and then we might have some new patents
which will give us an edge on the competition and
then as a CEO I'm very pragmatic I said no
we're not going to allocate money to that I'm going
to put this money directly to what's going to increase
my next quarterly statement because that's what I care about
and see that's a very myopic way to think a
smart CEO would recognize the value of like yeah let's
invest millions of dollars into research and development so that
maybe five ten years down the road we could have
some breakthrough technology and that could make or break our
whole company you see so the same thing with your
theorizing you can't know where it's going to lead to
therefore you need to be open to doing it even
though you not might not be getting an immediate you
know payoff very practical payoff it's hard to judge the
pragmatic implications of many theoretical things and if we take
a look at human history actually this is beautifully borne
out with mathematics and science these two fields have always
had this interesting relationship where mathematicians are more theoretical than
scientists and engineers and mathematicians for hundreds of years now
maybe even thousands of years have come up with various
theorems and discoveries within theoretical math headaches which when we
look at that real world an engineer would say well
there's no application for this in the real world until
maybe two or three hundred years later when finally we
realize like oh my god this has huge implications for
the real world for example that occurred with non Euclidean
geometry and many other things within mathematics work that way
so there's value we've discovered through trial and error through
a lot of epistemic folly we've discovered that we need
to let mathematics do it's highly abstract theoretical stuff trusting
that down the road and it might take hundreds of
years down the road we will find some very useful
applications for it and that we shouldn't be too quick
to judge that see my mom always likes to refer
to what I what I do for work and and
how I live my life is you know you're the
philosopher it's all philosophy oh you're just engaging in philosophy
you know I'm I'm not philosophical like you I just
live a very simple pragmatic kind of life and so
anytime I try to give her some advice or whatever
you know mention one of these concepts to her that
might improve her life she always dismisses it as no
no it's just philosophy I mean what's that going to
really do for me it's not really gonna do anything
for me it's just philosophy right um because she's stuck
on this point right she's not seeing that yes it's
philosophy it starts out as theory but then the whole
point of the theory is that you want it to
percolate down through the through this contraption here that I
talked about into the the practice true philosophy is not
just armchair philosophy there's a big difference in armchair philosophy
and true philosophy which maybe I'll talk about more in
the future so that's a very important ability another important
ability here is to see the practical consequences of your
theorizing a lot of theoreticians and rationalists get this one
really wrong they theorize away maybe they're very good academic
philosophers Messer's and scientists and mathematicians and they accomplished some
good stuff within a little local domain of their theorizing
but what they're bad at is seeing the practical consequences
of their theories usually when you're theorizing properly you're going
to need to have some breakthroughs in your theories and
then you're going to need to ask yourself the question
well what does this mean for my life what does
this mean for human beings what does this mean for
society and a lot of scientists get this part wrong
especially when it comes to the emotional and personal ramifications
of a theory the human implications of the theory see
the scientists like to separate out the theorizing from living
of life but really that's an artificial distinction maybe it's
useful for science departments but it has its limits because
again you're not getting the bigger picture and also because
your profound theorizing is then not able to percolate and
penetrate through into your everyday life you're not able to
embody it and also this is where a lot of
philosophers and and ideologues go wrong is that they start
to theorize about something like maybe person is a nihilist
or you know they're starting to get depressed because they're
thinking about all these things about like oh well Humanity
is terrible it's like a cancer upon the planet and
look at we're destroying the environment and this and that
and and you know now I'm starting to become a
misanthrope and start to hate humanity and you know well
life is also pointless because I've been studying existentialism and
that tells me that life is all pointless and there's
nothing to do and all I have to do is
think about my own death and so I start to
theorize along those lines but then I'm not seeing how
this is toxifying my life and I'm not actually able
to be happy and joyful and I'm not able to
be loving or compassionate other people I'm becoming a misanthrope
I'm becoming antagonistic I have grudges against people in society
and but I'm so lost in the theory of it
that I get mesmerized by the theory and I fail
to see how this theory is now actually percolating negatively
into my life and what I need to be able
to do is I need to be able to say
wait a minute yes this is all good theory perhaps
perhaps all the theory is correct but look it's ruining
my life my life is turning into a mess I'm
not able to motivate myself I'm not able to be
a good friend I'm not able to be a good
father I'm not able to be a good spouse I'm
not able to be a good human being at that
point you need to be able to shift your balance
on a dime so to speak and say wait a
minute I'm getting too theoretical here let me shift my
balance to being practical let me approach this whole problem
from the practical perspective now and you flip that around
you say this this philosophy is making me depressed this
existentialism is very disempowering let me drop that and let
me actually start to take my my practical concerns and
apply them to my philosophizing so what are my practical
concerns well I want to be a happy human being
I want to have good positive emotions I don't want
to be depressed all the time I don't want to
be sleeping in bed and not able to get up
on time because I'm so miserable from all my you
know theorizing and so let that now let the practice
now inform and flow into my theorizing so that I
can say oh well what would it take for me
to feel happy on an everyday level to actually enjoy
life to see the beauty of life to be a
good human being oh well that would take my thinking
to change my beliefs and my ideology has to change
I have to drop this existentialist [ __ ] this
this Nietzschean philosophy or whatever it is you know you're
studying search or something I have to drop that because
it's not working let me go explore some other avenues
let me go find a person who's actually happy in
life like maybe I'll find a Buddhist the Buddhist looks
happy okay let me maybe try to do what the
Buddhist is doing and see their what you're doing is
you're allowing your practice the practical stuff in your life
to actually inform your theory so it's not flowing from
theory to practice all the way down but always but
also up from practice to theory you see you need
this is so critical this is so critical you need
this ability to recognize when you're stuck too much in
one or in the other and you need one to
be able to inform the other and then the other
to be able to inform the other one depending on
the situation you also need the ability to be motivated
to action by good theory so that when you're reading
a book and you read something in a book that's
like oh that's a profound insight like oh that might
really change my life if I applied that or like
yeah that's a really good business strategy right there if
I follow that business strategy that would earn me lots
more money right you need to be able to go
from that to actually getting motivation out of that to
then go and take action on that theory I don't
know about you but I get really inspired when I
do listen to or I find a piece of good
theory like a great strategy or a great technique because
then I want to go and I want to embody
it and implement it and have it actually pay the
dividends you see but a lot of people might struggle
with this I can see because they're reading it they
read it and it sounds good to them but then
they sort of just say oh well yeah but I
don't know how to implement that and so I'm not
even going to get really motivated by that and therefore
it's just leftist theory a lot of times what I
find is that when people complain about stuff just being
theory it's really just because they lack the ability to
embody the theory and so to them it's true to
them it's just theory whereas to someone who knows how
to embody it it's not just theory it becomes the
very essence of their being it penetrates through into their
bones into the Mayer of their bones see so this
criticism often is a self-fulfilling prophecy it's like Oh Ali
oh you know your notions of good and evil you
talk about good and evil how how these things don't
exist and this is just theory it's just theory to
you perhaps but it's not just theory to me I
see the world in that way and it takes effort
to see the world in that way see people who
often criticize philosophers for just being abstract will really these
people don't understand how difficult it is to be a
philosopher to be a philosopher isn't you just sitting in
a chair all day dreaming up ideas you know pet
theories about life no being a philosopher is about embodying
the deepest truths and wisdom about how to live a
good life and then working really hard to embody these
very abstract and also emotionally challenging things and so people
who criticize philosophers often are just the ones who aren't
realizing that they have to work really hard to be
able to embody the philosophy so the ability that you
need here is you need the ability to create concrete
action plans based upon theory so you've got a great
theory and now it's motivated you and you're ready to
start to take action but of course the question comes
up how do I take a very abstract lofty notion
and turn it into practical results how do I embody
it and a lot of people fail right here because
they're not able to create an action plan like one
two three four five you know inning steps step one
step two step three and so forth for how to
get this theory so you might hear about enlightenment but
then you are not actually taking steps every single day
to actualize the enlightenment and so for you enlightenment remains
a theory and I agree with you if enlightenment is
just a theory for you then uh it's actually doing
you harm not only is it wasting your time it's
actually doing you harm as a theory because as a
theory it's it's false it's actually false believing all these
things I say but they're not actually embodying them and
coming up with action plans for how to put this
into place in your life it's going to make you
very miserable and it could actually backfire on you and
make your life worse not better so you got to
be careful there another ability you need is the ability
to drop theorizing on a dime so your theorizing about
something in your life and your theorizing about relationships or
about you know maybe moving to a different country or
about your life purpose or about enlightenment and about reality
about God whatever and then you just need to be
able to stop that drop it without any reason and
then you need to be able to start to see
action on a dime because notice if you're not able
to do this you are basically a slave to your
theorizing see and theorizing can be seductive where you sort
of theorize about something and then the theory starts to
sort of congeal around itself and create its own little
bubble or universe such that you are not even able
to take action or to listen to other people giving
you feedback or advice because your little bubble of theorizing
will say something like well but I can't take action
because my theory says it's not possible or my theory
is telling me I need to do more theorizing before
I can go take action and so this is what
kind of leads to paralysis by analysis and this becomes
a huge trap so you need to be able to
recognize that you know what your theory is not all-encompassing
yeah theorizing is good it can be very helpful to
inform your practices you can strategize and so forth you
can you can learn important overarching principles of life and
then apply them to the way you behave to the
way you emot-- to the way you relate to people
and so forth and all that is very powerful but
also you recognize that there are limits here and that
you need to be able to just let it go
let it go don't become an ideologue to any philosophy
to any scientific model to any religious or spiritual teaching
and just start to take action without any justification behind
it without any reasons see a lot of theories trap
themselves by saying well I need a good reason to
stop following this theory no you don't you can just
drop that theory right now and start to take action
right on a dime take action go take action if
you're feeling depressed because of the way you've been reasoning
about life for the last five years just drop it
and go start to take action that's a very effective
way rather than trying to think your way out of
a theory a lot of times the best way to
exit a theory is just to act your way out
of it not to think your way out of it
thinking usually only makes the problem worse you need the
ability to theorize one way but then act in the
opposite way and this is a tricky thing because it
feels like maybe you're breaking integrity or you're becoming schizophrenic
when you do this you feel maybe like a hypocrite
or like you're contradicting yourself and yet this is such
a critical thing maybe you're theorizing about your life purpose
or your theory theorizing about the nature of life and
reality and so forth and your theories are leading you
in this direction over here but first of all your
theories might not be fully formed therefore you still need
to be acting maybe in this direction over here and
this direction here might not yet be aligned with the
theories there so you need to be kind of doing
both simultaneously like during the day you go to your
day job you keep doing your day job you don't
quit it but then at night you're theorizing in this
direction and they might be totally opposite directions right like
maybe you're theorizing about becoming a Buddhist monk but then
and during the day you're going and you're being a
stockbroker you're being a stock broker on Wall Street right
and these two things seem like they're totally opposite things
and yet this is necessary for you to to hold
this tension because you know you're not quite sure yet
whether you really want to commit to becoming a Buddhist
monk that's a big commitment you got a you know
think that through and while you're doing that you don't
want to quit your day job you don't want to
quit maybe your life purpose or whatever practical thing you're
doing like maybe you're going to university you don't to
just quit going to university on a dime because that
would be a rash decision right you need consistency in
whatever you're doing whether you're stockbroker or you're following your
life purpose or you're in a university consistency is important
to success because see what happens is that if you're
always directly following your theories your theories could be changing
every single day you might be you know thinking about
a new life purpose or dreaming up some new place
you want to live in but you can't be following
that every single day there needs to be a sort
of gap between the two that gap there is like
a cushion like a spring that kind of holds these
things together but sort of loosely they're not supposed to
be glued together your theory and your practice cannot be
just cemented together all the time that's going to lead
to problems and likewise also there's a trap in having
your theory and your practice totally isolated which is the
trap that a lot of academics and scientists and rationalists
make is that they draw a very firm distinction between
the theory and the practice and you know their practice
in life is one way and then all their lofty
theorizing in this way and this never ends up being
able to inform this you see and also this doesn't
end up being able to inform that and then they
walk around like like a I mean they're really fragmented
they're not a whole integrated human being and these sorts
of you human beings I find them quite unspiritual they
are quite closed-minded even though they might be very intelligent
logical and rational and then the quality of their emotions
reflects that and you can tell that these people are
not really satisfied with life they don't really have the
bigger picture because you can't live life by fragmenting it
into little pieces so so yeah so that's this ability
to theorize and act in opposite ways but of course
you don't want to be always acting in opposite ways
to all your theories because that means you're breaking integrity
after a certain point like if your theories tell you
you should stop stealing and yet at work you're always
stealing and scamming your customers or something like that then
clearly you're going to have a breaking of integrity there
and so you're going to want to align your your
work to your theories because in this case the theory
is good the theories telling you that you know spiritually
you should not steal because that's creating deep rifts within
within inside you and that's going to lead to a
miserable guilty sort of lifestyle so of course you don't
want that so you want that theory to be able
to inform your practice in this case and the sooner
the better in that case but you need to develop
the capacity to modulate that c2c because otherwise you might
become overly moralistic with yourself and you always guilt yourself
and you said wow you know I saw I stole
some some paperclips at work and my theory tells me
that I should never steal anything and if I do
then I'm evil and I'm bad and so now I'm
like okay leo told me that I need to apply
my theory to my practice and to have integrity with
everything so that means I got to make myself feel
very very guilty and bad and evil for stealing some
paperclips at work and of course what does that do
that just gets you more stuck you see so it's
very tricky here you got to be able to navigate
this dynamic balance you also need the ability to see
the big picture patterns that come about through your actions
and your practices so the best theorizing comes often from
when you're practicing a lot you're in practice mode and
then as you're practicing you're also just observing and you're
observing what you're doing and then your mind sees patterns
within what you're doing and some of these patterns are
very broad overarching patterns that then can become principles or
insights and they can inform your theory because another problem
at theoretician space is that they theorize in the abstract
without double-checking their theory against the practical real-world situation so
you might sit there and you might theorize about you
know what's the best way to run a business and
what's the best way to form society you know should
we should be we be Democrats or Republicans liberals are
conservative so you know what's the best way to form
society and you can sit there and you can philosophize
about this stuff for a long time but really you're
going to get yourself into a lot of traps that
way because what needs to happen is you need to
actually implement and test your your principles you know you
need to actually go out there and test let's make
our taxes very high and see how society works when
taxes are very high test it make it a science
experiment and then do another do the opposite science experiment
make taxes very low and then let's test that and
see how society is doing see one of the problems
of politics is that people in politics just have ideologies
and opinions they have a lot of opinions but politics
is unscientific we rarely actually test the ideology and so
this gives people so much wiggle room and so much
fudge factor that they are able to come up with
all sorts of theories about which public policies are best
without actually seeing which ones are best see it would
be a lot wiser if we actually derived our public
policy more scientifically based on actual experiments doing actual tests
with tax policy education policy military policy and so forth
but we're very far from that a lot of it
is ideologically driven which is why we have these inefficiencies
because we're just basically going on personal opinion we're basing
the direction of our country on personal opinions that are
disconnected from facts that's a problem you also need the
ability to see when you're stuck in theory and conversely
you need the ability to see when you're stuck in
action and you can get stuck in both what does
it look like to be stuck in a theory well
I gave you that example of sitting there and being
depressed so maybe you're wallowing in nihilism for years wallowing
in nihilism wallowing in nihilism and now you're stuck in
it and your nihilism is so pernicious that it doesn't
even give you an escape a safety valve the safety
valve in that case is to start to take action
so you need the ability to be able to use
practice to break out of a bad cycle of theory
that would be the case with this nihilism but also
the opposite you need the ability to use theory to
break out of a bad cycle of action so what's
a bad cycle of action maybe you've been eating junk
food for your whole life and that's now become a
habit and it's just a mechanical action or maybe you're
stuck chasing money in your life and you've been doing
that for the last decade and that's become a cycle
you're always chasing money always chasing money always chasing money
because you're a very pragmatic person but you're stuck doing
that and maybe what you need is you need some
good theory that can prompt you out of that cycle
so maybe you read some self-help book and then you
start to see like oh yeah this cycle of chasing
money is breaking certain spiritual principles and that's why it's
not working very well for me so there you you
take the theory and you let the theory percolate into
your practice then break this cycle of bad practice see
or maybe you're stuck going to church every Sunday because
that's how you were raised and then you're reading some
books or you're listening to me talk or whatever and
then maybe the theory is telling you hey you should
stop going to church because that's not real spirituality going
to church has nothing to do with real spirituality maybe
you need to start to do spirituality in a very
different way than you were taught and but that's difficult
for you right because even though you've heard this advice
and this advice sounds reasonable and sounds like it's right
but still you're stuck in the cycle of action because
you feel guilty now for not going every day to
church or not going every Sunday or whatever and you've
got peer pressure you know your family's trying to pull
you back there they're telling you oh how dare you
not come to church last Sunday and all this and
this makes you feel guilty and bad but see you've
got to be able to use your better theory to
influence your practice you need to be able to see
the limitations of both theory and practice and what are
the limitations well the limitation of the theory is that
you can really get lost in a lot of concepts
which are disconnected from reality and that then you can
be theorizing one way but then living your life a
totally different way and that your theories might be very
beautiful and ideal and they might be very moral but
then your actual life is very immoral a low quality
low consciousness you're eating bad food you're not exercising your
you know your being an [ __ ] to your
family and and you're being selfish and petty but then
you have on the other hand all these beautiful theoretical
ideals and so that becomes a big limitation and then
of course the limitation of action is that you're just
stuck mechanically doing stuff going to your nine-to-five job taking
care of the kids and doing all these obligations and
chasing money and trying to get up from all your
friends and you know trying to be humorous and and
trying to be you know socially acceptable to fit into
society to keep up with the Joneses and all that
sort of stuff and then you're stuck in that cycle
so much that you've completely lost sight of being of
the beauty of life you've forgotten how to relax you've
forgotten the most important spiritual principles of life you can
no longer value philosophy because you reject it as just
theory just theory and you're not able to even strategize
towards bigger things in your life right you hear about
stuff like life purpose and then you say oh like
purpose that's just theory right and then that keeps you
stuck in this cycle that you've been stuck on you
also need the ability to stop the mind entirely theoretical
people get stuck in their mind but also practical people
get stuck in their money the entire pragmatic orientation towards
life is actually very conceptual and very theoretical if you
think about it because that's a paradise all paradigm is
an attitude just because you think of yourself as a
very pragmatic person and let's say you're a business oriented
person you like money and you're always chasing after success
and money but what is that that's a highly conceptual
activity even though you tell yourself it's pragmatic and you
know there's no philosophy involved but actually you have all
sorts of notions and beliefs and concepts about how business
works and why money is important and how to acquire
the most of it and what are all the best
ways to acquire it in all this sort of stuff
so your mind is still constantly churning whether you're a
theoretically minded person or a pragmatically minded person and you
need to be able to just shut it off just
shut it off and that's a difficult ability to acquire
because the value of that is going to be that
if you ever get stuck in theory you can just
shut your mind off get right back into being and
that centers you in what's most important in life and
if you're ever stuck in action and you're always taking
action action action you become very mechanical with your action
again you can just kind of cut off your mind
and when you cut off your mind that opens up
new possibilities of again just coming back getting centered in
being so that you no need to be doing so
much all the time acquiring so many things and then
you're just happy in being with still calm mind you
also need the ability to read between the lines of
your thinking this is a huge and subtle point most
people when they're thinking they're not observing they're thinking they're
thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking but then they're not noticing
hey I'm thinking about this stuff and that my thinking
about anything is not reality it's just thinking and so
if it's useful good but also it might not be
useful and also I need to see that what I'm
thinking about something like when I'm being very rational for
example rational sponsons trap a lot these are being very
logical rational all of reality except they're forgetting to apply
the rationalism to itself like they never ask themselves hey
is there good evidence for why all of reality should
obey my rationalism because if they ever asked that question
they would see that no there's no good evidence that's
just an assumption that they took on C but they
rarely think about their thinking process likewise with skeptics skeptics
like to be skeptical about everything is the false skeptics
that I'm talking about and and of course they don't
read between the lines of their skepticism because really if
you're truly properly skeptical you and be able to reflect
the skepticism in on itself and ask yourself the question
wait a minute all this skepticism is it really true
is it really the right position could it be that
I'm in being a skeptic I'm actually adopting a wrong
position here let me be skeptical about my own skepticism
but to do that you need to sort of step
back and do some sort of what I would call
maybe meta thinking thinking about your thinking and most people
are very bad at this you also need the ability
to move forward despite paradox confusion and indecision so you
might be theorizing about your life purpose got starting a
business about some philosophical concept about what reality is about
how best to meditate or how to self inquire and
you might be theorizing about this and thinking about it
wracking your mind around it but in the end you're
going to encounter paradox they're probably confusion probably indecision like
maybe you have to live purposes that you're considering you're
not sure should I go with this one or with
this one they're very different I don't know what Leo
which one should I choose how do I decide in
that case you need to understand that hey maybe the
greater danger here is not in choosing the wrong one
but in not choosing at all indecision might be the
greater danger there see and so hey just pick one
and go go with it maybe you change it later
but just pick one for now and go with it
this ability to kind of push forward and push forward
and push forward even though you're confused you're feeling cognitive
dissonance you're feeling schizophrenic you're not sure if it's the
right decision you just push yourself forward this is a
critical ability this is another example of practice pushing the
theory forward right when the theory can't wrap itself around
reality the action and the practice can push you that
problem and then the theory will catch up later so
one of the big dangers is assuming that you can
theorize your way out of every problem another big danger
is assuming that you could act your way out of
every problem sometimes you've been acting a lot and hasn't
been working need to be able to just sit yourself
down say okay I'm just going to take a week
off out of work out of my life do nothing
but just sit and theorize all week strategize think this
problem through and then you might find a very creative
solution that would save you know years maybe a decade
of going down the wrong road and likewise if you're
theorizing too much you need to be able to say
hey you know what screw the theorizing let me just
go start taking action and stuff will happen I don't
know how to start my business I just know that
I want to start my business and so let me
just go sir taking action I'm going to start a
project a little business project let me just see let
me just get some feedback from the real world because
hey just sitting here diarrea theorizing about how do I
start a business it's not getting me anywhere see and
you need to be a good judge of when to
do which and that's a difficult thing for me to
teach you because it's a it's an issue of dynamic
balance it depends on the context depends on the situation
depends on your values depends on your strengths right but
what I want to make sure you understand is that
all of these minor abilities that I talked about this
is all components we might say of the larger ultimate
ability of simply to be able to balance properly Theory
versus practice and if you want to nail the big
ability you got to get these components into place so
working on these components as you improve all those then
you improve the overarching ability and once you get good
at that then it's like oh you're a good unit
cycler you can balance on a unicycle no matter where
you are on no matter what kind of terrain you've
practiced and you've learned how to balance dynamically and that's
why this process is hard because it's messy it's not
just black and white I can't give you a one
two three step formula for how to do it you
got to struggle through it and be conscious and learn
through trial and error and through experience so how is
this accomplished of course you're wondering right Leo how do
I do this the key is observation you have to
be aware of these dynamics in your life don't be
so concerned with a 1 to 3 step formula here
I just want you to start to become more observant
of these different dynamics and I want you to start
to become observant of the limitations of theory versus the
limitations of practice and also how you can use one
to improve the other right they can prop each other
up as you start to become more aware of that
you'll see that your mind will figure out the details
for you I don't think you need to micromanage your
mind so much which is why I'm not giving you
some simple mechanical technique for how to develop these abilities
I'm just basically telling you to become more observant because
I think that larger this is a matter of awareness
you need to start to see these dynamics happening in
your life you need to become convinced by seeing them
that it's important to the quality of your life that
you become more and more observant of these things and
as you do that as you think about your thinking
as you break cycles of theory with practice and vice-versa
you'll become more and more adept at these things and
that's basically how you're going to develop this stuff um
and also just you know learning more self-actualization theory will
be helpful some people say well Lia all the stuff
you teach is just very abstract and theoretical yes it
is and that can be a huge danger but then
again it's very helpful to have a solid foundation of
theory so that you know what the right steps are
and where you're screwing up a lot of people do
not even know what they're doing wrong in their life
and before you can correct what you're doing wrong you
need to know what's right see if you think about
it like you're a young cadet who went to military
training school and you became an officer and they taught
you military strategy and theory you know for how to
fight balint battles on the battlefield and let's say you're
a general and you're commanding troops now and so you
have all these theories from the classroom those are good
those are very important a general needs to have studied
the decisive battles of the past throughout history throughout the
last three thousand years of history to see what other
generals did wrong and what they did right how military
battles are actually fought and won and what are all
the traps and mistakes that could happen you need to
know that in in theory but then of course you
need to be able to to take that theory and
then actually apply it to your troops to your particular
situation on the ground which might not fit any of
the templates that you've studied in the classroom although some
of the principles you can still carry over and apply
and so a good general is one who both has
practical experience but also theoretical know-how and he lets the
theory inform the practice he knows how to take the
theory and create a solid strategy fitting his particular situation
on the battlefield he knows how to convert the high-level
strategy into a concrete action step and orders that he
can get to his troops so that they can go
and actually execute on the strategy because if you have
a great strategy but no ability to execute on it
you know what good is that and he also knows
when to break with the theory because he sees some
sort of unique situation in practice unfolding on the ground
right maybe the theory is telling him that he needs
to concentrate all his force in this one spot and
attack the enemy in this one particular way but in
practice he's looking at the situation on the ground and
he's saying yeah I should do that but my troops
say I'm just sensing that my troops don't have enough
morale to follow through on that theory so in practice
I couldn't follow through on that theory so I need
another strategy I need something practical that's going to raise
my troops morale first so maybe I'll figure out some
way to do that which I wasn't taught in the
in the textbooks maybe I'll take my men to a
brothel and then get them all laid and now their
morale is going to be up and now I can
finally execute on that strategy that was taught to me
in the textbooks but you know in the textbooks and
they didn't tell me to take my men to a
brothel that's sort of like you know outside the bounds
of what a textbook can teach you just a random
example so see this this is it's a very interesting
and subtle game that's being played here in life between
theory and practice and I want you to start to
see this so I've already given you a lot of
examples about how this works let me give you a
few more let's take the example of someone who is
mmm learning personal development theory and so they spent maybe
a year watching videos and reading books and stuff like
that if they have this ability of manipulating theory and
practice properly then they need to tell us it's okay
I've got much theory now I've got enough it was
important for me to learn I spent the last year
learning all these principles it was very important I recognized
the value there but now I need to stop reading
books for a while not forever just for a while
I'm going to stop reading books and I'm just going
to sit down I'm going to come up with the
best action plan that I can take into account everything
I learned about what I need to do in my
life to start to embody some of these personal development
principles and I'll just make a list and then start
to act on it starting tomorrow BAM done and then
you start to do that and you do that for
a few months and then you start to see okay
yeah this is working it's finally working on finally starting
to embody the theory into the practice okay now I
can allow myself to go maybe read a few more
books and then continue that process see so that would
be an example of someone properly managing the theory a
wrong example of that would be someone who just says
now I'm just going to watch more theory and then
I want to watch more thing I'm going to buy
even more books and I'm going to I'm going to
go to some seminars I'm gonna learn even more and
more and more and more and more and then you
become a personal development Theory glutton but you're not able
to embody it another example of this careful balance between
practice and theory is let's say you're learning about spirituality
and as you're reading some book on spirituality one of
the teachers tells you hey spiritual seeking is very dangerous
do not become a spiritual seeker because enlightenment cannot be
attained in the way that you attain a material object
and so you read that and you might say oh
I shouldn't become a spiritual seeker and then you say
okay so I'm going to stop meditating I used to
meditate I'm going to stop I used to do visualizations
about becoming I'm going to stop that I used to
read spiritual books I'm going to stop that and so
you do that and then a month later what do
you discover you discover that you're sitting on your couch
watching television eating Cheetos not meditating not reading and you've
now all of a sudden found yourself in a much
worse situation than you were before so even though the
theory tells you you shouldn't be a spiritual seeker in
practice what you're seeing that by following that advice you're
actually lazy and complacent and that you are further away
from spirituality than ever and that you will never become
enlightened through that process and so now you need to
be able to recognize that and say oh wait a
minute wait a minute I've misinterpreted misapplied the theory and
then you realize ah but see seeking actually is necessary
from a practical point of view yes in theory spiritual
seeking is a trap but in practice by not actually
meditating every day by not studying spiritual literature by not
thinking about these things by not putting effort into it
I find that nothing happens at all and I'm deeper
into monkey mind and I'm more depressed and more frustrated
with my life than ever at least when I was
meditating I felt like I was growing I felt like
my awareness was rising see and then in that situation
you're you're you're being aware you're being observant of the
limitations of both ends of this right and then maybe
you become too much of a spiritual seeker and then
you can say oh yeah I've been seeking way too
much I should just sit down and you know calm
down and just relax and do some do nothing for
for a few days okay then you do that and
then you start to see that that works for you
see but you have to be able to balance that
another example might be let's say you're working in a
university department and all your professors are telling you hey
yeah you got to specialize more and more and more
specialize in your very very narrow people and in practice
maybe that's what makes you a successful professor that you
specialize more and more and more and more in your
field but in theory for example you know that specializing
so much you're going to lose sight of the bigger
picture and that ultimately what's more important in life is
not success in your university but to understand life as
a whole to see the bigger picture to be able
to embody the bigger picture and so here your theory
is telling you wait a minute like warning warning warning
alarm bells should be going off in your mind about
over specializing in some area and so you let your
theory inform your practical decisions maybe decide here you know
what becoming a university professor is not right for me
that might work for some people but it is work
for me because I care about the bigger picture I
care about holism I care about actually embodying the the
research that I do and so forth and I just
can't do that in a university setting that's just an
example right I'm not saying that this is what you
should be doing right now if you're a university I'm
not saying that data day you should quit University maybe
it's the opposite for you you see these are just
random examples you have to figure out what's right for
you another example might be let's say that you're trying
to figure out your life purpose and maybe you've taken
my course and you've got a general idea have a
little bit of a hunch of maybe what your life
purpose is but it's not quite resonating with you you
don't really feel that proper fit you're not really sure
if it's your life purpose and so you're just sitting
you've been sitting there for a month thinking about this
you know doing the course over again really trying to
get it locked down and it still doesn't click well
what you need to do is need to recognize okay
that was me acting on the theory that was me
sitting there theorizing a lot about my life purpose now
I've done enough of that I can only get so
far by just theorizing now I have to actually go
out into the real world and test some of this
stuff out yeah I don't have a proper fit it
hasn't completely clicked I'm not totally sure but so what
so what if I'm going to be sitting here and
theorizing about my life purpose until it's a perfect fit
in my mind I might do that for the rest
of my life and that's not a risk I want
to take so let me try to use action and
practice to inform my theory trusting that if I go
out there take action for six months and then I
come back to it and think about my life purpose
some more I'll have new insights new perspective a bigger
picture more of a context from which to see that
and in that way you're using action to prop yourself
out of a stuck situation in the theory let's say
as another example you're sitting there and you're doing self
inquiry and you're really curious to know then you're really
working hard at understanding what enlightenment is and you're sitting
there and you're sitting here trying to get to enlightenment
try and get to enlightenment like oh well as enlightenment
this is that that is it nothing what is nothing
where am i what am i what is reality or
thinking about all this stuff you're sitting at you're doing
all the exercises maybe you heard from me or from
other non-dual teachers and you're trying to do is you've
been doing it for months and you start to now
observe wait a minute if I step back for a
moment and I start to meta think about all my
thinking on this topic of enlightenment and on self inquiry
I can start to see that I'm trying to conceptualize
the truth I keep thinking about the truth keep thinking
about in life and keep thinking about a figure what
is nothing what am i what doing illicit it's just
thinking I'm thinking more and more thinking and then you
realize ah but I need to acknowledge the limits of
thinking I'm not going to get to enlightenment through thinking
maybe there's a different way see and when you notice
that when you actually observe that at a deep level
then your mind will actually release and drop the thinking
that's a very important component of not getting stuck in
theory is to you can what I found is this
very interesting thing happens when you're thinking sometimes you're thinking
very deeply about something especially if you're doing some sort
of existential level of thinking you're thinking very deeply about
something and then what will happen is that your mind
will reach a point where the thinking sees and thinks
of how limited the thinking is and when that happens
there's a sort of like party of the clouds and
the thinking sort of starts to melt and dissolve away
and what you're left with is this just this sense
of awareness and knowing but not thinking how do i
articulate this better yeah you have to experience this to
know what I'm talking about if you if you're a
conceptual person you thought of a lot about very stuff
you philosophize a lot in life then I'm pretty sure
you must have reached this point at some point with
your thinking where you realize where you're thinking realizes the
limits of itself it's a pretty profound and cool phenomenon
I think that a lot of rationalist people miss this
point which is why they keep insisting that hey everything
can be logical everything can be rational but when you
experience these moments where you're thinking realizes its own limitations
then it becomes very obvious and apparent to you that
actually you can't think your way out of every problem
because the thinking itself is a very limited thing you're
trying to use a subset of reality a symbol to
represent something much larger than that symbol and that's just
impossible you can become conscious of this but thinking about
it alone is not enough you need to actually become
conscious of this when this happens your thing sort of
stops and you get this nice quietness about you where
you have a sort of sense of knowing but the
knowing is not a logical knowing it's just like you're
sitting there and you kind of know maybe you could
call it an intuition or just knowing is a good
word but if you think of knowing as logical thinking
and verbalizing that's not what I'm talking about it's a
sort of deeper knowing it's a knowing that transcends verbalization
and you know if you take in psychedelics then you
know what I'm talking about there are things that you
can experience on psychedelics that you will struggle for a
hundred years to write down in words and yet it's
some of the truest stuff you've ever experienced some of
the true stuff you've known so anyways I tried to
give you a lot of examples here I hope you
get it you need to actually go out there now
actually sort of try to implement this stuff in conclusion
let me just tell you that you need to be
very pragmatic in life and very philosophical in life and
very idealistic in life and very realistic in life do
not make these into false dichotomies don't create an identity
out of being any one of these things to the
exclusion of others you need to be able to balance
depending on the situation because ultimately if we want to
take your life and boil it down and put it
into a nutshell what are you doing your life you
are solving utilitarian problems in the service of higher consciousness
that's what you're here to do and this is tricky
because you're solving utilitarian problems which is very pragmatic stuff
in the service of higher consciousness which is very abstract
stuff so that's the nature of the beast balancing theory
versus practice is a very rare skill it's a highly
valuable skill if you learn how to do this you
will have a much easier time in life much easier
time with business with relationships with everything and you will
be a much more valuable to your employer's to your
customers because you're just going to be a kind of
a down-to-earth person yet at the same time you're going
to have a sense of what's really important in life
see this really is like a superpower so I hope
this inspires you to go and develop it alright I'm
signing off please click the like button for me post
your comments down below share this episode with a friend
and lastly come check out actualize that org this is
my website right here I have some exclusive resources there
my book list life purpose course my blog I'm posting
a lot of cool insights on my blog and I'm
going to continue to do that so make sure that
you stay up to dip up-to-date with those every week
my newsletter is there so you can stay on track
with me for the future it's very important that you
stick with me because this is an epic journey this
is not just a couple of videos that you watch
this is your whole life trajectory that we're talking about
here self-actualization and I have so many profound concepts that
I need to share with you and I don't just
say that to brag I say that because it's it
is the case my biggest struggle is to to find
the time and energy to articulate all these very profound
concepts because there's I'm drowning in them there's too many
I'm drowning in them it's going to take me years
to cover all the most fundamental topics and they're going
to keep getting more and more fundamental and more profound
as we go along the most important thing for you
is to recognize this as a resource that could really
transform your life not because I'm important not because I'm
special just because this is a rare opportunity these sorts
of resources are very difficult to market the fact that
you found this resource just by luck is a very
rare thing most people in life will never find such
a resource so you found the trailhead of this path
you're not really on this path proper yet but you
found the trailhead the most important thing you can do
now the wisest thing is to realize I found the
trailhead of the most important thing in life self-actualization it
is the most important thing what else is there named
Eve one other thing that's more important I dare you
if there is I would be doing it I wouldn't
be wasting my time here people sometimes they only oh
but do you know if you were so smart and
so good then why don't you do with something that
earns you millions of dollars and you know why aren't
you earning tens of millions of dollars doing something else
because I know that that stuff will not be it
this is the highest path right here there's nowhere else
to be this is the path of greatest value and
it will be that way for you too because you're
a human being and you can't help it these are
the most fundamental the most rock-bottom principles that create a
great life right here there's no other alternatives really not
when you understand this stuff fully so the most important
thing we do now is recognize that you found the
trailhead and make a commitment to stick with this path
follow the path wherever it leads even when you're confused
when you're frustrated when you're not seeing the results that
you were expecting stay with it this is a big
prize that you're after a big prize comes with of
course a big investment the investment here is not so
much money but just your time your emotional labor your
consistency the ability to stick with me here in -
to keep watching this stuff over and over and over
again every single week so that you build a theoretical
foundation and then once you've got a solid theoretical foundation
you can go rock it with the action you should
start taking action already but do not dismiss the importance
of building a solid theoretical foundation I only feel that
now after maybe about seven years of actively very actively
studying personal development and spirituality only now am I feeling
okay I've sort of got a bit of a handle
on the theoretical foundation part sort of a bit of
a handle after seven [ __ ] years so don't
be too afraid by this notion like oh yeah I've
I've been watching your videos for a year leo and
it seems like you know I know too much theory
now no you don't you're still completely confused about what's
right and wrong for you in your life when you
really know the theory man you'll feel it in your
action now don't use that as an excuse to watch
my videos for seven years and not take any action
that would be a big mistake but also don't fall
into the trap of thinking like oh yeah I've already
watched 100 videos and that means I'm good now no
you're not you're not even close to conceptually understanding everything
you need to to live a great life so that's
coming more in the future stick with me for that
you
