hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the most important commitment
that you can make in your life and I'm going
to make a huge announcement about actualize org I'm going
to spoil the announcement a bit here I want it
to make it at the end of the video and
I'm going to talk at the end of the video
a lot about the announcement but I'm just going to
spoil it for you right here in case you don't
want to sit through to the very end which is
that actualized org now has a forum the actualized org
self-improvement forums it's a place where you can go and
interact with the people for free and learn tips and
tricks of self actualization so go ahead and check that
out right now you can go it's live you can
sign up for an account but stick with me I'm
going to talk more about that announcement and some important
features of that announcement at the very end but I
want to give you the meat of what I want
to talk about here today which is this commitment idea
what's the most important thing that you can commit your
life to well we'll get to that in a minute
first let me just say have you noticed that my
videos are kind of abnormally long sometimes they're like 30
minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes why is that well one
reason of course is that I simply just like to
hear myself talk as people have pointed out to me
but the second reason the more important one is that
self mastery what we're doing here self mastery this is
a very deep field a very deep field and one
of the challenges I have in working in this field
is that I have to wrack my brain every single
week thinking about how to teach you all this amazing
deep stuff that I've discovered in this field like really
deep stuff stuff that would blow your mind stuff that
you haven't even heard from me before like you think
some of the stuff I been doing lately has been
deep now I'm talking about like really deep stuff but
the problem is is that it's really hard to communicate
some of these subtle and deep concepts and ideas and
techniques in a 30-minute video or a 60-minute video even
a 90-minute video really to properly cover these subjects would
take hours entire courses which is something that I'm moving
towards and something that I'm planning on doing more of
in the future but see what I really need from
you is I need a sort of commitment from you
a commitment and a a vision for what self mastery
could mean to your life this goes way beyond just
watching some videos of mine you need to be reading
stuff you need to be doing exercises you need to
be going to retreats and workshops you need to be
much more engaged in this entire process of self mastery
and my challenge is to convince you of doing that
because this is not a logical argument this is kind
of like an emotional thing that you need to get
over right you got to realize that to really get
amazing results with personal development you need to spend years
studying and experimenting now some results you can get within
a matter of weeks or a few months and that's
cool and that's what you need to get started right
because you don't want to be investing years into something
and then not seeing any results so you need some
of those initial results but you got to be smart
enough to see the bigger picture here the kick-ass results
that you can get the life transforming results those will
take you realistically three to five years to see that's
three to five years of priming the pump priming the
pump is like you're pumping pumping pumping away and nothing's
really coming out yet you're investing right it's an investment
a long-term investment this is a huge investment it's a
huge investment of your time your energy there's other stuff
you could be doing you could be having fun you
could be entertaining yourself or whatever I know that but
the question you should really be asking yourself is yes
okay the investment is huge Leo you want me to
be pouring all this effort into this okay uh but
see a wise person the way wise person thinks is
like this is like well I'm fine with a huge
investment as long as my payoff is going to be
equally huge you see in fact when I see a
huge investment I get excited because that means that there's
a possibility of a huge payoff so the question is
is it worth it is it worth investing these three
to five years to see these so-called promised kick-ass results
and the answer of course is absolutely absolutely this is
the most worthwhile thing you could be doing in your
life my job is to deliver wisdom to you now
wisdom and I want to talk about this in a
whole separate episode this issue of wisdom because this is
one of those deep topics but in a nutshell what
wisdom is is it's knowing worth what is worthwhile to
pursue and what's not worthwhile to pursue it's the ability
to have a certain keen sense of judgment and priorities
in life it's the ability to make decisions in a
way that leads to the optimal outcome in the end
and to do this you have to think holistically you
have to think strategically you have to think very long-term
you have to make long-term evaluations it's kind of like
being president of the country or CEO of the corporation
or the general on the battlefield right these people have
to make big macro decisions and how do they do
that well they develop wisdom and how do they develop
wisdom by doing a broad survey and having a lot
of experience right you do a broad survey of all
the different things you could be doing in life and
you learn you learn what things are really going to
get you to the end result that you want to
that fulfillment that you're looking for and then you also
learn about all the things that seem like they'll get
you there but are ashlee detours or dead ends or
cul-de-sacs and there's a lot of cul-de-sacs that you've probably
experienced already in your life pick up can be a
cul-de-sac marriage can be a cul-de-sac business can be a
cul-de-sac going out and earning more money can be a
cul-de-sac entertainment and partying and hedonism and drugs those are
all ultimately cul-de-sacs see but it's hard to appreciate this
when you're not seeing the big picture when you haven't
done the survey the survey of the whole field yet
of all that life has to offer and until you
do then you can't really be wise you can't make
wise decisions you make immature decisions decisions that come back
to bite you in the ass decades later much to
your embarrassment and they create a lot of suffering and
misery in your life that shouldn't have been there right
so one of the values that I can provide to
you when I speak to you is that I can
help to convince you of what's wise and what's not
wise and let me tell you one of the wisest
things you can do one of the most worthwhile things
you can do in your life is to learn personal
development really learn it from the inside out learn everything
about it live it to the point where you not
just learn the theory but you actually learn the practice
you learn how to embody learn all the nuances and
that takes some effort that takes years to do that
why is this the wisest thing well because actually there's
nothing more important or urgent or practical than learning personal
development I mean what's more relevant and important to your
life than learning how to optimize your own life everything
else is secondary really if you think about it a
lot of what we do in modern societies we outsource
work to other people for example if I need to
repair my car get an oil change I'll go to
mechanic I don't even know how to change the oil
in my car because it's easier for me to outsource
that for forty dollars than to spend a week learning
how to do it myself and likewise maybe if I
have a computer problem I can outsource that to some
kind of computer tech guy and he can do that
for me because he's more knowledgeable about computers and it
would take me years to learn everything about computers to
be able to code this complicated piece of software that
I need him to code for me and so we
do this right we rely on other people this is
the the specialization we're highly specialized in modern society so
that's good in a sense but there's a problem with
that in that you can't do that with the overarching
direction of your whole life you see you can't outsource
being a CEO of your own life imagine for example
that you got elected president of the country alright you
I'd like to president now president is the one who
sees and makes all the judgments and decisions based on
his foresight and his good judgment and his wisdom in
his years and decades of experience that's the purpose of
a president right that's the purpose of a strong leader
is that he can integrate he could see and he
can come up with a vision for the future that
other people can't quite see because he has that something
extra in him that allows him to do that right
this is what a great leader does but now imagine
that you became president of the country but then what
she did is you said oh you know what I'll
just outsource have to somebody else all that's some other
member of my cabinet do it for me or I'll
just pay this guy over here to do it for
me two problems with that first of all you became
president because you actually want to be the leader I
mean don't you want to be the one that's leading
your own life you don't want me leading your life
you want to be leading your own life you want
me to just be a resource for you but see
what most people do is they just kind of take
the back seat and when they watch these videos when
they listen to me then is kind of like I
become the leader of your life and then you just
become the follower and you don't go out there really
take the initiative to learn the inside guts of this
thing we're calling personal development what you really need to
do is you need to learn how the engine works
so if you're a mechanic and you really want to
be good mechanic you learn how the engine works right
you have to study it now it doesn't make sense
for you who's not a mechanic to study how an
engine works because that'd probably be a wasted your time
you don't really care about engines okay fine but you
can't do that with your life you can't take that
kind of attitude with your life because if you do
that what happens then is that you're not really taking
responsibility for your life right you want to be the
leader to get the amazing results you need to be
able to see the big big big big ultimate picture
of everything concealed in life is all-inclusive it includes everything
includes all the sub domains of life it includes your
career your relationships your fitness issues your your health your
medical conditions your uh you know who you involve yourself
with your friends and how you entertainers all these things
fit into life including the pursuit of truth and your
education and how much money you have all these are
just little facets of this bigger thing we call life
and one of my missions is to to show you
as the depth at which you can master life and
understand how the guts work but to do that I
need you to really be on board and committed to
learning how the guts work and not just looking for
a quick fix solution like you're going to take some
little technique of mine you're gonna go use it and
then you're gonna say olio this didn't work or maybe
it did work for you and you say oh yeah
it worked and you're going to keep using at your
whole life but then you're not gonna go deeper and
learn you know why is it working why am i
saying the things I'm saying why does everything that I
say uh fit together in a certain way how did
I come up with these conclusions the point is not
for you just to come up here into - believe
me and just to accept these things on faith that's
not going to help you no more than if you
want to learn to be a mechanic and someone told
you about how an engine works and you just learned
it memorized it and then you think you know how
it works but really you know how it works you
just memorized something someone told you if we actually give
you a real live engine we tell you to take
it apart and put it back together again you'll destroy
that engine you see so that involves tinkering on your
part and a genuine curiosity in the field a commitment
to mastery in the field the only way that I
can show you everything that I want to show you
that I know that you can learn that will completely
transform your life is if I convince you I persuade
you I believe you I shock you into making this
commitment this is not a logical argument something you have
to kind of get in your bones in your heart
it's just basically me mind you that's what I'm doing
up here it's not the techniques that I'm delivering or
the information I'm giving you that's important what's important is
the mindfuck component you need to get mind by somebody
into seeing and waking up and saying oh oh this
is so freaking important why didn't I see it before
I was asleep the whole time that's really the most
important thing you can get from me if some of
that rubs off on you see one of the greatest
decisions that I made in my life personally was back
in like 2007-2008 when I first stumbled upon self-help as
a genre as a field I actually went to Barnes
& Noble ever I went to a book store Barnes
& Noble this was in Fort Worth Texas when I
just first started my first business and I had some
spare time and I wanted to kind of improve my
habits and I was just looking through the aisles and
I found the self-help aisle I didn't even know the
self-help aisle existed I just found it in the bookstore
and there I was just looking through all the stuff
and I was kind of amazed at all this stuff
that was there and I just picked the thing that
I thought was going to be like the most productive
and I was just Tony Robbins CD program CD program
from Tony Robbins cost like 50 bucks or something and
I bought that and then I started listening to that
in my car I remember during my lunch breaks when
I was you know in between work and like just
something in me clicked I saw it was just like
a vision of like oh my god this multiplied if
I just keep doing this multiplied times year after year
after year decade after decade after decade is going to
completely transform my whole life see so there I got
convinced I kind of convinced myself or I don't know
Tony Robbins can do something convinced me um but see
you have to have that kind of imagination to see
what self mastery over the decades will really mean for
you because usually our imaginations are lazy and they don't
think very far ahead they're not very ambitious they're not
what we'd call like a visionary imagination they just kind
of think like one or two steps ahead they don't
see 10 or 20 steps ahead I saw then and
there that I need to learn the inner workings of
self help not just listen to Tony Robbins in my
mind it was like yes Tony Rob has so many
great things I like it ok cool but it's like
no no no this is just a tip of the
iceberg in my mind it was immediate like no I'm
mastering this whole field mastering the whole field not just
one program not just one book or a couple of
them I'm gonna understand all the inner workings and the
guts of it and by the way I didn't just
do that because I said to myself well I need
to because this is going to be like my career
now I didn't have any ambitions to be a self-help
guru or anything like that for years that happened much
later much later so I'm not saying that you have
to do this with some kind of ambition to become
some self-help guru I mean you could if you want
but um no you just need this personally for yourself
to get great results the reason that I started actualised
org is not to make money and it's not to
be a self-help guru but it's to show people the
deepest understanding of life that's possible and that's tough to
do it's tough to go deep especially on a platform
such as YouTube where I'm competing with with people who
are shooting five ten minute videos about stupid humor and
whatever else right um but this is necessary this depth
is necessary not only is it necessary to get great
results it's also just fascinating it's one of the most
fascinating things you'll find in life I mean what's more
fascinating to you than the study of yourself I mean
you're the thing you care the most about in life
don't lie that's the only thing you pretty much care
about in life is you so you might as well
study the out of it right what else could be
more practical what else is a better use of your
time are you starting get on board starting to see
the possibilities I don't know Matt's like sit down for
an hour just visualize the possibilities because you need to
get your mind thinking along these lines and connect all
the dots together and just see what's possible for you
20 years down the road if you just keep on
this road and it's not like you need to delay
for 20 years I'm not telling you that for the
next 20 years you need to grind it out and
it's going to be no fun and it's going to
be no results and only then you'll guess you're going
to get results pouring in before that much earlier but
also you got to be smart and make sure you're
not trading the long term huge gains for the little
short-term shortcuts and magic pill solutions and little gains that
you get upfront those are all nice but really that's
not why you're doing it you're doing it for the
long-term once you get your mind making this paradigm shift
then all the sudden you're going to be more engaged
you're going to be more tolerant and more patient you
can have more focus for washing along video or read
a long book which otherwise you would never do you
see so bottom line is what I want from you
is I want a commitment from you I want a
commitment from you for a lifelong study in pursuit of
self mastery do you want to make that commitment if
you can see the possibilities and make the commitment with
me right now the way that I did what is
it like eight years ago now seven years ago and
I'm still just tapping into the all the kick-ass results
that I could be getting I mean I've already gotten
a lot of kickass results from this process but all
the more most kick-ass results are still way ahead for
me right that's what's so exciting about this journey is
that it really never stops bearing fruit it's like you're
planting an apple tree that just keeps dropping apples just
every day year after year after year after year and
all you got to do is just nurture it for
a few years to get it to that mature state
word the Apple start to drop so if you can
see that in your mind's eye then make this commitment
with me right now say this with me I commit
to the lifelong study of self mastery said again I
commit to the lifelong study of self mastery one more
time say with me I commit to the lifelong study
of self mastery excellent make sure that you mean it
and if you're still wavering on that then sit down
and really drill into it and and contemplate the significance
that this kind of commitment could have in your life
what it could do for you you see this commitment
right here will solve many many many many problems in
your life and will lead to many many beautiful things
that you can't even expect yet and that takes some
visionary skills on your part to see all right so
enough about that I covered the commitment topic now let
me talk a little bit about this big announcement with
actualize org and the forum so the announcement is is
that we just launched the actualized org forum it's a
free community where you can go and create an account
and sign up and what you get is you get
access to all the other individuals who are really keen
on doing self-actualization work I've really been amazed we already
have a hundred people the initial test run we tested
the form with a hundred people and I sent out
invitations to two folks and they responded back and I
was amazed at some of the stories and applications that
I read from these folks if some of these folks
have lots of experience they've overcome serious crippling challenges in
their life and they're working on themselves and they're reading
a lot and they're they're pursuing self development like they
made a commitment to it these folks are living what
I'm talking about here and a lot of them are
pursuing enlightenment and meditation all the stuff that I talk
about right so this community here is a community of
people who share a common set of values this is
a rare thing if you've tried to look for a
self-help community online you might have discovered that is hard
to find a good one I mean I'm sure there
are some out there but personally I haven't really found
any that I really liked that much there are either
all kind of dead there's not that many people there
the discussions there are really low quality or the discussions
are about topics that are really not central to self-actualization
it's really not about self-actualization it's more about how to
fix a problem that I have so for example you
might find a online message board about how to cure
depression or how to overcome alcohol addiction or something like
this I mean that can be helpful for some people
sure but there's something very different between that and between
what we're doing here with actualized org the actualized org
forum here we're focused on positive psychology here we're focused
on how do you hit your peak potential life this
is what you really need if you're depressed you don't
need to go to a depression forum what you really
need to do is you need to go to a
forum or a place where people are talking about how
you can lift yourself up to the highest you can
be right because when you go to a depression forum
what you're doing is actually you're you're basking in depression
because everyone there is depressed and they're talking about their
depression you go to a self-actualization forum and you hear
people talking about amazing stuff that they're doing in their
life and all the amazing possibilities that now gets you
excited about how you could outgrow your depression transcend your
depression and move into something really amazing that maybe you
didn't even imagine was possible before for you you see
forums I feel like are really greatly underappreciated resources online
of all the different tools that are available online from
like Twitter and Facebook and social media accounts and there's
all sorts of different websites and applications and different kinds
of software that can let you do all sorts of
you know great utilitarian things but forums and forums have
been around since the very beginning of the internet since
the the 1990s forums are actually I think one of
the most old-school and yet still most functional and important
tools of the internet this is a format that allows
you to discuss subject matter that you would otherwise never
be able to discuss with anybody else and it allows
you to learn things that you would not be able
to learn anyway else you can't just learn it the
same way through a book or through a video or
through a seminar something like that I mean all of
these different modalities are useful and I encourage you to
use them all but there's something very special about forums
and in my own life there were key moments where
actually forums if I really think about it I can
I can attribute my personal success right now where I
am my position in life my financial independence I can
tribute all of that I can tie it all back
to my participation forums over the last 10 to 20
years I've used forums to learn software development and web
programming and scripting that otherwise I would not have been
able to really learn I've used forums to create my
first career my game design career that I started was
it it was a really good career I got a
really good job right out of the gate and that
was because I was participating in a game development forum
and I created a mod there and I got a
lot of recognition on the forum for it which then
allowed me to use that as a stepping stone and
then move into my my first career stat was huge
that was life transforming for me and then uh also
for the first business that I started my internet marketing
business basically that entire business was started for me being
dissatisfied with my game development career which is ironic cuz
I got that through a forum but then I went
to a new forum and I started learning about internet
marketing and so um that forum allowed me to then
create a business that went on to earn hundreds of
thousands over a million dollars in cash so that was
from uh from another forum right and there was no
way I would have learned all that information by myself
through a book or anything at forums discuss topics that
are not usually available in books and then after that
after my business endeavors then I found myself really lacking
with dating and not knowing how to attract women and
so again I went and I looked at forums and
I found a forum that taught me how to attract
women and that was really instrumental for me because there
is no way I would have learned some of the
things that I learned and basically my whole personality structure
has changed from the things that I learned on that
forum it was actually multiple forums that I used not
just one so that that was huge that was life
transforming for me where I am today where I live
today I live in Las Vegas that basically happened because
of what was enabled on that forum and then and
then after that you know after I got done with
my dating stuff and I got a little better there
and I got happy with my results there then I
also went and I found some consciousness development forums I
started learning about enlightenment and other things like this and
I started getting help through forums and I get it
sort of getting mentoring and stuff like that and that
was instrumental for my understanding of enlightenment and my understanding
of consciousness and meditation and a lot of the things
that I teach you now things that are now like
a cutting edge in my life a lot of those
things I learned through forums so the point being is
that these are tools that can be really really simple
on the surface it can seem like all form you
know what kind of for really do for me but
then when you actually get involved in the community you
see other people doing it you just get hooked into
it you start learning stuff you start learning little tips
and tricks that you would have never found in any
book no matter how many of them you read uh
and you just get involved and get passionate about something
and stuff starts to click for you and you start
moving advancing forward in ways that you didn't imagine was
possible before you know it was challenging for me to
make this decision of releasing this forum it wasn't easy
because one of the challenges with the forum is that
it's a democratic place I'm not there to rule over
everybody and in fact in a sense the forum sort
of goes against my personal self agenda because with actualize
a Touareg what I could have decided to do is
I could have just said you know what all that
actualize abrooke is going to be is just me standing
up here and talking and spouting my opinions and ideas
about personal development and then you know releasing courses and
people would buy those and I would live happily ever
after um that's kind of like the business model that
I was going down but then I also started to
to kind of get this higher calling which was telling
me like but how can I deliver even more value
to people beyond the videos beyond the courses how do
I get really how do I really get people to
self-actualize and of course the answer immediately came up as
okay start a community you need a community it's much
easier to self-actualize in a community of people but then
of course I had a lot of doubts you know
the ego throws up doubts and fears and it's as
well but what about you know what about the community
what if the community just becomes so good and so
autonomous that they don't even need me anymore what if
it affects my bottom line what if they don't buy
my courses anymore what if you know all these what-ifs
all these fears so I struggle with that for a
while and I have to see you know what am
I really after here what I really want and ultimately
I decided that what I really am after is my
original goal with actualize our wishes to to deliver the
deepest understanding possible to you and I just felt like
I couldn't do that just through video alone or through
courses right and I just knew that I wouldn't be
satisfied until I got more people invested and more people
seeing the depth of possibilities here and to me that
meant that I had to I really did have a
choice in the matter I had to release this forum
and so that's what I've been working on for the
last couple months and here it is a lot of
people have been asking me over the last couple of
years you know Leo how do I find people who
are into self-actualization it's so hard none of my friends
are into it my family isn't into it they think
I'm weird you know where do I go well here's
your solution to that problem the people on this forum
are going to be focused and specialized on self-actualization all
the stuff that I cover in my videos we're going
to have high quality discussion there I've got a great
moderation team I'm really excited about that they have a
lot of experience and a lot of these folks are
pursuing stuff like enlightenment and other advanced personal development concepts
the other really cool possibility here is that we can
really develop a big live community so I have a
lot of subscribers to the YouTube channel I have a
lot of subscribers on my email newsletter list and so
I encourage all of you to go and check out
the forum because think of the possibilities here we can
get a community of 10,000 maybe even a hundred thousand
people over the next couple of years coming together and
if it's if it's going to be centered around the
right set of values these values of self-actualization then man
this community could really be something incredible and one thing
that I'm really stressing with this community is higher consciousness
values so that's something that we're going to try to
moderate on and something that's we're going to try to
get everyone to kind of rally around because these are
things that you don't really see in other places I
think it's really hard to find high consciousness communities on
the internet most internet communities are pretty low consciousness so
this can be something of a unique point about the
actual eyes that are on forum you can come here
to meet like-minded people you can make friends all crowd
across the world or in your local area you can
share tips and tricks for how to self actualize how
to be more productive how to be better at relationships
how to improve your health how to find your life
purpose how to improve your career how to earn more
money how to start a business how to do enlightenment
work how to meditate all these topics that are central
to your life right you're also going to get perspectives
from different people not just for myself so what I'm
giving you with my videos and my my standard actualize
that our content is basically one perspective on the world
the actualized org léo perspective but that's not the only
perspective there's plenty of other valid perspectives and other valid
and different ways of doing personal development and that's something
that you'll be able to experience on the forum you
can also share great resources you can share your favorite
books your favorite movies your favorite programs your favorite coaching
seminars and workshops and all this kind of stuff you
know there's a lot of amazing resources out there filtering
through it all on your own can be expensive and
challenging this forum will help you a lot with that
you can also get emotional support and this is huge
because you know what if you're in a rut right
now in your life you're feeling lazy were you feeling
depressed you're feeling like you've got this problem that you
can't overcome like you've got some kind of addiction or
you're just stuck and you don't know what to do
or you're just feeling like very negative and you don't
think that it's going to work out for you that's
we're getting other people to come and to assess your
situation more objectively is really helpful other people who are
compassionate who have been where you've been who have much
more life experience than you who can infuse your worldview
with a little bit more wisdom a little bit more
objectivity and get you that kind of emotional leverage that
you need on yourself to really go out there and
change your life and make it stick so you can
get emotional support and accountability people can hold you accountable
for actually starting to take action another really cool feature
that I think will be really useful if you guys
want to do this and there's a section on the
forum right now already for this is something I call
self actualization journals you can create a journal a public
record where you can just keep adding entries on a
weekly basis of how your self actualizing how yourself developing
the challenges you're overcoming and you can be very brutally
honest about this and this will be almost like therapeutic
for you and it will also be highly inspirational to
the people that are following your journal and you can
just kind of keep adding to it and that will
build a lot of momentum for you and hold you
accountable for doing the things that you want to do
as far as your personal development goes and lastly I
think a key feature of the forum is that I'm
going to try to contribute some personal content for myself
they're the actual eyes that are content here uh I
try to make it personal but there's a lot of
stuff that I have to hold back because it's not
quite polished you know it takes a lot of effort
to to shoot these videos to make sure they're polished
and nice and everybody sees them and stuff on the
forum I'm going to be chiming in and I'm going
to be leaving comments and I'm going to be contributing
content there which is going to be in a sense
even more powerful than what you get here through the
videos because it's going to be like raw unpolished content
and that can be very eye-opening because when you see
kind of the polished presentation of self development it just
seems a little bit like well but Leo how do
I apply this in my life you kind of get
that kind of vibe from it when you see like
the raw guts of how people do personal development that's
often very different from the kind of polished perspective that
you get in a video or in a seminar to
program somewhere right the real down-to-earth no like dirty personal
development what does that really look like well if you
go to the forum then that's what you're going to
see happening right there live before your eyes every single
day so those are all the features I hope that
you can see some powerful possibilities here and if you're
committed to this thing we call self mastery then this
is just the perfect opportunity for you it's free it's
open right now go ahead and create an account you're
going to need to create a new account so if
you already have an existing actualizado account for the actualizado
website the forum needs a separate account so go ahead
and open that and I look forward to seeing you
there there's going to be a button at the end
of this episode that you can click that will take
you straight to the forum all right that's it I'm
Leo and I'm done signing off you
