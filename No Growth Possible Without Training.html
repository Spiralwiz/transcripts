hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about how no serious growth is
possible without training [Music] you if you're not going to
train you can kiss all your dreams goodbye the biggest
reason that people don't grow and they don't self actualize
is simply that they don't train it's that simple training
is required for success in any area of life it
doesn't matter what the area is business career public speaking
relationships sexuality dating health being good at computers socialization sports
art crafts personal development spirituality and consciousness happiness and even
morality and being a good human being all of these
things require enormous practice and training over and over and
over again to develop proficiency are you not happy with
the results you've gotten so far in your life are
you not happy with the results you get from watching
this content and doing self-actualization or from your meditation practices
or from your spirituality I can almost guarantee you that
it's because you're not training nearly enough what is training
training is very simple it's the consistent daily focused practice
into some field of life it's when you set aside
30 minutes of your day or maybe 5 hours of
your day however much time you want a lot here
and you run drills specific drills that you design to
improve and to practice some aspect of the thing that
you're trying to master so whether it's an art or
playing the guitar or working on your your taxes or
whatever you know whatever you're trying to get good at
you can design drills to isolation train those particular things
training involves isolating elements of your practice even if you're
just focusing on the guitar okay you're focusing on the
guitar but then there's there's different chords you want to
play then maybe you could practice the different fingering and
then you can try drills for getting faster at your
fingering and then you know more and more and more
little techniques like that which together would add it up
create the excellence of playing the guitar or if you're
learning public speaking then you can come up with drills
to specifically practice different elements of your public speaking like
if you want to practice speaking with a loud voice
then you can set aside five minutes to drill loud
speaking to project your voice you can set up specific
drills for how to breathe so that you're pausing the
right times and breathing as you're speaking to not running
out of breath that's important and then of course you
can practice speaking very loudly and then speaking very softly
and trying to get that dynamic range in your speaking
you see and this applies to any area of your
life including your spiritual work and including the self-actualization training
also means using theory to fine tune your practice training
is primarily practice based you're actually doing something but theory
is still important because the theory tells you what you
should be doing and how to do what you should
be doing properly or how to do it better so
in that sense it's important that's what training is it's
not a complicated subject this isn't rocket science here but
it does require actually doing it and not just thinking
about it or talking about it what isn't training this
is also important to consider training is not reading books
watching videos talking about or thinking about or planning to
train that's not training training is when you're actually doing
the practice and very importantly what training is not is
it is not doing routine work so you might think
like well I work at a job at a computer
somewhere and therefore I'm training to get good at the
computer no not necessarily it depends different kinds of work
are different some kinds of work really do involve you
training if you're at a company like a startup company
where it's just you and a couple of other people
and you guys have a big project you're working on
and you have to be learning all this new stuff
let's say you're a computer programmer you have to be
learning all these new computer languages and all these new
techniques as you're trying to come up with your you
know meet your deadlines that probably does involve quite a
bit of training but add a lot of jobs including
a lot of computer jobs all you're really doing is
you're sitting there and you're doing the same thing over
and over again stuff you've done for years you know
how to do it by now and you're just doing
it over and over again to get stuff accomplished that's
the majority of work that human beings do and that's
not training because you're not pushing yourself to learn anything
new you're just redoing the same old stuff that you
already learned so this is all quite obvious and simple
stuff but the trick is actually doing it it's hard
to actually do this consistently and what's really tricky is
getting yourself to do it when you're not required to
do it by some external Authority like your boss or
your school or your professor or something like that let
me ask you this when was the last time that
you consciously trained anything think back and we're gonna exclude
here any externally enforced training protocols that were put upon
you from from an external authority so if your boss
forced you to go to some training seminar exclude that
exclude school exclude college that doesn't count because there you're
sort of in a system would get you to train
so excluding all external systems when was the last time
that you by yourself of your own initiative using your
own self-discipline actually consistently trained anything in your life was
it a year ago five years ago ten years ago
twenty years ago can you see the problem here for
many people it will be years since they actually trained
anything and by training here I mean you actually set
aside a deliberate time window in your schedule where do
you save yourself I'm gonna train for 30 minutes today
my speaking skills for example and then you do that
tomorrow and then the next day and the next day
and the next day and you keep that up you
don't just do it once or twice when was the
last time you've done that see that's the problem that's
why you're not getting the results you want once you
become an adult once you finish school and university don't
expect anyone to train you this is a problem because
when we're in school and in university we get so
reliant on sucking from the tit of the university system
or the school system that we just expect training to
come to us and in school and university it's rather
effortless you just have to go to the classes and
you get trained and it works to some extent there's
problems with it but it works people learn math and
reading and writing in history and whatever else they they
need to learn but but then what happens after you
get out of school see you have no training muscles
built up you don't know how to train yourself and
so for the most the rest of your life like
most people you don't train anything and then you wonder
why get the results that you expect or that you
see some of the excellent people out there getting here's
why people rarely train it's not easy firstly training requires
great vision because training is challenging and it's difficult you're
not gonna do it unless you're a visionary very basic
point but how can you train towards anything unless you
have a vision first a very compelling juicy vision of
why you're training why the training is necessary what its
gonna do for your life you need that vision and
I really call that life purpose and that's why I'm
very big on life purpose I have my life purpose
course that I like to plug for this very reason
because without a vision nothing else can happen and how
to create the right vision for you that's a very
personal matter but also there are a lot of very
important principles involved it's a it's a pretty deep topic
which is why I created a very long twenty five
hour course about it so go check that out but
if you already did check it out and you already
have your purpose set and you have that great vision
now you are in a great position to really get
the results but still it's gonna be hard it's gonna
be also hard because even after you got the great
vision now what is required is enormous self-discipline you have
to train yourself to be a self-motivated human being that's
rare most people are motivated only by external circumstances by
pain by suffering by necessity they will only do stuff
when they are backed into a corner that doesn't fly
with training because training is not necessary these days our
lives are so easy if you're living in a first
world country your life is pretty much so II see
that you can just go to your nine-to-five job earn
a paycheck come home and then do nothing all day
and then that could be your entire life and you
can just coast like that and once you finish school
and university you can find a nice little comfy job
for yourself and just coast without learning anything about your
job anymore you can find those jobs and see that
that requires no self discipline that requires no intrinsic motivation
but it doesn't get you a great kind of life
it gets you just a very mediocre very basic vanilla
kind of life there are no external support structures when
you're training no one is really forcing you you have
to do it on your own like if you want
to train yourself to become good at the guitar who's
gonna force you nobody is your parents aren't going to
your friends aren't going to your boss doesn't care it's
only you only if you care enough will it happen
same thing with your spirituality or with enlightenment north meditation
your friends aren't gonna care in fact they're gonna actively
discourage you which will lead to another reason why meditate
or why training is so challenging is because it requires
enormous focus you have to really focus on not multitasking
but single tasking that one drill over and over and
over again avoiding all the distractions of society of your
friends of your family of all the entertainment that's out
there all the easy stuff that's very easy to to
get distracted by all the computer stuff all the internet
stuff all the smartphone stuff that you've got going on
also training is difficult because training is repetitive and boring
at least it is when you first start the first
few years of getting your training habit going it's gonna
seem very monotonous and it's gonna seem like you're you're
losing out on all the joys of going out there
partying with your friends and watching TV and playing video
games and doing alcohol and weed and whatever see you're
gonna feel like you're missing out on that stuff and
training by compare it's gonna seem so boring but that
is because you need to develop a taste for training
which you develop only by doing lots of training the
other reason why people rally train is because it involves
emotional labor it's difficult you have to actually struggle struggling
makes you learn and the whole learning process is much
more challenging than just sitting back and watching some Netflix
after work training is exhausting it's both it can be
physically exhausting depending on what your training it can also
be mentally exhausting and probably both which is hard to
do especially after you've done a whole day day of
work like if you have a your basic nine-to-five job
and you want to train something on the side that's
really challenging because you just got energy problems depending on
your diet and your exercise and so forth you just
might not have the energy to do it the other
reason people rarely train is because society and marketing discourages
training and effort our entire economy is built on the
premise that everybody can offer you a quick fix solution
which requires no emotional labour or effort or training on
your part to get what you want so it's like
do you want to do your taxes well just go
higher tax guy and he will do your taxes for
200 bucks for you and you don't have to learn
anything about taxes no training required or it's like you
want to you want to what you want to lose
some weight well don't learn and train yourself at the
gym like heaven forbid you would do that no instead
you just go and you you pay a couple thousand
dollars to get some liposuction or whatever and and now
you're at the right weight that you like but what
for only a couple of months until you get it
all back and then you look worse than ever see
so our whole marketing system our whole society just discourages
people from training it's really the sort of decadence we're
living in this decadent era which reminds me of the
the era before the fall of the Roman Empire where
it was just too much decadence the whole Roman work
ethic and many of the Roman values that the Roman
Empire was built upon were sort of eroded by the
success of those very values you see it under mine
itself and that's what success tends to do you get
successful then you get complacent and lazy and then you
lose all your success as a result training of course
means less fun less sex and less drugs which is
why another reason why people fail to train because of
course you want to maximize your phone you want to
maximize your sex you want to maximize your alcohol consumption
and your partying and that sort of stuff and like
I said already training is an acquired taste it requires
a certain maturity to want to train to see why
training is important and what are the long-term payoffs that
it can have on your life that requires a sort
of mature mind that many people don't have these days
so how do you get started training well like we
already said the first thing you need is a vision
no vision no training what can you possibly train without
a vision what are you training for how are you
going to endure the emotional labor and the monotony and
all the opportunity costs that come with that unless you
really have a compelling reason for why you're doing it
so first what you need is you need to clearly
decide on what you want from your life be very
specific about it understand what you need to train and
why you're training it and if you want to know
how to do that well check out my life purpose
course that's well that is all about once you've got
that down then you need to ask yourself okay so
what skills do I need to fulfill my purpose and
then you break down the skills like maybe you need
some public speaking skills maybe you need some computer skills
maybe you need some foreign language skills maybe you need
some meditation skills and that is your first step there
is to break that down and then after that you
need to create drills for each of these so you
can go by and read some books about what are
the best meditation techniques what are the best techniques or
drills for public speaking what are the best ways to
to learn a foreign language and so on and then
you need to actually set aside time every day in
your schedule to actually practice these drills and do it
consistently not just once or twice and as you do
it consistently you build up momentum and this momentum builds
up not over a course of a week or a
month this momentum builds up over the course of the
years if you're talking about training really you're talking about
years of training months of training is too little to
accomplish anything significant you're talking about years of training so
you got to be mentally prepared for that and then
plan for it accordingly and then as you do that
you need to also develop a taste for the training
process cultivating that taste the first few years of doing
it you're not going to have the taste it's gonna
take time for you to really develop that especially if
you've been out of it for a long time you
haven't trained anything for years and maybe decades and that's
it that's the basic process this isn't rocket science but
if you want results what you got to do now
I want to end by talking about the story of
demosthenes demosthenes was a Greek statesman and orator from ancient
Athens he was considered one of the greatest orders of
all time especially in the ancient times his dates were
384 to 322 BC but demosthenes wasn't born this way
he wasn't born a great orator in fact as a
young child he had great difficulty speaking and you know
in the in the Athenian times people would go to
the forum and they would speak and they would have
public debates and discussions so oratory was a very important
skill much more important than it is for most people
today today we just type little YouTube comments or post
trolls on the internet stuff like that trolling comments which
was very different from the ancient times so as a
child he actually had a lisp and he had a
weak voice and he used to talk in these long
rambling sentences that were ungrammatical and made no sense and
just confused the hell out of people so people were
already put off by his speeches and in fact they
made fun of him for his Lisp so he was
very discouraged by this but he wanted to really become
a great orator that was his life purpose so what
did he do when he was an adolescent he actually
built for himself an underground room where he went to
work where he would study the speeches of the greatest
orators of his time but not only did he do
that studying he would also go outside he would go
to the seashore and they are alone outside the city
of Athens he would practice by the seashore and he
would drill himself on all the facets of oratory that
he needed to master first he would pick up pebbles
from the beach and stuff his mouth full of these
pebbles so his mouth was pool and now he has
these programs when he doesn't know how to talk with
these pebbles in his mouth but this forced him to
articulate his his speeches so he would articulate every syllable
every single words such that he could even talk with
pebbles in his mouth next what he would do is
he would run along the seashore and recite verses from
the greatest speeches so that he could he could speak
while running so that he would increases his lung capacity
his breath and get that endurance and lastly he would
come really close to the cliffs where the ocean waves
were crashing into the cliffs with these loud roaring sounds
and he would speak and deliver his speech to no
one just to the ocean so that he would speak
over the waves so he would develop that carrying capacity
of his voice and through this process he became the
greatest orator of the ancient times I tell you this
story because this in a nutshell is what you have
to do to get the kind of results that we're
talking about here with self-actualization this is your process except
of course your details will be a little bit different
it will depend on your particular life purpose on your
particular domain of mastery what are you trying to master
but the process is basically the same now don't mistake
training for just being about some sort of shallow materialistic
form of success certainly training is important if you want
materialistic success but there's a deeper element to training which
is even more important training develops character that's why it's
so important not because you want to go out there
and chase money your cars or a great career I
mean yeah you can do that stuff and to some
degree that's important you need to have some degree of
success in your life but really what you're after is
you're after the character that it develops there's something about
a human being who is self-made who is able to
come up with a vision of what they want to
create and then have the mental resources to discipline him
or herself to go out there and do it that's
a high quality human being that's a human being you
can depend on that's a human being who can get
stuff done in the world that's a human being who
doesn't whine and complain and play victim and make excuses
and get into debates and arguments with people over silly
philosophical or spiritual topics no this is the kind of
human being who's very pragmatic goes out there and does
stuff but at the same time has character and when
you take this process and you apply it to the
most important thing in life which is self-actualization itself and
spiritual development that's when you get the the greatest energy
of all for example if you apply all this to
to your meditation practice or to yourself inquiry practice that's
gonna grow you the most into the best and wisest
human being you can be if you haven't noticed what's
the one column common element behind every great human being
think of your favorite actors your favorite celebrities your favorite
businesspeople your favorite artists your favorite athletes what's the one
common thread training not just training but training training training
training training training training their massive trainers that's really the
only difference and of course they have the vision for
why they should be training so if you think you
could go become like them just by training a lot
it's not gonna happen unless you have the vision first
see they were first extraordinary visionaries which then allowed them
to do the training which then got them all the
results that they got training is not optional for sages
and self-actualize errs if you're young you should be training
non-stop by young I mean under 20 years old your
whole life at this point your whole adolescence your teenage
years should be all about training not having fun and
getting into relationships and and doing drugs or anything and
none of that stuff it should be nonstop training but
even after 20 you should still be focused on training
because a lot of people they get out of school
University and then all their training stops so really lifelong
training is what you're really shooting for but for those
who are young in the audience make sure you don't
waste your youth not training that's gonna be something you
regret the training you do when you're young builds your
entire foundation if you miss training when you're young it's
gonna be very hard for you to to really make
something of yourself in the future because you've already laid
such a poor foundation for the rest of your life
so that's it in a nutshell let me just tell
you that training is the cost of getting things your
way in life if you want things to go your
way bite the bullet and accept that you're gonna have
to train and yeah it's gonna suck at first it's
gonna be challenging it's gonna be emotionally difficult you're gonna
want to quit it's gonna seem like it's no fun
it's gonna seem like man why am I doing this
why why is this so challenging how come I keep
failing cuz you're gonna keep backsliding it's not just gonna
be smooth sailing after you make that there's gonna be
a lot of backsliding and back and forth and mistakes
and failures but that's where your perseverance has to win
out your vision has to support you throughout that whole
process which is five it.why vision is perhaps the most
important element to this whole to this whole puzzle but
you're just gonna have to accept that training is the
cost to get things the way you want and if
training seems painful and very bad well maybe it's just
because you haven't found a vision compelling enough yet to
overcome and make those costs worthwhile alright that's it I'm
