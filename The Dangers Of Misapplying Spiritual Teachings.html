[Music] we need to have a discussion about the dangers
of spiritual work this is an especially poignant moment at
which to have this discussion we've had it before but
we need to have it again because recently we've been
made aware on the actualized.org forum that one of the
members there killed himself so i'm going to talk about
that situation i'm going to answer many questions i'm going
to then lead into a discussion about suicide and into
my thoughts on that and we're going to talk about
many of the traps of spiritual work and just many
of the traps of any kind of system of beliefs
or ideas in general so there's going to be a
lot of very juicy and important information here so stay
tuned with me and i'll try to answer all your
questions and objections so now what happened uh well we're
not exactly sure with 100 certainty what happened but the
best that we can piece together and as we've been
informed by the family by the sister of this individual
and and his family is that a few weeks ago
he got the idea to literally jump off a bridge
and for spiritual purposes uh it's not exactly clear what
his logic was for doing so what he thought he
would really gain from it or why it would be
necessary but somehow he got it in his mind that
jumping off a bridge would i guess be a quick
path to god or towards the afterlife or the next
life or whatever and then he literally jumped off a
bridge or so we're told again i don't have independent
verification of this i'm assuming it's true let's just treat
it as though it's true all right so let's say
it happened so now what do we make of this
because i take this very seriously sometimes people get the
idea that i treat these ideas kind of casually or
flippantly about enlightenment awakening and so forth um and my
teachings in general uh very much no very very much
no um in fact i'm going to point out repeatedly
again and again and again how many warnings and disclaimers
i've given how many times i've talked about the traps
of this work this is a recurring theme if you
watch my content through to the end you notice this
recurring theme what we're always talking about is we're talking
about the mind the ego mind and all of its
wacky crazy ideas and how it survives and how it
fools itself and how it deceives itself in many different
ways including materialistic ways but also including spiritual ways as
well and we talk about the dangers of ideology and
belief systems and getting locked in a paradigm getting locked
into a single perspective of closed-mindedness of cults cult psychology
so we we've covered this topic so much i have
videos for example about with titles such as the dangers
of spiritual work the dark side of meditation act is
actualized or occult which i just released actually recently in
the last month or so i released that one and
in that one you know some people criticize me and
say that well leo you spend three hours that's a
three hour long episode three hours explaining how actualized rig
is not a cult but if you watch that episode
carefully it wasn't just three hours of me selfishly defending
myself it was mostly three hours of elaboration upon many
of the misconceived notions people have about this work and
spirituality in general and many ways in which it can
be misinterpreted and misunderstood and in fact most of my
episodes are so long in general precisely because i go
into a lot of detail about the traps of the
mind how easy it is to make mistakes in this
work and to get things wrong to make sure that
you're not misinterpreting something that's being said there's a fundamental
problem here though in that the longer i make my
episodes the less likely people are to watch them or
to just they're more likely to skim them and when
they skim them then they can actually skim over the
disclaimers the warnings the traps the examples the rebukes that
i give and the problem is that if i harp
too much on the obvious things you shouldn't do in
this work for intelligent people that's going to tune their
mind out because they've heard it once they've heard it
twice how many times leo do you need to tell
me not to jump off a bridge isn't that obvious
does it really need to be said that you shouldn't
be jumping off a bridge that is not valid spiritual
work and that has nothing to do with what we're
doing here if the teaching was to jump off a
bridge that's what i would tell you to do that's
not the teaching you might say of course if you're
reasonable and intelligent but the problem is that hundreds of
thousands and millions of people watch out of all these
people we're talking about so many people you have to
keep in mind that in the united states alone there
were 40 000 suicides in 2018 by the statistics only
in the united states alone that's not counting the rest
of the world so we're talking about literally millions of
suicides every year and i have a global audience people
watch me from everywhere around the world it's quite amazing
my videos have received close to 100 million views in
the last eight years and so from the beginning i
was concerned that people can take these teachings and misconstrue
them misinterpret them in whatever ways they will and misuse
them and abuse them in fact i've talked about that
in the past quite a lot oftentimes i ended my
episodes with some sort of you know final word where
i would say something like be very careful not to
abuse these teachings in some particular way and then i
might mention the way or explain what the traps are
i do that for a reason because when you teach
millions of people eventually somebody's going to get some stupid
idea or is going to misunderstand something and it's very
difficult to make these teachings foolproof so the challenge is
that what i teach is rather advanced stuff and really
it's not suitable for people who have mental disorders or
who do not have a stable mind or who do
not just simply have a good reasoning process who just
don't have common sense right you can't get far with
my teachings without common sense and basic reason and a
stable life the ability to just survive in your life
and one of the challenges that i face is that
honestly i come from a rather healthy mindset myself i
don't have a lot of experience dealing with seriously mentally
ill people or very depressed people or suicidal people or
people who just have weird ideas about life or reality
and some people are like that they just have weird
ideas they have a weird reasoning process you get people
like that and by no means is this something special
to actualize.org this is a general problem for all spiritual
teachers and all spiritual schools and the more you teach
the bigger your audience the more of a problem it
becomes because what happens is that if you're a very
specialized narrow teacher that teaches something very advanced and you
get maybe 100 students a year coming to you you
can have very tight control over that and the people
who come to you tend to be of a much
higher caliber they're not coming from just off the street
the problem with youtube is that anybody who's doing any
work on youtube their fan base if it's of any
significant size let's say over a hundred thousand people is
going to consist of some very intelligent people some a
lot of average people um a lot of stupid people
and then some really really stupid people or even not
that but actually sociopathic criminal psychotic schizophrenic bipolar and god
knows what other conditions depressive suicidal and and and even
things you can't even really imagine you get some very
fringe edge cases when you have a hundred thousand followers
let alone a million followers you get a really wide
distribution of that bell curve and overall it's fine except
once in a while you get some extreme cases and
what makes the situation worse is that within spirituality and
personal development this area especially attracts people who sometimes are
especially prone to having mental problems uh trauma that they're
working through in their life sometimes mental illness depression or
who are suicidal because that's usually the kind of person
who wants some sort of health self-help advice if you're
totally happy in your life you're usually chasing money and
success and you don't even turn to self-help or spirituality
so a lot of people come to spirituality with the
purpose of escaping suffering and that already creates sort of
a bias in the distribution curve because who suffers the
most are the people who have the most chaotic minds
they suffer the most and they probably need therapy and
self-help and spirituality the most but they are also the
most prone to misunderstanding or misusing these ideas so in
general this is a problem that really goes back to
the dawn of human civilization it's important to put this
into context so i'm laying out a lot of context
for you here so you understand the depth of the
problem teaching truth or consciousness or spirituality at an advanced
level where you have really deep insights of the nature
of reality metaphysically existentially to the point of penetrating through
uh life and death these sorts of of topics these
topics have always been to a certain extent taboo within
society and culture and there's a very good reason for
that because these topics these types of questions when we
start to deconstruct the mind or when we start to
talk about and question the fabric of society of reality
of social structures of gender of cultural norms of money
of politicians of the economy of ourselves and our relationship
to others in the world when we start to question
what am i what is another is there even such
a thing as another person or am i just imagining
that what is death what is life is life even
meaningful is death really scary is that a bad thing
or a good thing like when you start to ask
these questions and you don't just invent ideologies and belief
systems about it but you really probe into it deeply
and you try to reach some kind of truth of
the matter through consciousness this is very threatening it's threatening
to the entire social order it threatens the politicians it
threatens the business owners it threatens the advertisers it threatens
the the academic systems it threatens the school system it
threatens your parents your family your friends your co-workers it
threatens religion it threatens science so very quickly you develop
enemies which is why historically these sorts of teachings were
not mass available to a casual audience they were kept
within very narrow specialized esoteric sects which were not known
very well by the majority of people whereas the majority
of people practiced exoteric forms of religion and spirituality which
was sort of like advice for dumb people it was
dumbed down mysticism effectively which just gave you some rules
to follow like don't kill people don't steal don't be
an [ __ ] don't judge people don't jump off
a bridge these sorts of things need to be told
to normies because you're sort of gearing the teachings to
the lowest common denominator so there's a tricky trade-off between
how advanced your teachings are and then who they're geared
towards and then how widespread they can be like a
lot of times i will teach something about the nature
of fear or survival or religion or the origins of
religion and things like this and then people write in
the comments section people tell me all the time like
leo oh my god why isn't this taught in school
well the reason is because ideas can be dangerous and
i've said this in the past that ideology is not
just fun and games ideology is deeply connected to your
survival and survival people don't appreciate how deadly serious survival
is survival is as serious as cancer as a heart
attack as a bullet to the brain now if you
want to take the position that none of these things
matter from an absolute absolute perspective because it's all just
a dream yeah you can take that perspective but you
have to also be very careful here because you can
say that or take that perspective while you're sitting at
home on your couch listening to a video and it's
all very comfortable and easy but then when someone runs
over your dog with their car if someone robs your
grandmother as she's walking home from the grocery store if
uh you know if a burglar breaks into your house
while you're asleep with your children with a gun are
you still going to be able to hold that lofty
metaphysical position of it's it's all just a dream yes
it's all just a dream of course but how do
you want your dream to unfold and what are your
attachments to the dream i bet you have some attachments
i bet there are ways your dream could unfold that
you would really hate to see happen and hey i'm
not wagging my finger at you here i also have
attachments to the dream again people get this so wrong
they think like oh well leo since you say you've
you know you've realized god and other such things and
and you've said you say that everything is a dream
that means that you don't care what happens in your
life right no of course not of course i care
because i have relative goals for example one of my
relative goals that i'm pursuing in my life is that
i teach that's what i do that's my life purpose
is to teach this stuff to spread this wisdom and
these insights so look at how this works it's a
bit paradoxical because on the one hand the wisdom and
the insights tell us that all these attachments that are
all just illusory standard buddhism right all these attachments to
life are just illusory at your attachments to money to
your children to your family all illusory and is that
true yes of course it's true from the absolute perspective
it's true but at the same time just to be
able to teach that to people requires that one be
alive the buddha can't teach you unless he has air
in his lungs food in his belly and a comfortable
place to sit the buddha can't teach you without food
water air a safe environment a climate controlled area where
it's not too hot and not too cold he can't
teach you on the surface of the sun he can't
teach you in the middle of a of a desert
where you're dying of thirst so very narrow conditions are
required for survival and for the propagation of spiritual teachings
and work or any kind of life for that matter
this is obvious stuff but it's worth thinking about in
this context so for example for me to teach the
things i want to teach i have to be concerned
by very petty mundane issues that most people would think
well leo surely you should be above this like leo
you're so awake and so forth you should be above
concerns for money but no see if i was above
concerns for money i would literally not care about money
and if i literally didn't care about money then i
wouldn't even check my bank account and if i didn't
check my bank account it would run out eventually and
once it ran out my electricity would shut off my
cable would shut off i wouldn't be able to power
this camera that i'm recording this video on and i
wouldn't be able to upload it anywhere you see how
that works so it's actually perfectly okay for me not
to care about money but then there are consequences the
mistake that naive people make is they think oh well
it's all just sort of a dream and i could
just like stop caring about these things and everything will
just be okay like god will guide me through life
not so fast what kind of life do you want
god is not something above you that is guiding you
through your life this is god your thought process itself
is god so when you think to yourself [ __
] i gotta put more money in my bank account
so i can pay today's electricity bill so that my
electricity is not shut off so that i can do
my work tomorrow when you think that that is god
doing its work that's how god works that's not the
only way god works but people overlook that that is
how god works god works not just in supernatural ways
god works in very practical ways in fact mostly that's
what's happening in your life so if you care about
your children not suffering see maybe you're above suffering and
you might say oh leo i've i've become so enlightened
that i'm not even worried about suffering anymore okay but
you have children are they as enlightened as you do
you care about their suffering now maybe you say leo
i'm so enlightened that i don't even care about their
suffering okay and that's possible that is perhaps a valid
state of consciousness you could one day reach although i
highly doubt any of you have reached it but let's
say you've reached that point okay fine but then your
children will suffer and die are you okay with that
now if you say yes then what's the problem well
technically there is no problem but the problem is that
you're not going to be okay with it see you
fool yourself telling yourself that you'll be okay with it
but actually you won't be so that's where you have
to be very careful so what you have to understand
is that ideas inherently are dangerous things we tend to
treat ideas as mere philosophy some sort of armchair stuff
that we do and frankly a lot of what you
see on youtube in terms of the sort of idea
sphere on youtube is that it is just armchair philosophy
it's it's ideas that have little real world consequences but
even in those even in those areas it's still not
true i mean look look at what's going on in
our culture in our society for example with ideas within
politics there are dangerous ideas within politics both on the
left and the right now i would say that there
are more on the right than there are on the
left but hey you could say that i'm biased whatever
but you can certainly find some very dangerous ideas for
example if you wanted to on the radical right and
that's not to pick on the right wingers but just
like honestly there are some really toxic and dangerous ideas
and ideologies floating around within conservative circles the extremes of
conservative circles nationalism racism xenophobia people who want to start
an ethno-state people who are happy with ethnic cleansing and
they spread these ideas online and they gain traction they're
sort of a battle over these ideas going on recently
in the last five years online um that is not
to pick on right-wingers here that is just to point
out that ideas can be dangerous and this has always
been the case throughout human history we tend to have
reached this very point of luxury today in first world
democracies where we tend to consider free speech as the
highest goal and right and that you know everything is
okay with free speech free speech makes everything good but
it was never that way never to get to this
point human civilization had to be built on deep restrictions
on speech and on ideas because some ideas are corrosive
to the very fabric of society and they're threatening to
social hierarchies and to the economy and other such things
for example an idea like that that the dollar is
imaginary seems like an innocent idea right it seems in
fact so obvious that the dollar is imaginary i mean
if you if you corner anybody with this question they
will admit to you that the dollar is of course
imaginary we imagine it's value and the only reason it
has value is because we collectively agree that it has
value and then we're going to use it but if
for example one keeps questioning the idea of a dollar
more and more and more and more until literally everybody
in the world stops believing in the dollar that can
crash the entire economy that's the power of one idea
and spiritual ideas are a special class of ideas which
are the the trickiest in a sense they're the trickiest
precisely because as we've talked about in the past a
lot of times the human psyche all that it's doing
as part of its survival function is that it is
constructing various worldviews and perspectives and ideologies taking on various
beliefs and it's using these to navigate its way in
the world that those ideas shape how you see reality
and how you interact with people animals things family members
how you view your life whether you even believe your
life is worth living this is all based upon ideas
as soon as you get the idea that your life
is no longer worth living that's the doorway for you
to suicide and 40 000 people in america do that
every year so ideas are very very powerful especially your
ideas about yourself and especially your ideas about the structure
of reality and so the problem though is that when
you start to get closer to truth by deconstructing various
fantasies and illusions and ideas what happens is that the
ego gets very threatened and so there's pressure put upon
the ego the closer it gets to truth to squirm
away and to come up with some sort of fantasy
or illusion or deception to again cloak itself in more
ideas that's what the mind is doing that's how the
mind survives and it had to be this way for
you to be sitting here listening to me otherwise you'd
be dead and i'd be dead if you and i
and our ancestors for the last 100 generations were not
like this so we're all like this nobody is immune
to this so the problem fundamentally is this how do
you teach deep truths about spirituality without people misconstruing it
or weaponizing it or demonizing it or going into ideology
belief worship messiah complexes spiritual ego and you know taking
it too far in that direction because there's there's a
problem with both sides on this side you have extreme
skepticism and cynicism and sort of demonization so these are
sort of like the people who don't like the ideas
at all to begin with their minds are so closed
that they just find any excuse imaginable to attack the
ideas as false they smear they demonize whatever they can
even do violence that's sort of the skeptical end of
the spectrum and a lot of times the most skeptical
people of spiritual ideas are the scientific and the atheistic
and the rationalist people so you create enemies out of
them when you teach this stuff uh but then there
is uh the other end of the spectrum which is
people who who love the ideas so much they get
so enamored with the ideas that they stop thinking critically
they lose common sense and they start to turn it
into an ideology and they become cult-like about it they
start to worship the teacher or the guru they hang
on every word and then from that all sorts of
problems can happen but that's not all the risks and
dangers in a sense those are easy to control the
stuff that's really difficult to control is that when you
have people starting to engage in large numbers in serious
spiritual work by doing meditation yoga psychedelics vision quests shamanic
breathing exercises even stuff like going out and camping in
nature i mean like look if i give you some
advice like you know hey i went on a on
a camping trip into the wilderness and i just sat
around there all day and meditated and had a great
time and i became peaceful and very spiritual i felt
one with the universe you know out there in the
in the forest and then you go try to emulate
that and do it i mean that's in general that's
great advice right you should be out nature more great
advice but what if you go out there and a
rattlesnake bites you what if there's a bear and you're
not prepared what if there are wolves what if you
get bitten by a spider what if a tick with
some sort of disease bites you and infects you right
so there's there's a lot of ways you could screw
up your camping trip what if you get lost in
the woods what if you get snowed in and run
out of food and water you could die up there
on in the mountains in the forest if you don't
know what you're doing what if you're hiking up there
and you break your leg or your ankle twist it
somehow and you don't have any help what do you
do well yeah there's dangers with doing that and you
see it's difficult to give any kind of advice without
without like over qualifying all the dangers because if you
give the advice for a million people to go camping
over the weekend uh a few of them are gonna
break their ankles a few of them are gonna run
into bears a few of them are gonna get bitten
by snakes and god knows what else happens up there
and of course i'm very well aware of this when
it comes to doing meditation and self-inquiry and various kinds
of spiritual work which is why i have those two
videos i have a video called the dark side of
meditation where i talk about all the downsides of meditation
that normally you don't hear about very much from spiritual
teachers and uh i talk about uh in my other
episode the dangers of spiritual work i talk about many
of the other kinds of dangers of spiritual work not
just with meditation you see so actually a lot of
people who get into spirituality are not aware of the
risks of spirituality there's quite a lot of risks and
in fact it would take a couple of hours to
articulate all the risks and even if that was done
you would still likely fall into these traps because it's
not enough just to hear them really you don't appreciate
their significance and depth until you're in the thick of
it i want to share some of these with you
here i mean i've shared them in the past but
i want to share some more poignant stories because i
really want to get it through to you because one
of my biggest concerns is that my teachings are not
corrupted or misused or abused in some way this is
not just something new that i've adopted yesterday this is
something that if you uh if you're a long-time listener
of mine you should be aware this is something i've
been doing for years now perhaps not as well as
i as i could do and recent events are now
getting me to think much deeper about what are all
the precautions and safeguards that i could put into place
within reason uh you know to reduce harm because the
general rule with my teachings is this right like if
you're ever confused here's the general rule and i think
i've said this in the past as well is that
if you're applying my teachings and that is leading you
towards something that is harmful or leading to to your
own suffering and suffering of others or endangering yourself and
others especially physical bodily harm then you should immediately stop
and ask yourself wait a minute why would leo teach
that and you should recognize that ah maybe that's not
what he taught maybe i'm misunderstanding something or i'm misapplying
something because it doesn't make sense that leo would teach
that these teachings are about improving the quality of your
life fundamentally so if these teachings are not improving the
quality of your life that's a immediate common sense sort
of litmus test that you get to use to realize
that either this teaching is not right for you you're
misapplying it you're applying it at the wrong time in
your life in the wrong way in the wrong place
you misunderstood something about it you got to change how
you're applying it or maybe just this particular technique is
not right for you you need a different technique common
sense common sense basic common sense is absolutely required in
doing spiritual work but that's not enough common sense is
not enough you also need care and you need intelligence
and wisdom you need the ability to see how your
own mind is fooling you when it is you need
to have awareness of different traps that people commonly fall
into in this work so within spirituality there's a a
phrase actually coined i think it's by stan groff if
he didn't coin it he popularized it it's called a
spiritual emergency spiritual emergency uh stan groff teaches holotropic breathing
he's a psychiatrist he's written many books upon various problems
that are encountered with people who undergo serious deep spiritual
purification work he was also an early pioneer of lsd
research back in the 1950s before it was banned and
so he's been working with with with people for his
entire career for like 50 years either through psychedelics or
through sort of this shamanic breathing method in workshops and
so forth and uh and basically what happens is that
quite a few people who who do serious spiritual work
will have these spiritual emergencies what is a spiritual emergency
it's when basically you sort of deconstruct the mind so
much that your reality starts to melt and you're not
sure what's up and down anymore and then you get
very emotional you get very confused maybe you have a
mental illness and that feeds into it and makes it
even worse uh or maybe you have some sort of
trauma from your childhood that bubbles up and now is
making you irrational and so you start to behave in
confused and paranoid ways and and you're not sure what's
happening to you maybe you're starting to experience mystical visions
for example from doing lots of meditative work or breathing
work or whatever and then you're not sure how to
interpret those visions or what they mean these visions can
be demonic in nature if your mind skews in that
in that direction and so on and so there are
so many different possible permutations see the difficulty is accounting
for all those possible permutations i've been for example on
meditation retreats where i had a meditation partner we would
you know we would partner up i had a meditation
partner i remember on one retreat it was sort of
a classic 10-day vipassana retreat and we you know we
were just chatting about he told me he was going
to this retreat for the last 10 years and i
was kind of impressed that was my first time there
he was going there for 10 years in a row
and i sort of asked him like well what were
your experiences early on like and he said like man
you know on some retreats on some years i would
go so deep into the meditation that like stuff started
happening to me i thought i was losing my mind
in the middle of the retreat i had to actually
like leave the retreat and physically pay for a taxi
to drive me to the nearest bookstore into their like
psychotherapy section i would just sit in that aisle for
the whole day and just read books on you know
psychotherapy conditions to try to explain what was happening with
me from all this meditating i don't know exactly what
was happening to him he had some kind of visions
or you know hallucinations or whatever and he was starting
to feel like he's losing his mind his his reality
was collapsing around him and he wasn't handling it very
well because he was sort of like a normie he
didn't have a very good foundation theoretical foundation for what
could happen and then and then so that happened and
then you know he got over it and in that
case he was successful but that could also turn out
very negatively he could for example after his meditation retreat
is over you know and he's in that very fragile
state he could end up going back home and then
um you know shooting himself in the head because he
doesn't know how to handle it he doesn't know what's
happening and he's spiraling out of control and maybe he
has a sort of a a borderline mental disorder that
he didn't even realize he had it was triggered by
the you know intense meditation and that happens i'll give
you another example uh i was at another retreat it
was like a consciousness workshop that i was at some
years ago and i specifically because i you know i'm
a teacher of this stuff so i was very curious
i asked the facilitator he was sort of a master
you know enlightened master i asked him um you never
talk about this but like i mean you've you've taught
for like 40 years you've taught awakening and enlightenment and
no self and these sorts of things you know very
very advanced stuff and i'm just curious in all these
years of running these workshops have you ever had anybody
like lose their mind or lose their [ __ ]
or you know something bad happen and he kind of
looked at me rather dismissively and kind of flippantly and
he just kind of said no i was i was
rather surprised now this wasn't a teacher who taught like
hundreds of thousands of people he taught in very small
groups and most of his clients are rather advanced elite
clients they pay a lot of money to go there
so that weeds out a lot of the riff raff
and the crazy people um but even so i was
surprised because other spiritual teachers i talked to they do
talk about these sorts of like edge cases where things
go horribly wrong and but later later i actually like
a year or two later i talked to one of
the one of this facilitator's assistants i talked to one
of his assistants and just to kind of like you
know get a little bit of behind-the-scenes scoop of you
know what what happens what goes on there and then
the assistant told me oh like oh yeah one yeah
i asked him like you guys ever get like crazy
people because you know i'm like sometimes i get crazy
people like emailing me and stuff do you ever do
i can't believe you guys don't get that and he's
like oh yeah actually we uh just the other year
we had we had someone come to our workshop and
and then when i looked in his eyes i could
just tell he wasn't all there and i'm like wait
a minute he wasn't all there what does that mean
and he's like well well he was basically like a
psychotic i'm like psychotic what happened and then he's like
well as we went deeper it was like a week-long
workshop as we went deeper and deeper into this workshop
um the the person just became more erratic and more
erratic and uncontrollable in their behavior to the point where
you could look at him and try to like communicate
with him but you could see it wasn't registering in
his eyes he was off like living in his own
reality and i said well what did you guys do
and he said well eventually we just had to call
the police called the police they they came over and
just took him away they didn't like arrest him but
uh just you know um basically he he had they
had to evacu evict him from the workshop and then
and then what happened after that well the police just
kind of drove him off i guess back home or
somewhere wherever he came from yeah that kind of stuff
happens another example i'll cite to you is um there's
these enlightenment intensives i've done several of them three or
four different ones around the country around the world um
of these enlightenment intensives and there was this one interesting
anecdote i was talking to one of the facilitators of
this enlightenment intensive and just kind of picking his brain
about you know what kind of crazy stuff happens at
these intensives they're called intensives because they're they're [ __
] intense people lose their [ __ ] at these
intentions they start to yell and scream i've personally experienced
this where like you're in a you're in this quiet
intensive it's like it's almost like a meditation retreat and
then somebody just stands up with this violent almost homicidal
rage and just starts yelling and like throwing [ __
] across the room because they were they were doing
some deep self inquiry you know that came up some
trauma came up or somewhat of some rage came up
whatever and then they encourage you to not to hold
that back but to actually express it in a safe
in a safe way but it can also get out
of hand uh like in one of these intensives the
facilitator told me that uh uh you know he was
you know the facilitators are supposed to look after everybody
in the intensive you know there's like usually 30 50
people at an intensive you know people everyone's doing their
own thing it's sort of like herding cats and so
the facilitator you know he was hurting the cats and
doing all this stuff and then there's like lunch time
and so lunch time comes along and everybody sits down
at the dinner tables or the lunch tables and they're
they're eating their lunch ordering their food and then he
notices this one lady who was just kind of quiet
the whole day and you know he he he kind
of saw that there was something weird about her he
was kind of keeping an eye on her the whole
day but he notices that you know she's just got
this like stole stone cold look on her face and
and and he sees her like in the corner of
his eye he sees her walking into the kitchen the
back of the kitchen where you know students aren't supposed
to go that's just for the staff and then he
just kind of gets curious and he walks back there
just to check up on her see maybe she took
a wrong turn somewhere and then he sees her and
she's standing there with she takes a a giant chef's
knife from the uh from the kitchen you know the
kitchen you know prep area there where the chefs were
making the food for everybody she takes that knife and
then and she's walking out out towards the kitchen area
and he just kind of asks her what like hey
what are you doing what do you think you're doing
with that knife and she says i'm gonna go stab
somebody and she names the person she's gonna go stab
and she just says it very calmly like i'm going
to go stab this person very commonly as though nothing
is happening she's sort of like in a trans like
a zombie like trans and so the facilitators you know
he was very good they they train you if you're
a good facilitator you don't you don't like fly into
a rage you stay calm and he just said no
you don't want to do that here give me the
knife hand me the knife you know she refused for
a minute and he's like he's like hand me the
knife you don't need the knife she handed him the
knife and he's like okay now go back go back
in the kitchen area and sit down and eat your
dinner or your lunch and that's it that's it that
was the whole story so what does all this mean
what this means is that spirituality has inherent dangers to
it it's not easy work and honestly many people are
not suited for this work because their minds are unstable
their lives are unstable they can't even handle the basics
of life like keeping a job or paying their bills
or not being addicted to booze and whatever else and
then they get into serious spiritual work and they get
in way over their head and they also probably lack
the theoretical foundation because honestly how many people have enough
time and patience and wherewithal to sit through 300 hours
of my talks not many and i would say that
even if you did sit through 300 hours of my
talks it would not be enough to cover all of
the edge cases all of the possibilities you would really
need to also listen to other teachers read a bunch
of books like on my book list watch a bunch
of other videos you know attend workshops and go to
retreats and do all this stuff and only then would
you be in a position where you can sort of
guide yourself down this path another story of a lady
i've told this story in the past there's actually a
book about this on my book list this lady who
who was part of the transcendental meditation movement back in
like the 1970s and she became one of their sort
of teachers and facilitators and she became so advanced as
a yogi uh and a meditator that she was invited
to like the highest levels somewhere in europe in switzerland
or some place where they would do these advanced yoga
trainings with with the master yogi who you know who
pioneered trends on transcendental meditation i don't remember his name
yogi magesh or mageesh something like that i forget his
name anyways um she became very advanced with the practices
it came effortlessly to her but but this spiritual school
at the time like transitional meditation they didn't give you
a lot of theory they didn't tell you about what
all the different states of meditation and yoga are what
all the possibilities are they didn't really even explain what
enlightenment was or awakening or no self or god they
didn't explain any of this stuff really they just taught
you a technique so she started doing this technique doing
this technique and then and then she quit and she
got married and years a few years passed she she
had a child with her husband she got married she
she even stopped meditating by that point she was sort
of out of it but she did spend like five
years there you know in europe meditating but then she
came out of it and then and then she's just
literally walking out of the bus at the bus stop
doing her chores as you know a mother does and
then suddenly she had an instant enlightenment where she lost
all sense of self and she was completely dumb struck
and paralyzed by this occurrence because she had no reference
point for what it was she lost her sense of
self entirely as though it never even existed and then
she kind of came home to her husband and she's
just telling him like i have no more sense of
self and he's like what do you mean where to
go what does that even mean to not have a
sense of self right a normal person doesn't understand these
things this was some time ago this was before youtube
this was like back in the 80s or something i
don't know um so there wasn't a lot of literature
available about this she didn't have a lot of information
and then so she struggled for he for years with
the sense of no self she was terrified she she
thought she was having some sort of mental disorder she
started going to therapists and shrinks who also didn't understand
what was happening to her they didn't know what awakening
was they didn't know what no self was they didn't
understand what yoga and meditation would do to a person
uh you know advanced stages and so uh and yeah
she she got depressed she got she had panic attacks
every night she couldn't sleep she was stressed this went
on for years for years and years and years and
years until finally she accidentally ran into some kind of
new therapist who had some sort of understanding of non-duality
and awakening and was able to actually introduce her to
some sort of spiritual master who then was able to
explain to her like oh what you're going through this
is just a these are just the early stages of
classical you know buddhist awakening nothing to be worried about
this is normal in fact it's a good thing that
you lost your sense of self and that completely reframed
everything that was happening for her and then she could
be happy again it took her a while but she
could be happy again um after a certain point people
like to talk about eckhart tolle as though he's a
sweet lovable innocent little man just sitting up there he's
being so sweet to you telling you sweet little things
this little little eckhart tolle german man but what people
don't realize they don't connect these two simple dots using
common sense is that the reason eckhart tolle is this
sweet little innocent man sitting there before you now is
because in his like early 30s or 40s i don't
know how old he was the dude was massively suicidally
depressive for years he was on the brink of killing
himself the way he writes it as i remember it
that he was basically to the point where he was
gonna kill himself like today and then in his mind
it's sort of something clicked and said like his mind
said something like well either i'm going to kill myself
today or i'm just going to completely surrender and stop
resisting and then he just surrendered and stopped resisting and
he had his awakening now people hear that and say
oh well how lovely how wonderful and all that yeah
it's lovely and wonderful but you don't know how it
felt to go through years of the depression that led
up to that and you have no idea how close
he came to killing himself you see because um see
for eckhart tolle now in retrospect you look at him
you see his whole life it looks beautiful and wonderful
and all this but i want you to try to
imagine how many people there are in the world like
eckhart tolle who have been depressed and suicidal for years
and then they reach the point where they've had enough
and that's it they're right on the break and then
maybe they're gonna have their awakening but they don't and
end up killing themselves with pills or with a gun
or something and see you don't hear about those people
nobody ever tells you about those people those people don't
go on oprah winfrey and they don't write a book
that sells 50 million copies and their face isn't all
over youtube and everywhere else and they're not these sweet
people they're [ __ ] dead or they're criminals or
they're in an insane asylum and you never hear about
them again these are some of the dark realities of
spiritual work and it's important that you be aware of
these also of course it's important that you understand that
we shouldn't fear monger about spiritual work so even though
there are these rare edge cases and things can go
horribly wrong things can go horribly wrong with almost anything
if you do it enough things can go horribly wrong
with airplane travel with car travel with marriages with relationships
with sex with business with investing in wall street things
can go terribly wrong it's just that these tend to
be more socially acceptable and they're not threatening to the
ego therefore there's no incentive to play up when there's
this kind of screw-up see when an airplane crashes it's
tragic people you know mourn the loss but we quickly
move on because there's no incentive for the ego mind
to latch onto they say ah you see airplanes are
evil look how bad i told you how bad it
was flying in airplanes is a cult people in a
cult flying airplanes are [ __ ] crazy that's what's
really going on see there's no incentive for the ordinary
mind to do that with airplanes because airplanes don't threaten
the ordinary mind but with spiritual teachings there is that
incentive and so the mind becomes very selective in how
it cherry picks its data and what it emphasizes and
what it doesn't now even though i tell you all
this it might sound like it's some kind of excuse
it's not an excuse and i'm very much committed to
sharing honestly with you these sorts of edge cases and
other traps and helping you to avoid them and honestly
many of them can be avoided simply through awareness of
them and discussions like these the problem is how do
i make sure that everybody who watches my content listens
to this episode and watches it all the way through
again the more detailed i get the longer the video
runs the fewer people will watch it and also many
people in fact some of the craziest and most reckless
people they're not concerned about safety so when they hear
some disclaimer from me or they see a video from
me which is sort of safety oriented are they going
to listen is a criminal going to listen to my
warnings about not turning these ideas into some sort of
justification for his criminal actions for example you've heard me
say in the past that morality is absolutely relative there
is no right and wrong what is considered criminal and
legal and illegal these are relative social constructions they are
that's the truth now someone hears that and says ah
okay so that means leo says that i can go
rob a bank and it's not bad yeah it's not
bad in any absolute sense but you have to consider
the consequences see uh what are the consequences of you
doing that first of all what i said the truth
has no prescription to it it's non-prescriptive it's not normative
and this is a general point about any truth all
truth is non-prescriptive what that means is regardless of what
is true what you do about it that's on you
that's your responsibility you can't derive an ought from an
is so just because robbing a bank is socially constructed
and relative does not give you license to rob a
bank nor does it excuse you from the consequences of
your actions when you rob a bank god is not
going to punish you but your fellow humans will you
see you're not punished by some sort of external rule
or moral system which tells you that something you're doing
is bad you're punished by the action itself when you
cheat lie steal kill rape do violence to when you
manipulate exploit corrupt when you're doing those things when you're
being selfish there's a natural consequence that comes from being
selfish it doesn't come from god it's challenging for me
to preempt and to pre-envision every way in which people
can misconstrue and misinterpret what i say i try to
address many common traps but there are many extreme edge
cases which don't even enter my mind because i'm not
even that creative most of the time for example it
never even occurred to me that someone might get the
idea that jumping off a bridge is a legitimate spiritual
technique because the way my mind works that's so [
__ ] stupid that it would almost be an insult
to my own intelligence and to the intelligence of my
audience to be mentioning in a video that you shouldn't
jump off a bridge as a spiritual technique but hey
apparently some people find that a valid spiritual technique i
often see all my forum people coming up with just
stupid ideas for for doing things and i can't personally
monitor all of it for example i remember one time
i caught a guy on my forum who sort of
came up with this technique of of uh i guess
his baptism um so he would fill his bathtub and
he would like put ice in it and stuff like
ice cold water and then he would attempt to like
drown himself in that ice cold water to the point
where he was like totally out of air so when
i saw that i mean obviously obviously that's dangerous and
then he was trying to like promote this as a
technique to other people and you know i contacted him
and i told him like i mean you're doing some
crazy stuff there in a very hardcore in a certain
sense that's admirable that you're willing to go to these
lengths to you know to awaken yourself or to i
don't know what you're trying to prove there um but
uh but like we can't have this as a technique
for the rest of the people on the forum people
get crazy ideas people get desperate and the the real
difficulty here is that the mind is so constructed that
it can literally take any truth or any teaching and
twist it and distort it into its polar opposite very
very easily it almost takes no effort for the mind
to do this for example like you might say well
leo but aren't all these problems just showcasing the fact
that new age spirituality whatever you teach let's say it's
new way of spirituality that this is all this is
all sort of newfangled unexplored territories all dangerous stuff that's
why new age stuff is dangerous so you should go
go to the classical religions that's where it's safe in
the classics in the classics you know christianity catholicism judaism
buddhism islam but see this is this is a this
misunderstands the depth of the problem you see an ignorant
mind will find a way to make almost anything dangerous
and the amount of people who are actually killed as
the result of christianity catholicism islam and other religions is
way more than new age spirituality if that's what you
want to call what i teach although i myself wouldn't
call it that um new age stuff is actually something
separate and i'm not i'm not a big fan of
the new age for you rationalists and atheists and debunkers
in the audience i'm not a new ager i have
many critiques of new age thinking and there's many problems
with it but also they get some stuff right so
it's a mixed bag but um but i mean really
think about this you think christianity is so safe it
only seems safe because it's culturally accepted and just normalized
in the same way as that airplane example it's not
actually safe uh think about how many people commit suicide
because they have homosexual urges but christianity tells them that
homosexuality is a sin and these people they try and
they try and they try to be heterosexual you know
they do these sort of conversion therapy on themselves and
it doesn't work because they're just gay but they can't
admit it to themselves so first of all they're living
with years and years of guilt and it's corroding their
mind and ruining their life millions of people like this
around the world exist but that's just you know never
mind that kind of suffering which goes on for years
and years and years and then some percentage of those
people actually kill themselves maybe one percent but since there
are so many christians and catholics who believe this stuff
seriously one percent of all those is still going to
be thousands of people maybe they they have some sort
of gay affair because they were trying to suppress their
you know sexual urges they have a gay affair and
then their family finds out that they that they had
this fair then they can't live with that shame and
they kill themselves same thing in islam too it's probably
even worse than islam for example the catholic church tells
you that if you if you repent your sins to
god god will forgive you and you will go to
heaven sounds like innocent advice right what what could i
mean beautiful beautiful loving advice this is advice from jesus
right this is what jesus taught what could be wrong
with this well so does that mean that if i
murder my my neighbor and rape his wife and then
i go to confessional and confess it to the to
the priest he forgives me god forgives me i get
to heaven right is that what that means you see
if i have the kind of mind that thinks that
way i can take that crit the most powerful and
beautiful of christian teachings and messages christ's message of forgiveness
and redemption and heaven for for all and i can
abuse that into a justification to rape my neighbor's wife
because i will be forgiven and god doesn't judge and
everyone who repents even the worst sinner is saved or
how about let's say i've been a good person my
whole life and then what does the christian church tell
me if i've been a good person my whole life
and i die in a car accident i'm going to
heaven right so i go i ask my priest hey
you know father i've been a good person no i've
gone to church i've been faithful to my wife i've
been a good provider for my kids what if i
die in a car accident tomorrow am i going to
heaven he's going to say of course you are son
okay and then i say to myself you know i
walk away from me and i say okay so that
means that if i jump off a bridge i'm going
to heaven why wait why wait for the car accident
why wait for my life to end why don't i
just jump off a bridge i'm going to heaven after
all it's heaven it's beautiful up there why would i
want to stay in this earth here i would be
an idiot not to go to heaven and so i
go jump off a bridge you see even very innocent
teachings can be horribly abused and twisted because that's the
mechanism of the ego mind it can twist anything into
whatever it wants it's constructing reality it's constructing fictions and
illusions it's justifying whatever it wants to itself it can
justify murder rape terrorism suicide bombings hatred racism slavery all
of these things have been justified using spirituality and religion
for over 2000 years so now here is where the
scientifically minded rationally minded atheistically minded person comes in and
says ah leo well you're just proving our point is
that all of this spiritual new age old age religious
mumbo-jumbo all of it is [ __ ] all of
it leads to all sorts of evil so let's just
throw it all away okay let's do that and then
what do you got what do you got what do
you replace that with you replace it with materialism reductionism
scientism and i don't mean just materialism in the sort
of atomic realm i mean materialism in the because there's
a there's a going to be a there's going to
be now a pragmatism that comes along with this and
now your whole life is just about running around earning
money also no moral code no ethical code you don't
believe in ethics you just believe in maximizing profit and
doing whatever you can get away with practically speaking whatever
technology you can build let's build that technology there's no
limits on what technology you're willing to build who you're
willing to sell it to uh and so you've got
this capitalistic materialistic system very pragmatic no no spirit no
soul to anything this means you can cheat on people
you can be sexually promiscuous you can objectify the opposite
sex you can use them manipulate them exploit them you
can start to experiment with drugs recreational drugs and pornography
and all this stuff and alcohol so all of the
classic stage orange excesses and so you go into that
for five or ten years and what happens you become
even more suicidal even more depressed than if you were
classically religious or new age and then you kill yourself
the majority of suicides don't actually happen from religion they
they happen from a lack of meaning a lack of
purpose a sort of a hopelessness a nihilism that people
get drawn into a sort of a hollow materialism where
you just acquire more and more and more wealth and
then eventually you realize that there's no amount of wealth
in the world that will make you happy and then
you end up in a situation like anthony bournein or
avicii both of whom killed themselves some years back so
first of all you should recognize that the the problem
of suicide is a very general problem it is not
confined to religion or to spirituality or to the new
age it's a it's a very broad problem next you
should recognize that actually religion and spirituality when done properly
and responsibly saves thousands of people from suicide it does
because it gives people a sense of direction in their
life it saves a lot of drug addicts from overdosing
you know that's that's one of the most effective ways
to save a drug addict from overdosing because most drug
addicts they're sort of spironic stage red what comes after
red blue so many drug addicts and actually criminals too
for that matter you know violent criminals if they can
get reformed and you know it's rare but it does
happen some percentage of these people maybe five ten percent
they do end up reforming themselves and becoming you know
well functioning members of society what happens is that they
move up from from red to stage blue and what
that means is that they find god they find religion
now it's not a very advanced you know kind of
thing that i teach it's it's a kind of a
crude dogmatic religion but just the fact that they start
to go go to church they're part of a community
they have some rules to follow you know some simple
basics they do the jordan peterson thing that gives them
a sense of direction and grounding in their life and
allows them to kick the addiction the opioids the heroin
the meth have a family saves thousands of lives and
also the same dynamic sort of exists on the transition
between orange and green a lot of orange people they
dry themselves crazy with their endless materialistic pursuits and then
when they you know when that endeavor exhausts itself and
they get no satisfaction then they start looking towards you
know what else is there and then they find some
sort of new agey stage green spirituality some meditation some
yoga practice some vipassana retreat they go to maybe some
psychedelics you know then maybe they start micro dosing some
mushrooms some lsd it starts to help them a lot
of people cure their depression and their anxiety with with
mushrooms there's actually going to be approval clinical fda approval
of mushrooms and mdma soon for treating depression ptsd anxiety
other such disorders legitimate therapeutic uses the science behind this
is undeniable at this point absolutely undeniable it works it's
very effective it works better than antidepressants and other things
you know ketamine very effective for treating depression so this
is we're on the cutting edge of this now i'm
actually very excited about this these possibilities for psychedelics um
so there's that transition from orange to stage green where
at stage green you do open yourself up from the
rationalism and the scientism and the materialism to something higher
something more spiritual and you know maybe you smoke some
wheat or whatever and you have a little bit of
insight opens your mind opens your heart a bit and
uh and then that can save you from from suicide
and depression too because again you find something higher so
there's a sort of a isomorphism between the transition from
stage red to blue and from orange to green and
personally i get emails from people quite often who tell
me that they were suicidal then they you know were
desperately searching on youtube found my content started listening and
then now they're free of that they're free of their
depression their their anxiety they have a sense of direction
in their life and that literally actualize or save their
lives and it's very rewarding to to receive those emails
thank you for sending me those i've i've gotten dozens
of those over the i don't even check my emails
that much if i check them all there would probably
be hundreds of them like that now of course i
also get emails from from crazy people i do get
sometimes emails uh from people who say that you know
they started going down this rabbit hole and now you
know their life is less stable than it used to
be they're less happy than they used to be they're
suffering more well part of that of course is just
the nature of the spiritual journey there has to be
a cost you must figure there has to be a
cause for awakening because if there wasn't everyone would be
awake what is that cost that cost is this massive
dip of of nihilism and spiritual turmoil that you go
through in order to finally break through and i wish
i could say that everybody you know is sort of
everyone gets a happy ending and everyone goes through the
dip and then just comes out the other end all
happy and awakened but that's of course not the case
some people will go into this dip of nihilism and
it'll spiral out of control and they're going to end
up in a mental institution or they're going to make
some very bad reckless choices in their life or in
the worst case scenario they'll kill themselves how do you
prevent that what do i say to prevent that it's
challenging because you're sort of you're damned if you're doing
damned if you don't if you stop teaching then the
net result of that is that actually that hurts more
people because the teachings help more people than they hurt
significantly more orders of magnitude more but there's always those
few edge cases that make you wonder what could be
done to make the teachings more robust more clear more
foolproof one of the things i want to do is
i want to i want to make people more aware
of the what they're getting themselves into so one of
the problems is that sort of like youngsters come along
they don't have any foundation in their life and then
they they go down this rabbit hole of awakening and
they start learning about these advanced insights that i share
and honestly my work is designed to be advanced this
is not entry-level work it's advanced advanced stuff i talk
about stuff that's very psychologically threatening especially some of the
latest stuff i've been talking about and it can get
misunderstood by people who just adopt it as a belief
system and don't have a direct consciousness of it which
is why grounding all these insights in direct experience is
so crucial and i keep stressing that all the time
but no matter how much i say it people are
going to take it as an ideology anyways but one
thing that i will do going forward is i will
try to stress and disclaim more when a topic that
i'm talking about is sort of an advanced topic and
that it can it can it has the potential to
destabilize your mind part of the challenge for me is
that see you see the way my my mind you
probably should understand this by now but my mind doesn't
work like a normal mind my mind actually enjoys it
literally enjoys the process of deconstructing reality to me it
gives me pleasure to do this now not always i
i experience plenty of suffering and sometimes i hate it
sometimes i get an insight that you know bothers me
um and i struggle to integrate it that does happen
to me but in general i enjoy deconstructing reality but
that's not all people and actually it's taken me a
long time of teaching and getting feedback to start to
understand that about others see part of the part of
the biggest challenges of being a human is that whatever
you are whatever your strengths are you just tend to
assume that everyone has that strength you just sort of
assume that that's just a innate human ability for example
my strength of being radically open-minded that's like an innate
ability that i have that i see that it took
me many decades of experience to realize that most people
don't have that and so i have to take that
into account when speaking to them well well likewise with
this idea of deconstructing the mind i love this idea
i'm very passionate about this idea this is what i
teach i will continue to teach it because that's my
area of expertise and where i can help people the
most i feel but it's important you understand that deconstructing
the mind is a very long and deep slippery slope
and so on the surface many of my episodes will
start to help you deconstruct the mind here at the
beginning of the slippery slope but then you're gonna start
sliding down and you're gonna if you take it seriously
you're gonna deconstruct more and more and more and then
once you sort of get to the to the lower
third of the slope that's where you have to be
careful because you can deconstruct your mind in a sort
of a dangerous way what do i mean by that
well let me give you an example a good example
is with fear you know i have episodes for example
that talk about how fear is an illusion now is
that true yes in the absolute sense all fear is
illusion and ultimately the fear of death is illusion um
and the reason i say that is because it's true
and my priority is to say what's true but the
problem is that people can misinterpret that because someone could
say well if all death is illusion then i got
nothing to fear so why would i inhibit myself in
any way from doing anything so for example why should
i worry about pressing the the the brake pedal on
my car in fact why don't i just saw the
pedal off my car i don't need a brake pedal
only cowards press the brake pedal when they're driving i
only need a gas pedal and then if i tell
you no no you need a pedal you should have
a pedal a brake pedal on your car you might
respond to me as like but leo you told me
fear is an illusion what are you afraid of leo
what are you afraid is gonna happen you afraid i'm
gonna crash oh that's ego that's ego in you leo
it's only the ego that's afraid you see a lack
of basic intelligence and common sense will get you into
a lot of trouble very quickly with this work the
things i say are advanced they're nuanced they require oftentimes
years of contemplation on a single insight to really understand
it for example the insight that self and other are
the same the self other distinction is the same you
can collapse that distinction that's something i've talked about that's
a that's a core tenet of non-duality there cannot be
a distinction between self and other if there is you've
got a duality so now when you say that in
the abstract of people you can say it in sort
of an innocent sense where people hear it and they
kind of a little bit understand it and then they
say oh yeah okay i accept it i buy it
makes sense to me but they have no idea how
radical that insight is they're not conscious of that they're
not conscious that self and other is a conceptual boundary
within one's mind and then see they hear a lot
of other sort of more soft neo-invited teachers teaching this
same truth but in a very sort of casual milk
toast way they hear it and it just it's all
it sounds all lovely and beautiful but then oftentimes when
i teach it and i go really deep on it
i will go so deep on it that i will
really make you feel the solipsism of it and this
is where a lot of people struggle is with the
solipsism of it because then at some point it hits
you that wait a minute if there's no difference between
self and other that very much seems like i'm everything
and this is all that there is and it's solipsism
and solid system is bad right and then we go
down that whole road um and i'm not prepared to
talk about solipsism that's a separate topic i want to
shoot a video on i've been planning that video for
a while now to address it in detail i'm not
going to address it here my point though is that
many of these insights are very challenging to integrate and
to accept fully when you get to the rock bottom
of it whereas on the surface it seems nice and
and wonderful when you really feel it it's a totally
different animal like i remember the first time that i
became conscious like really deeply conscious that there is no
boundary between me and anybody else and when that happened
i i freaked out i couldn't believe what i realized
i i it was so radical because what happened there
for me was that i literally became conscious that my
parents were imaginary when i became conscious that my parents
were imaginary it threw me for such a loop it
was such a mind [ __ ] that it it
took me a few days of sort of just like
sitting there like that in disbelief wondering like was that
did i get that right i can't it can't possibly
be right i must be mistaken but then the more
i thought about it the more i realized i'm not
mistaken it's just something that's so radical like i need
to figure out how to how to integrate this and
i'm not sure how it even got to the point
where i i i actually uh i messaged one of
the moderators on my forum who who's conscious of these
sorts of things just just to get some some input
and some feedback about that just to kind of check
myself you know am i going crazy or not um
and that's me i have a i have a rather
unique and not to brag but i have a rather
rather strong mind strong in the sense that like i
love these kinds of insights to me when i realized
that my parents were imaginary on the one hand it's
like kind of horrific to realize that on the other
hand it's the greatest joy it really depends on how
you look at it and i can see it both
ways in fact i do um and you know now
i love it now i love it it's good um
but you know again that's me like see it's hard
for me to get into your mind and to see
how you would react to that i imagine that most
of you would react quite badly to that uh it
might throw your life into disarray you might even feel
like you're losing your mind you might feel like you're
going crazy a bit and i've been there like i
mean i've i've taken psychedelics that that sent me into
a into a full-blown madness full-blown man like i know
what madness feels like uh i've been there it's a
very good experience in retrospect now you don't want to
be stuck there um and i integrated it but how
many of you are going to be able to integrate
it or not i don't know so in these kinds
of situations i want to give more warning you know
pre pre warning for folk that this is sort of
like deep waters where you could get yourself into trouble
and i've done that a lot with psychedelics you know
i talked positively about psychedelics a lot but actually before
this incident happened with the forum i actually i already
recorded i have i have in my render pipeline right
now i have a episode about the dangers of psychedelics
where i go through all of the risks and dangers
of psychedelics very methodically um because i was looking i
i'm always looking on my forum for instances where people
are misusing psychedelics because i'm i'm very touchy about that
because to me one of the most important things about
psychedelics is precisely because they're so [ __ ] powerful
and so important as a technology that the misuse of
them this is one of the greatest this is one
of the greatest tragedies and problems that we that we
have collectively that needs to be solved so for me
anytime i see somebody on the forum misusing psychedelics even
something as simple as like not weighing a dose just
eyeballing it i'll generally you know chime in there and
i'll all sort of get into space about it i'll
make him feel bad for doing that but leo isn't
everything good didn't you say everything is good and perfect
in the world why is anything bad of course everything
is good and perfect in the absolute sense but in
the relative sense in the survival sense if you care
about surviving then you have to ask yourself how do
you want to survive do you want to survive in
a in a society that's crazy and chaotic and people
are slitting each other's throats or do you want to
survive in a comfortable society that treats you so decently
see so it very much matters and it has always
mattered to me the practical effect and influence of these
teachings on ordinary people's lives that has always mattered to
me and in fact you have to understand where i
began i began this whole thing from personal development i
was a personal development teacher i didn't even know about
spirituality or awakening when i started this thing actualize that
org eight years ago i learned along the way what
you see with me is you see my own evolutionary
process unfold in these talks and a lot of times
what i'm sharing with you is insights that i've had
recently and sometimes i'm figuring these insights out and you
have to understand that i am fallible i don't always
say the right things sometimes i speak just because i'm
sloppy sometimes i misstate a factual statement here there on
occasion um sometimes i misanalyze the situation i get it
wrong sometimes i have an insight but the insight isn't
fully baked it needs more time to bake it'll take
two more years to bake it but i still share
it with you because it's part of my process and
because i expect you to be verifying all these things
for yourselves as i've said multiple times and as as
i stressed in my three-part series called self-deception that's one
of the most important series i have is the three-part
self-deception series it really addresses a lot of these straps
here and really the core issue that we're talking about
which is self-deception because that's how you get yourself into
trouble is through self-deception uh i said at the end
of that series that i am not immune to self-deception
nobody is immune to self-deception i don't care how awake
you are how enlightened you are you're not immune to
self-deception i've seen even the the most respected of enlightened
masters deceiving themselves in one way or another i've seen
it it happens trust me you can trust me on
that um and if you don't want to double check
it for yourself like you should with anything i say
so an important safety feature of all of actualize.org is
this idea that you have to verify the things that
are said to you through your own direct experience i
don't know how many times i can repeat that anymore
it's tiring to repeat it that's part of the problem
with these disclaimers it gets tiring to say them and
then those people who are smart and wise and conscious
they get tired of hearing them because they don't need
it said because it's obvious but the safety feature is
that you gotta run it through your own direct experience
and verify and cross reference these things with other teachers
teachings books and so forth to make sure that you're
interpreting things correctly you have the right view and if
your view is leading you down a road which is
socially irresponsible which is going to cause social damage damage
to your family to your loved ones to yourself to
your bank account to your health then that's a clear
sign to you that you're misunderstanding something there's nothing about
these teachings which should be causing anybody physical harm or
damage and when i talk about awakening and i talk
about god and i talk about love and i talk
about death when i talk about ego death this does
not mean any kind of physical harm to your body
or to anybody else this is not a license for
suicide obviously i want to shoot a separate episode about
suicide and people who are suicidal there's there's a lot
that i could say on that topic but for now
what i'll say is that the entire point of awakening
is to make you appreciate the beauty and gift of
this life that you have this life is a gift
all of my teachings are predicated upon the premise that
you are conscious of the fact that your life is
a precious gift and that it's because of this that
you self-actualize it's because of this that you develop a
life purpose it's because of this that you develop responsibility
and discipline you see i don't teach you just how
to transcend the self and and go into some sort
of you know spiritual abyss a lot of my work
is very practical and just teaches you the foundations of
how to put your life together i teach about responsibility
and open-mindedness and reading books and studying and doing spiritual
practices and uh getting your finances in order having a
life purpose being creative with your work relationship sexuality this
is all positive life affirming stuff the reason we're interested
in all this is to get you mastery a basic
level of mastery with survival i talk about that i
don't dismiss the importance of survival survival is important so
long as you are interested in surviving and i assume
you are and i am i'm not above survival in
case that wasn't obvious at the very least because teaching
can't be done without surviving spirituality cannot be taught without
surviving and also because people aren't ready to learn spirituality
unless they have at least the basics of their survival
handled so the whole point of this work is first
you have to recognize how amazing your life is most
people don't recognize that they take their life for granted
and that's why they don't self-actualize and they don't put
a lot of work into their life you cannot put
a lot of work into your life unless you really
value it so why would you then squander it by
jumping off a bridge when i talk about ego death
we're talking about a conceptual death of the self not
the body now you might say leo but doesn't nonduality
mean that there's no difference between a conceptual death and
a physical death because now you're drawing a line between
concept and material stuff physical stuff and technically speaking from
the absolute point of view there is no boundary between
conceptual death and physical death in fact to be perfectly
frank physical death does not exist it's purely imaginary but
that only applies if you're ridiculously conscious and you don't
care about survival you're not attached to survival now again
some people will take this and they will misconstrue this
and they will come up with an excuse to use
this to justify their suicide and with regards to suicide
i'll say this you know is suicide good is it
bad should you do it what are what are leo's
thoughts on this well first of all it doesn't really
matter what my thoughts are what matters are what your
thoughts are because whatever my thoughts are yours are going
to actually determine whether you do it or not not
mine but i'll share my thoughts with you anyways maybe
it'll set your head straight my thoughts on it are
that ultimately it doesn't matter in the absolute sense it
doesn't matter if you want to end your life you
can it's your choice it's not morally wrong in any
sense and in fact if you were in deep enough
suffering you would kill yourself any of us would if
the suffering got deep enough i guarantee you'd kill yourself
that's just a fact of life um but fortunately the
majority of us will never be in that much suffering
to do it um and the desire or even the
thought just the mere thought of wanting to kill yourself
already shows you that your mind is not pure there's
something impure about your mind now if you're thinking to
yourself well leo but if i kill myself i will
reach the godhead sooner and faster and deeper i will
become infinitely conscious i will merge into god with love
and all this good stuff that you talk about isn't
that true isn't that what you've said yes death is
infinite love but this dream that you're in is also
infinite love it's also god this is it here don't
go looking for it somewhere else it's here in fact
there's nowhere to go there's here even when you're thinking
about your suicide that already is fantasy land you're fantasizing
you're not grounded in the present moment in what's absolutely
true and if you were you would have no need
to kill yourself the thought wouldn't even arise you would
be so enraptured and in love with the beauty and
majesty of this present moment god is right here look
at your hands look around you look at the trees
look at the birds it's pure [ __ ] beauty
where are you running off to where are you going
to go to see what this is it the point
of the work is to recontextualize all this as the
absolute beauty that it is and then you can enjoy
it there's no other purpose to life or to being
than the enjoyment of it and by enjoyment of it
i mean to love it see love is not something
you enter into when you die although of course it
is that but love is your love for what is
here right here do you love this can you love
this that's the challenge there's no challenge in loving everything
when you're dead that happens automatically there's no challenge the
challenge is precisely to figure out how to love this
the stuff that is limited and difficult to love it's
the thorn in your side that's difficult to love now
if you say well leo but why i don't want
to play this game why can't i just uh have
it easy the easy way out well look in the
end suicide is your prerogative as a living being nobody
can ultimately stop you some people can tell you it's
bad some people can tell you it doesn't matter some
people can tell you it's not bad but you shouldn't
do it for the sake of others or because you're
being selfish or whatever but in the end you're going
to do whatever you want to do and nobody has
a right to tell you what to do so i'm
not going to sit here and moralize to you about
suicide i just want to point out to you that
if you have a craving for it that itself you
should notice is not a healthy impulse something is out
of whack in your mind now if you're in really
really deep suffering because you had some terrible chronic you
know you're in a car crash and you broke your
spine and now you're in miserable pain 24 7 that's
a separate situation we can talk about that that that's
almost like we can talk about that as like euthanasia
and we can make some ethical points about the validity
of doing suicide in in that situation and i'm not
going to talk about that here for the majority of
people who commit suicide that is not their situation for
the majority of people what it is is that their
mind is tricking them in some way and yes many
people of course do suffer i totally acknowledge that but
what you have to realize about the suffering is that
your suffering comes and goes and it ebbs and flows
on some days and i mean i'm not immune to
this i've had suicidal thoughts before i'm not perfect um
in fact in the last year if you've been following
along with my health issues with my stomach i've had
some i had a very tenacious gut infection in my
stomach that has been very difficult to cure i've tried
all sorts of antibiotics that have not worked um and
i'm still trying to figure that out but it's caused
me so much suffering and misery and pain over the
last year and a half i've tried so many things
i like i was at my wit's end with this
thing i went to all these doctors and all this
sort of stuff so much suffering it like it shot
the quality of my life down from like if we
say it was 100 now it's at like 20 and
there were moments in that period where i was suffering
so much with no hope in sight that i had
suicidal thoughts and i would think to myself well if
if if this keeps going i can't live like this
because there's no way to enjoy life in this state
but what you have to understand is that even when
you hit those lows those are usually temporary lows and
your mind will play a trick on you where it
will get you to think like well it's going to
be this way forever but then of course i know
that it's not going to be this way forever so
the key thing to remind yourself when you're in this
kind of depressive mood is that first of all you
make a commitment not to harm your body ever and
to take good care of your body just making that
commitment which i've recommended in the past in my is
actualized or occult episode i talk about making a commitment
not to harm your body on this journey it's a
very important safeguard so make sure you do that you
make that commitment um and then you just what you
do is you sort of commit to suffering it out
through life no matter how bad it gets and on
some days it'll get really bad but what happens is
that when you commit to suffering it out no matter
what this is actually what purifies you and saves you
and grows you later in life you will remember that
those lowest points were some of the most important for
your growth and for your spiritual work but i'm not
gonna lie some days it'll be very difficult and your
mind will try to fool you into thinking like it's
never gonna get better and really when a person decides
to commit suicide is that moment when they decide that
there's no more hope there's no way this can be
improved every avenue has been exhausted it's really i think
only when you feel that way and you get yourself
to believe that fiction it's then that you actually decide
to commit suicide because as long as you maintain at
least one avenue of hope one possibility you can try
tomorrow to improve your situation one way that things might
get better or turn around for you as long as
you maintain that then you can keep going but if
you lose all hope then you're as good as gone
and on some days you will lose all hope and
your mind will be so uncreative that you will not
be able to imagine a better alternative or any alternative
you're going to think you're stuck this way forever and
that's what i want you to remember me telling you
that it's just a temporary trick of your mind it's
not true there's always something else you can try there's
always some additional hope and therefore it's worth toughing it
out because tomorrow your brain will reset your mind will
reset you'll get it you'll catch a second wind you'll
get a little bit of relief you'll get some more
ideas you'll get some new people in your life who
can help you or who can suggest new things to
you you'll read a new book that'll have a new
technique or whatever and then you'll come out of it
and then that will let you appreciate life more really
really appreciate what you have here you've been given this
incredible unique opportunity to be yourself you're the only one
who's like this in the universe in the entire universe
you're the only one here who's like this like you
exactly the way you are and the game of life
is for you to figure out how to live that
in a beautiful way in a way that is harmonious
with the rest of what's here how to tap into
your discover and tap into your special strengths and gifts
and the unique contributions you can make to mankind it's
very challenging sometimes life gets very very very challenging to
a suicidal point that's why i want you to make
a commitment to never physically harm your body in fact
that's not even enough if you're following my work then
you should know that my work is not just about
maintaining your body but it's about improving your body health
is very important you should be taking better health of
care of your health and coming soon i will have
some episodes about how to improve the health of your
brain improve the health of your body cure gut problems
like i've been dealing with i'll share that with you
very strategies that i've discovered i've discovered a lot of
stuff in the last year about nutrition and health and
so forth these are all these are all important take
care of your body take care of your health one
of the things that i learned in the last year
and a half suffering through this health problem that i
had with my gut is how foundational health is to
anything else you do in life a lot of times
spiritual teachers will make you believe that like oh well
health isn't so important as long as you're just awake
enough you can you can power through any kind of
health problem you won't suffer no i don't think so
your health is ridiculously important and the only way you
can have such a flippant attitude about your health is
if you have good health and it's extremely easy to
take health for granted when you have it and you've
never lost it it's only when you start losing it
like i have in the last year and a half
that you really start to appreciate and become conscious of
how foundational health is to everything including your consciousness including
your consciousness that's the twisted paradox of consciousness is that
on the one hand consciousness transcends the body on the
other hand your consciousness is so limited by what is
going on in your body if i give you a
glass of mercury to drink and you drink that mercury
your consciousness is going down the [ __ ] you
are not going to be this this blissful happy uh
super woke above it all person no your conscious will
crash back down into a condensed state as that mercury
leeches through your body and into your brain and disrupts
the functioning of your neurotransmitters and neurons and all of
that that it'll happen and all of that despite the
fact that your brain is imaginary there's no contradiction because
it's all consciousness so taking care of your brain health
and your body health is very important and even your
gut health you might think well the gut has nothing
to do with consciousness oh yeah try going through what
i went through in the last year and a half
with my gut when you get some nasty bacteria in
there and then every time you eat food that nasty
bacteria releases toxins into your bloodstream through your gut and
it feels like a anti-psychedelic psychedelic raises your consciousness you
can feel it you know you take a tap of
lsd and then 15 20 minutes later you can notice
your consciousness is just elevating and it's beautiful well when
you have a gut bacteria and then you eat some
food it has exactly the opposite effect you take it
and then you just notice rather than your consciousness rising
you notice your thoughts start to get scrambled and chaotic
and you get washed over with this wave of chemicals
that are just like they feel toxic and you get
brain fog and you can't concentrate and you can't meditate
you can't do anything you can barely think straight and
you're in pain that's what i went through for the
last year on many days it was very humbling and
very challenging so in general what i want you to
understand is that this work is a lot more complex
than you ever imagined and i feel like that's one
of the hallmarks of what i teach is i teach
the complexity of this work a lot of other teachers
oversimplify this work now there's pros and cons to that
of course there are negatives to to making everything too
complex um but the reality is that life is infinitely
complex survival is infinitely complex even spirituality is ridiculously more
complex than you ever imagined if you truly start exploring
it all of its different facets and so it's easy
to get lost in that complexity that complexity is what
allows your mind to fool itself because you think you
got something figured out but actually later you realize you
didn't you might think it's a good idea to jump
off a bridge because it'll bring you closer to god
but maybe that's not the right way to get closer
to god so anyway going forward in the future i
will be putting more disclaimers and warnings into my videos
i haven't yet decided on what format that's going to
take it might be right at the front of the
video maybe towards the end of the video i don't
know um i also have to think about putting it
into the audios because people don't watch they listen you
see so there's a lot of complexity here i'm we're
definitely we're going through and we're changing all the disclaimers
in the text boxes for the videos to make them
more robust um we've already been doing that for for
the last few weeks um and we're gonna kind of
go back and and retool some of the old videos
for that purpose um unfortunately youtube doesn't allow me to
change my old videos if they did i would have
changed a lot of stuff already a long time ago
but they don't like allow me to insert slides or
anything into into videos all i can do is just
edit like the text descriptions um so there will be
some of that coming forward in the future you can
look forward to that but also i i will simply
just be talking more about various traps and dangers and
stressing them more like i said and pointing out where
the advanced stuff is and where you can get go
go wrong and maybe potentially harm yourself but also i
want to say another thing here which i haven't touched
upon yet which is that like i said very powerful
and truthful teachings and wisdom has been demonized throughout all
of human history and so one of the greatest things
that concerns me here with this incident is that as
tragic as the incident is there's also the consideration of
the actualize our brand and i'm concerned that people will
take this incident and twist it into some sort of
weapon to discredit the brand and the teachings there are
a lot of people out there who would love to
do that because that's historically what is done with powerful
and truthful teachings is that the ego mind the collective
mind will look for any excuse they could find to
to demonize it discredit it or weaponize something against it
which is why it's very important to put it into
proper context and so i've laid out a lot of
that context here today so that anyone who's reasonable and
objective can can weigh and understand the um the full
complexity of the situation that we're dealing with here for
example i know saad guru faced some [ __ ]
when his wife committed mahasamadhi at least that's what he
says his wife had a child she was a yogi
she was in her early 30s good health and then
just poof mahasamadi there were reports in the newspaper that
assad guru killed his wife there are websites right now
online you can go and type into google saad guru
killed his wife and you'll find websites you'll find something
like saadgurukilthiswife.com which will post news clippings and theories about
how he killed her and how he lied and manipulated
and this sort of stuff so um this is the
kind of thing that i find very distasteful and that
i am defensive about because it happens there are people
out there who will smear in this way uh and
a lot of times they just it's simply because they
don't understand right so the things that i teach like
try to imagine this from the point of view of
somebody who's sort of like a normie who's a materialist
who is an atheist who is a rationalist or whatever
and uh they hate all this stuff and all these
ideas are sort of an affront to their entire world
view and they have no interest in any kind of
spiritual stuff and they have no interesting kind of nuance
about it in their mind they just know that all
this stuff is just pure [ __ ] that some
cult leader is spinning to earn money from gullible fools
that's how they see me that's their view of reality
that's how they see actualize.org and they're not conscious of
that they don't really understand what they're doing or how
their own mind is playing this trick on them they
don't understand projection they don't understand self-deception they don't understand
the limits of materialism they haven't had profound mystical experiences
they don't believe they're even possible they just think that
love and god is just some new age mumbo jumbo
[ __ ] and this is all just about money
and so of course when they see me and this
work in that way then they can't help themselves but
to go into some sort of attack mode and look
for any kind of sort of gotcha and so uh
that's that's virtually inevitable by the way with with most
teachings spiritual teachings uh there was a you know there's
actually um well everybody knows the story of christ um
nailed to the cross but uh there was a there's
also a similar story with the buddha where like there's
a story in buddhism that that goes you know after
the buddha became awakened and he was teaching people and
he had like a little cult following going there of
his loyal disciples there was like one one of his
students or villagers or disciples i don't know who it
was who was disgruntled with the buddha and you know
thought that what the buddha was teaching was like all
[ __ ] and stuff and then um and then
the story goes he he unleashed there's like an elephant
that was tied up there in the village he untied
this elephant and unleashed it and kind of you know
goaded the elephant onto the buddha to like run towards
the buddha and trample him as the buddha was walking
down the path um and then the elephant ran towards
the buddha and the buddha just like put up his
hand and the elephant eventually um stopped and bowed before
him so um the only reason i bring that up
not to compare myself to the buddha but just to
say that um there's a there's always a tendency to
suppress truth and to manipulate it to distort it to
corrupt it to demonize it to outlaw it to discredit
it because the job of the ego mind the job
of the devil is to muddy the waters so much
that ordinary people around him cannot distinguish truth from falsehood
anymore in all the mud and they just equate truth
and falsehood they throw their hands up and they say
well it's just all a wash who really knows we
don't really know what's true so let's follow this guy
who happens to be the devil and then they follow
the devil and he leads them off a cliff there
are many ways to lead people off a cliff not
just physically but there are much worse ways war capitalistic
exploitation genocide ideological battles back and forth partisanship that lasts
forever and leads to endless gridlock riots and protests and
insurrections so what's to be done about all this is
there a a solution there's no algorithmic solution to the
truth falsehood problem the only way to distinguish truth from
falsehood is through careful conscious investigation through personal experimentation through
direct experience there's no algorithm for it it takes intelligence
and there's no algorithm for safety either people often look
for an algorithm for safety they say like well the
ten commandments are like the algorithm for safety just stick
with the ten commandments you'll be safe oh really will
you be safe or will that lead to a genocide
or a holy war you're not safe following some ten
commandments because reality is far too complex for that and
the dangers are far too complex for that see there's
no commandment that says don't jump off a bridge so
if you're foolish you might say well i follow the
ten commandments there's no commandment telling me not to jump
off a bridge so i guess it's okay by god's
standards i guess i'm going to heaven you see there's
no amount of rules you can invent no amount of
algorithms that will prevent ignorant people from doing ignorant things
the only way to cure ignorance is to cure ignorance
and to do that you need consciousness which is what
i'm trying to teach but for you to learn consciousness
you can't just hang on my every word and trust
what i say you have to do consciousness you have
to be consciousness you have to be intelligent intelligent comes
intelligence comes from being conscious and being conscious comes from
studying your own mind and doing these practices carefully and
only in this way by cultivating consciousness and intelligence will
you then be able to avoid all the many land
mines and traps that are out there for you in
the spiritual and even in the material landscape there are
plenty of material traps that people fall into all the
time and the way you avoid those is by com
by building up your consciousness and being more intelligent about
how you go about things being more responsible and one
of the things that i learned by doing this work
and by going through these uh situations and uh scandals
and so forth is that i'm also learning like how
to be a leader as well so one thing i'm
realizing is that it's it's it's quite challenging to be
a leader there are many things as a leader like
that i don't want to do or don't care about
but then they're kind of thrust upon me that i
have to start to care about otherwise i'm not being
a good leader and then people don't want to follow
so what this incident is teaching me is how to
lead more responsibly more carefully and so you're going to
see better leadership for me in the future as a
result of this and honestly i'm still processing and deciding
what this means and how i should change if anything
about what i do and how i teach but what
i definitely know is that the teachings are important and
so i'm going to continue doing my teachings as i
always have because i believe in this work and you
know some people don't believe in this work and aren't
interested in this work or or don't like the way
in which i teach this work in which case i
recommend you don't waste time don't waste your time you
don't need to waste time hate watching me um just
go go develop yourself in whatever way you want that
works for you if it's a non-spiritual way do that
if you want to do purely materialistic self-improvement go do
that if that's what you think is the best thing
go do that don't waste your time with me or
if you want some other approach to spirituality go do
that don't waste your time with me or you know
explore many perspectives as i've always recommended from the from
the very beginning um and then cross-reference everything and then
find out your own system in the end basically what
i teach is hopefully what you get from me is
how to sort of build your own system not my
system but build your own system based on principles that
i teach you the principles are very broad once you
learn the principles then you can apply them in in
a way that that tailors and fits to to the
way that you want to do this work and this
work is just sort of honoring your life and building
out a great life and that includes both personal development
and spiritual development both of those are about building out
a great life just in different ways there are different
aspects to life that need to be built out material
and and spiritual both the material is spiritual it's just
a lower level of spiritual it's important if you're young
and i've said this before but i'll say it again
that you develop some survival foundation in your life you
need some mastery of survival before you go hog wild
into spirituality so work on the basics make sure you
have that handled make sure you have a good common
sense i remember that uh i read a story about
yogananda and his guru sree yukteshwar and they were discussing
like you know under what conditions does does the guru
take an apprentice and the conditions that were pretty strict
the conditions were that yuktaswar's sort of conditions were that
he would ask basic questions of of his you know
disciple prospective disciple before they sort of locked in the
relationship he would ask him like well what are your
grades like in school how are you with your friends
and your family are you fulfilling your family obligations are
you able to do that um uh are you able
to support yourself to feed yourself to cook food to
clean laundry do these basic things or do you struggle
with these things and if you said you struggled with
any of these things then he wouldn't take you on
because you're not ready because how can you do that
stuff when you can't handle the that's the basic stuff
of course the challenge with our communications here virtually through
youtube or whatever through the internet is that this is
not a guru disciple relationship i'm not your guru and
it's really important that you understand what i am because
people get this very wrong about what i am what
function i serve i am literally a guy on youtube
who is sharing his philosophical insights about life that's all
that i am and you should treat me as such
i don't know you personally i can't read your mind
i don't know what's going on with you in your
life and each one of you of the thousands and
millions of you out there have your own stuff going
on some of it very weird that i can't even
relate to that's not even within my my general ballpark
of what i know and understand about life some of
you got very weird lives and that's fine weird is
not bad per se it could be great um but
in the end all i'm doing here is i'm sharing
ideas with you ideas can be very powerful a single
idea can change your life but a single idea taken
the wrong way can also destroy your life so you
if you continue to listen you have to be very
careful about how you make sense of these ideas how
you apply these ideas and in the end i don't
know how you're going to apply them and what kind
of twisted way you're going to imagine something's going to
happen in your life i don't know remember that truth
absolute truth is not prescriptive in any way that means
whatever i say the absolute truth is or whatever you
discover the absolute truth to be it doesn't mean anything
likewise with love when you discover absolute love infinite love
god's love you might fall into the trap of thinking
that it means something it means you should do something
in the material survival world it means you should hug
your kids more it means you should have more sex
it means you should get a divorce it means you
should get married it means you should have sex with
your mother i don't know what you think it'll mean
but whatever you think it means it doesn't mean that
why doesn't it mean that because everything is love so
when you say oh i'm gonna do this because it's
love well what you're not realizing is that the opposite
of doing that is also love so when you say
i'm going to hug my kids that's love okay but
if you don't hug your kids that's also love and
if you hate your kids that's also love everything is
love that's infinite love absolute love it's very radical what
this means is that the ego your little ego cannot
control or manipulate or use or justify with this love
anything that it wants to do so take ownership of
that rather than concocting these elaborate justifications for like oh
i did this today i went to the grocery store
because of love and i did this to my kids
because of love you didn't do that because of love
you do that because you're selfish and you're surviving that's
why you did those things and then you and you
invented some stories about love to make yourself feel nicer
and sweeter to you to your own self truth and
love make you free they don't constrain you to a
limited set of options you have to use intelligence and
consciousness to figure out very skillfully in a very nuanced
way what would be the most loving expression of your
love in any particular situation and you could always be
wrong about that you might think that oh this is
going to be the best expression of love and then
you realize i tricked myself that was actually selfishness masquerading
as love you see that's self-deception inaction and i'm not
immune to it don't assume you're immune to it don't
assume your favorite guru is immune to it or above
it they aren't this is the whole challenge of life
you never solve this problem permanently this is something you're
constantly juggling and balancing like on a surfboard you got
to be dynamically balancing as you're on the wave and
that wave is your life and as soon as you
become too rigid on that board and you decide that
well i'm just gonna i'm just gonna shift my weight
to the right and just keep it there forever because
i got it figured out now that's when you're going
to screw up and wipe out you
