hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about overcoming addiction and
I'm going to tell you the deepest root cause at
the bottom of every addiction listen up because this information
I'm going to give you here is not just for
hardcore drug addicts this is something that's going to be
useful for everybody I'm going to share with you some
deep insights that I got from my own food addiction
and overcoming my food addiction earlier in my life and
what that's going to give you is it's going to
give you a really deep high-level understanding of what addictions
are and why they exist and where they ultimately stem
from because every addiction stems from the exact same deep
place firstly though how do we tell that we have
an addiction there's a great limit s --t that I
can give you which I got from gay Hendricks I
really love this and what he basically says is if
you stop doing the behavior that you suspect that you're
addicted to if you stop doing it for one week
and cravings arise then that means that you're addicted and
if you stop doing it and no cravings arise that
means you're not addicted so this is a very simple
rule of thumb you can run this test on any
behavior you have that you suspect of being an addiction
and if you actually do this and try this out
you might be shocked at what you surprised at how
many things you're addicted to you might discover that you're
addicted to things that you wouldn't even have normally thought
or addictions these days in modern society almost everyone is
an addict the only question is to what degree how
severe is it and how many addictions do you have
most of us have not one or two addictions but
at least half a dozen if not a dozen or
more the most common addictions are of course drugs but
also food porn tobacco alcohol TV and Internet videogames very
common these days also socialization chit-chatting and partying with your
friends shopping work gossip and thinking now thinking is a
really interesting one you might think that you're not addicted
to thinking and that thinking doesn't really qualify as an
addiction but man actually thinking is the number one thing
that most people are addicted to and they don't even
know it now that's a tangent that I can't go
into here it's a very deep rabbit hole that I
talk about in my enlightenment videos and in my meditation
video so I will cover it here but what I
want to do here is I want to talk about
the root cause of all of these addictions because they
only have one ultimate root cause and that is fear
of emptiness fear of emptiness sounds kind of weird fear
of emptiness how does this create addiction well it's really
the fear of the emptiness that you experience when you
are alone with nothing to do so if you just
sit in a room and don't do anything for an
extended period of time you will notice this fear of
emptiness come up and it comes up in many different
ways and what addictions are is they're distractions and escapes
from this existential emptiness fear that all of us have
who have not faced it head-on the way that I
discovered this is with my food addiction I don't know
if you notice about me but I used to be
overweight quite heavily overweight for most of my life since
I was about ten years old until I was about
21 or 20 two years old all through school and
through the first half of college I was quite overweight
and not just overweight but I was really obsessed with
food and I over ate a lot of food and
just ate terrible food and then when I got into
college finally I decided that this is something I need
to change and over the course of about six months
I put a stop to all of it and I
got myself in shape and I've stayed pretty lean ever
since ah now the thing that I discovered though in
those first few days when I started to make that
transformation with my diet and with my fitness is I
discovered this root cause of addiction I didn't realize that
it was all addictions I thought it was just food
but what I realized and I remember this very vividly
as I was sitting there at home it was late
at night and usually I would go grab a snack
some candy or some some soda or some ice cream
or whatever while I was uh just relaxing after college
but what happened here is that I committed to eating
cleaner so I made a commitment not to eat any
dessert or to drink any soda or any sugary type
products and I had some ice cream in the refrigerator
and I was sitting there just watching some TV and
I really got this craving for some ice cream I
wanted to go great grab some the way I normally
would but then I remembered that no I can't do
that because I've made this commitment to clean up my
diet and so what I did is this was a
decisive moment for me I just sat there i sat
there and didn't move didn't do anything just sat there
the TV was playing and I just watched this craving
for ice cream course through my body and it was
a whole physical reaction right the whole physical reaction as
you know with addictions if you've ever tried to quit
something like smoking or drinking or porn or whatever is
that you have this whole craving that your body goes
through is not just a mental thing it's also a
physiological thing and so what I did is I just
I force myself to sit there and just to experience
it and that was the decisive moment for me from
then on my whole diet got a lot easier because
I was able to crack that uh that really difficult
the most emotionally challenging moment in this whole phase of
changing my diet was just to sit there and to
not give in to this craving and just kind of
observe it more or less mindfully so that's what I
did uh so I'm going to use food as the
kind of prototypical example throughout the discussion here in this
episode but of course you can replace food with any
addiction it doesn't matter what I'm talking about food you
replace it with whatever you're addicted to internet porn videogames
relationships love thinking anything it doesn't matter right it's all
the same stuff basically so the problem that you have
with whatever you're addicted to is that you're basically unable
to sit alone in an empty room you can't stand
it so what you do is you turn to blank
as your distraction and fill in the blank with whatever
you want so you turn to food as a distraction
or you turn to drugs as a distraction or you
turn to shopping as a distraction now you might wonder
like what does this have to do with anything why
is this this notion of sitting alone in an empty
room why would that be important and why is this
being used as kind of the metric to judge things
isn't it sort of arbitrary and actually no it's not
arbitrary it's a very special metric it's very important because
in a sense the degree to which you are self
developed and the degree to which you're emotionally mature and
the degree to which you are capable as a human
being is the degree to which you can sit alone
in an empty room without any external stimulation see and
the degree to which you need external stimulation to feel
happy in your life is the degree to which you
have of no mastery over your life it's the degree
to which you are a slave to external reality it's
the difference between being externally grounded and internally grounded and
the whole aim of self-actualization is to ground yourself deeper
and deeper into your own being internally and being internally
means just being rather than doing rather than running around
and stimulating yourself with television or food or anything else
you see so this criteria of sitting alone in an
empty room and being fulfilled or satisfied or at the
very least not agitated and full of craving sensations is
a very important metric it's a very important litmus test
and you can try this by yourself just sit alone
comfortably in a room for an hour or two doing
nothing and see how you feel do you feel okay
do you feel happy do you feel normal or do
you feel antsy and bored and pissed off and frustrated
and agitated and you can't even sit still for five
minutes or you're lost in fantasies in your mind about
stuff you're dreaming about sex and you're dreaming about food
and you're dreaming about business and you're dreaming out work
and all this other stuff but you can't just be
present in the moment this is very very important a
lot of people completely underestimate how important this is you
can't really be satisfied in life if you can't sit
alone in an empty room for a couple hours without
cravings and most people can't do that and the reason
that is is fundamentally that your life is hollow see
your life is actually empty but you've been running away
from that truth from that reality for most of your
life ever since you were a child and you started
playing video games or you started playing with toys or
you started reading books or watching television or whatever you
started doing eating food candy all that stuff was you
getting attached to stimulation because you weren't able just to
be present and satisfied with stillness and with being so
what you started to do early on in your life
and you continued to do it today and is very
normal for you today you think that this is how
life should run what you do is you stuff yourself
until you're aching and you're guilty that should ring some
bells for you think of all the times either recently
or in the past where you stuffed yourself until you're
aching and then you're guilty maybe you stuffed yourself with
a Netflix marathon or you stuffed with yourself with a
a porn marathon or you stuffed yourself with food at
a buffet or some restaurant or backyard barbecue or you
stuffed yourself with a reading or with knowledge or you
stuffed yourself with work it's like work work work work
work right what you did is you stuffed yourself think
about the last time that you stuffed yourself and how
you felt you felt very full but you also felt
dirty and really even though you felt full on the
surface deep down below the surface what happened is that
you felt empty inside and no matter how much you
consume that emptiness is never filled because this is the
inescapable limit of hedonism and materialism is that you can't
fill that emptiness of being with more doing or with
material X colonel possessions or activities no matter how much
you try you can't do it so the problem here
is that you're running away from this existential emptiness and
this existential emptiness usually most of us think of it
as a problem something to avoid but actually is something
that you need to open yourself up to and to
face and to embrace and to accept and this is
what most people do not do and by not doing
this this leads to all manner of a dysfunctional addictive
behaviors and it leads to just a dissatisfaction with life
and then ultimately can lead to depression and even to
suicide because being biased nature is empty that is the
nature of being itself is emptiness but see most people
don't like this idea at first it seems kind of
negative and it seems depressing actually it's not it's a
very beautiful and incredible experience to fully realize the emptiness
of being and to be one with it this is
a very profound experiences of what spirituality is based upon
but most people aren't mature enough to grasp this and
they're so busy running away from it because they've been
running away from it since they were like 3 years
old that now it seems like it's the normal thing
to do it's fear of the void the existential void
inside of you this is the void you feel when
you start to think and contemplate about your own death
have you ever just sat down and contemplated your own
death do you realize that you will be dead within
the next 20 30 50 years at most you'll be
dead and you'll be dead forever never again in the
billions of years that this universe will go through will
you ever again be alive now sit with that and
think about that for a moment and try to imagine
what the experience of death is I don't mean going
through death but I mean after you're dead what that
is that lack of experience in other words there will
not be no more colors or sounds or tastes there
won't be sex there won't be entertainment there won't be
porn there won't be videogames there won't be business activity
there won't be money-making there won't be fun there won't
be travel there won't be sadness there won't be anything
there won't be fear there won't be uh you know
bodily sensations of any kind it's going to be a
complete void so empty that is not even going to
be black and it's not even going to be silent
because silence and darkness are actually phenomenon of life so
it's going to be so empty that you're not even
to have those things it's the same emptiness that you
experience when you're in deep sleep not when you're dreaming
but when you're in deep sleep and you have no
sensations and no memories of anything you don't even know
that you're alive that's what the void is like is
what you were before you were born think back to
what your life was before you were born it was
a void right you have nothing you have zero experience
of it so that's the thing you're ultimately running away
from and that's something that you don't just I'm not
just saying you're running away from death I mean you're
running away from that sort of empty that's sort of
emptiness it doesn't just exist after death it exists right
now now in the reality of being itself so if
you just sit and do nothing what you have is
you just have raw experience and if you sit there
long enough you start to realize that all this experience
that's happening it's always changing it's always in flux and
ultimately none of it means anything and this might start
to make you depressed this might lead to an existential
crisis but what has to happen is that you have
to face this you have to face this void at
one point in your life if you want to conquer
addiction sustainably see a lot of people what they do
when they have addiction is they look for kind of
a a service level solution it's like well how do
I change my behavior so I stop smoking or I
stop overeating how do I go to the gym more
and workout more all that stuff it can be useful
to a degree but it will not really allow you
to conquer addiction permanently sustainably because it doesn't get you
looking at the void and accepting the void so how
do we get you to conquer the void and to
accept it well you can't really conquer it but you
can come to peace with it and it's really simple
if you permanently want to conquer any addiction that you
have here's what you do is you just sit with
emptiness and do nothing so if it's a food addiction
you sit with an empty stomach and you don't do
anything and if it's a drug addiction users sit there
with you know a clean clean veins and you don't
do anything you don't fill them with any addictive substances
and if it's a video game addiction that you just
sit there without any stimulating images or pixels moving in
front of your eyes and so on and so forth
right and as you do that don't go into fantasy
but just sit there very mindfully don't distract yourself you're
going to be very tempted to distract yourself with some
book or call a friend or talk to your family
or go to the park or whatever we have to
notice that all those are distractions from just facing being
itself and facing that emptiness of being and as you
sit there and you face that emptiness what you have
to do is you just have to surrender yourself to
the purifying fire of emptiness where those cravings will come
up in you and all your suffering will come up
and all your desire for sex and for money and
for food and for for fun and for socialization and
for love and for for all this kind of stimulating
exciting stuff all those cravings will come up and you're
gonna have to suffer through all those and sort of
face your inner demons and as you sit there and
brace yourself you're going to have a psychosomatic reaction your
mind is going to be going crazy and your body
is going to be going crazy and you're going to
feel uncomfortable and perhaps even ill and it's going to
be emotionally challenging but what's going to happen is that
the longer you sit there hour after hour after hour
doing nothing that purifying fire will burn out all your
inner demons and you can just imagine this all your
inner demons are just kind of escaping you as every
hour goes by and that's how you conquer every addiction
if you don't do this then you don't really conquer
the addiction you just find a short-term solution and usually
what happens is that you're going to fall back into
it if not in a week then in a month
and if not in a month than in a year
and if not in a year than in ten years
you will fall back into it because you have it
really faced the inner demons you've just sweep them under
the rug so what I'm giving you here is a
mature solution to addiction this is a very mature solution
this is the ultimate solution and the way you tell
it's but she is that it's very emotionally challenging this
is not easy to do most people don't want to
do this in fact this leads us to the catch-22
that every addict faces when they're going through recovery the
catch-22 of addictions is that every addict when he tries
to go through recovery wants to find a technique that
will help him to avoid the emotional labor of recovery
but it's that avoidance of emotional labor which created the
addiction in the first place so if you notice those
people that are really hardcore addicts in whatever field of
life they are the ones who tend to avoid emotional
labor the most that's basically what addiction is coming from
it's the avoidance of emotional labor emotional labor one of
the forms of emotional labor here is this emotional labor
that comes when you sit there and do absolutely nothing
it seems like doing absolutely nothing is simple and not
laborious at all and actually for someone who's psychologically healthy
and mature and not an addict it's the most pleasant
thing ever but for someone who is an addict sitting
and doing nothing is like torture it's really emotionally laborious
which is kind of the paradox of it and most
addicts they just want a quick fix solution they don't
want to face their emotional labor but it's because they
don't want to face their emotional labor that they're addicts
you see so it's like a vicious cycle and at
one point or another what's going to happen to you
in your life is you're going to realize this you're
really going to get it not just hearing it from
me but you're really going to like feel it in
your bones at one point and if you do then
that will be the beginning of the end of your
addictions and if you don't if you keep resisting and
you keep running away from this and you just hear
my words but you don't really get them to penetrate
down into your bones then you're going to be an
addict for the rest of your life in one form
or another all addiction is basically emotional immaturity all addiction
is basically childishness it's pretty profound to think of it
that way let me give you my top three techniques
for addicts for becoming a non addict for becoming a
really psychologically stable and internally grounded human being this is
what's necessary if you want to self actualize you can't
be fully self actualized while at the same time holding
a bunch of addictions it's just not going to work
so my top three techniques number one is the do-nothing
technique number two is mindfulness meditation number three is strong
determination sitting and then a bonus number four is what
I call existential investigation so let me just briefly cover
these I actually have videos that cover most of these
techniques in a lot of depth so I'm not going
to go into the details here I have a video
about technique number one which is to do nothing technique
you can search for it I have a video for
mindfulness meditation you can search for that I have a
video for strong determination sitting you can search for that
so that covers those three they're all really powerful and
they're basically different ways of just sitting and doing nothing
and paying attention to present experience to being and then
the fourth bonus technique is the existential investigation and what
that is is you sit down and you actually start
to investigate who and what you are existentially and you
face your inner demons really head-on you don't just sit
there I mean sitting there is really good but you
actually take out even more proactive approach you start to
ask yourself okay what's going to happen when I'm dead
you start to contemplate your own death you start to
face your own death you start to face the insignificance
of your existence and that's something that I actually want
to cover in a new episode that I'll shoot soon
I'll show you how to do this kind of existential
investigation and I'll talk about existential crises so I don't
want to go into that too deeply here I just
as a very simple technique if you just want to
start to break your addictions right now all you really
have to do is just make some time sit in
a room by yourself alone without any stimulation without any
music without any books without any games or television or
anything else and just sit there and do nothing it's
really that simple addiction is a much bigger problem than
we realize I mean I'm talking about here what I
would call kind of like hard addictions even things like
video games or even things like shopping I would call
a hard addiction but actually there's a whole second category
of addictions which I would call soft addictions or emotional
addictions and this is something I want to cover again
in a separate episode because it's going to take me
a while to explain all this but basically soft addictions
are things that you wouldn't even ever consider as an
addiction for example criticism or judgment that might be an
example of a soft addiction or an addiction to an
addiction to love and validation from other people or an
addiction for compliments from other people or an addiction for
success these sorts of things most of us think that
these are actually good things or if they're not good
things we think that they're not really addictions but actually
they are addictions and they're in fact some of the
most important addictions that you have even besides your drug
addiction or your porn addiction or your video game addiction
and I'll talk more about that in the future with
additional episodes so one way to look at self-actualization is
you can think of it as the removal of addictions
that's one way to to think of it there's a
lot of different perspectives that you can take on self-actualization
because it's a very deep and kind of high level
abstract concept but that one is one that I really
like because when I think of a self actualized human
being one of the things that immediately comes to mind
is that this person is totally internally grounded and not
dependent on any particular form of stimulation at all now
this doesn't mean this is an anal person that this
person can't have fun or can't watch some TV once
in a while or can't play a video game he
can but he doesn't need it he doesn't crave it
he's transcended all that stuff and in fact for him
the thing that's most enjoyable is not watching TV or
playing a video game or watching some porn the most
enjoyable thing for him is just to sit and to
be that's become more enjoyable now think about that how
close are you to that ideal you might be very
far off think about what it would take how you
would have to structurally change your life to get to
the point where you can just sit and be as
happy as you are playing video games let's say or
watching a Netflix marathon without any stimulation at all do
you believe that that's even possible can you see the
power of that can you see why it would be
powerful to just sit and do absolutely nothing and be
just as satisfied as you are when you're stuffing yourself
with food or when you're shopping or when you're gossiping
with your friends you see why this is powerful if
you can be happy doing nothing at all think about
what happens when you actually are doing something wonderful like
watching a beautiful sunset or hiking in the mountains or
playing a fun video game or smoking some pot you
can still do all those things but just think about
how much more enjoyment you'll get if your baseline level
of enjoyment is already at the maximum of where you
currently are when you're doing all those activities you see
it's like an overflow of internal wealth you might say
you know external wealth is like money houses and yachts
internal wealth is how happy you can be doing nothing
and that's something that you would develop that's not something
that comes to you by accident people don't just grow
up with a lot of great internal wealth almost everybody
starts with zero internal wealth and it has to be
developed through self actualization work that's what this whole channel
is about that's what this whole website is about that's
what everything I tell you is leading you towards in
one fashion or another so keep that in mind one
last issue I want to address here before I go
is 12-step programs so you might be wondering well Leo
what about 12-step programs is this something I should do
are they good what you're suggesting here is slightly different
than most 12-step programs so here's a scoop on 12-step
programs they can be very helpful and for many people
who have hard addictions they need support from knowledgeable experts
who have already gone through you know all this stuff
and who can help them and hold their hand and
guide you through all the steps so that can be
very helpful but most 12-step programs lack the big picture
you can enroll in a 12-step program and you'll go
through and they'll give you a lot of different techniques
and that stuff will be great but they won't give
you the really big picture because they don't quite frankly
understand it themselves right your mission is not to quit
an addiction and that's the only real mission that a
12-step program will give you it'll just say okay let's
have you quit this addiction and maybe they'll say let's
replace this bad addiction with some good addictions but they
won't give you the true mission that you need to
have which is to become self actualized see there's a
very big difference between what we might say playing defense
versus playing offense in a 12-step program you're playing defense
you're not playing offense you're not trying to become the
best human being you can possibly be you're simply trying
to overcome a deficiency or a dysfunction that you have
and while that can be good it's better than nothing
it's not as good as what I'm telling you here
and really you can do both right you can take
the techniques from the 12-step program but most importantly have
the mission to become self actualized to become your greatest
self to become the greatest that a human being can
become and if you do that then that will be
much more motivating for you than just to quit a
drug or just to quit for basically a negative reason
you need a positive reason and the most positive reason
is to become self actualized alright that's it I'm done
please click the like button on this post your comments
down below I do read a majority of the comments
share this episode with a friend and lastly come check
out actualize that org it's my website I've got some
free resources on there that will help you to self
actualize I'm not really interested in just helping you overcome
a little problem that you have in your life or
even a big problem self-actualization is not about fixing problems
it's about living life to its fullest right this is
a very different attitude most people don't have this attitude
in life and it takes a while before you can
acquire this attitude you can understand all the facets of
it there's a lot of conceptual frameworks that you need
to really get on track with self-actualization also various techniques
what I do every single week is I release new
content through my newsletter and on my youtube channel that
explains all this stuff this is all very practical stuff
I'm a my approach to self-improvement is very hard-nosed no
nonsense no new-age type of stuff I'm just really practical
about the concepts and techniques that I find and how
to apply it in my life and I love to
share them with you and to show you the kind
of results that you could get so go check that
out if you sign up to the newsletter it's free
and it'll keep you on track so you don't lose
track of this you don't forget it's very easy to
forget you might watch one of my episodes and then
the next week it's as though you watch nothing it
just kind of goes in one ear and out the
other never to rebe remembered again in your life doesn't
change and what I want for you is I want
not just a change in your life I want to
help you make a transformation in your life and that's
possible but you have to stick around with me you
have to learn some of the frameworks and that will
take a while right my take is six twelve months
to really sort of soak this stuff in and start
to get on track so the newsletter is a really
great way to do that outside of course I have
a book list all those are great sources and I'm
working to release more free resources and also paid courses
in the future that will help you to do all
that so sign up and check it out and stay
tuned for more which I'll see you with real soon
you
