hey this is leo for actualized.org and in this episode
i'm going to give you a list of 40 signs
that you are neurotic and i'm going to help you
to develop a really deep understanding and give you a
definition a very rich definition of what neurosis is my
sister-in-law she once asked me leo what do you mean
by neurosis you use that word a lot neurosis but
what does it really mean and that's a good question
got me thinking actually got me doing some research because
i do use that word a lot and it's quickly
becoming one of my favorite words in personal development work
why because it goes straight to the heart of most
matters and most problems that people have in life neurosis
is the thing that makes you miserable in life it's
somewhat of a technical term comes from old school psychology
back in the sigmund freud era but there's uh so
many different angles that you can look at neurosis from
you should be very concerned about what neurosis is and
you should be very interested in studying this subject because
this is the thing that is making your life miserable
so here i'm going to give you a really rich
definition of neurosis you're going to get a really solid
understanding by the end of this episode of what it
is and how it works but let's just start off
right with the list the 40 signs that you are
neurotic here we go anxiety obsessive thoughts compulsive behavior vague
physical ailments such as chronic fatigue syndrome insomnia fibromyalgia or
anything along those lines depression suicidal thoughts anger or rage
social maladjustment for example if you're very very shy or
maladjusted socially in other ways a history of dysfunctional relationships
inability to work for whatever reason you know whatever story
your excuse you have for why you can't work and
go make a paycheck that's likely neurosis money problems that's
its own category for example you're wasting your money or
you don't have the ability to manage your money properly
or maybe the opposite maybe you're tight-fisted very thrifty with
your money like a scrooge type of person addictions of
all kinds there are so many addictions you could potentially
have virtually all of them are neurotically driven perfectionism if
you need everything done to the letter exactly how you
want it that's textbook neuroticism workaholism also an example of
this stress if you're stressed all the time lying if
you're a chronic and habitual liar that's neurotically driven restlessness
if you can't sit still if you're always agitated overeating
phobias of all kinds and paranoia being easily offended and
very touchy sensitive and defensive do you find yourself being
offended by people all the time or being offended by
politicians or being offended by religions or being offended by
violence or whatever else goes on in the world constant
criticism and blaming of other people constant criticism and blaming
especially of your family your spouse or your children this
is textbook neuroticism preaching and moralizing how much of that
do you do do you tell other people how to
live their lives especially maybe your children or your spouse
that's textbook neuroticism also arguing and stubbornness do you find
yourself in heated debates with people all the time either
at the dinner table or at work with co-workers or
in some discussion forum on the internet or some comment
section under a youtube video well that's all neurotically driven
narcissism neediness and codependence in relationships like needing love needing
compliments needing approval and validation needing people to like you
jealousy and envy are you constantly worried that your partner
or spouse is going to cheat on you or you're
envious of what your neighbor has what kind of car
he got or how much money he earns or maybe
your co-workers guilt and shame oh man this is a
huge one this is one of the biggest signs of
neurosis is when you're guilting yourself all the time about
keeping secrets do you have some big secrets that you
can't disclose to anybody like you got some skeletons in
your closet well that's classic neurosis also manipulation do you
like to scheme and manipulate people especially those close to
you like your girlfriend or your boyfriend or a co-worker
or a boss or a family member having enemies do
you have some enemies some people you really hate some
people you just despise that just make you seed with
with hatred uh that's neurosis that's not normal playing victim
do you feel like a victim in life like you
just can't do it you can't lose the weight you
can't quit your drinking problem you can't get a raise
you can't improve your situation you can't move to a
new city because you have all these reasons and excuses
for why you can't that's neurosis a stiff rigid body
do you find your muscles and your body always stiff
to the point where you have muscle aches and pains
and maybe back pain that kind of stuff are you
finding yourself inflexible like you can't bend down and touch
your toes it's often caused by neurosis sexual dysfunctions of
all kinds are caused by neurosis also sexual repression are
you sexually repressed are you uncomfortable with seeing yourself naked
are you uncomfortable with other people seeing you naked are
you uncomfortable with your sexuality all of that and more
is all neurosis are you vindictive do you like to
get back at people do you like to plot against
people when they've done you wrong that's neurotic also nihilism
are you a nihilistic person like do you believe that
life is pointless and meaningless and everything is is just
is pointless because we're all gonna die anyways that's neurotic
alcohol and drug addictions of course neurotic gossiping is neurotic
having no sense of humor this is a good one
i like this one most people don't think about this
but you know those people that are very anal that
take everything too seriously they take themselves too serious take
life too seriously these are classic neurotic people and lastly
are you obsessed with your physical appearance are you checking
yourself out in the mirror all the time are you
worried about how you don't have hair or you don't
have the kind of nose you want or the face
you want or you're at the right weight level or
whatever you're always worried about how you look that's neurotic
any of those sound familiar ring some bells well they
should because you are neurotic i guarantee you that you
are so that was the list now what i want
to do is i want to start moving into talking
about actually what neurosis is what's causing all this what's
at the center of all this and i started doing
some research and i ran across some work by alexander
lowen who's a really brilliant psychologist and he's a he's
a doctor and he's done a lot of work in
the field of psychotherapy and he has some really interesting
theories some really deep i was shocked by his uh
in-depth discussions very insightful discussions very eye-opening discussions of what
neurosis is so what i'm going to do is i
want to read you actually a couple of uh really
juicy excerpts from some of his books so here we
go quote he says the neurotic individual is in conflict
with himself part of his being is trying to overcome
another part his ego is trying to master his body
his rational mind to control his feelings his will to
overcome his fears and anxieties though this conflict is largely
unconscious its effect is to deplete the person's energy and
destroy his peace of mind neurosis is internal conflict the
neurotic character takes many forms but all of them involve
a struggle in the individual between what he is and
what he believes he should be every neurotic individual is
caught in this struggle end quote sound familiar good let's
keep going i have another excerpt from him which is
real juicy he says quote unable to face his pain
and the anger to which it gives rise the neurotic
individual strives to overcome his fears anxieties hostilities and anger
one part of him seeks to rise above another which
splits the unity of his being and destroys his integrity
the neurotic person struggles to win over himself in this
of course he must fail failure seems to mean submission
to an unacceptable fate but actually it amounts to self-acceptance
which makes change possible to the degree that most people
in western culture are struggling to be different they are
neurotic and since this is a fight one can't win
all who engage in the struggle will fail strangely though
through acceptance of this failure we become free of our
neurosis end quote sound familiar good let me give you
one final snippet which is real juicy listen to this
i love this quote neurosis is not usually defined as
fear of life but that is what it is the
neurotic person is afraid to open his heart to love
afraid to reach out or strike out afraid to be
fully himself more life or feeling than one is accustomed
to is frightening to the person because it threatens to
overwhelm his ego to flood his boundaries and to undermine
his identity end quote oh man that last sentence is
so important threatens to undermine your ego to flood your
boundaries and to undermine your identity that's what living a
full life entails and that's the thing that you're always
trying to resist because that's kind of the ego's job
so that was alexander lowen now what i want to
do is i want to take this understanding of neurosis
that we're developing and just kind of go deeper with
it and give you a even richer definition by citing
some other sources and then just giving you some of
my perspectives on this we're going to take a look
at neurosis from multiple perspectives so that you can kind
of see the intersection of all these different perspectives it's
quite powerful wikipedia has a really nice quote that i
liked and it said this it defined neurosis as follows
a distorted way of looking at the world and at
oneself which is determined by compulsive needs rather than a
genuine interest in the world as it is an interest
in the world as it is not as you need
it to be really important how many times do i
tell people that you got to be detached in an
intimate relationship and then when someone hears about that of
course what they retort with the objection they have is
they say but leo if i don't need to be
in a relationship why would i even be in a
relationship at all and that right there is just the
epitome of neurosis right because the assumption there is that
if you don't need something then you can't have it
in your life or it shouldn't be in your life
or you wouldn't want it in your life it's like
your whole life is run by needs and not by
wants which is really twisted it's like you've been so
neurotic for so long that you don't even know any
other way of being kind of screwed up don't you
think and that doesn't just apply to intimate relationships it
applies to all sorts of things in your life another
definition of neurosis i really like is from brad blanton
he's a psychologist and therapist and he defines it this
way quote it is essentially a refusal to accept what
is happening in the present a neurotic is a person
who incessantly demands that life be other than what it
is end quote that's a really good one fundamentally it's
just a denial of reality is what neurosis is it's
an excessive demand that things should be different than what
they actually are reality should be this way or it
should be that way or she should do this or
he should do that or i should earn more money
or i shouldn't be sick or my kids should be
smarter or they should get good grades or something else
in my life should be this way or my shoes
shouldn't be dirty or the dog shouldn't be making a
mess in the in the house right all of these
shoulds everything should be this way you know taxes should
be low and government should give me all these benefits
and my boss should respect me and people should like
me and i should be financially secure and my retirement
should be guaranteed and my health care should be provided
for and my children shouldn't be endangered and on and
on and on this list goes this list applies not
only to reality but also to yourself and in fact
this is the biggest crime you commit right here is
not just a denial of reality but a denial of
yourself self-denial denying who you actually are and trying to
be something else than what you are this is called
a self-acceptance rate it's a lack of self-acceptance the neurotic
person does not accept himself this is completely unacceptable it's
unacceptable to accept stuff this means disowning parts of himself
vilifying parts of himself like parts of him are evil
like lying is evil and cheating is evil and being
mean to people as evil and this and this and
that notice that for the neurotic not only are there
certain positive ideals that should be in place but there's
also a strong resistance and vilification of the negative ideals
it is a problem when you have negative ideals in
a sense like when you tell yourself that lying is
evil and you know murder is is evil it's the
most horrific thing leo how could you even how can
you even consider the idea that murder is not evil
is this kind of attitude it's this kind of rigidity
that this person takes on because see this rigidity that
you have it's a way of being it applies in
very subtle levels on how you treat yourself how you
think of yourself and how you treat other human beings
and how you treat situations you might get into a
grocery store and there's a long line at the grocery
store and you tell yourself well this is stupid why
is there 20 people in this line why don't they
have more of the lines open and so you get
into this kind of fuming rage about how the line
should not be this long in yada yada yada yada
you have all sorts of laws and rules that you've
created and now you act like the rule keeper making
sure that everyone abides by these rules and of course
you tell yourself belia no no you don't understand this
is necessary i need to tell my kids that they
need to clean their room they have to clean their
room and they can't lie leo they can't be liars
and my daughter she can't be a [ __ ]
you want my daughter to be a [ __ ]
leah what are you crazy these things are like rigid
rules these are these have been set by god these
have been set by societies have been set by parents
all these demands what happened was that when you were
growing up you picked up all these demands and all
these rules and all these laws largely unconsciously without you
being even aware of it you didn't even know you
had an option you just absorbed all these like a
sponge because you didn't know any better and now you
try to live by them and especially if you've uh
been religiously religiously raised or educated you have a really
big problem with this because you've been moralized to your
whole life by the church and by your parents but
see the thing they didn't tell you is that this
takes away your freedom and that this makes you neurotic
highly highly neurotic and actually highly immoral and highly irreligious
this is the exact opposite of what religion is meant
to make you but you know in uh in our
society the way religion is twisted in on itself it
produces the exact opposite effects of its intended original meaning
you know i don't know about jesus i don't know
who he was when he was what he was or
if he even existed but i can guarantee you this
if he was enlightened which uh all evidence suggests then
he was anti-neurotic he didn't have any rules by which
he lived his life you understand this this is really
hard for religious people to understand enlightened people are completely
free they have no rules by which they live their
life now see the moral person what he says well
he says but leo if he didn't have any rules
how come he didn't just go out and kill babies
as if that's what you need to not kill babies
is you need rules handed down to you from the
church see that um that's the lowest level of morality
that exists that kind of morality the highest levels of
morality have no rules no principles no laws no commandments
and no one's going to punish you they're all intrinsic
they come from the inside from understanding what reality is
from being conscious from being aware see a conscious a
highly conscious individual does not need a bunch of rules
they know how to behave they don't need to discipline
themselves really harshly they know how to behave simply through
sufficient awareness now the people who are lazy and don't
build up sufficient awareness and they have low consciousness what
they need is they need a bunch of rules but
see these rules are so rigid that they inevitably backfire
on you and uh one bitter pill that you're gonna
have to swallow if you've been living this kind of
very rigid lifestyle is that man if you want to
advance forward and you want to really develop yourself to
high levels and you really want to develop your morality
and your ethics and you want to become a really
good decent human being then you need to start abandoning
all those rules which leads me to the next point
a neurotic one way to look at a neurotic is
someone who clings to beliefs and to identity fundamentally why
is an erotic neurotic because he's cling to beliefs and
he finds safety and security there and he's really afraid
to abandon those and to live life freely because he
thinks leo if i just abandon everything if i have
no principles or anchors to guide me then i'm just
going to be a devil how am i going to
live this freedom is going to destroy me that's the
neurotic sphere and so instead what he does he becomes
a ideological fundamentalist and he has a certain dogma that
he advocates that he preaches to everybody else he needs
everybody to believe in his dogma to not question his
own dogma too much because it's important it's the truth
this is how it is there are no alternatives why
does he tell himself that and others he tells others
that as well he has to because this is the
only thing that like anchors him if he loses that
then he's completely lost because he hasn't developed the ability
to actually utilize freedom responsibly and consciously a neurotic is
also very often lost in monkey mind arguing in his
own mind with what is and how things ought to
be other than what they actually are do you have
that think about it how much time during the day
do you devote to having internal dialogues and arguments about
how the children shouldn't be this way and the husband
shouldn't be that way and my my boss shouldn't be
this way and the school officials the professor he shouldn't
have done this and and then also you apply to
yourself too it's like well i shouldn't have i shouldn't
have gone partied and drinking on friday night you know
that was so stupid of me and i shouldn't have
uh you know i shouldn't have uh not prepare for
that test you know i should have prepared for that
test i wasn't i wasn't uh responsible enough i didn't
prepare for that test and i shouldn't have eaten that
dinner yesterday that was a terrible unhealthy dinner now i
feel so bad about eating that these kind of arguments
this is the epitome of neurosis when you're having these
in your mind and think about just how many of
those you have on a regular basis that right there
is just sapping all the happiness and joy out of
your life if it continues long enough over years and
decades it either turns you into a perpetual victim who
can't get anything out in life or somebody who's just
very angry and bitter at the whole world or someone
who's so depressed that they want to shoot themselves another
way to look at neurosis is emotional avoidance again fundamentally
what you're doing and the reason you're becoming neurotic is
because you're avoiding emotions why would you avoid emotions well
because emotions are hard to predict you can't codify rules
of emotions emotions just come there's a loss of control
with emotions both the good emotions and the bad emotions
so a neurotic person becomes this anal retentive puritanical person
like the puritan can't have fun has a stick up
his ass doesn't feel very high doesn't feel very low
tries to avoid all emotions his heart is encased in
a three foot block of concrete and so he doesn't
really love he doesn't really fear fear or sadness or
any of these things he tries to protect himself from
all that and this is fundamentally as alexander lone said
quote a fear of life you fear really living life
is an emotional game it's not a logical game it's
not an ideological game it's not a rational game it's
an irrational emotional game and boy a lot of you
rationalists out there who fancy yourselves very logical and scientific
minded this is your greatest weakness right here is that
in your logic and your rationality you avoid emotions and
you put logic above emotions when in fact logic is
way down the list what really runs your life are
emotions but from the neurotic person what he tries to
do is he tries to control emotions with logic in
the same way that you take a horse and then
you strap it into uh into all its gears and
rigging and you strap it to a carriage and now
you think that you've got the horse under control except
of course this horse never gets tame this is a
wild horse and so it drives you crazy your whole
life you're trying to control this horse and it never
goes wherever you want it to go because this was
a wild horse that you've tried to just uh enslave
and it doesn't work and drives you crazy drives a
horse crazy but see this is all going on inside
you so you're internally conflicted you're always in battle with
yourself except what's real bad is that you probably don't
even recognize this is happening this is an unconscious conflict
that's what's going on here largely unconscious conflict and you
don't know why you hate life or why you're miserable
why you're frustrated or why you keep failing to get
into good relationships or why you keep failing in business
or why you keep failing to lose weight and all
this kind of stuff why you failed to find the
right man or to find the right woman for you
well because you have these very deep structural unconscious conflicts
and because you're so rigid with your belief system there's
no possibility for there to be an opening for light
to shine in there and it just festers and gets
worse and worse and worse quite tragic quite tragic that's
why raising your awareness is one of the most important
things you can do if you want to self-actualize and
grow as a human being there are no highly developed
human beings who have low awareness it's not possible another
way to think about neurosis is self-sabotage are you frustrated
with your self-sabotaging behavior maybe you're an artist and you
self-sabotage your work or maybe you get into relationships or
marriages and you sabotage those and it's consistent like there's
a pattern of it and what's really scary is that
you can see the pattern happening it even becomes conscious
you see the self-sabotage happening maybe with food you keep
getting on diets but then you keep self-sabotaging you keep
seeing this and you can't stop it you don't know
how to stop it because you're looking at the surface
of things you're not going down to the very roots
of your neuroses and so you might start one business
and fail and go into bankruptcy then you start a
next business the next business the next business and you
think that well what don't i understand about business but
see it's probably not a business problem it's a problem
that's much deeper in your psyche it's a much more
fundamental problem probably you're not accepting reality you're not accepting
yourself and so on and so forth and you get
caught in these kind of vicious cycles of flailing around
you flail around in your relationship and then you flail
around some more in another one and another one and
you just kind of flail around you think something's going
to happen something's going to improve but the more action
you take the more you self-sabotage so action isn't the
solution for you you need to shine awareness into the
problem rather than just blindly take action and this is
where a lot of neurotic people go wrong and here's
another perspective at which to look at and define neurosis
neurosis can be seen as forced action the neurotic person
thinks he can use his will to brute force his
way into the solution without understanding the deeper issues involved
he thinks that he can just use harsh self-discipline to
accomplish the job and to live life so anytime that
you're not getting the results you want as a neurotic
what you do is you say okay i'm buckling down
even more i'm going to apply even more willpower this
time this time i really mean it and if i
don't carry it through i'm gonna i'm really gonna stick
it to myself and so you develop this kind of
self-flagellating very harsh self-discipline and this creates uh a rift
inside of you you break integrity with yourself because you
develop this pattern of not being able to actually trust
yourself when you create a goal or you have a
vision for something you want to accomplish in in your
life you know you've got a history where you do
not accomplish goals unless you beat yourself to death with
fear and with guilt and so you try to use
this negative motivation to to get to high places in
life and it doesn't work it can work to some
degree but it only gets you so far it doesn't
get you to the really good stuff in life you
can't really self-actualize using that kind of approach so action
isn't always the solution sometimes requires turning inward that's why
you self-sabotage that's why you can't change your patterns is
because you're trying to turn outward for outward solutions all
the time well you know what the deepest solutions are
inside you and you don't know how to turn inside
leo how do i turn inside what does that really
mean well that's why you're neurotic that's why you're [
__ ] up because you don't know how and that
requires some real deep study that's not something i can
just explain to you in five minutes i've shot over
100 hours of video on these topics and i still
feel like i've just started scratching the surface this requires
a real commitment to wanting to understand yourself to find
your authentic self to love yourself see the fundamental problem
with this harsh self-discipline approach is that you're really you're
not accepting yourself you're not loving yourself you're not being
kind or compassionate to yourself and then of course you
can't be kind or compassionate or loving to other people
if you can't be that way towards yourself so that's
another perspective for you right there and finally to kind
of sum up this definition two really easy ways to
think about neurosis when i say neurosis that i call
someone neurotic usually i just mean it as dysfunctional neurotic
and dysfunctional i use quite synonymously although there are some
differences but that's a good nutshell way to put it
and then perhaps my favorite nutshell for what neurosis is
is ass backwards it's living life ass backwards that's what
you're doing rather than turning inward you turn outward rather
than accepting you're rejecting rather than surrendering you're always fighting
see the the most unacceptable thing to the neurotic is
to actually surrender to surrender to truth to surrender to
reality surrender to what is he can't accept that that's
unacceptable to him it needs to be otherwise and there's
always of course good stories for why it needs to
be otherwise and why leo i can't believe you and
leo i can't do what you're saying because if i
did then xyz would happen in my life there's a
lot of real good stories and lies in your mind
about why why this is but those are the things
that need to be really inspected with your awareness to
get clarity and truth around it so does all this
sound familiar ringing some bells i hope so because you
are neurotic you are neurotic you might wonder at this
point well what's the opposite of neurosis what's the alternative
is everything neurotic is everyone neurotic no not everyone a
lot of people are but not everyone and it's not
the only way to live life there are alternatives what's
the opposite of neurosis well i'm glad you asked it's
peace of mind that's it peace of mind and what
is peace of mind peace of mind is being happy
with exactly what is not what you want not what
you think should should be but what is now this
might sound kind of funny even contradictory coming from me
because you're probably thinking like well leo what do you
mean what is what happened to self-actualization and growing yourself
and becoming this ideal person and all this you want
to be careful about that you got to be careful
about that and i've been guilty of that myself is
approaching self-actualization with a neurotic frame of mind like there's
some ideal you got to get to this is one
of the paradoxes of personal development is that at the
same time you have to accept yourself exactly as you
are and reality exactly as it is and then also
you gotta be committed to growing and improving and getting
more authentic but not in a neurotic way it can
be difficult to to swallow that hard to reconcile that
takes a while it takes a lot of study to
start to get your mind around that little brain twister
right there but let's get back to peace of mind
i don't want to get too far off track here
what you really crave secretly crave from life is you
crave peace of mind if only your mind could be
still and just give you some peace you could just
ah just relax and enjoy your life a little bit
for a few seconds that's what you really want except
see your neurotic mind is going about it all backwards
because to actually get peace of mind you have to
do a 180 your strategy has to change completely this
is a very counterintuitive thing the reason people don't have
peace of mind and happiness is because it's extremely counterintuitive
it's not what you would typically think you'd need to
do to get it most people turn outward and that
doesn't work so how do you get it the most
direct way is enlightenment check out my enlightenment videos spiritual
enlightenment i got some great videos on that topic it's
an advanced topic but it's the most direct way to
get there and the second most direct way is self-actualization
work what does self-actualization work everything on this website everything
on my youtube channel over 100 hours of content on
how to do self actualization all of the stuff in
my videos if you follow it generally speaking it will
make you less and less neurotic over time it will
make you more accepting of reality and yourself as you
are in an ironic way because you know in a
lot of videos i tell you to change and be
this way and don't be that way and it seems
like kind of like i'm telling you not to accept
yourself because usually i'm stressing um this component of taking
action you know but there's also a component of self-acceptance
so that's kind of what i'm stressing now and this
is going to be weird for you you're not going
to want to accept both these things at the same
time you have to you have to though if you
want to really grow make no mistake that if you're
not enlightened then you are neurotic there's no way you
can not be enlightened and not be neurotic because without
enlightenment you fundamentally misunderstand what reality is and so quite
simply you can't align yourself with reality when you don't
understand what reality is you also can't align yourself with
your authentic self when you don't understand who you authentically
are really like absolutely existentially this issue goes very deep
and i don't have enough time to cover all the
existential issues here right now so um go check out
some of my other videos for more depth on this
so uh yeah you are neurotic the only question is
to what degree are you neurotic some of you are
neurotic to extraordinary degrees to the point where no one
can even be in a relationship with you or to
the point where you can't even take care of yourself
you can't even feed yourself can't even wake up in
the morning get out of bed on time some of
you like that some of you are generally successful and
pretty good and maybe you even earned six figures and
so forth um but you're still quite goddamn neurotic which
is why you're not fulfilled with your six figures and
your seven figures and whatever however many figures you make
and however many houses you have and how many you
know girlfriends you have and all this it doesn't really
make a difference because you still got those neuroses in
there that you got to go take care of so
what do we do about all this what's the action
step well hold up there with the action this is
more about consciousness it's more about awareness so what i
propose here is that you make some commitments right now
say the following words that i'm going to say do
it with me i want you to commit to some
of the stuff you've heard about here if you feel
like you're tired of being neurotic and you want to
change this then here's a good way to do it
make the following commitments which i want to help you
to make i'm going to say them first then you
repeat after me there's going to be about five or
seven lines that i want you to repeat this is
going to be good for your mind drill it right
in there all right so first thing i want you
to say is the following i am neurotic repeat after
me go i am neurotic good say it like you
mean like you really realize like you learned something about
yourself here hope you have now the next one i'm
gonna say it then you're gonna say it i commit
to discovering the roots of my neuroses go good now
the next one i commit to aligning with empirical reality
go good now the next one i commit to dropping

final assignment pull out a piece of paper take out
a pen and i want you right now after this
episode is over to sit down quietly and to think
about and write down your top five neuroses what are
your top five neurotic behaviors make a list one through
five and once you've got that list then what you
do is you ask yourself what's the rock bottom root
cause that's motivating this behavior what's the rock bottom root
cause that's motivating this behavior don't be satisfied with a
surface level explanation it's not just because you want someone
to marry or you want more money in your bank
account that's not a good enough reason go deeper what
about you do you have to believe what about reality
do you have to believe that's motivating you to be
neurotic here dig deep all right get awareness over these
