            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/vQpCvRQbLV4' target='_blank'>How to Make Your Life Extraordinary - Actualized.org</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Living for something greater than oneself</b>: Leo addresses the emotional response in movies like Braveheart and Troy when characters fight for a cause larger than themselves. He emphasizes that these emotions are stirred up when we realize we may not be living to our fullest potential.
</li><li><b>Understanding the brevity of life</b>: Leo shares that life is short and the importance of making the most of it through living with excitement, engagement, and fulfillment. He mentions his struggle with determining his purpose and persistently staying on track. 
</li><li><b>Embracing challenges to achieve a noble vision</b>: He recalls the pride that comes from realizing a big vision after overcoming struggles and developing oneself, which ultimately leads to a sense of fulfillment that can have a positive impact on others.
</li><li><b>Personal journey and struggle with purpose</b>: Leo describes his immigration from Russia to the United States and its impact on his life. He speaks about his early ambition to become a game designer, the challenges he faced when he felt inadequate in his first design job, and his shift to starting his own business in internet marketing. Additionally, he discusses his loss of passion and eventual turn towards personal development to figure out his purpose.
</li><li><b>Fulfillment through personal development</b>: He shares his journey through personal development, studying success, attending seminars, and reading books to find fulfillment. He faced doubts about finding a new purpose after discarding his original one, but was determined to find it.
</li><li><b>Importance of a compelling vision</b>: Leo emphasizes the power of a compelling vision and the importance of having a purpose or mission in life that is bigger than oneself. This is, he believes, key to living consistently with purpose and staying engaged.
</li><li><b>Struggling with consistency and mediocrity</b>: Describing personal struggles with inconsistency, Leo acknowledges that being able to maintain focus and stay on track with one's purpose can be difficult. Despite this, he warns against settling for a comfortable but mediocre life.
</li><li><b>The pursuit of a higher purpose in life</b>: Leo encourages individuals to not settle for being comfortable and mediocre, but instead, strive for greater fulfillment and excitement by pursuing a higher purpose. According to him, this is what breeds true satisfaction and excitement in life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Seeing Oneself as a Creator</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to see oneself as a creator. This doesn't necessarily mean being artistic or creative, but rather having a vision for what one wants to manifest in the world. This could take form in various ways, including creating art, designing games, engineering products, starting a business, or contributing knowledge and expertise to help others.
</li><li><b>Challenging the Mediocre Life</b>: Many people settle for a comfortable but mediocre life, missing out on the excitement and fulfillment that comes from pursuing a higher purpose. Achieving the conventional milestones of life can lead to a baseline satisfaction but not real excitement. It is possible to find and develop this drive.
</li><li><b>Misconception about Creators</b>: It is a misconception that creators and achievers are inherently different from ordinary individuals. This is not true, as anyone can become an achiever or creator by going beyond their comfort zone and engaging with their vision.
</li><li><b>Unleashing Full Potential</b>: Through Actualized.org, Leo wants to help individuals unleash their full potential. He has spent years studying success psychology, human development, peak performance, business, and marketing to create a model for designing an exciting life. It doesn't involve focusing on just one aspect of life, but getting all areas in place, including career, relationships, health, time, and finances.
</li><li><b>Contributing to the World</b>: Leo encourages individuals to be creators and contribute something meaningful to the world. This is not some selfless philosophy but a way to feel good, engaged, and happy. The best way to achieve financial abundance is not through get-rich-quick schemes, but by creating and contributing.
</li><li><b>Leveraging Available Resources</b>: There's an abundance of resources available to learn various skills. The challenge is that most people do not use these resources because they lack the motivation or a big picture understanding of their life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Inner Game and Emotional Mastery</b>: Understanding inner psychology and achieving emotional mastery are fundamental to happiness and success. External rewards do not guarantee happiness. A deep understanding of oneself, what drives them, and awareness of one's unique qualities are crucial. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion</b>: Leo urges listeners to challenge mediocrity, become creators, leverage available resources for self-development, and work on their emotional mastery for a fulfilled life. He advocates for an understanding of the bigger picture, being independent thinkers, and focusing on inner growth. Creating value and contributing to the world are emphasized as means to both personal fulfillment and financial success.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing unique traits</b>: Leo encourages individuals to leverage and promote their unique capabilities, talents and interests, contributing to various aspects of their lives that they find meaningful. He stresses the importance of having a purpose or cause in life that you're willing to sacrifice for, as having a purpose stimulates engagement and dedication.
</li><li><b>From cog to creator</b>: There's a societal shift from conforming and fitting into societal norms to taking up a more creative role and utilizing one's unique talents and perspectives. Unlike in the past where being a factory worker was the norm, Leo notes that the future belongs to those who create and contribute something unique to the world.
</li><li><b>Compensation for creativity</b>: Taking up creative roles not only results in personal fulfillment but can also bring about financial rewards. Leo notes that creating a business out of one's unique talents and passions is not only a path to financial fortune but is a more fulfilling venture.
</li><li><b>Alignment of interests and society needs</b>: Leo urges individuals to find something they are passionate about doing, which is also needed by the world, and channel their energies towards achieving it. 
</li><li><b>Seeing through the lens of successful people</b>: Leo dispels the myth that successful people have it easy and did not struggle to where they are. He affirms that everyone faces challenges in their journey to success and implies that the setbacks faced should not deter people from their quest for success.
</li><li><b>Utilization of resources</b>: Leo encourages his audience to take advantage of the resources he offers in terms of achieving success. These resources include videos, articles, and a free newsletter that offers invaluable content on success and human psychology.
</li><li><b>Engagement with Leo</b>: Leo invites individuals to contribute to the website and the Youtube channel, share their challenges and successes, ask questions, suggest topics for future videos and articles, and ask for specific products and services that would help them on their life journey.
</li><li><b>The goal is results</b>: Leo emphasizes his commitment to delivering practical results rather than theorizing about success. He expresses his desire to create a database of resources that will help individuals achieve their life goals.
