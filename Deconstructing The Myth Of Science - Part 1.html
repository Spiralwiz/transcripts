[Music] all right here we go are you ready are
you ready are you ready to deconstruct the greatest illusion
spun by the mind of man science deconstructing the myth
of science part one this is a four-part series on
the epistemic and metaphysical foundations of science the limits of
science and how to take science beyond science this is
serious stuff here this is why i do the work
that i do this is what i'm most passionate about
in my work i have been contemplating the nature of
science for 15 years for well over a thousand hours
reading researching contemplating investigating thinking very deeply and independently about
this issue because this is such a central issue because
science grounds our entire sense of reality now before we
really start to get into this because there's so much
material to cover here let's set it up give me
some give me some time to to set this up
because this is such a thorny domain filled with so
many traps and landmines so here's a list of warnings
to get us going warning number one this is very
advanced material this is very serious material if you're just
screwing around online looking at videos and you know just
doing sort of fluffy type of self-help stuff this is
not for you this is for people who really really
care about understanding reality at the deepest levels possible so
just keep that in mind that means when i say
something is advanced what that means is is that you
have to be very careful with how you use your
mind to to interpret everything that i say because your
mind is going to want to misunderstand the things that
i say and the reason that is is because this
stuff is very threatening if you understand the points that
i will be making over the next four episodes in
this series this will deeply threaten your entire sense of
self and reality it could even make you mentally unstable
because science is not just some stuff that some guy
does in a white lab coat in a laboratory somewhere
that doesn't affect your personal life it's way deeper than
that your entire identity is wrapped up with the world
view of science so your mind is going to have
an entire host of sneaky defense mechanisms for getting you
to stop from deeply questioning science because if you question
it deeply enough i'm telling you you're going to feel
like you're losing your mind this is serious stuff if
you really understand the things that i'm going to be
telling you here you're going to have an existential crisis
if you're a professional scientist or an academic this will
this will cause an existential crisis for you you might
have to rethink your entire career and what you're doing
and of course you don't want to do that that's
highly inconvenient for you especially if your career puts bread
on the table and you've invested decades into it you've
got a lot to lose so just watch out watch
out for how sneaky your mind is about this information
i have to p preempt i've spent hours thinking about
just how to preempt all of the tricks that your
mind is going to employ to prevent you from listening
to this information of course since this is advanced material
it requires extreme open-mindedness i'm asking of you a level
of open-mindedness which is unseen anywhere else in society because
you're gonna your mind is gonna shut this material down
really fast so it's on you did you learn the
lessons of radical open mindedness that i've taught in the
past many times this is the real test of your
open mindedness right here of course also i should warn
that nothing i say here should be taken on faith
or as belief i'm going to be sharing many points
and insights with you these insights are valid not because
i tell you they are and not because of my
credentials or my reputation or my subscriber count or anything
like that the only validity these insights have is if
you're able to validate them for yourself through contemplation uh
through your own direct experiences and experiments and and very
careful careful attention to detail this is not a religion
that i'm teaching here it is not an ideology of
any kind now another note i should make is that
while we're going to be talking about science we're going
to be talking about it from the perspective of the
sun of the limits of science which means i'm not
going to be mentioning many of the good parts of
science there are many many good parts to science of
course obviously this is so obvious it shouldn't even be
said but yet it needs to be said because people
will misunderstand me so there are many good parts to
science but i won't be focusing on them because frankly
they're quite obvious i already expect that you understand that
and also because they're overemphasized throughout your entire educational career
if you went to university or even just in high
school the good parts of science are overemphasized no it's
it's important to promote science in the public and so
forth there's value in that but uh what we're interested
in here is going beyond we're interested in taking science
to the next level which means that we got to
focus on its limitations all right so this presentation over
the next four episodes it might seem very negative in
a certain sense it might seem very anti-science it's not
really anti-science it's just that we're focusing on the limits
you see and we have limited time and even though
it's going to take us about eight or ten hours
to get through all of this content that i have
prepared uh you might think that's a lot of time
it's not a lot of time please understand the significance
of what we're talking about here like i said i
spent 15 years and thousands of hours contemplating this material
and it's still difficult it's still tricky i still don't
have all the answers uh so don't expect me to
be able to communicate all of this to you in
all of its subtlety and nuance within 15 minutes it's
just not possible what you're asking for is impossible so
you have to be patient if you can understand the
things that i teach you even in a chunk of
10 hours that would already be incredible because most scientists
most professional academics and scientists with phds in top universities
will not understand this material even in 40 years so
just keep in mind the value that is being offered
to you here don't take it for granted don't be
an ingrate be serious when it comes to serious things
know when to be serious and then know when to
have fun this is not a time to have fun
this is the time to get serious now of course
everything i say here will be perceived as an attack
on science obviously because science has invented necessarily very clever
defense mechanisms to preserve its authority and science is a
very huge source of authority in our society and culture
but of course see sometimes people misunderstand when i criticize
science or talk about the limits of science or try
to deconstruct science they interpret this as though i hate
science leo you hate science why do you hate science
so much i don't hate science in fact i love
science i've studied and been interested in science since probably
middle school i was very serious into academic science i
read about it on my own not to mention in
school i took advanced classes in physics in chemistry in
biology in psychology i've studied the philosophy of science i've
studied advanced mathematics and calculus i took two years of
advanced mathematics so uh and i got good grades in
all those classes so like i'm really interested in science
i love science uh it's actually the opposite of what
you think it's not that i hate science it's that
i love science so much that i want the most
purest form of science possible and what i saw as
i was studying science in my youth what i realized
after a certain period of time is that science itself
is full of corruption and foundational epistemic mistakes that go
denied and swept under the rug and my opposition to
science became not that i want to do away with
science but that rather i want to clean science up
i want to reform science i'm not anti-science i'm anti-dogma
and so there's a heretic problem here you know we
know the heretic problem in the church in the church
the church likes to excommunicate and condemn and even sometimes
kill heretics you know historically not today but historically and
what were the heretics who were they the heretics were
those people who criticized the church because they found inconsistencies
contradictions limits within the church's teachings well what you need
to understand is that the heretic problem this is not
a problem merely confined to religion it's a broader problem
the heretic problem exists in any human institution that has
a lot of power and authority that is criticized every
institution has various degrees of corruption with it within it
whether it's the the military the government a political party
or a corporation uh or science or religion uh all
these institutions have their various degrees of corruption and when
somebody stands up from within the institution who actually loves
the institution and wants to see the institution cleaned up
so it's not so corrupt they get called a heretic
and they get excommunicated it's a defense mechanism you see
and you better believe that science has this problem too
as some as soon as somebody levels a serious foundational
critique against science they're immediately excommunicated from the academic domain
such that their ideas can be easily discredited and just
dismissed and not taken seriously and that's of course exactly
what's going to happen with all the stuff that i
say here which is how science maintains its corrupt state
and we'll be talking about all the corruptions in science
and making it very clear now also i want to
warn that hang in there there's a lot of content
here you're going to have questions and objections to the
things that i say just keep in mind that there's
four parts so many of the questions you have will
be answered answered in future episodes uh not necessarily in
this one alone and in fact part four of this
series i'm dedicating exclusively to objections and criticisms that i
will be addressing so i'm not playing any sleight of
hand here i'm not being evasive if there's some question
you have understand that the reason i didn't answer it
probably is simply because there wasn't enough time to put
it into a single episode right and in fact i
welcome your objections and critiques post any kind of objections
or critiques you have in the comments section down below
under the first three episodes of this series i will
collect them all and try to answer the best ones
that i can um you know time permitting in episode
four okay so let's begin by making the first distinction
here that's important which is that science can be criticized
from below or from above please make this distinction this
will help you to clear up a lot of confusion
there's an unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in culturally
and remember science is a part of culture with culture
inextricable from culture despite maybe what you have been led
to believe so culturally we tend to see science as
the opposite of religion and so either your pro science
or your pro-religion and those are your only two choices
all right this is very unfortunate this is a very
um unnuanced uh way to think about this issue which
gets us into a lot of trouble so there's criticism
of science from below and from above criticism science from
below would be something like the critiques of creationism or
religious fundamentalists or right-wingers a lot of times make these
critiques so they will for example a creationist will create
critique you know evolutionary theory and aspects of science that
that they don't like because the creation has a creationist
has a certain world view that they're indoctrinated into and
they need to defend that worldview and so they really
don't have an option they need to attack science because
science contradicts their worldview you know science says that the
earth is four billion years old or something like that
and uh creationists might believe that it's only five thousand
years old and then you know that's that's a that's
a big contradiction so you gotta you gotta wage a
battle there um and so but the problem here is
that see the creationist is attacking signs from below in
the sense that he's doing it from a position of
reaction of emotional attachment to his ideology of self bias
he's coming from a place of a lot of time
of ignorance simply ignorant of the facts or how science
is done doesn't know sufficient science to actually make a
powerful critique and so his critique of course obviously is
is ridiculed by people who understand science and who are
at a level of cognitive development that's a little bit
higher than that of the creationist and you know many
right-wingers they will criticize science because science contradicts many right-wing
ideological positions for example on climate change and on environmental
issues on maybe homosexuality or other forms of gender identity
or whatever you know science contradicts some of the old
conservative traditional worldviews and many things that were written in
the bible or in the quran maybe 2000 years ago
that gets contradicted and so it's obvious it's obvious to
those who are who are really passionate about truth and
about science that these are critiques from below but there's
also critiques from above and this is a possibility that
many scientifically minded people rationally minded people and atheistically minded
people don't take seriously i want you to open yourself
up to this possibility that science can be critiqued from
above that doesn't mean that we're critiquing science in order
to take us back to the medieval times and to
believe in dogma and nonsense no we can accept many
of the discoveries and methods of science but then we
also find that it's not perfect there are aspects of
reality which science is unable to wrap itself around and
we need new methods and we need to evaluate the
methods of signs and to really wonder whether they're going
to be sufficient up to the task or not these
are critiques of science which are post-rational the post-rational stages
of cognitive development if you watched my series on spiral
dynamics and my series on the nine stages of ego
development the susan k greuter model so basically critiques of
science coming from above are coming from stages of cognitive
development yellow and turquoise on spiral dynamics and the construct
aware and the unitive stage on the susan k greuter
model don't worry if you don't understand what all this
language means but for those of you who do i'm
just pointing this out so you kind of understand what
it means to critique signs from above basically a critique
of science from above comes from a level of cognitive
development that is beyond the rational and yes there is
something beyond the rational that doesn't make it irrational it
makes it rational plus it transcends the rational but includes
the rational this is what ken wilbur refers to oftentimes
as the pre-rational post-rational fallacy or the pre-trans fallacy this
is when scientifically-minded people reject critiques of rationality and science
because they're afraid that it's coming from below not from
above they don't make this distinction they confuse these two
and they think that all any critique of science just
wants to take us back to the medieval times or
into some sort of ideological belief in god no open
your mind to a to a higher possibility now you
might wonder leah why would anybody want to deconstruct science
i mean science gives us good stuff technology so like
leo you're sitting here and you're shooting this video uh
you know using cameras and computers uploading it to the
internet and all of this using fiber optics and uh
microchips and all this kind of stuff and this is
all science so aren't you being hypocritical here well of
course i'm using science but i'm also not arguing that
we shouldn't use science we're going to continue to use
science stopping using science is simply not an option you
can't put the toothpaste back in the tube but the
reason you might want to deconstruct science is as follows
consider that if you assume that science and truth are
one thing and always perfectly aligned then it doesn't make
sense to try to deconstruct science but consider the possibility
that maybe science is one thing and truth is a
second thing and that these things are not necessarily aligned
in which case you might have to make a choice
between science or truth and then the question becomes where
does your loyalty lie if you have to choose one
or the other which are you going to choose because
after all if you've even studied the history of science
a little bit there are many examples in the history
of science where science was bad created wrong conclusions wrong
theories and various kinds of deceptions so obviously science can
be false it can be aligned with falsehood which means
that it diverges from the truth so in that case
if your loyalty is to science and not to truth
can you see what's going to happen is that you're
going to veer further and further away from truth there's
going to be a divergence this divergence is going to
grow if your loyalty is with science you're going to
be defending science thinking that actually you're defending truth without
realizing that actually these are two separate things and as
you keep doubling down on your errors your epistemic errors
if they're going to keep getting worse and worse and
worse and you're going to veer further and further off
into delusion which is in a sense the problem that
you have with religion if you're a scientifically minded person
see because one of your critiques of religion is that
religious people don't admit their faults whereas scientific people are
supposed to be able to admit their faults well how
do you think that occurs that occurs by deconstructing science
if you really love science you shouldn't be afraid to
deconstruct it i suggest that it's better to have your
loyalties with truth than with science because what we really
care about is truth if you think about it what
good is science if it is if it isn't getting
us to truth see if your loyalty is to truth
even when science diverges if the whole world is going
mad with ideology and dogma and whatever kind of fad
thinking that they are partaking in it doesn't matter because
we've got the truth and we can use that to
help realign signs back to the truth see so please
don't make the naive mistake of thinking that science is
equivalent to truth that's a big question mark whether that's
the case we need to investigate that in a lot
more detail which we will here now you might also
wonder why is a self-help teacher talking about science leah
what does this have to do with self-actualization well like
uh i've given you this analogy and metaphor in the
past is that if we think of your mind as
a computer with an operating system that runs your entire
life see science is the foundation of your operating system
especially today you know in the past during the medieval
era and for for centuries and even millennia mankind made
sense of reality through religion today religion is going out
of favor for obvious reasons and sometimes good reasons but
then science is coming in to take its place science
is not in this case just a collection of objective
facts that is being given to you science becomes infused
into the very foundations of your mind and how you
see the world and it is how you make sense
of reality it's certain it serves a sense-making function of
your ego mind science is a foundation of your operating
system and so you might say well what's wrong with
that well what's wrong with that is again if there's
a divergence between truth and science and science is at
the heart of your operating system and your sense making
then any errors within science are going to be infesting
your own mind and corrupting how you see and make
sense of reality so in practice belief in science is
one of the biggest obstacles to understanding reality at the
deepest levels which is what my work is about and
what i care about the most is helping you to
understand reality at the deepest levels that's where my loyalties
lie that's my bias and to do that it's necessary
like i said in the past to jail break your
mind and the problem is that people say well leo
but science has been so successful how could you possibly
criticize or try to deconstruct science when it's obviously true
because it's so obviously successful you know we can launch
a man to the moon we can launch satellites and
make computers and all this crazy technology well see this
is what makes science so deceptive it's easy to see
the foolishness of religion and the errors of religion because
they're so obviously out of touch with everyday life and
with reality science is harder precisely because science gives you
all these shiny gadgets and widgets to play with science's
success is precisely what makes it more deceptive and more
dangerous than religion the greatest deceptions are not pure falsehoods
they are truths with nuggets of falsehood inside of them
such that then distinguishing the two becomes very very difficult
and then they're extremely deceptive they're so deceptive that you
would not even think or suspect that there could be
any deception and that's exactly what makes a highly successful
deception or illusion the success of modern science has given
us an over inflated sense that we understand more of
reality than we really do there's this sort of sense
that oh well science has figured out 90 of reality
maybe there's 10 percent left that it doesn't understand and
you know if we give it a couple hundred more
years it'll figure that out too and then we'll be
done and science will have proved victorious this isn't the
case there's a gross over-inflation of us thinking that we've
figured reality out we have not there are deep foundational
aspects of reality which we don't understand and that current
science is preventing us from understanding now also keep in
mind that my critiques of science here are going to
be of current science this doesn't mean that science has
to maintain these problems into the future science could change
science could change tomorrow in fact that is in line
with the spirit of science the problem though is that
the spirit of science might say that it likes to
change and that it's willing to evolve but when the
rubber hits the road when someone comes along and actually
starts to critique science and deconstruct it and show it
a way forward into a new paradigm is that going
to be accepted or rejected you see it's hypocritical on
the one hand to say that you're willing to admit
that science admits mistakes and that science evolves and yet
when somebody comes along and tries to help you to
evolve science you deny everything they say do you see
the problem with that are you really so naive as
to think that the epistemic errors of religion would not
creep their way into science that just because you change
the contents of your beliefs that that makes you immune
to epistemic errors don't fall into that illusion so the
reason that i am talking about this topic is because
i need to help to jailbreak your mind because ultimately
what i teach is i teach love i teach infinity
i teach consciousness now how can i teach that to
most people when most people's minds are infected by materialist
science scientism really and that world view denies the existence
and validity of love infinity and consciousness so of course
we have to deconstruct this stuff to make to make
room for love infinity and consciousness all right let's make
the next distinction here an important one is that on
the one hand you can have the doing of science
and on the other hand you have understanding science as
a system please understand that these are two totally different
things independent variables so one of the illusions of science
is that people who do science or people who see
people doing science just automatically assume that well if that
guy is doing science and he's getting success in his
work then he must understand science obviously right wrong there
are thousands of scientists all around the world in top
research universities like mit caltech stanford harvard princeton whatever who
are really really good at doing science much better than
i ever could be they work in laboratories they do
experiments you know advanced technical experiments with lasers and radiation
and particles and all sorts of stuff they can write
great research papers they can get their papers published they
have a lot of peer-reviewed studies that they've that they've
published they even have awards they even have nobel prizes
they get lots of grants they have lots of experience
they might have been a scientist for 40 years they're
very well respected they have high status they've published many
books but none of that that is the doing of
science none of that is the same as understanding science
as a system you might wonder well but how can
that be how can someone do science but not understand
what science is seems implausible but yet consider you've been
using language for a long time very early in your
life you've been using language but you didn't understand what
language was or how it really worked in fact people
who learn you know their first native language they don't
learn it through rules of grammar they don't really understand
what's going on with language they just learn it instinctually
and they're really good at using it and most of
the best language speakers they're great at using the language
but they couldn't sit down and give you a scientific
analysis of how language actually works or even what language
is these questions didn't even cross their mind they're just
using language they can use language to write a great
novel or poetry or or whatever else be a great
orator or speaker but that has nothing to do with
understanding what language actually is these are two separate things
likewise of course you use your body all the time
you've been using it since birth the body is an
elaborate highly complex machine bio machine we could say with
trillions of cells and different organs and systems and you
don't know how any of this stuff works you don't
even know all the organs located in your body and
where their locations are and what their functions are and
yet they all work for you seamlessly and you're able
to just go about your day and do the stuff
that you got to do this is how most scientists
do science most scientists have not seriously thought about what
science is it hasn't even occurred to them that there
would be value in doing something like this if you
want to understand science as a system actually the trick
is that you have to go outside of science because
look what we're doing we're studying science science is trying
to study itself this creates a self-reflection problem and so
really that takes us into something i would call meta
science the science of science otherwise known as philosophy or
epistemology or metaphysics and so we'll be doing a lot
of meta signs in the next four episodes and you'll
see meta science is different than ordinary science and yet
at the same time it's not separate from ordinary science
now a common mistake that many professional scientists and academics
make is they believe that well yeah sure leo you
can talk about meta science all you want but at
the end of the day i'm just interested in doing
my science and i don't need all that meta-science stuff
it's just a distraction be careful with that assumption because
that itself is a meta-scientific assumption which you haven't carefully
investigated and you don't know the full consequences of this
assumption as it turns out if you really want to
do the most groundbreaking revolutionary science that pushes the edges
of your field and of human understanding then actually meta
science is crucial for you because meta science is what
is going to allow you to think outside the box
of the limitations of the field that you're working in
so if you're a professional academic or scientist the next
four episodes are going to be crucial for you this
is a game changer i'm telling you if you want
to make if you want to get nobel prizes listen
to what i'm telling you here learn these lessons apply
them throughout the rest of your career and you will
you will see that you will be able to run
circles around your colleagues who are clueless about these things
and in fact your greatest challenge will be actually trying
to convince your colleagues of the discoveries that you make
more on that in the episode too all right now
another note i need to make here is that in
deconstructing science we will not be disputing the purely empirical
measurements of science so you know at a at its
lowest level we could say that science is about making
measurements of nature so when a scientist takes a measuring
tape and measures a rhinoceros from its tip to its
tail and tells us that it's 3.58 meters long or
whatever i'm not going to dispute that now of course
he could be wrong in his measurements but generally we're
going to give scientists the better benefit of the doubt
with basic measurement type stuff like that so we're not
going to be disputing that what we will be disputing
though is the interpretations the assumptions the context the paradigms
the methodology and the meta science behind the empirical measurements
and the entire sense sense-making apparatus behind these measurements because
see if science was just an excel spreadsheet of measurements
of nature then yeah there would be nothing much to
deconstruct there but that's not what science is science is
way more than that and we'll be getting that into
that real deep here in a moment so before we
do that though i want to create another distinction which
will be very helpful for us there's really two meanings
of science that we need to be concerned with here
the first meaning is what i would call the pop
cultural or the layman understanding of what science is this
is the myth of science as i call it this
is what people who are not professional scientists and academics
think science is that's distinct from professionals and academics who
have phds and who do serious science and think about
it in much more depth than laymen do these people
have a much more nuanced and better more accurate understanding
of what science is but yet there's still a problem
so there's going to be a trick that is being
played by your mind here this is why this distinction
is so crucial is that we're going to start by
leveling leveling a basic critique of the pop cultural myth
of science and this will crumble very very quickly as
that happens the rats will start to jump ship to
a new ship the professional academic ship and they will
want to say well yeah leo sure of course yeah
you made some critiques about cultural the cultural myth of
science yeah people online and so forth are stupid they
don't really understand science very well but the professionals the
academics the guys at caltech and mit and so on
they they don't suffer from from this pop cultural nonsense
they really understand science and there's no fundamental critique of
what they believe and that is precisely wrong so my
critique will not just be of the pop cultural notions
of science but also of the academic and the professional
um and uh and actually this distinction is not so
clear what i've noticed is that in practice many of
the professional and academic scientists actually do buy into the
many pop cultural myths of science so let's uh let's
articulate a little bit more fully what this pop cultural
myth of science is we might call this scientism rationalism
atheism reductionism in the past it was called logical positivism
logicism this is the following idea it's the idea that
basically you have two camps and two ways of looking
at the world you have the scientific and the rational
and then you have the religious and the irrational and
the new age and the woo nonsense these are your
two basic categories of things and so if you're a
rational person and you're a truthful person then you subscribe
to the scientific sort of worldview and then if you're
not if you have some sort of agenda or you're
stupid or deluded then you believe in this hocus-pocus stuff
over here and uh and that this stuff is defeated
by this stuff over here if you just use sufficient
logic then that will defeat all of the the hocus-pocus
stuff uh and so this sort of battle is set
up uh this battle is is present within the the
culture and the zeitgeist and uh this is how we
make sense of various kinds of perspectives that we run
into in society right so you see somebody like deepak
chopra on tv talking about something and you immediately if
you're a scientific mind person you just kind of lump
him into the the you know the woo crowd the
crazy irrational crowd um or you know you see gwyneth
paltrow and her like goop stuff um uh her group
company and you just kind of throw that all into
the irrational camp with the crazy religious nut cases and
the fundamentalists and the radicals and whatever else and you
know they're not being logical well i hate to break
it to you but it's not so simple it's way
more complicated than this and uh and so this uh
this sort of myth of science it puts signs on
this pedestal like science is the ultimate achievement of man
science is how we get to objective truth it literally
is objective truth and the only problem we have is
that we have these new agers and these woo people
and we have these fun religious fundamentalists who are just
so brainwashed that if we just get people to forget
about god and to forget about all this crazy religious
new agey stuff and all this you know cult stuff
and just get them to think more rationally and more
scientifically then that will solve all of mankind's problems and
that is the best that we can do that will
lead us to objective truth and that will solve so
many problems in society well this is a myth this
is false this will never work and i will explain
in a lot of detail going forward why it will
never work uh see this myth idealizes and lionizes science
and then when you subscribe to that myth you become
very defensive of course because you've lionized that you've idealized
it and now you're sort of committed to defending signs
to the death ironically kind of the way that religious
people do with their ideology you see the problem here
is when you get really attached to one particular perspective
or worldview then you start to bend over backwards to
defend that worldview even in light of contrary evidence and
then you have a divergence of that worldview from the
truth and then all sorts of devilry and disaster ensues
you have to remember that it's culture that creates scientists
scientists are not born scientists are created by culture and
in turn scientists then contribute to creating and changing culture
again and so it's a sort of a self-feeding cycle
see and we gotta look at culture in a lot
more depth to see how it creates scientists and how
scientists create culture so this myth of science is in
a sense it's not separate from the academic and the
professional scientists it it it it's fed by the academic
and professional scientists and then that myth gets perpetuated in
our media and elsewhere you know on online forums through
reddit through these sort of youtube channels that are trying
to debunk religion and so forth and you know the
new atheist movement that has been popular in the last
you know 20 or 10 years this sort of stuff
that's all part of the the culture and then that
in turn creates the next generations of scientists which then
get that worldview imprinted as part of their operating system
of their mind and then they will use that to
do their science we'll be talking a lot more about
culture in part two but okay so let me now
give you a list of the uh of the biggest
misconceptions of the pop cultural myth of science i'm not
going to address and explain every single misconception here there's
going to be like 20 or 30 misconceptions i'm going
to just list them out just so that you get
a big picture sense of why this is a myth
and what i'm really pointing to when i say the
myth of science all right so here's a list of
misconceptions about science that is held by laymen and also
by some professional scientists and academics who aren't being careful
misconception number one is that science is just a collection
of objective facts this is false the next misconception is
that science equals truth because it works and because it's
successful at producing technology this is false the next misconception
is that there's a clear boundary between science pseudoscience and
religion this is false the next misconception is that science
is the opposite of religion and therefore it cannot be
an ideology and therefore it's not subject to the same
epistemic problems of religion it's immune from those problems this
is false the next misconception is that science is not
based on belief or authority this is false science is
99 belief and authority the next misconception is that science
is immune from problems of the ego as though the
ego is something that plagues other people and domains of
life but not science and not scientists and not academics
this is obviously false the next misconception is that scientists
understand what science is we've already uh alluded to this
uh touched upon this earlier uh no they don't you
can't just assume that scientists understand what science is most
of them don't just because they have a degree or
a nobel prize doesn't mean that they understand science the
next misconception is that science is objective and unbiased because
it ignores things like subjective feelings emotions human psychology intuitions
and first-person experiences this is false the next misconception is
that if a thing is true it can be proven
by science this is false the next misconception is that
reason and logic are exclusive to science and are the
thing that differentiates science from pseudoscience or from religion and
other kinds of delusion this is false another misconception related
to this is that reason and logic are objectively true
this is false another misconception is that the scientific method
is an obvious given monolithic and static singular thing there
is this thing called the scientific method and if we
can just adhere to the scientific method if everyone would
adhere to it this would lead us to objective truth
this is false no such method exists or could exist
and i'll explain why very soon here the next misconception
is that there is no methodological disputes between scientists as
though all scientists agree upon the scientific method this is
false the next misconception is that science does not make
deep errors as though any errors within science sure we
can admit that there are errors within science but you
know it's surface level stuff you know someone made a
bad measurement somewhere okay or did a little bit of
bad science here or there you know it's one bad
apple out of a bunch this is not the case
the the errors of signs are much deeper deeper than
just a single bad apple or one wrong measurement the
next misconception is that unlike religion science is eager to
correct itself there is a big component of this myth
of science that well leo if somebody comes along and
really points out the error of science science will accept
that error and correct itself because that is part of
the spirit of science is that we admit that we're
fallible unlike the religious people this is false even though
you say that you will admit of this error in
theory in practice when the error is presented to you
because it lies outside of your paradigm you're actually going
to dismiss it and you're going to demonize the person
who is pointing out the error and so in this
way you'll get stuck another misconception is that science is
immune to self-deception psychological historical and cultural forces as though
science sits outside of and is immune to history to
culture to fads in thinking to politics that's just not
true another misconception is that science seeks truth that's a
very dangerous assumption that's not true another misconception is that
mathematics is subjectively true after all what could be more
of a paragon of truth and objectivity than mathematics everyone
agrees to that right that's false another misconception is that
science proves the existence of an objective external material reality
this is false science has never proven such a thing
nor will it ever prove such a thing such a
thing is impossible to prove even in theory let alone
in practice another common misconception is that science proves the
existence of other beings other than yourself this is false
there's a host here of related misconceptions that i'll rattle
off real quick that science proves also the existence of
objects physical objects this is also false the misconception that
science proves the existence of a self of a personal
self this is false and that science proves that you
are the body this is also false another misconception is
that proof is a simple objective notion that is not
relativistic this is false another misconception is that science does
not have any contradictions within it unlike let's say religion
this is false there are plenty of serious contradictions within
science and in the third episode i will be giving
you a large list of some 20 serious contradictions within
science that i have discovered so hang in there for
that that'll be an exciting list if you're skeptical the
next misconception is that science is not circular unlike religion
this is false science is most definitely circular the next
misconception is that science has debunked religion mysticism the new
age spirituality the paranormal esp and god this is false
of course the next misconception is that science is not
relative to culture language or the human mind this is
false and the final misconception is that science is not
corrupted by business or capitalism which is also false so
that's a pretty serious list of misconceptions that's a lot
to be misconceived about and i find that you know
like folks on reddit or folks on youtube part of
the pop culture you know intelligentsia they subscribe to these
misconceptions very very easily but then also many professional scientists
i'm telling you many professional scientists um who people look
up to and respect like folks like neil degrasse tyson
um you know i can start dropping names here uh
lords krause sean carroll rick richard dawkins sam harris jordan
peterson like i mean many of these people first of
all i wouldn't even call them scientists really it's it's
offensive to call these people scientists uh because i have
a very rigorous standard for what i consider a true
scientist um these people are more like public intellectuals than
true scientists and um and yeah they have no idea
what science is and they subscribe to many misconceptions and
then even many very serious scientists at mit and caltech
still fall prey to these misconceptions so just you know
be careful all right now let's really get into the
meat of this topic and where do we begin where
do we begin understanding science well of course with basic
questioning such as what is science that's the first and
ultimate question essentially everything i'm talking about here has come
from that one question what is science it seems deceptively
simple it's so taken for granted by us because science
is just the water we swim in if we were
a fish if you grew up in the 21st century
if you were born in the last 100 years science
is just the water you swim in and it seems
as though science has always been there and that it's
obvious and that we know what it is so the
first thing i want you to recognize whether you're a
layman or whether even you're a professional or an academic
or even a philosopher you don't know what science is
please have the uh enough self-honesty and aware self-awareness to
admit to yourself that you do not know what science
is you don't know we have to start with that
because if you think that you know what science is
how can we really question science you already know you
already have an ideology you already have a dogma and
you're going to spend the rest of the time defending
your pre-existing beliefs and the reason you don't know what
science is because you haven't ever seriously contemplated it you
haven't seriously investigated in fact you've probably never even thought
about this question for an hour in your life you
haven't taken it seriously and the reason why not is
because your culture never put that idea in your mind
that it's worthwhile to question what science is it seems
like a waste of time right well but how would
you know unless you actually questioned it and then the
second important question here is how do you know that
science is valid seriously how do you know you might
say well leo mankind has used science for centuries now
and it's produced all this amazing technology so obviously it's
valid well that's uh an interesting theory but um there's
two problems with that first of all the problem is
that just because you create something successfully you know if
you manipulate reality that doesn't guarantee that it's actually valid
or true it just guarantees that you've manipulated reality using
some system we could conceive of many different systems that
could manipulate reality does it make it science doesn't make
it true so just again be careful there can be
a divergence there between truth and manipulation or success and
success produces a very juicy illusion for example a lot
of people are fooled by celebrities who are very successful
and people think oh well they're so successful they must
have a perfect life and then you know later you
realize that no this guy is addicted to drugs he's
addicted to sex and he's depressed then he ends up
committing suicide and he wasn't happy at all even though
he had money and he had hot women and he
had everything he wanted but he was miserable so again
success is not happiness success is not truth success is
not science so just be careful about that and and
also the other problem you have here is that of
course you know science has historically made a lot of
errors and mistakes so if science was able to make
all those errors how can you be confident there aren't
a bunch of errors being made by science right now
i mean if you've been fooled once you'd be stupid
to assume you can't be fooled twice so here's what
i want you to really again using radical self-honesty and
self-awareness i want you to admit the following thing that
you have never validated science as a method never you
have not done this and the reason i can be
so sure is because it's actually not possible to do
this you haven't done it neither has any scientist ever
done it neither has mankind mankind as a whole ever
done it and the reason they haven't is because it's
impossible and i will demonstrate to you why that's the
case over the next hour so just stay with me
so let's think about this from scratch as it were
where did the scientific method come from it should be
pretty obvious that it wasn't there from the beginning in
the beginning if you just imagine that you are the
first human ever alive of course this is sort of
a silly childish thought experiment but hey go go with
me here imagine you're the first human ever born do
you have the scientific method no of course not and
how do you get it let's assume that you're going
to be the first guy to get it how do
you get it guy girl i'm using it gender neutral
here uh let's be let's be politically correct um so
how do you get it are you going to get
it from god are you going to go up on
a mountaintop and god is going to give you stone
tablets etched with the scientific method the principles and rules
for the scientific method and this is the method he
god tells you this is the method that you shall
use ye shall use this method to distinguish truth from
falsehood and discover everything true about nature just follow these
10 steps no of course not right as a scientifically
minded person of course you don't appeal to things like
god giving you the answers you have to derive the
answers from scratch for yourself and hey i'm sympathetic to
that view but let's really really take on that view
let's really totally assume that we start from a position
of ignorance we know nothing we know nothing now to
start from a total position of ignorance this is a
very radical thing it's it's difficult for our mind to
even conceive of such a thing and to imagine what
that is like because our minds have been programmed by
culture from birth with all sorts of ideas assumptions technologies
and possibilities for how nature is we take most of
these for granted we assume they were there from the
beginning or that they were obvious but they weren't obvious
and science wasn't obvious some human had to invent science
which means some human had to decide how to do
science some human had to sit down and say this
here is valid science and this here is invalid science
so the question is how did that first human distinguish
between what was valid and what is invalid science what
method did he use what criteria did he use how
did he do that how is it possible to do
that do you see the problem here if you're going
to say well he just used science to distinguish between
what was valid and valid no you can't do that
because that begs the question because our question is how
do you know that science is the right way see
if you say that you can use science to distinguish
between truth and falsehood that already assumes that you validated
science and that you know that it's true but you
don't know that if you say oh well he just
used reason and logic to decide what is valid in
valid signs no that also begs the question because the
question then is how do you know what is valid
logic and valid reason versus invalid logic and invalid reason
you say oh well it's just evident self-evident no it's
not it's not evident at all it's only evident to
you because you're attached to whatever you're attached to that
particular way of doing logic or reason and that has
been all programmed by by your culture you didn't invent
that and there's a further problem let's say you know
you're the first guy to invent your scientific method but
then there's a second guy the second guy on earth
and he he independently develops his own method what are
the chances that you two are gonna have the same
method and that you're gonna agree and if you guys
disagree how do we determine who's right what are you
going to say you're going to say well we're just
going to use the scientific method to determine who's right
that's begging the question you're not getting the depth of
the problem if you say that because the whole problem
is that we don't know what the scientific method is
which means that you can't use a scientific method to
adjudicate between two different versions of the scientific method there's
not just going to be two of them there's going
to be hundreds of them thousands of them in fact
every human is going to have their own version of
a scientific method unless somehow we create a culture that
corrals people to build a a unified method but even
then you know there's not one culture in the world
there's many cultures cultures have fragments they have subcultures within
them you're never going to get everybody to agree on
your method now here's the next important point is that
we talk about science but what is science really a
part of what is science really attempting to do science
we could say is attempting to understand everything about nature
that is possible to understand nature or you could call
it reality or you could call it the universe basically
if we conceive of the most ideal version of science
what we really care about when we're doing science is
we care about the pursuit of knowledge in a sense
science is a subset of a larger pursuit which is
the pursuit of knowledge so if you sort of imagine
the super set of every possible fact and piece of
true knowledge that you could have about the universe it's
a lot of stuff a lot of knowledge if you
could have everything written in like let's say let's say
you could take everything true about the world and about
you know the world i'm using world with a capital
w the universe it's a better word everything's true about
the universe and you could put it into a single
book it would be a giant book realize that first
and then so so we would want to say that
in a sense science is interested in building that book
that's what science is ultimately about science strictly speaking is
not about building technology it's not about manipulating reality it's
the pursuit of knowledge because you see if you say
that no leo science isn't really interested in the total
pursuit of knowledge it's interested in something smaller than that
well that's going to be a problem later for you
because you see if you say that science is only
interested in the in the pursuit of physical stuff but
not other kinds of stuff then here's there's a problem
because if you're only going to be studying or investigating
one part of reality then there's going to be some
other part that you leave out that is going to
be outside of your scientific method but nevertheless that's still
going to be you can you can still have valid
knowledge of that but it's just going to be outside
the domain of science but you see that's going to
be a problem because at heart the spirit of a
true scientist and granted these people are pretty rare these
days true scientists but the spirit of a true scientist
is that a scientist is interested in everything that's true
about nature a scientist doesn't judge a scientist doesn't say
that well you know i'm interested in electrons but i'm
not interested in rhinoceroses no there's no reason why an
electron is more important than a rhinoceros you're interested in
both as long as they're true as long as you
can know something valid about either one you know and
then you're interested in stars and you're interested in clouds
and you're interested in the earth and you're interested in
people and right even stuff like people you're interested in
even like sexuality you're interested in sexuality there's a science
of sexuality there's a science of people there's a science
of politics there's a science of government there's a science
of all sorts of stuff all of it is is
interesting and potentially very very useful it can be very
useful to do the signs of sexuality or the science
of of you know government or something like that so
we want to be careful not to draw our domain
of science so narrow that we exclude the full possibilities
of science so really what we're talking about here is
the larger pursuit of knowledge agreed okay so if what
we're talking about this is the the total pursuit of
knowledge in the universe then the question becomes okay what
are all the valid ways to pursue knowledge oh boy
that's a that's a deep and thorny question what are
all the valid ways to pursue knowledge you see most
scientists have never even asked themselves this question and that's
the problem because they're engaged in a pursuit of knowledge
that they call science they've never seriously considered other ways
of pursuing knowledge that might be beyond science or outside
of science or the way that science has been defined
so uh let's let's drive this point home with uh
with the following method i am going to list off
to you a list of various ways of potentially pursuing
knowledge and as i list these off you get a
sheet of paper if you want and you write down
or circle the ones circle the ones on this list
that are invalid science or invalid ways of pursuing knowledge
and valid ones those who don't circle or rather i'm
sorry i screwed this up uh circle the vat the
ones you think are valid and leave the invalid ones
uncircled all right all right let's do this so meditation
is that a valid way of doing science yes or
no if you think it is circle it next contemplation
shamanism voodoo reading tea leaves belief witchcraft gossip from your
neighbors speculation in an armchair logical deductions reason looking at
omens like a crow flies over the horizon and to
you that means that rain is coming dreams visions direct
experience alchemy phrenology yoga scripture holy book meaning reading a
holy book for knowledge ancestral stories stories passed down from
your ancestors astral projection animal sacrifice books google searches microscopes
radar x-rays interviews surveys polls statistics and drawing a map
which of those are valid ways of doing science are
you starting to see the problem you see it's not
so easy do you think that these terms or items
that you circled do you think that your friend or
your mom or your dad or your college professor do
you think they're going to have exactly the same list
with the same circles on it or they can have
a different list with different circles how do we determine
which of the terms circled is correct you see the
problem what criteria are we going to use how do
we get people to agree on that criteria so consider
the following possibility the following example let's imagine that you
are alive 200 000 years ago and humans were alive
200 000 years ago according to science at least um
so we'll just take that take that for granted uh
you were alive 200 000 years ago you were living
life in a small tribe in the amazon pretty much
the way that some tribes still live in the amazon
today it was just you and 50 people living in
the amazon you were a secluded tribe and uh and
you were a shaman in this tribe and of course
one of the things shamans do you know they do
their shaman stuff uh and uh and also what they
do is they experiment with with various herbs you're living
in the amazon it's a rich ecosystem lots of you
know plants around and so of course you know humans
depend on those plants so as just part of your
survival and life and just your interest as a shaman
you you sample different herbs and plants and just kind
of discover what they do through trial and error maybe
there's a couple of different flowers there's a green one
a blue one a yellow one and you try these
different flowers and you test what they do one day
you try the yellow flower and you discover that this
yellow flower cures cures your stomach ache you have a
terrible stomach it cures it uh you're you're excited by
this discovery and then you tell your villagers and your
tribe of course because their you know tribal life is
very communal it's almost like a family a family of
50 basically and so you tell everyone in your family
that hey i can help you guys you know who
has a stomach ache here i know it's a recurring
problem in a tribe look i found the solution i
found this miracle flower that will cure your stomach and
sure enough you give it to them and it works
it doesn't work all the time it works maybe 70
of the time uh but still that's pretty damn good
and so this flower now becomes a part of your
tribal zeitgeist and culture because you know tribe has its
own culture people start to gossip about this flower and
they tell each other oh yeah it's the yellow the
magic yellow flower that will cure a stomach ache beautiful
right and then and then later a couple years later
you find uh you know a red flower and this
red flower will cure uh will cure the plague you
know sometimes a plague will will come into the village
and you know you know decimate half the population and
this will cure the plague and you discover that and
this is a matter of life and death you know
it could save your entire village save your life discovering
this this red flower or whatever um so now my
question to you is is is this shaman a scientist
see this this puts you scientists in a very tricky
position because if you're a professional scientist or academic you
would not want to admit that a shaman is a
scientist on the other hand common sense tells you that
look i mean this guy is basically doing science i
mean what's he doing he's experimenting with flowers he's fighting
the ones that do something he's creating a catalog in
his mind of which flower does what he's testing it
on people i mean sure it's not a it's not
some rigorous double-blind placebo-controlled study he's not doing it in
some academic setting he's not part of some scientific community
he doesn't write peer-reviewed research articles but i mean is
this not science if what he's doing isn't science then
you've got a problem because you've got a very artificial
definition of science and again notice you might say that's
not science and some someone else might say it is
so again who's right you say well i'm right of
course because we in in my university we've decided that
that's not science okay well but but again can you
see that that's just a cultural artifact that's culture there's
nothing objective about that you see the problem here is
that science really wants to construct the myth of an
objective monolithic method of science and that if you just
follow this method this will get you to truth but
what i'm trying to show you here is that no
such method exists it has never existed and it will
never exist not even in theory is it possible it's
an absurd idea and yet many scientists subscribe to this
sort of myth but it's even worse than that because
the the even uh scarier question for you is that
tribe that now has a culture wherein the flowers you
know have different properties are regardedly this the yellow flower
cures your stomach ache the red flower cures the can
the the plague or whatever um is that science because
those people didn't actually do the experiments themselves they just
believe it they have beliefs they just believe the shaman
many of those people might have not even tried to
flower themselves they might have never been sick with a
stomachache or with a plague they just believe you know
because in a tribe you just believe what the tribe
believes and so the tribe tells you that oh that's
a good flower that's a bad flower it'll do this
and that and you just believe it is that science
now if you say no that's not science again you're
in a lot of trouble because what's the difference between
what i just described in the way that most laymen
who are not professional scientists know science they've never actually
done any scientific experiments what's the difference but it's even
worse than that it gets worse much worse because you
see these these tribal people they don't just have a
strict you know belief that oh this flower the yellow
one does this the red one does that they add
additional beliefs on top of that because this again this
is helping them to make sense of the world it's
not just factual information like yellow flower good red flower
bad sort of thing or whatever it's uh it's much
it's got much much more behind it because to them
you know they have their sort of uh you know
animistic belief worldview sort of system uh as the tribe
and they believe in you know deities and spirits and
ghosts and this sort of stuff and to them you
know they believe that the yellow flower this is a
gift from you know from the ancestor gods you know
the god of of of water she gave us this
flower because this flower grows near the you know near
the lake and then this the red flower that cures
the plague that flower was given us to us by
you know by the god of war because you know
he is associated with the color red and because these
these flowers grow near you know near the you know
near the volcanic pits or something where there's fire these
are the war flowers and they will cure the plague
you see and so that whole belief system and sense
making system gets fused with the empirical data so to
speak of what these flowers actually do and then that
now my question is to you is that science now
if you say no leo that's definitely not science now
you've gone too far now that's religion and that's hocus
pocus stuff well you've got a big problem because that's
exactly how most people conceive of science in our society
today the deities might be missing the deities were replaced
by other things other images but uh see the way
people hold scientific facts is not just as facts they
put those facts into a a a rich matrix of
sense-making which doesn't really have anything directly to do with
the facts and not only do the layman do this
you might say well those people are just dumb and
superstitious they don't know any better the shaman you know
he's more of a true scientist he knows better he
doesn't do that no the shaman does it too and
the academic scientists of today at mit and caltech and
harvard they do it too now they do it in
a secular way but just because it's done in a
secular way doesn't make it any more true and what
you see is that you can take the facts and
you can embed them in different types of matrices so
while that one tribe might have you know their constellation
of gods and deities and whatever and myths the neighboring
tribe next door is going to have their own they
could use those same flowers to cure similar illnesses but
then they're going to have a different constellation or a
different matrix that they embed those facts into which is
going to lead to a different worldview and you could
have thousands of these different worldviews that these facts get
embedded into including secular ones of today there's a further
problem here this list that i just gave you that
you were circling stuff on notice those items you didn't
circle because you thought that they were pseudoscience or that
you thought they were you know witchcraft or something like
that let's work with the example of witchcraft it's a
really good one so i assume most of you probably
didn't circle witchcraft which means you think witchcraft doesn't constitute
valid science but my question to you here is now
how do you know that how do you know that
witchcraft isn't valid science it's not so obvious it's really
truly not so obvious have you actually done witchcraft no
then how can you say that it's valid science i
mean that it's invalid science in order for you to
say that witchcraft is not valid science first you would
need to actually do witchcraft to test it that would
be in the spirit of science because if you just
denounce witchcraft with actually testing it what you're being is
you're just being ideological and you're just acting out your
own prejudices and biases and beliefs what if witchcraft turns
out to have a scientific component to it you say
well that's crazy but how do you know it's crazy
where did you get the idea that it's crazy from
your culture but you didn't test that idea it's just
a belief that belief could be wrong now you might
say well you know i but you know i can
go read a book about witchcraft and it's just nonsense
first of all have you actually read a book about
about witchcraft really i highly doubt it second of all
it's not enough to read a book about witchcraft you
gotta actually really do wishcraft like really get into it
like i mean really get into it in the same
way that for example if i wanted to validate uh
an experiment within quantum mechanics i couldn't do that just
by reading out one book about quantum mechanics to validate
an experiment on quantum mechanics i would need to spend
12 years of school plus an additional four years of
undergrad plus an additional probably two or four more years
after that of graduate school and maybe then i would
reach a point where i could finally after what 18
years and thousands of hours of study and practice only
then maybe i might be qualified to actually validate one
of those experiments and yet when it comes to witchcraft
you don't even want to read one book about it
you've dismissed it already can you see how problematic that
is you're doing that with a lot of stuff with
meditation with shamanism with yoga with astral projection with holy
books with scriptures and many other things you're creating a
confirmation bias do you see here it's a very deep
profound confirmation bias it's a methodological confirmation bias in that
what you're doing is that remember scientific method was not
empirically validated at all we're just assuming what the scientific
method was if you say that well the scientific method
is xyz where did that come from it only came
from two places either you validated it yourself or you
made it up or your culture gave it to you
so maybe three places but validating the method is very
very difficult in fact it's impossible because there's thousands of
different ways of acquiring knowledge and you don't know which
of them are valid or invalid and it's even worse
than that because usually these methods are not foolproof it's
not that one method is 100 foolproof to use a
method also means you have to know how to use
the method properly and there can still be mistakes it's
very easy to make mistakes so just because you try
a little bit of witchcraft and you fail well that
might just mean because you're you're doing it wrong in
the same way that if i go try a little
bit of quantum mechanics you know uh like in a
laboratory with some you know particle collider i'll probably do
it wrong i'll do it long wrong a lot it
might also be very costly it might be very expensive
it might take a long time may take 20 years
so you see the deeper point here this is the
the ultimate epistemic point that you gotta understand is that
all knowledge is non-trivial distinguishing truth from halt from falsehood
is completely non-obvious and non-trivial there's a even deeper point
here which is the following if you are the first
human alive and you are completely ignorant and you know
nothing that means that you do not know whether alchemy
will yield valid knowledge or astral projection will yield valid
knowledge or some witchcraft will yield valid knowledge or some
animal sacrifice will get you some valid knowledge or some
meditation or some empirical observation see this is completely non-obvious
we tend to assume that like well but leo out
of all of these methods you mentioned probably the most
scientific and rigorous one is the one which involves direct
experimentation some form of empiricism where you are directly you
know running an experiment but you're already assuming that as
a given you actually don't know that how do you
know that running an experiment will yield more valid knowledge
than sitting in an armchair and just speculating now you
say well leo it's obvious that if i'm just sitting
there speculating then that that's not real knowledge that's not
real science that's not obvious that's not obvious please understand
this for this i have a a funny anecdote for
you uh funny but also true and uh that is
uh with aristotle you know aristotle was a greek philosopher
he was married twice in his life as they say
and uh for his entire life he argued that women
have fewer teeth than men and you know during his
time aristotle was actually considered one of the more empirical
philosophers he was in in a large sense you know
you could you could trace western developments of science back
to aristotle he thought that we should explore the the
tangible material world in a sense he was sort of
a materialist and a pragmatist and yet he thought that
women have fewer teeth than men and it never occurred
to aristotle to ever open the mouth of his wife
and actually count how many teeth she has to discover
that it's the same number as him you would think
that would be so obvious how could an otherwise intelligent
rational intellectual like aristotle not have gotten the idea just
to ask his wife how many teeth she has like
if you're not going to open her mouth and let
her count herself and just tell you it never occurred
to him the idea that to know how many teeth
someone has you have to open his mouth and count
how many are in there that idea itself is revolutionary
it seems obvious to us today if we're doing science
but it wasn't obvious and in fact it's impossible to
know that without trial and error who's to say that
a microscope is a valid way of doing science you
say well that's obvious of course it is no it's
not it's not obvious at all the microscope could be
distorting reality and presenting you a false picture you see
you have to assume that a microscope is valid science
that's not a given who says that radar or x-rays
are valid data for science you say well of course
they are no that's not obvious at all for this
point i will bring to light an example that i
like with galileo galileo faced this problem because he was
the one of the first early adopters of the telescope
and uh he didn't invent it but he he was
one of the early adopters and his genius was figuring
out that you can point this thing at the stars
at the moon and see amazing things that you can't
say with your naked eye for example he would look
at jupiter and he would actually be able to to
resolve and to count like four moons of jupiter that
you couldn't see with the naked eye so he discovered
these moons then he went to his uh you know
his colleagues at the time uh now keep in mind
of course everybody was religious back then uh so this
was this this does not preclude science all scientists in
galileo's time were all religious people uh that doesn't mean
they were dumb but he took this information to to
them and he said hey look i can discover these
extra moons um and they said no that's that's impossible
there can't be moons revolving around jupiter because you know
our model of the solar system doesn't have these kinds
of moons that's impossible and he said well i'm not
asking you to believe me or to take this on
as faith here's the telescope i invented this you know
like i invented this device look it up in the
look up in the sky and you can count the
moons for yourself and what do they tell them did
they say oh okay yeah let's look in there no
of course not because they were coming from the position
that there are no such moons and there couldn't be
such moons therefore what that means is that any moons
that are visible through this telescope obviously that's a work
of the devil it's an illusion so they condemned his
telescope as the work of the devil and they never
looked into it and then of course they even got
him into trouble and then eventually he went up in
house arrest and so forth for various other positions that
he held but anyways uh i love this example because
what it shows you is that the human mind's capacity
for denial of data is infinite it's bottomless you can
deny any data that is presented to you all you
have to do is deny the method that yields the
data you see if i find something through a microscope
that contradicts your worldview that threatens your worldview and i
try to present it to you what do you got
to do all you have to do is discredit the
microscope as a method you have to say that's not
real science if i discover some data with radar that
threatens your worldview all your ego has to do is
just say well of course radar that's for idiots radars
pseudoscience are you getting how the game works there is
no neutrality or objectivity in how your mind understands reality
your mind is constructing reality on the fly and what
you consider science is part of the meaning making system
of your ego mind this is not objective at all
even though your ego mind tells you that it's of
course objective anything the ego mind imagines as being real
it considers to be objectively true that's just that's exactly
how religious people fool themselves but so do scientists see
here are some questions for you is history science if
you say no you've got a problem because are you
going to say that historical facts don't exist well if
they do supposedly there's a science that that's part of
science or should be right like for example did did
julius caesar actually get killed by you know by the
senators on a certain date did that actually happen supposedly
that's a scientific fact if it did but that's within
the domain of history so are you going to say
history of science or not but you know the problem
with history is that there's there's a lot of speculation
within history too history is not just a collection of
empirical facts there's a whole narrative process behind history history
is politicized it's not a it's not some objective telling
of of the unfoldment of the universe history so you've
got a problem both ways whether you college science or
not you're damned if you do and dammit if you
don't how about computer programming is that science you might
say it's not but then again why can't you have
a science of how to do coding you could have
various principles and rules of how to code properly there's
true things and false things about how to how to
program a computer to do certain tasks how about filmmaking
is that science you might say no that's not science
that's art but there's a lot of scientific aspects to
filmmaking like how to light the scene lenses camera angles
a lot of technology is involved in that and furthermore
you can have a science of like how to tell
a good story how to write good characters cinematography lighting
color correction audio are you going to exclude that from
science how about criminal detective work like if someone in
your office you got an office of 20 co-workers someone
in your office steals your stapler and then you go
on a hunt to to to track down this this
cretan who stole your stapler and doesn't want to you
know confess so what do you do you know you
act like sherlock holmes you take out your detective eyeglass
and a hat and then you go around looking for
clues and fingerprints and hairs and whatever and then you
do some detective work and through some sherlock holmes in
detective work you discover that it was bill from accounting
who stole your stapler uh is that science supposedly if
bill from accounting actually did steal your stapler that fact
that he did do it that's a scientific fact you
might want to say right are you going to deny
that like dna evidence in criminal investigations is science that's
a problem if you deny that on the other hand
it's sort of a problem if you admit that this
is this detective work is science because it really takes
you outside of the traditional scientific method as conceived by
by rationalists and you know atheists and so forth because
this this you know sherlock holmes into detective work and
this is this is this is pretty fuzzy stuff this
is not some sort of you know objective uh formal
scientific method being used here it's it's a lot of
guesswork and detective work and um you know piecing things
together and then who knows whether that result is even
valid and whether you can really rely on it how
much validity it has what if there's a you know
what if you make a mistake how do you validate
all that it's it's it's very hairy how about map
making if i'm making a map of the earth by
just walking around and drawing on a piece of paper
or sailing on a ship you know the way the
folks did before satellites and computers and so forth uh
is that science go take a look at some of
the early maps that were made by european explorers of
the americas and so forth like it's they're pretty funny
when you look at some of them but was that
science so hopefully you're starting to see that this idea
of a single objective monolithic scientific method which is static
and doesn't change and can clearly differentiate between all the
different ways of studying reality that this is a fantasy
no such thing has ever existed and can never exist
in even in theory it doesn't work doesn't make sense
all of these different ways of knowing nature come with
a ton of assumptions hidden assumptions which themselves have never
been tested and are not objective and when you select
one method over another method realize that this is your
own subjective mind relativistically deciding that okay well this will
be our method that's not objective there's nowhere in the
universe that says that like well microscopes are valid method
x-rays are valid method radar's valid method but witchcraft is
not and map making is not and filmmaking is not
this is far too simplistic obviously it doesn't work that
way so one of the mistakes of modern science is
that it assumes there is an objective method and that
such a method is possible whereas in fact in reality
method is completely relativistic and what i'm saying here is
worse than you even think i'm not just saying that
we haven't found the method yet but one exists to
be found in the future what i'm saying is that
there just isn't such a method in the entire universe
because the universe is relativistic all knowledge is relativistic let
me ask you this if i take a frog and
i put him in a blender blend him up into
like a juice and then i study his cells under
a microscope and i make some conclusions from that like
okay i can there's this fact about the frog and
that fact about the frog and then through this method
i i come to understand the frog i study the
frog through this blended liquid that i make in the
blender um and i say okay now i understand the
frog it's just a bunch of cells and a bunch
of fluids and matter is that valid science is that
all there is to science what if there's more to
science what if there's more about this frog than just
the cells it's made out of you see to put
a frog in a blender to think that you can
understand the frog by blending it up and studying itself
under a microscope this comes with serious metaphysical and epistemic
assumptions within the mind of the scientist the scientist has
to believe that this is a valid way of understanding
what frogs are now sure enough maybe that is a
tiny portion of how to understand a frog but can
you imagine a scientist who only studies animals by putting
them in blenders and then studying the liquid that comes
out and then he convinces himself that well that's it
that's all there is to nature but then some other
guy comes along like me and says well you know
what i don't like to blend frogs in a blender
i will study the frog in other ways i'll you
know i'll keep the frog as a pet i'll study
his behavior and his mating habits and so forth his
eating habits all get to know the frog that way
and maybe i'll understand more about the frog that way
than by blending it up and studying under microscope and
but the scientist who blends frogs he says what are
you talking about that's not science that's some [ __
] pseudoscience that's some new age stuff you know oh
yeah you're going to keep a frog as a pet
ha ha that's not academic that's not objective so my
question to you is who's right me or him and
of course the answer is that neither one of us
is right it's relative if we want to really articulate
the essence the spirit so to speak of the scientific
method we could say it's something like this this is
the best that i've been able to do basically the
spirit and i use the word spirit here very deliberately
to poke fun at the uh the rationalists and the
scientists because uh they love they're annoyed by this word
um but really this is the problem is that modern
science has lost its spirit so what is the spirit
of science the spirit of science is something like open-minded
empirical investigation which goes something like this these are the
principles nothing is known a priori nothing is obvious we
start from a blank slate of total ignorance we don't
assume anything we don't hold any dogmas we don't speculate
excuse me we don't speculate and we don't philosophize everything
we claim about nature we need to test every issue
must be tested against experience such that we discover and
let nature tell us how it works rather than us
telling nature how it should work let nature tell us
how it works and then whatever nature reveals to us
that truth must be accepted no matter how radical or
inconvenient it is and sometimes it can be very inconvenient
and very radical sometimes we will assume that nature is
going to work this way but then nature tells us
that no that's not how i work i work something
some other way in which case i as a scientist
have to be willing to surrender my pet ideas and
beliefs and biases and i have to admit that i've
been wrong and for this i have to keep a
very very radically open mind because nature could surprise us
in fact that's been the history of science is that
nature keeps surprising us more and more and more mistakes
will happen necessarily in this process and the only remedy
to that is just to admit our mistakes and to
be willing to really look for our own mistakes rather
than denying them or sweeping them under the rug that's
the essence of science uh notice that it's extremely broad
and even as broad as that is you know it
it could encompass a lot of stuff so notice that
my method here is so broad that it even includes
something like witchcraft because i don't know that witchcraft doesn't
work i don't know that it's invalid for me to
know that i have to go actually do a lot
of witchcraft try it out test it see uh maybe
there's something to it maybe i'll learn something from witchcraft
i can't just assume i can't even assume what witchcraft
is until i go and actually do it and i
have to keep an open mind such that if witchcraft
actually reveals something to me that is contrary to conventional
science or whatever i have to accept that and i
have to be willing to challenge conventional science because uh
my experiment shows that there's something to witchcraft and i
have to be willing to admit my mistake that you
know if i've been ridiculing witchcraft my whole life now
i have to admit that hey i was wrong how
many scientists are actually willing to do that actually very
few very few you see the problem with science is
that there are many domains of phenomenon within nature we
could say that all that nature is is just a
collection of phenomena that's it there's nothing we have of
nature but phenomena different kinds we have phenomena of the
earth in the oceans in the sky in the in
outer space that's all it is it's different phenomena we
have phenomena dreaming we have phenomena thinking seeing hearing that's
all phenomena and as we explore more and more phenomena
this opens up new fields and new domains of phenomena
that previously were inaccessible to us and as we do
science and we develop new technology that opens up new
fields for example when we first started you know we
couldn't really explore under the oceans and now we can
we couldn't go to the moon and into outer space
and now we can um and even with something like
uh psychedelics you know now with modern chemistry we can
take a certain chemical uh easily knowing what the chemical
is take it in isolation from other chemicals and we
can test its results and impact on phenomena but the
problem is is that we are opening up new domains
of phenomena and there's always the methodological meta-scientific question of
which of these domains are valid and what are the
methods by which we will investigate these domains different methods
are required for different domains the method that you're going
to use underwater is not the same method that you
use for studying microscopic stuff and not the same method
that you study you know the cosmos with not the
same method that you study sexuality with not the same
method you used to study you know chimp behavior and
chimp psychology not the same method you used to study
human politics not the same method that used to study
uh consciousness the inner human mind and psyche these all
require different methods which means that ultimately scient the scientific
method has to be so broad to encompass all of
that that in a sense there's a problem here if
you try to make the scientific method too narrow and
confined and limited that excludes certain domains of phenomena and
then you don't count that phenomenon as evidence anymore as
data it's excluded by your method and then there's a
sort of a catch-22 here because once your method is
so narrow that it excludes an entire domain of reality
a phenomenon when someone comes to you and says hey
your method is too narrow let's expand your method because
look there's some data here outside of your method which
obviously contradicts or you know your method can't account for
what is the person who is locked into their method
say in response he says what are you talking about
that's pseudoscience that's hocus pocus because my method says so
but that's begging the question because the whole question is
how do you know that your method is accounting for
all the phenomena of nature you didn't know that from
the beginning you never had an ability to validate your
method because in order for you to know that your
method was valid and could accommodate all of the phenomena
of of nature you would have to completely know the
truth the only way to empirically validate the entire well
to empirically validate the scientific method would be to explore
the entire universe in totality and to know every fact
about the universe and only then you could say in
retrospect that yeah our method was valid but of course
if you knew that you wouldn't need to do science
the whole purpose behind science is that science is supposed
to be the thing that distinguishes truth from falsehood and
uh in a sense we're developing the method as we're
using the method because we were never given the method
to begin with we had to develop it as we
were going there's a great metaphor by otto neurath philosopher
of science in the 1900s where he he said our
situation epistemically is something akin to trying to build a
ship at sea we find ourselves floating in the sea
without a ship and we have to build it while
we're floating we're not building it on land there's no
foundation we're creating the foundation as we go so you
see the greatest danger with any kind of pursuit of
knowledge is that your theory and your speculations and assumptions
and prejudices when they're not grounded in inexperience leads you
into delusion but modern science itself fails to clear its
own bar it's like modern science has set this high
bar of testing everything against experience but modern science has
not been able to test the scientific method itself against
experience because that would require investigating the entire universe which
obviously it hasn't done so modern science can't clear its
own method can't i mean can't clear its own bar
that's the irony in the contradiction of it open mindedness
and neutrality are key in doing scientific investigation and contrary
to popular belief most scientists are not open-minded nor are
they neutral modern science tacitly holds a materialist realist objectivist
metaphysics this metaphysics has not cleared the bar of empirical
validation it has not been validated and yet it's held
as true just like the gods of that tribal shaman
people and the flowers the whole problem is that you're
holding metaphysical and methodological biased dogma and you're not willing
to surrender it because you're attached to it which is
the exact problem of religion it's the problem of the
human mind this is a much broader problem than just
religion so the fundamental epistemic problem is this we start
from a position of total ignorance we cannot know how
to distinguish truth from falsehood if we did life would
be easy but we don't there cannot be an explicit
method for doing science because knowing the validity of the
method would require no knowing everything about reality which obviously
we don't therefore this is the contradiction of science is
that uh your faith in the scientific method is not
the product of rigorous testing and validation therefore in fact
it's not scientific and it's appropriate to call it faith
literally scientists have faith blind faith in the scientific method
and this is what gets them in trouble because their
method is limited and it will always be found limited
in the future it will always need to be expanded
there's a further problem here which i call the circularity
problem the problem of question begging within science and it
goes something like this how is the scientific method validated
if you use the scientific method to validate the scientific
method then science is circular similar to religion so one
of the critiques leveled against religious people like a christian
for example is a scientific person or an atheist will
speak with a christian and uh ask the christian like
well so you believe god exists how do you know
god exists and the christian will confidently say well the
bible says so and the atheist will say well sure
it says so but how do you know the bible
is true and the christian will say well it was
the bible was written by god obviously and the atheists
will say but that's circular logic you see how can
i argue with you when you're when you're justifying your
worldview in a circle and then he'll smugly say this
as though he's superior he's in a superior position but
then we take a scientist and we have the exact
same problem i tell the scientist well okay so you're
scientists you believe in science how do you know it's
valid well the scientific method is valid how do you
know that well because obviously we've used the scientific method
to validate science it's a closed circle you see the
problem here is that if there is any mistake within
your scientific method that you're not conscious of you will
be using that method to validate your own method thereby
doubling down on the mistake therefore creating a blind spot
within your method therefore data outside your method will not
have a way of entering into your method because you're
going to be in denial about it because you assume
your method is true without ever validating it other than
through your method it's sort of like saying i'm always
right well but how do you know you're always right
well because i always feel that i'm right but what
about in this case when you're wrong well that that
case i can't be wrong because i feel that i'm
right yeah but what if you're feeling that you're right
isn't right and it's wrong but i feel that it's
right yeah that's the problem that's the whole problem you
got to see through that and in order to see
through that see you can't do it with science you
need meta science to be able to do this because
if you're only confining yourself to science and one of
the tricks the scientific mind uses it says well but
i have to stick to science i can't go outside
of science because if i go outside of science then
that's falsehood meta science that's woo stuff leo that's not
truth but you see that's exactly what the religious person
is doing like if i tell a muslim for example
hey take some psychedelics and uh maybe you'll discover that
there's something outside of islam or like go study some
christian texts and you'll discover something outside of islam to
the to the muslim this is this you can't do
that because for him to even go into a christian
church is already a violation of his own faith you
see that's something evil that's something wrong so he's never
going to go he's never going to read about christianity
he's not going to read about buddhism he's not going
to take a psychedelic why because his worldview tells him
that that's all false that's all the work of satan
right now you scientists don't have an idea of satan
but you behave in the exact same way anything outside
your narrow confines of science you consider invalid and yet
of course the very confines of science have never been
validated so there you go that's your problem right there
so actually in truth it's impossible to distinguish science from
pseudoscience if you could do that you would already have
all the truth in the universe and therefore you would
need to do science it begs the question when you
assume that you can distinguish science from pseudoscience which is
why it's so silly you know people on reddit and
youtube and elsewhere you know the you know they make
these accusations like oh that's pseudoscience but actually you don't
know that you're begging the question there is no clear
line between science and pseudoscience you have to do science
to distinguish between the two there's also no clear line
between science and philosophy in fact science is a subset
of philosophy and historically you should know this if you've
taken some philosophy classes is that of course science used
to be called natural philosophy science is an offshoot a
branch from philosophy and the reason that is that that's
not just an accident it had to be that way
because the only way you can do science is from
a larger domain of meta science in a sense the
meta science comes first before the science and when you
forget that and then you dismiss philosophy this is also
part of the myth of science is this misconception that
ah well philosophy this is not true science we don't
have anything to do with philosophy if we if we
take philosophy seriously that actually dilutes our science makes it
less pure nothing could be further from the truth look
at this the belief that philosophy is dumb and irrelevant
and unscientific and unnecessary to the hard sciences is itself
an untested metaphysical epistemic claim which you hold unconsciously what
you have to notice here is that your mind your
ego mind is playing tricks on you it's constantly the
power of the ego mind is that it has the
power to dismiss or to deny anything that it wants
or doesn't like you can deny any point any fact
any interpretation any argument any logic at any time as
long as it suits you and you will convince yourself
that what you're doing is truthful when actually it's just
self-serving you see the problem fundamentally with scientists is that
they want to turn science into a dumb brute mechanical
process where you just have this like meat grinder you
put the meat at the top of the meat grinder
you spin the wheel like an idiot you know you
just spin the wheel like an idiot and then scientific
facts and truth comes out the other end like that
this is the ultimate ideal of objectivity the human aspect
of science is completely taken out you don't need any
intelligent you don't need any thought there's no relativity there's
no subjectivity it's just a meat grinder just stuff it
in the meat grinder grind it up and truth will
come out this is not how science actually works and
in fact when you conceive of science in this way
there is nothing scientific about that conception firstly realize that
secondly when you conceive of science that way you're going
to get bad science because there's going to be aspects
of nature which do not align with your meat grinder
approach to studying nature you can't just assume that oh
well nature should fit into my neat grinder neatly no
no no you have to ask nature hey nature are
you the kind of thing that will fit through a
meat grinder and then come out the other end in
a truthful way or not and then let nature tell
you whether that's going to work or not and what
you'll discover is that nature will rebuke you for being
so stupid to think that nature is so simple that
it can be reduced in such a dumb mechanical way
you've underestimated nature and you've done so from a meta
scientific position what you're doing is not science even though
you're calling it science that's the problem what you call
science is not really science it's stupidity it's closed-mindedness it's
the limits of your own ego mind which you're not
recognizing because you don't take self-awareness as an important aspect
of science you think you can do science out there
in the world without deeply self-reflecting about the very mechanism
through which you're doing science which is your ego mind
and of course that's going to create serious serious epistemic
scientific blunders so i'm not saying that you need to
deconstruct science because science is being mean to religion i'm
saying you need to deconstruct science for the benefit of
science itself because it's like science is punching itself in
the face you might think that logic and reason here
can save you from this problem of circularity it can't
because logic and reason itself faces the same problem of
circularity how do you know which reasons are valid those
of you who i call rationalists who think that the
world is rational and you can just distinguish truth from
falsehood through rationality this is complete nonsense this itself is
irrational everybody who's ever believed anything crazy or false throughout
all of human history has always had good reasons and
logic behind their beliefs that being the case how can
you ever ever think that you could trust logic and
reason logic and reason are completely co-opted by the ego
mind you can't trust them there is in fact no
distinction no clear distinction between the reasonable and the unreasonable
the rational and the irrational the notion of rational is
actually culturally defined it's a culturally defined notion and word
which evolves and changes over time what is considered rational
today is not always considered rational 100 years ago or
a thousand years ago and it's not going to be
what is rational 500 years from now by future generations
how do you know what is rational that's the problem
right now i want to read you a quote here
from a great philosopher of science paul feyrobin he writes
extensively on this topic this is uh if you want
more on this you can read his book called against
method and other books that he has about this topic
he says quote one can show the following given any
rule however fundamental or necessary for science there are always
circumstances when it is advisable not only to ignore the
rule but to adopt its opposite the material which a
scientist actually has at his disposal his laws his experimental
results his mathematical techniques his epistemological prejudices his attitude towards
the absurd consequences of the theories which he accepts is
indeterminate in many ways ambiguous and never fully separated from
the historical background this material is always contaminated by principles
which he does not know and which if known would
be extremely difficult to test end quote and i have
another quote here from louis de broglie who was one
of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics in the early
1900s he writes quote the history of science shows that
the progress of science has constantly been hampered by the
tyrannical influence of certain misconceptions that finally came to be
considered as dogma for this reason it is proper to
submit periodically to a very searching examination principles which we
have come to assume without any more discussion end quote
and one more quote here from max born who is
also one of the early founding fathers of quantum mechanics
he writes quote i believe there is no philosophical high
road in science with epistemological signposts no we are in
a jungle and find our way by trial and error
building our road behind us as we proceed we do
not find signposts at crossroads but our own scouts erect
them to help the rest end quote so a lot
of what we consider science is actually retroactive justifications for
a process of trial and error a very complex messy
hairy process of trial and error which was actually never
this simple process of the meat grinder it was a
deeply intuitive human process with many errors and pitfalls and
a great price was paid to get to the point
we're at now but you should always be careful that
you can't assume it's just going to be simple from
here on out it wasn't easy to get here and
it won't be easy to get to the next step
what got us here is not what is what is
not what's going to get us to the next step
all right now let's move on to the next point
this is a big one on the one hand science
wants to claim that it is strictly empirical yet in
practice it's highly theoretical and most of the people involved
in science actually do zero empirical work the myth of
science tells us that science is 99 fact and one
percent interpretation or theory actually it's exactly the opposite science
is 99 interpretation in theory and conjecture and speculation and
interpretation and assumption and all this and one percent only
one percent of any kind of empirical fact science has
never been a set of individual raw facts like some
database or excel spreadsheet the myth of scientism paints science
this way when you start to conceive of science as
just an excel spreadsheet of raw facts that are objectively
true uh that are unbiased and independent of humans this
this whole view of looking at nature in reality is
so simplistic it's so dumb it's so counterproductive to doing
quality science it's just it's also completely historical i want
you to see that science is full of simplifications and
idealizations even the most simple statements that you might think
are just brute facts brood objective facts are not something
like for example the the statement lemons are yellow first
of all i'll ask you is that a scientific fact
is that an objective scientific fact many people would say
yes it is we can prove it with science really
though you're going to claim that's an objective scientific fact
can you see how problematic this is this idea of
lemons are yellow this is not a fact you find
in the world you don't go out with a measuring
stick and find the truth that lemons are yellow uh
first of all what is meant by a lemon and
what is meant by yellow these are not simple notions
these are complex notions that are intertwined with language and
language is intertwined with metaphysics very deeply so the notion
of a lemon what counts as a lemon what if
there exists you know most conventional lemons that they sell
at the supermarket are yellow when they're ripe but before
they're ripe they're green so does that count see you
have to exclude that if so no what i really
meant to say is that ripe yellow ripe lemons are
yellow not the little green ones okay um but see
you have to qualify these statements this is a deeply
subjective relativistic human enterprise this is not objective fact and
then what happens when there are different species of levens
what if there's a a species of lemon that's genetically
engineered in the future that's going to be blue is
that that's going to invalidate your claim um and then
what even counts as a lemon is there even such
a thing as a lemon i mean conventionally speaking we
know what lemons are but ultimately there's no such thing
as lemons there are individual lemons so we've created this
abstract category called lemon but really there are millions and
billions of specific lemons and these lemons are always changing
science itself tells us that these lemons are evolving that
means no two lemons have the same dna they're always
evolving mutations in the dna and so forth new species
can be uh you know born any at any time
um and then what what counts as yellow i mean
is a lemon really yellow are all parts of it
yellow what about little dots there they're kind of more
brown and black um and then different there are different
shades of yellow like so what counts as yellow at
what point is it green rather than yellow or more
of a kind of a brownish color you see this
is all extremely subjective so the idea that lemons are
yellow is some objective fact no i mean it's it's
it's a gross abstraction gross abstraction how about the statement
the earth is round you might say well it's round
but is it though what counts as the earth i
mean like if you actually look at the mountain ranges
of the earth i mean assuming you you buy the
idea that the earth is not flat let's just take
that one for granted but assuming you buy the idea
that the earth is spherical um but when you actually
zoom into the mountain ranges i mean they're not ra
they're not round at all so what does it mean
to say the earth is around like how far do
you have to zoom out if you're zoomed in enough
the earth doesn't look round when you're on the earth
it doesn't look around at all to say the earth
is round when you're standing on it is rather absurd
you you have to zoom out so you have to
zoom out but then so when you say the earth
is round you're sort of privileging the zoomed out position
rather than the zoomed in position which is true see
and and what does round mean at what point does
an object go from being round to not round is
there a clear boundary there you see these these are
very tricky thorny philosophical linguistic metaphysical issues science is completely
intertwined with culture with language with philosophy with with with
basically everything you can conceive of it's this giant mess
which makes it so challenging how about for example evolution
you say well science has proven evolution evolution i mean
i'll agree with you let's say let's let's just grant
that science that's proven evolution okay fine um i'm not
gonna dispute that but let's um but this idea that
evolution is an objective empirical fact this is very problematic
you don't go out into nature and find evolution you
don't see evolution every anywhere evolution involves a lot of
theory assumption conjectures connecting various kinds of dots in abstract
ways over time you don't just find evolution hanging on
a tree branch this is a highly conceptual scheme model
that is invented in the mind of man and then
is projected onto nature to explain certain facts and certain
phenomena that are happening it's a very powerful model it's
it's great in certain ways but consider that that is
something the human mind is projecting onto the facts it's
not strictly empirical it's way more than empirical uh how
about the example with with dinosaur skeletons did you know
first of all that when you go to a museum
and you look at dinosaurs the thing you're looking at
it's not even a real dinosaur skeleton the real dinosaur
skeleton that's a fake the real ones are like in
there you know in the back room somewhere uh but
even assuming the real ones uh you know when you
see dinosaurs in jurassic park or you even see them
like on the discovery channel they have those documentaries with
the dinosaurs they show their skeletons a lot of times
the skeletons they show i'm not even talking about the
bodies but just the skeletons alone most dinosaur skeletons are
very incomplete like a lot of times when they find
a t-rex or something it's going to be only 10
complete 20 complete rarely do you find 100 complete skeleton
even 80 would be amazing to find so usually what
scientists do is they take multiple skeletons from different parts
of the world of the same species they think or
roughly the same and then they come they try to
combine them together to create you know as whole of
a skeleton as they can and even when they do
that they still don't reach 100 then what they do
is they they extrapolate and interpolate you know like we
have this bone here and that bone here and then
like what what what would it look like in the
middle we don't have that but we can kind of
guess maybe what that is and then they guess it
so that i mean i'm using this example because it's
perfect to illustrate just how unempirical the whole process is
and how much it involves guesswork and interpolation and so
forth and i'm not even mentioning you know when they
actually flush out the the flesh of the skull of
the of the skeleton of the dinosaur and they paint
it various colors is that science when they paint a
t-rex certain colors that's science we don't know what what
color the t-rex was we don't really even know if
it had feathers or not or what it really um
we don't really even know if it was like warm-blooded
or cold-blooded or something in between these are all open
questions um now that doesn't invalidate dinosaur science it just
it just shows you the challenges of science it's not
as clear-cut as it is painted out to be by
many folks similar with for example the atomic model the
classic atomic model where you have like a ball the
you know the nucleus of the atom is the ball
with electrons on the balls spinning around in circular orbits
this this has been completely debunked by quantum mechanics in
the early 1900s and yet this simple atomic model is
still the kind of model that most people are walking
around in in their minds with and they really think
that like my hand is made out of these little
you know little balls of rotating molecules and stuff like
that that's how they make sense of reality what difference
is there really between that absurd model that's completely false
versus the tribes people who had a little who had
their own model about you know how the flower is
you know coming from the water deity or whatever or
the the war god or something like that what difference
is there they're equally false they're equally fictitious and yet
these models can still be useful in explaining nature so
see the problem with science is that since science does
a lot of modeling mostly what it does you can
have a lot of different models for the same amount
of data this leads us to this problem in science
called the under determination problem what this means the under
determination problem means that given a set of raw data
points let's say i have five raw data points i
can create many models and many explanations for that for
those five data points this model will account for these
five data points and then usually it'll also have implications
for future data points these models what makes them different
is that they have different implications for the future data
points even though they all account for the original five
if they're a good model so this gives us hundreds
of potentially different models which could account for different data
points some of these models could be identical some of
them could be interchangeable but others not and it's very
difficult to tell which model is right which was wrong
and this is a lot of what science is about
and a lot of what you understand of nature how
you conceive of stars and planets and the earth and
atoms and whatever evolution is all models highly conceptual abstract
stuff fantasies in the minds of man not objective fact
and these models can change but we get attached to
these models because these models create a sense of reality
for our ego they're more than just models for predicting
data they are ways of making sense of reality and
then once our mind gets stuck with those ways of
making sense it can't shift it's like a record stuck
on a groove and it can't get out of that
groove and then it denies other models and it mistakes
those models for reality itself for truth but truth is
not a model that's something we'll talk about more in
future episodes so the reality is that all of science
is theory laden deeply theory laden and in fact the
idea that you can separate fact from theory at all
is a complete illusion no such separation is possible the
way science really works is that science is a giant
web of ideas all validating each other in a giant
web in a circle every idea is pointing to other
ideas these ideas loosely connect on the periphery to some
sort of empirical data which really that's not objective truth
what it's connecting to is different measurements from our instruments
for example you weigh an apple and that data point
is on the periphery of this field of science that
you have and then you measure the length of a
kangaroo and you put that number here then you measure
your height you put it here then you measure something
else you put it here and all these different measurements
and that's just the thin periphery of this field and
then on the inside though is all of the way
that you're making sense of all this data and this
can be rearranged in a million different ways it can
be secular it can be religious it can be new
age it can be witchcraft on the inside accounting for
the same data so the religious person in a sense
is also doing science um they're still accounting for the
same data for example a religious person still has to
explain why the earth is here why they're dinosaurs uh
you know what atoms are et cetera et cetera they
all they still have to explain all the same all
that data they just explain it in a different way
and what you take objection to is not the data
but how to explain the data and which data to
focus on and how to interpret the data and what
the data means because raw data in and of itself
means nothing to you as a human as an ego
i can give you a giant spreadsheet you know a
million pages long of various data about nature and it
means absolutely zero to you that's not what you care
about that's not what you argue about when you're in
some argument on youtube or on reddit about some scientific
fact or some new age nonsense that you think needs
to be debunked you're not arguing about data you're arguing
about your interpretations and you're the way you're making sense
of reality and the reason you're getting emotional about it
and the reason you're getting triggered about it you don't
get triggered by data nobody gets triggered by data the
ego gets triggered and emotional about things that threaten its
survival that's one of the clues so science scientific statements
are tested as a whole body they are not tested
as individual statements in fact it is impossible for example
to take a statement such as lemons are yellow and
to validate that statement in isolation by itself that's a
myth you can't actually do that to test whether the
statement lemons are yellow is actually true what you're doing
is you're bringing in your entire web of meaning making
language culture various assumptions logic and so forth you're bringing
that in and then your methodological assumptions about how to
actually test that lemons are yellow what constitutes a valid
test and all of that you're bringing in there and
much of the that meta baggage that you're bringing in
that meta science um you're not even conscious of what
that stuff is and you're pretending as though you're neutral
and that stuff is just a given it's obvious when
in fact it's not no fact means anything in isolation
from the framework that it's looked at from interpretation is
unavoidable in science there are also methodological questions that are
relativistic and problematic such as which phenomena to study which
phenomena is worth studying because there's a near endless amount
of phenomena in nature to study what do you study
what do you allocate funds and time to your energy
to your finite time energy and money which questions do
you ask because the questions you ask determine the answers
you get back if you don't ask a certain question
you will get a certain answer this is highly relative
and subjective which experiments do you run how do you
design your experiments how do you know which experiments uh
which experimental designs are proper and which are improper which
are going to buy you know how you design your
experiment biases the results you get back and then how
do you interpret the results of those experiments how do
you categorize things that's another relativizing factor you know even
categories like lemons or limes or citruses or oranges or
you know fruits vegetables these sorts of categories these are
highly relative and subjective and they're fuzzy it's not so
clear how to categorize such things there are no clear
objective categories found within nature our mind is projecting those
onto nature and how we carve up nature that's relative
that's arbitrary in a certain sense and that's different for
different people and that leads to different results and different
meanings and different models and different interpretations and different sense
making frameworks just by changing the way you categorize things
changes your science changes your understanding of reality you have
to be very careful about your categories most people just
assume that nature comes with categories but categories are not
objective nature has no inherent categories baked into them other
than what the ego mine projects there's also the question
of which relationships between the data you emphasize so a
lot of what science is is a it's a pattern
recognition if we think of everything in the universe as
just being points of data any two particular points can
have some kind of complex relationship or a simple relationship
you have to you can think of science as finding
connections between these different data points and the relationships cataloging
the relationships between them for example one data point might
be the the sun one might be the earth and
then we we track the relationship between the sun and
the earth that might be an elliptical orbit another example
might be the relationship between like rabbit populations and wolf
populations you know as the rabbit population increases the wolf
population follows suit because there's more for them to eat
and then when the wolves eat the rabbits too much
the rabbits dwindle and so does the wolves because they
run out food and there's a complex relationship there and
basically all of science can be thought of as that
way in a sense of course that's a very limited
way to think of it but that's one way to
think of it and um the question becomes which of
these relationships do we focus on and emphasize and track
that's going to change your entire world view depending on
which relationships there's an infinite number of relationships in a
sense which relationships you pick is biased you're going to
pick the ones that are relevant to you because of
your survival needs usually even something like object permanence that
we take for granted you know children don't have object
permanents when they're really young when they see like a
ball pass behind a an obstacle like a wall that
occludes it and then pass through the other side they
don't recognize that that's a single object to them that's
like one object here and then a second object appears
there now you might say well that's because children are
stupid or that's because you're actually interpreting to have object
permanence you have to actually make assumptions and in fact
science doesn't prove object permanence it's still an assumption every
time you close your eyes when you're looking at the
moon every time you turn your back on the moon
technically empirically speaking if you want to be very strict
if you want to be very empirical what's happening is
the moon is being destroyed and created destroyed and created
and it's happening thousands of times but you don't conceive
of the moon as an object that is con that
is destroyed and created nor do you conceive of the
moon as an object that is different for every person
that's looking at it you can see of the moon
as one single object that's the same for everybody that's
a problem because that's not empirically true if you believe
that you're doing a lot of behind the scenes metaphysical
speculation and assumption making see now i want to conclude
here start to conclude by reading extensively from willard klein
he was a brilliant philosopher of science in the early
1900s who made a very powerful articulation of this idea
of science as this web of belief that is tested
as a whole all the stuff that we've been talking
about so let's listen to what he has to say
he says quote the totality of our so-called knowledge or
beliefs from the most casual matters of geography and history
to the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even pure
mathematics and logic is a man-made fabric which impinges on
experience only along the edges or to change the figure
total science is like a field of force whose boundary
conditions are experience a conflict with experience at the periphery
occasions readjustments in the interior of the field the total
field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions experience that
there is much latitude of choice as to what statements
to reevaluate in light of any single contrary experience no
particular experiences are linked with any particular statements in the
interior of the field except indirectly through considerations of equilibrium
affecting the field as a whole if this view is
right it is misleading to speak of the empirical content
of an individual statement especially if it be a statement
at all remote from the experiential periphery of the field
any statement can be held true come what may if
we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system even
a statement very close to the periphery can be held
true in the face of recalcitrant experience by pleading hallucination
or amending certain statements of the kind called logical laws
revision even of the logical law of the excluded middle
has been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics
and what difference is there in principle between such a
shift and the shift whereby kepler superseded tolmie einstein newton
or darwin aristotle for my part i do quality physicists
believe in physical objects and not in homer's gods and
i consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise but
in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the
gods differ only in degree and not in kind both
sorts of entities enter our conception only as cultural posits
the myth of physical objects is epistemically superior to most
in that it proved more efficacious than other myths as
a device for working a manageable structure into the flux
of experience end quote it's powerful stuff and there was
a point i forgot to mention which i want to
go back to which is the point about psychedelics so
remember that example that i gave with galileo looking through
the through the telescope and the his colleagues unable to
you know to be convinced by that you might say
well that kind of stuff doesn't happen today in science
you know those were those were silly religious people who
were closed-minded and and stupid because they were brainwashed by
religion but today science is more sophisticated than that we're
better than that today but the same problem exists today
almost exactly the same problem because if i go to
a serious scientist at mit and i tell him here
i found this substance called 5meodmt you take this and
it will provide evidence of paranormal things to you uh
what are they gonna do are they gonna say oh
great how wonderful you've made a amazing contribution to science
let me try it of course not of course not
they're gonna immediately dismiss this as a hallucination they're gonna
dismiss it as invalid science and uh they're never actually
gonna test it just like with witchcraft they're never gonna
test witchcraft because their culture taught them that witchcraft is
bad and their culture taught them that psychedelics are bad
and they just believe their culture without questioning it now
of course they're going to deny my point here by
saying that well leo we can't question or we can't
personally test every crackpot theory that's out there and there's
a lot of crackpot theories and people peddling all sorts
of [ __ ] hey you're right of course that's
the whole problem that's the whole problem of epistemology discovering
truth and separating out from falsehood is highly highly non-trivial
and it's extremely costly and in fact it even comes
with risks serious risks even to your own life and
if you're unwilling to take these risks and to pay
these costs then you're not a true scientist you're not
in the business of science science is all about taking
calculated risks exploring uncharted territory you see it's very easy
to explore already charted territory that's what most scientists are
in the business of doing but when it comes to
exploring truly uncharted territory that's where they get scared that's
where they screw up to explore truly uncharted territory this
takes a special kind of mind a meta-scientific mind that
can go beyond science see science contrary to the opinions
of rationalists science requires really good holistic intelligence and judgment
and wisdom beyond anything explicable or formidable formally provable again
this goes back to that meat grinder analogy the ideal
of most rationalists is that they just want to design
some sort of mechanical proof proof generating system that will
be able to easily adjudicate between truth and falsehood and
they assume that such a thing is possible but actually
it's not the nature of reality as such is that
it's so complex and sprawling and counter-intuitive that you can't
capture it with any kind of simple linear formal mechanical
system and historically the best scientists are the ones who
had a deep holistic intelligence and were able to think
meta scientifically not within the confines of that meat grinder
those were the scientists who made the greatest contributions to
science these are the newtons the einsteins uh and so
on there's many more that i can mention but we're
running short on time so what you have to understand
is that your proofs and your reasons these occur in
retrospect to make scientific scientific discovery possible at all what's
required is something beyond science meta-scientific something science cannot explain
which is holistic intelligence or intuition so the great contradiction
and irony of the rationalists is that the greatest advancements
within logic itself were actually made through intuition and the
greatest advancements in science and mathematics have been made through
leaps in consciousness and intuition by genius visionary scientists not
by uh brute force mechanical methods of some sort of
meat grinder method that was dogmatically stuck to that way
you just get business as usual you don't get new
groundbreaking discoveries that way all right i have more that
i wanted to say here but we're running short on
time so i'm going to leave that content for future
episodes i just want to end here i guess on
one final quote by einstein einstein said this quote so
many people today even professional scientists seem to me like
somebody who has seen thousands of trees but never seen
a forest a knowledge of the historic and philosophical background
gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation
from which most scientists are suffering this independence created by
philosophical insight is in my opinion the mark of distinction
between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker
of truth end quote that's albert einstein and albert einstein
is a really amazing guy who i recommend you study
his work more deeply study the meta scientific aspects of
his work because there were sort of two sides to
einstein one side of him was the scientist the technical
scientist the other side of him was the philosopher and
the epistemologist and really i spent i spent many hours
studying uh how einstein saw science and saw philosophy and
saw the world and it's remarkable because he himself attributes
his groundbreaking paradigm-shattering breakthroughs with the development of general relativity
you know when when he was asked what is it
that allowed you to make this what is the biggest
scientific discovery basically in all of human history why was
he the one who was able to make this discovery
and what he said was that because his colleagues were
just basically involved in technical science whereas he from an
early age because he was introduced to several books about
uh philosophy of science and epistemic problems within science basically
meta science he spent a lot of time thinking deeply
about meta scientific issues and that is what allowed him
to be able to run circles around his colleagues think
outside the box that they were all thinking inside of
and to start to question something as obvious as for
example absolute time and space and uh to realize that
time and space are not absolutes but are actually relative
and the reason he was able to do that was
because he took these philosophical and meta-scientific issues these epistemological
issues very seriously and he was critical of those scientists
who poo poo that stuff as though it wasn't important
but then again he was a brilliant scientist doing groundbreaking
research whereas most scientists aren't doing that so maybe they
don't need it i'll i'll end on one final quote
of einstein's which is quote i want to know god's
thoughts the rest are details all right that's it for
part one but we're just getting warmed up just getting
warmed up you think this was a lot no we
haven't even covered a third of the material that i
have to cover so to be continued in part two
next week stay tuned uh i wanna remind you to
please if you have any questions or objections or counter
arguments post them down below under under this episode and
i will read through them and then try to incorporate
the best ones in part four to address all that
all right that's uh that's it i'm done here please
click that like button for me and come check out
actualize.org that's my website there you will find my blog
with exclusive content that i post some of my best
stuff goes on the blog and can only be found
there so make sure you check it out it's free
come check out the book list which is going to
be actually very valuable for you in this domain because
on my book list i have some powerful amazing books
that deal with these topics these heavy topics of epistemology
metaphysics philosophy of science make sure you go read those
books on my book list they will really ground you
in this material and help you with your own contemplations
and also help bolster some of the points that i'm
making here you know i make a lot of radical
points at times and it can seem sometimes that like
leo is off in his own little bubble world by
himself and he's just making [ __ ] up and
whatever uh actually no if you go read the the
books on my book list you'll see just how much
confirmation there is from other great intellectuals and thinkers throughout
history of the things that i'm talking about i'm not
just pulling these ideas out of my ass there is
a lot of historical background and context and and justification
for many of the things that i say i am
standing on the shoulders of giants but the problem is
that most people have not read what these giants have
thought so it can seem like i'm just pulling stuff
out of my ass when in fact i'm pulling a
lot of stuff from history and from you know great
thinkers both contemporary ones and ancient ones uh but if
you don't do the reading i assume you do the
reading if you don't do the reading you're going to
be completely lost with my material it's it's way too
advanced to not do the reading so go check out
those books check out my life purpose course if you
want to find your life purpose come hang out on
the forum ask questions discuss things for free on the
forum and you can support me if you'd like if
you like this content and you want to see more
of it and more of this kind of in-depth research
available in the future without a bunch of crazy advertising
