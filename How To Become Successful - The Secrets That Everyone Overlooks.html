hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org and
this is a quick self-help segment we're in about 10
minutes or less I'm going to tell you how to
become successful so this is a big topic to bite
off and in fact this is one of my favorite
topics to talk about this is why I created my
website actualize that org is to really understand the psychology
of success and that is such a deep rabbit hole
to go down I literally have hundreds of ideas on
this so here in this quick little segment I'm just
going to give you some of the some of the
basics some of the fundamentals maybe some of the practical
things that you can do and actually I'm actually going
to reference Arnold Schwarzenegger who has was a great video
on this where he talks about his six principles for
success so I'm going to reference a little bit of
that and throw into my ideas so his six principle
of success all right I'm going to just list them
out one trust yourself to break the rules three don't
fear failure four don't listen to the naysayers five work
your butt off and six give back so let's cover
some of these and some other ideas so first of
all trust yourself I think here what he's saying is
that you have to really understand yourself you understand what
you want out of life what do you really value
what do you find meaningful what are you passionate about
you have to align your passion with your work because
if those two are not aligned you will not be
successful I guarantee it you will not be successful and
even if you are it's going to be very shallow
kind of success so you got to do a little
bit of self exploration that means go out and try
some stuff if you're still early in your life you
haven't had a lot of jobs go out and experiment
and just see what resonates with you because you don't
even know what you like yet if you're a little
bit older you've probably already had a little bit of
that experience so you're more cognizant of what you like
and what you don't like you have more stipulations so
you have to go and sit down and really write
this out to be very methodical and strategic about what
you want you have to get clear about your values
you have to get clear about your top five feelings
you have to get clear about your life purpose and
all these topics I cover really really in-depth in on
actualized org with other videos so you might want to
check those out but knowing yourself is very very important
otherwise you're not going to your work is not going
to be aligned the next thing is I would say
the hard work hard work is really really important to
be successful and to be at the top like ten
percent of the population in terms of success all those
people work their ass off you're not going to be
successful without hard work and the reason mostly is not
even they have to go out there and and build
a giant Empire or you have to a mass amount
of money or work long hours it's not even so
much about that it's that you need to develop yourself
because success is not so much an outer world state
as an inner world state and that might sound kind
of hokey a new age but it's very very true
success is grounded within you you're not going to be
able to maintain any sort of level of success if
you do not have the psychology to really follow principles
to know how to maintain success to think strategically to
think long term to delay gratification to resist addictions all
these factors come into play so really for me success
is grounded in self mastery it's understanding yourself and then
building on that building disciplines building successful habits which then
move you towards where you want to be going the
next point is I think you got to really choose
a career path for yourself what is it that you're
going to be mastering I tell everybody to create a
personal mission statement and on that mission statement one of
the things that I instruct everybody to do all my
clients and all my listeners all my viewers is that
they need to pick one thing there to be mastering
over the next ten years that they're going to be
totally committed to so what does that think for you
you know are you like orange for Tiger and you
want to be the world's best bodybuilder do you want
to be the best computer programmer do you want to
be a highly paid movie star what do you want
to be doing with your life you want to be
an athlete there's all these infinite possibilities you have to
pick something and really commit to it and commit to
it and like burn all your bridges so that go
back so that there's only going forward and that no
matter what obstacles are on your way you're still going
to keep going because I guarantee there's gonna be obstacles
and the biggest problem with people not being successful is
that they dabble too much George Leonard talks about this
in his brilliant book mastery which you must read if
you want to become successful in life and I cover
that in other videos as well I have videos on
it that cover in depth reviews but you should also
check out the book itself is that most people are
dabblers that means that they do a little bit here
they do a little bit there they try this they
try that and they're all over the place they don't
have focus they're not committed to anything and with that
kind of mindset you cannot be successful you have to
put your time in success is a slow cooking recipe
it's like a stew right it's not a quick little
stir fry it's a stew it has to marinate and
that marination process it doesn't take a year it doesn't
take two years it takes more like 10 years or
20 years we're talking about decades so go into something
with that kind of mindset and you can already sense
that if you're going to be putting 10 to 20
years into something you have to know that what you're
putting it into is going to be something that's going
to be aligned with your values it's going to be
something that you find passion in something that you find
really meaningful something that you find rewarding something you find
interest in something that's fascinating to you and you're curious
about so what is that for you if you don't
know what that is you want to go out there
and explore maybe do some brainstorming do some journaling about
it start looking into that start finding that out you're
probably also going to want to go and and find
out what your major strengths are by taking the strength
survey at authentic happiness calm its pre-survey for Martin Seligman
he's the founder of the positive psychology movement and there
if you take that survey it'll give you your top
5 strengths out of a list of 24 and those
strengths should strongly guide you in the direction of where
you want your career path to go and so you'll
have to think about that the other thing I would
say is figure out exactly what you don't want because
sometimes we know what we want but we don't think
about what we don't want and part of that for
example is people pursuing a career very rigorously like maybe
somebody wants to become a or a lawyer or they
want to become a CEO or or whatever professionally but
then they don't think about the lifestyle that comes with
that so it's very important to both think about your
career and your lifestyle simultaneously and to see how those
two are going to meet together how they're going to
dovetail you want them to dovetail well for example do
you want to do a lot of traveling do you
want to be living in different countries around the world
how important is money to you how important is financial
independence to you how important is creative autonomy to you
how important is that your job has a lot of
creativity how important is it that your job is you
sitting in a cubicle all by yourself and being able
to focus and concentrate or maybe you're the type of
person that really finds it interesting to be talking with
people all the time and you can't stand sitting in
a cubicle and you need to be in a very
social environment or maybe you can't even stand to be
in a social environment in an office you want to
be outside the office you want to be working in
the outdoors like you got to take all these factors
into consideration and write down a list of the things
that you know you absolutely don't want so maybe you
don't want to be working for somebody else that's important
that's something I had to find out the hard way
by going and working for somebody only to realize that
I cannot work for other people I'm too creative I'm
- I'm like - I'm too excited about getting my
own ideas out to be implementing somebody else's ideas so
for me that meant that my only real route was
entrepreneurship starting my own business working for myself being self-employed
so that was a big shift I had to make
and I lost some time and some some some opportunities
by not having to realize that earlier but sometimes you
got to make those mistakes to really understand it or
you can't just understand it in the abstract so you
got to go out there and experiment and try this
stuff around so success will come to you really if
you if you hit all these points you're working hard
you know yourself you're aligned with your life purpose you
know what that is and you've chosen a path of
mastery that means you're going to be very committed to
it for for years and decades it's going to be
hard to be a failure when you've got all those
elements in place and the last element that I'm going
to talk about really is this element of self matter
Street I think that's what ties it all together because
if you've got all those these these other points but
you don't have a really mastery of your own emotions
and mastery of your own psychology then what's going to
happen is that you're going to have problems that are
gonna creep up you're going to hit obstacles you're going
to have points where you're going to think about failing
you're going to have points about we're going to be
you're going to be feeling like you're not achieving as
much as you want to be you're going to have
points where maybe you have a major setback in your
business or in your career you get fired you get
laid off something like that you need to be able
to deal with those and you need to have awareness
and control over your emotions which is what I call
self mastery and that's a topic that's really deeply I'm
deeply passionate about that I cover very deeply in other
topics on actualize data log that you'll probably want to
check out in other videos but I think you got
to commit to that as well because if you're committed
to that then you're committed to really understanding your own
psychology and you're committed to mastering yourself well from that
flows everything else from that flows your your career from
that will also flow your relationships from that will flow
your money management abilities and your fitness and your your
ability to admit to do everything in life that's just
such a critical component and I think the other last
element kind of the cherry on top of it all
is that successful people study success they study other successful
people because success leaves Clues and you can see that
other successful people are doing something different that normal people
are doing and one of things they do differently is
that they interact with those successful people and they learn
from them and they buy books and they attend seminars
and they're always learning so you got to keep your
mind open always be committed to learning be curious about
everything and above everything study personal development because you're gonna
you're going to learn what the psychology of success is
when you read books every once in a while and
you attend a seminar once a year and you mastermind
with other successful people you're going to see the commonalities
and their success is going to rub off on you
not in the sense they're going money or fame or
something like that but I mean their their mindsets are
going to rub off on you and then you're going
to use those in your own unique way to go
out there and create the kind of success that you
want in your career and in your business wherever that
takes you whatever your path is and then of course
as Arnold Schwarzenegger says give back right success should not
be about accumulating a bunch of money or getting prestige
or fame success should be about you doing something positive
for the world and to be successful you need to
be aligned with value giving you cannot be a value
leech and be successful in the long run I see
people making this mistake you need to be a value
provider and you need to see that you're not just
providing value as in getting charity that's what I'm talking
about I'm saying you need to provide value in a
way where people are getting a lot more from you
than you're charging them and then when that is happening
then people want to be associated with you they want
to interact with you they want to hire you they
want to do business with you they want to become
your clients and through that process you cannot fail to
get success the fact is though that handling all those
points that I just mentioned even though it's simple it
can be challenging especially staying on track with that so
to help you do that that's why I create resources
on actualised org so I'm going to wrap up this
video here go ahead post your comments share it like
it but more importantly if you're really committed to success
I highly encourage you to go to actualize that org
check out our other advanced free videos some of our
courses there and sign up to the newsletter so that
you can be immersed in this in this theory of
success because I cover psychology success and pretty much every
single video that I shoot the more you learn it
the more you immerse yourself in it whether for me
or for somebody else I don't care the more successful
you're likely to be the more you're likely stay on
track with success because it's all about how long you're
able to to stay on course success is not a
sprint it's a marathon all right this is Leo signing
off you
