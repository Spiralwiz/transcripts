hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm gonna share some deep thoughts about what it
takes to really create an extraordinary kind of life a
kind of life that you might dream about the kind
of life that you would think is transformational for you
but the kind of life that you might also really
doubt whether it's possible for you in reality I want
to talk about how to really make it happen [Music]
hey okay welcome back so let's talk about how to
go about creating an extraordinary life before we do though
I want to talk about a little anecdote that I
remember hearing a long long time ago as a kid
and it went something like this there was an old
village out near a forest so this is an old-timey
type of village and in this village you know they
had shopkeepers they had they had bread makers and and
an artisans and in craftsmen and just residents living there
and one of the residents there was an old lady
and one night she just went out in to the
woods and she went off into the woods in order
to do some chore and then in the woods as
she was strolling through doing her thing she came across
a hungry savage wolf this wolf just ran up to
her and started growling it just opened its big mouth
its teeth its fangs you could see them salivating its
tongue was sticking out it was stalling at her it
was ready to bite her and this woman she was
terrified she didn't know what she was gonna do a
grown man could not fend off a wolf of that
size and would be scared because of those sharp teeth
nothing in your hands you have no weapon you have
nothing to fight it off with what do you do
it's right there it's in your face so what did
she do well she Mustard's some courage she reached out
her hand she grabbed the wolf by the tongue pulled
the tongue out took the wolf by the tongue held
it so tight that the wolf couldn't even do anything
couldn't bite down and dragged that wolf all the way
back to the village where finally when she got it
back to the village somebody was able to Club it
to death over the head all the time she was
holding that wolf by the tongue kind of cool huh
well what does this have to do with our topic
creating an extraordinary life well I've been getting some comments
on YouTube that I was looking at and I was
just thinking about more generally you know what is it
really gonna take because what I want for you guys
what gets me passion about putting out these videos and
just doing what I do is not to give you
a little boost and improvement in your life I mean
sure it's nice I can give you a little tip
a little piece of advice a little trick that will
help you to you know get a better job smoothing
out that relationship attract that girlfriend or boyfriend that you
want maybe improve your your marriage get your health and
do the better or improve your psychology in some way
stop some of that negative thinking that you always go
into so we have takes trips yeah tricks and tips
for solving those little problems and those are what I
would call techniques but what I really want you to
buy into and this is a problem this is the
idea of buying into something you have to buy into
the idea that you want to live your life big
it's kind of like an all-or-nothing thing if you have
asked your life you're gonna get a mediocre life I
hope you realized that this is what I'm trying to
drive home to you and that's the reason that I
use this example of the woman the old woman with
the wolf is in that scenario there was either two
ways that that was gonna play out one was that
the wolf was gonna maul her and it was gonna
eat her and there was nothing she was gonna do
about it - is the she could have gone full
out mustered the courage to get in there and grab
that wolf by the tongue and not let go think
about what that takes this is not a piddly little
commitment this is a commitment that you're making to yourself
that you want to go full-out your all-in you have
to be all-in this is your life you've only got
one of them this woman she realized that if she
was just gonna gently move her hand towards the wolf
what was gonna do it was gonna bite it off
she either had to reach in there and grab it
and hold on for life and never let go or
she was doomed that's kind of what I'm trying to
drive out you home here I'm trying to drive this
home for you is that stop looking for the quick
little solution stop looking for that little one tip or
trick that's gonna just make your life great that's not
how to create an extraordinary life that is how to
patch up a mediocre life and maintain mediocrity so I
see sometimes people posting like well that might be a
little too hard to do this thing here is not
practical this thing doesn't work that it up look it
works if you do it and you're committed to it
and many of the things that I'm sharing with you
will not work if you have acid and the important
thing here for me is not to teach you a
technique it's not to give you a tip I mean
that kind of draws you in this channel or this
video or this website you might look at and say
okay here's some quick little tricks that I can use
to make my steel myself feel a little happier to
make myself a little bit richer to improve my health
a little bit and that's great that will draw you
in but I also want to be real with you
here is that even though we can give you these
little patches to your mediocre life what we're really after
here my mission is to transform your life to revolutionize
your life I want you to be living an amazing
life all right something big and you know what I'm
talking about here this is the kind of life that
you envision for yourself at some point maybe when you
were a kid maybe in high school maybe in college
maybe afterwards maybe just a few years ago and maybe
now you've kind of forgotten about it because what tends
to happen is that everyday life overwhelms us and we
are faced with business concerns family concerns money concerns medical
problems relationship problems all of this stuff comes up and
it tends to take our focus away from the big
picture and what I have been thinking about lately is
this idea and I think this is so so so
true is that people who are struggling in their lives
people who do not have their lives together and I'm
just talking about even a baseline level who do not
have a baseline level of a good life the reason
that is is not because they're thinking too big it's
because they're thinking too small they think too small and
so they get what they think they get a small
life and then they rationalize it to themselves by saying
well if I stop big that would be too ambitious
if I thought big that would be too bold if
I thought big that would be too idealistic that doesn't
work in the real world let me tell you it
does work the reason you're saying that is because you're
actually not living up to deeper issues that you need
to resolve within your own ego well you're not living
up to is you're not living up to the courage
that you need to go out there and to live
an extraordinary life this takes courage if you had one
element that could help you really succeed here if I
could wish for one thing for you to have personally
as a personal trait I would say it's fearlessness I
want you to be fearless I want you to be
courageous because all these things that I'm talking about to
have them function for you and to have them build
up to the kind of life that you want to
even go and put yourself on a path towards building
a big life you have to have the courage to
delve into that that is not going to be something
that it's done overnight that is not something that's going
to be easy you are gonna have times when you
are gonna want to quit you're gonna have times when
you're gonna want to cry you're gonna have nights where
you're just gonna want to curl up on the couch
in a fetal position and cry yourself to sleep you're
gonna have nights like that and you know what that's
okay because what you're after is you're after something bigger
what's really sad is living that kind of mediocre life
that you're living right now that is what's really sad
working your ass off for something big and struggling through
that that's not sad that is the glory of life
that is what grows you that is what inspires you
that's what motivates you and that's what motivates other people
when other people see you living this kind of life
when you see yourself living this kind of life just
imagine what kind of challenges you have now will just
melt away this is an interesting point because a lot
of times people that are stuck in a mediocre or
even a really bad frustrating painful kind of life will
say well I've got bigger fish to fry I got
to pay my mortgage I've got very practical things to
think about I might I might lose my child in
my divorce all right so I need to really focus
on that I might lose my job so I really
need to focus on that I've got serious medical problems
I got to focus on that so some of these
ideas that you're throwing at me are too too far
out there right they're just they're a little bit too
wishy-washy a little bit too wishful thinking nothing could be
further from the truth what I'm throwing at you is
extremely practical but it's also not the way that you've
been conditioned to think and I do this on purpose
because this is a huge huge huge problem is that
growing up in our society as we do the way
that we're raised with our parents with our siblings with
the media that we're just bombarded with the way we
grow up is that we we have these assumptions and
we don't even realize that we have them and these
assumptions suppress us they keep us down they keep us
from really going out there and living our dream getting
our gifts to the world unleashing our full potential to
do that takes something more and I think you you
can realize this if you just think about a little
bit people that go above and beyond people that unleash
their full potential would you say those people are common
or those people are rare they're rare right it's not
every day that you meet someone like that and the
reason is is that you can say I use this
word a little bit of caution you can say that
it's unnatural it's unnatural in the sense that it's very
much more easy to be lazy to be complacent to
be mediocre and just to do the things that are
easy from society standpoint easy from the standpoint of growing
up in our culture and then just kind of rolling
with the flow not being very conscious not being very
ambitious not being very deliberate not setting something bigger for
yourself and then working towards it and then working on
yourself along the way so you can stay on that
path realizing that this takes time realizing that you're making
an investment in yourself and that is the deepest investment
that you can make there is no greater investment that
you can make that in yourself because from yourself stems
everything else your relationships your health your money your business
your creative output comes from you so one of these
assumptions that I'm getting out here is the assumption that
life is dangerous that life is scary sometimes we tend
to grow up and even as kids you know we
grow up and our parents try to do the best
they can to create kind of a safe little bubble
for us as we're growing up they try not to
put too much on us they try not to tell
us shocking truths about the world because they think that
we need to be protected and they want to preserve
that innocence but even though that's going on kids were
smart and we understand growing up that underlying all of
that there's just this general sense this notion that somehow
the world is dangerous that somehow reality is harsh and
that will come and it will knock you down it
will beat you down and as a result what you
have to do is you have to be very cautious
you have to be conservative you have to be careful
with the way that you conduct your affairs with the
way that you talk to other people make sure you
don't upset them make sure you don't say anything rude
and impolite make sure that you don't challenge the status
quo whatever you do don't question the religion in your
church whatever you do don't question the values of your
society whatever you do don't be that rabble rouser at
work who's questioning the direction of the company or the
direction of management or at school don't question the things
that are going on at school don't question what your
friends are doing don't question what your friends are pulling
you into do we just have this assumption it's very
deep this assumption and what it prevents us from doing
is it prevents us from reaching out and grabbing that
wolf by the tongue imagine how you would live your
life if you were fully conscious of the fact that
your life will be over like that in a split
second relative to the time of the universe to the
time of this planet your life is going to be
over like that a quarter of it a third of
it half of it maybe two-thirds of it are already
over so what do you got left right now you've
probably got another little what 20 30 40 years left
that's about it maybe 50 years if you really take
care of your health but many of you are not
even doing that that's all you got left and what
you're telling yourself whether consciously or subconsciously and I want
you to find the points where you're telling yourself this
is your telling yourself somewhere in your life that it's
more safe to be conservative and to hold back than
it is to go all out you're not going all
in are you I know you're not you're definitely not
because if you are then you are scared you are
afraid you're struggling you're having a hard time because it's
hard to do that it's hard to go all in
it takes a lot of balls takes courage but you
know what the even greater danger the even greater risk
is to really not commit at all and to live
a lukewarm kind of life a kind of life where
you just hum along and then you Peter out and
it's like a firework that failed to explode and it
just leaves you going oh well I wish that one
better where was the Bang where was the spark where
was the flash it didn't happen he just kind of
sputtered and then snuffed itself out and petered out no
Big Bang no flash nothing big nothing nothing meaningful nothing
significant with your life it didn't happen and you know
why that is that's because you're up or any others
assumption and you're holding yourself back I know you're holding
yourself back because I know that after even doing years
of work on myself pushing myself as hard as I
do I'm still nowhere near to the level of development
that I need to be at to be giving my
full giving my all nowhere near because I have too
many fears that I'm not facing too many limiting beliefs
too many assumptions that I'm buying into all this horseshit
that is keeping me back and I'm tired of it
I don't want it I want to live the kind
of life where I'm given in my Hall and if
it doesn't work so what so what the thing that
I would regret the most is to have not really
tried to have given it a half-ass attempt how miserable
will I be on my deathbed how miserable will I
be if that ends up being the case you can
only hope for a quick death at that point because
there's gonna be only one of two things they're gonna
happen you're gonna have either a quick death we're gonna
have a slow drawn-out death a quick death would be
something like dying in a plane crash or in a
car accident BAM and you're gone and you don't even
have time to reflect to think about what you did
or did not do in life and if you're living
a mediocre kind of life then you should wish that
for yourself because the alternative is gonna be very very
bad here's what the alternatives gonna be is that you're
gonna go a little bit older gonna go a little
bit older a little bit older and you're not going
to be quite as strong as you used to be
not quite as vital as you used to be not
quite as much energy as you used to have all
of a sudden your brain is not gonna work quite
as well as it used to your health it's gonna
start to deteriorate you're gonna start to become slow and
hunchbacked and then you're gonna start you're going to start
to pull out of the world you're gonna stop creating
gonna stop contributing and slowly you're gonna decay like that
you're gonna decay and decay and decay decay and as
that's happening you're gonna see it happen to you you're
gonna see it and you're gonna think it back and
you're gonna think about how wonderful the twenties were how
wonderful the 30s were how wonderful the 40s and the
50s were even the 60s how wonderful that time was
and how much you could have accomplished and how big
of a life you could have led if you had
just taken that wolf by the tongue and committed full-out
and you're gonna see when you're 80 or 90 years
old lying there on your deathbed or getting close you're
gonna start to see and the biggest thing you're gonna
tell yourself is why was I so afraid why didn't
I just go in all-in I mean so what what
would have happened yes the world is not all rainbows
and butterflies there's real danger in the world there's real
problems you get yourself into the world but you know
what the biggest problem is it's not the most painful
problem but it's certainly the most prevalent problem right now
in society especially in first world countries it's the problem
of mediocrity that is the real problem the real danger
is not that you're going to get attacked by burglars
or that someone is going to swindle you or that
you're gonna lose all your money in the stock market
or that something bad is gonna happen to your family
or that you're gonna lose your prized possessions like your
car in your house and your jewelry or your iPhone
or you're gonna lose that novel that you've been writing
those are not the real dangers the real danger is
that you take no action at all the real danger
is that you listen to this video and then you
go on and you say that was nice that was
profound that was inspiring and the next day you do
nothing at all you go and you watch another video
and then the next day you go and you watch
another video and then you watch some more television and
then you go do a bit of shopping and then
you go to your work and you do your normal
9:00 to 5:00 and then you go and you do
your standard routine in your relationship or in your marriage
and a standard thing with your family with your kids
and that is how your life runs eventually it runs
into the ground and nothing happens and what you're left
with is you're left with regret and you're left with
pain is that what you want for yourself ask yourself
this is the time if not now than when are
you going to commit to transforming your life into doing
whatever it takes whatever it takes because I can guarantee
you it's gonna take everything you've got right now and
more it's gonna take everything and more and if you're
not willing to put in that effort if it's not
