Hey, what's up? This is Leo here for actualised.org. And
today, I want to cover the important topic of positive
versus negative motivation, and why the negative motivation that you're
using is not going to get you ultimately to where
you want to be. So let's dig into this. What
is positive? And what is negative motivation? Well, I think
that a lot of people can really relate to negative
motivation very easily, because this is how they accomplish a
lot of change in their life. And it's not that
negative motivation doesn't get you any results, it gets you
results. The problem though, is that once you get to
a certain level, negative motivation stops having the effect on
you that you want to have. So let's dig into
the details here and really make this distinction between positive
and negative. Traditional psychology likes to say that there are
two types of personalities out there, they get motivated in
different ways. The one personality type is the one that
gets motivated by avoiding pain. So this is someone that
gets motivated by things like your electricity is about to
be turned off, and so you're motivated to go pay
the bill. Or you don't like the idea of being
poor. So you go out and you find a good
job so that you can become financially well off, you
don't like the idea of being bossed around at work.
So you go and you start your own business, you
don't like the idea of a fighting in your relationship.
So you go and you find a new relationship. So
that's the one side of the equation, right? It's trying
to avoid pain or discomfort in your life. And this
can be a pretty powerful motivating force. So I call
this negative, because it's like the stick. If we compare
the carrot and the stick analogy, then this is the
stick that you're getting hit with, that's telling you that
what you're doing is wrong, what you're doing is painful,
what is what you're doing is not something that's making
you satisfied. So you had to change your behavior. And
that's a signal that you use to then go off
and create some sort of change in your life. So
that's the negative, what about the positive? Well, the positive
is the opposite of that, it's you being drawn to
something. So it's what you're moving towards. So let's say
that you've really got a passion for art, and you
love painting, and that that's something that's deeply fulfilling for
you. So that's going to be a positive motivation that
goes out there. And it has you taking action, learning
how to paint learning how to draw, and then ultimately
becoming a professional artist in that case. So that's one
example of positive motivation. What's another example, let's say you
love you love the way your body looks when you're
ripped, and you love the muscles, and you love being
at a low body fat percentage, and you just love
that look, and you're just excited about new, you're really
eager to get into the gym every day, and work
and work out and just have a nice bodybuilder type
of physique. Again, that's a positive motivation. How about another
positive motivation? What if you like contributing, and you like
providing value to people? So maybe you like doing volunteer
work, or maybe you just like doing your job really
well, because it gives you a certain fulfillment and a
certain joy, then that's positive motivation. How about if you're
motivated to, to, to do something that you really enjoy
doing, like maybe playing a sport, or to have some
sort of craft or hobby, just because you really love
it? Something that you do anyways, like, maybe you really
like reading a certain genre of book, maybe you like
mystery books. And so you do that. And you're positively
motivated, because you're always excited about the next book that's
coming out in the series, and you want to read
it, that's something that's great for you. Or maybe you
love movies, and you love to go and you'd like
to see indie art flicks or whatever, again, positive motivation.
So So here we have the contrast between positive and
negative, where in one case, you're moving away from things
you don't want things that displease you things that you're
uncomfortable with. And then in the other case, you're moving
towards things that you do want. So it's like the
positive negative pull of a magnet, right? Now, these seem
like they're two sides of the same coin, right? You
can be motivated by the negative event mode by the
positive, motivated by the positive. And the two are, are
kind of part of the same piece. Like the Yang,
the yin and the yang, right, like there's a balance
there. Sometimes you're motivated by the positive sometimes by the
negative. Well, what I will submit to you is that
if you really want to get the success that you're
thirsting, after, and if you really want to get the
kind of results that are atypical, from from normal from
normal folks from normal society kind of results that average
people get, if you want to kind of rise above
the mediocrity, then you have to start shifting away from
the negative into the positive, because there's a huge difference
even though they seem like they're, they're equal and balanced.
There's a huge difference in results that you're gonna get
from going from negative to positive and being driven by
a fuel that's part positive rather than negative. So let's
go into some of the reasons as to why this
is. There, there's a multitude of reasons and we're gonna
go into them, some of them are deeper than others.
But what I really want to what I want to
stress here is something that was talked about in the
book called path of least resistance by Robert Fritz. And
this entire book is about creating, it's really about creating,
actually, and how to cultivate a creative mindset, and how
to pursue creative pursuits. And creative here doesn't mean that
you're artistic in any way. Creative here means that you're
actually using the process of creation to make whatever it
is that you want to make in your life, whether
it's how you look, how you feel, what kind of
job you have, what kind of family you have, all
of that is creation of some sort, right? So it
doesn't necessarily just have to be that you're a creative
person in kind of the stereotypical way like we think
of an artist as being creative. Creativity is much more
broad than that. And what path of least resistance talks
about is the fact that there are really two structures
that you can use towards living your life. There's the
problem solving structure, or paradigm that you use, which is
when you're going about your day and going about your
life, trying to fix problems. So you're looking for problems
that pop up in your life, situations that you're not
quite pleased with that you want to improve. And then
you go out there and you work on them, and
you try to improve them. There's that paradigm or structure,
as Robert Fritz calls it. Then there's the other structure,
which is the creative structure. And this structure is not
about focusing on the problems or focusing on the things
that you want to improve. The creative structure is about
what do you want to create? It's like you have
a blank slate. Think of yourself as an artist and
your life as that blank canvas. And it's like, what
do you want to draw on there? Because you have
all these tools, you have all these possibilities. You have
all this, these opportunities at your disposal? And the question
now is, what do you want to create. And so
these two, I equate with the positive and the negative,
right? The problem solving mindset is really the negative motivation.
Because what you're motivated by is the problem, you want
to fix the problem. And when and the way that
your mind is thinking is like when I fix this
problem, I'm going to feel better. And I'm not going
to have that thorn in my son anymore. So that's
something I should get to work on. So maybe you're
not happy with your weight. And you look in the
mirror, you're really you're bummed out about it, every time
you look in the mirror, you think yourself, you know,
I could easily drop 20 pounds, I would be so
much happier. If I did that I'd look so much
better, I'd be so much more attractive, whatever. Let's say
you've got that mindset. Well, that's the problem mindset, right?
Because you've not you noticed a problem about yourself. And
now there's some pain there, there's a twinge of pain,
a twinge of guilt, about not following through not taking
action, not living up to your full potential. And so
now you're driven by that to make some sort of
change. So you're gonna go to the gym, you're gonna
change your diet, whatever it takes. That's the negative, the
positive. And this is the creative mindset is like, what
do you want? What is your vision for yourself? So
in the case of, of your physique, if you're trying
to improve your looks, it's not about, oh, I want
to improve my looks, because I'm dissatisfied, it's about what
do I want? What do I want to be? Who
do I want to be? What do I want to
create in my life, and in this case, it's like,
you have a vision, you have a positive vision of
what you look like. So maybe you picture yourself ripped,
or sexier, lean, or maybe you're picture yourself at the
gym, being in that top 10% that go there consistently,
maybe you picture yourself very healthy. And it's not so
much about the looks, but it's more about the health
and the energy that you now have, and that vitality
that you have with being active, and eating healthy foods,
so that they're nourishing your body and you feel good
about that. Not even because you look good. And not
even because you feel good. But it's just because you're
kind of living up to your own standards, right, you
have a vision of what you want to look like
you have a vision of who you want to be.
And that's something that you want to work towards, and
something that you literally want to manifest create in your
life. And then again, you do that by going to
the gym, lifting weights, changing your diet up, whatever. Now
on the surface, it seems like you know, what's the
difference, because in both cases, the actions are the same.
In both cases, whether you hate how you look, or
you have some vision of how you want to look,
in both cases, you're you're gonna have to go to
the gym anyways, you're gonna have to change your diet
anyways, and it doesn't really matter. Well, this is really
the inner game side of things, and the inner game
of success. And even though the outer game here is
the same, you're going to the gym, you're doing the
diet stuff. The inner game is very different. And the
inner game is where your motivation stems from. Because here's
the problem, especially with the gym is that are you
going to have the motivation to stick with it? Are
you going to have the motivation to achieve what you
ultimately want? The problem with the problem solving mindset and
the negative mindset is that if you're motivated by that
negative motivation, you're going to start to notice a certain
yo yo effect where that motivation might be powerful at
first, it'll get you going. And in fact, a lot
of times people will cite examples of like extreme negative
leverage, where they have some sort of really painful event
in their life, sort of painful experience. And they use
that as fuel to get them somewhere new. And a
lot of times that will lead to a pretty big
transformation. And that's great, you can definitely do that that
strategy. The problem is, though, that you've if you've already
made some of that transition, and now you're looking to
get to that next level, that negative leverage no longer
starts to work on you. Because here's the problem with
negative leverage is that when you're in a real deficit
of whatever it is that you want, and there's a
big gap between what you want and what you have,
right now, there's a certain tension that's created, right? There's
like pressure there. And so like, let's say that you're
really miserable at your job right now. You get paid
very little, you don't get respected, you hate what you
do. You just hate it. And then you have this
vision of something awesome that you really want to do
maybe some dream, dream career that you've always imagined yourself
doing. But you're not sure how to get there yet.
And it seems like the gap is huge. That huge
gap, even though that can be a problem. It's also
nice, because now that creates motivation, right? You see the
disparity, you see how much better your life could be
here than it is right now. And that makes you
start to want to move towards it, that gets you
that motivation. The problem, though, is if you're driven by
that negativity, then what happens is as you close that
gap, right, your drive is proportional to that to that
gap that's there. So as you're closing it, you're closing,
you're closing it, closing it, the motivation wanes, and wanes
and wanes, because all of a sudden, the pain that
was there that was pushing you isn't as painful anymore.
So let's say you hate your job right now. And
so there's a lot of pain and you quit, and
you go off, and you find a new job. But
let's say that job isn't quite what you want, it's
maybe only 30% of what you really feel like you're
capable of. And so you're working at that job. But
you're doing all right, this job is much better than
your previous job, you're getting paid much better, your boss
respects you more, you'd like your co workers, you're having
a good time, you're doing something valuable with with, with
the effort that you're putting in there. But still, it's
not like, it's not the thing that you really feel
that you could be doing. It's not your full potential,
it's only 30%. So in this case, what's happening is
that gap has now narrowed, it's much smaller gap. But
now you're not really motivated to go out there and
achieve your full 100% potential, because you've already achieved 30%
of it, the gap has closed, and now you're less
driven, you start to become complacent, it's like you know,
I'm pretty comfortable here, I'm pretty comfortable going off finding
that job, that's 100% of my potential, well, that's pretty
risky, you know, I'm gonna have to quit this job,
it might involve getting less pay in the short run,
it might involve a time where I won't be able
to find a job where I'll be unemployed, maybe for
six months, that's gonna be a painful period, I don't
want to go through that. And so see what happens
is if you're driven by pain, you're always using the
scale of assessing what's more painful, what's less painful, and
you're always trying to find that path and bring you
the least discomfort, least pain. You can definitely use the
strategy, the problem is that you're not going to be
be really great using the strategy, nothing great really gets
accomplished by avoiding pain or discomfort, you can accomplish certain
things, but it limits you. Whereas with the creative mindset,
well, there's almost no limit to what that can do,
what positive motion motivation can do. Because once you have
that drive, once you set up a vision for yourself
of where you want to be, and you're really inspired
by that, and you It connects with your values, and
you really feel this is something that's deeply important to
you. That motivation is there. And it's never ending. In
fact, what it does, if you set this up properly,
then it just keeps amplifying and building up and building
up and building up on itself. And that's when you
can get like 100,000 10,000 times the results that you
would get with the negative motivation approach. Because you have
a vision, and you are where you are now. And
there's that gap and there's that same tension. But this
is now a positive tension. And as the gap closes,
you're getting more excited about it. You're not getting less
excited, not getting demotivated, the fuel is still there, because
you're getting closer and closer to the vision. And what
happens is ultimately, your vision enlarges and expands and deepens.
And so your vision always rises. And you go along
for the ride. And as that gap is closing, you're
just thrilled about it, you're more motivated, because once you
reach that vision, then the vision expands to the next
level. And suddenly it evolves and transforms to something new.
And then you go on to the next thing, and
then the next thing and the next thing and you're
feeling good about yourself, right? So this is the key
difference between positive and negative and why You should make
that transition from negative to positive. Now, what I want
to say about this, I think the profound thing to
understand here is that, you know, I was asking myself,
this has anything, has anything really great, anything really awesome
been achieved by people or organizations that were simply driven
to avoid discomfort or pain? And I thought about this,
and I thought about some like prototypical examples, maybe, let's
say, the pyramids, you know, how were the pyramids built?
What was the intellect that was behind that? What was
the motivation required to create that kind of achievement? Or
how about a billion dollar company, you know, founding a
billion dollar company that provides a lot of value to
society and helps a lot of people maybe, you know,
common technology companies, common examples, Microsoft? How about a company
like Apple? How about a company like Google? So these
kinds of innovative visionary companies that create a lot of
positive impact in the world? Is it possible to start
a company like that, if you're trying just to avoid
discomfort, or you're trying to simply solve problems? Well, what
I would submit is that that's not possible to have
the kind of drive you need to have to create
that kind of greatness, there's something more there and you
need to tap into your higher self, you can't do
that, by being stuck in low consciousness thinking, you can't
do that by being reactive, you can only do that
by being proactive. And by having a vision of what
you want, because otherwise, what would happen is, well, basically,
you can think about like this is that these grand,
lofty visions of starting a billion dollar company, or helping
the world to cure a disease, or building a monument
like a like a pyramid, or the Eiffel Tower, or
something great like this, this is this is like an
inspired and inspired drive, right? Because you can easily have
a lot of money, and just be comfortable, you know,
you could have everything that you basically need in life,
you can have a nice house, a nice car, you
can have a nice family, you can have good friends,
you can set your life up to have all those
things. But that's never going to lead you to create
something amazing, something great. That is just going to make
you comfortable, maybe happy. If that. And in fact, what's
going to do is if you put yourself in that
position, you don't have that vision, most likely, you're just
going to get complacent, you're going to get lazy, and
actually what's going to happen, you're going to start to
stagnate, you're going to stop learning, you're gonna stop working
hard, and you're not really going to achieve a lot
in your life. But to achieve something big, right? Think
about what it took to build the pyramids. That's not
simply a matter of like survival. That's way beyond survival,
survival is just getting your basic needs met. This is
like getting your highest ideals met. Right? For the Egyptians,
it was obviously tied to their religion and their spirituality.
But that was something that was deep to them. That
was a deep value. For them. It was really important,
you know, for how about a founder of a company
like maybe like Google or Apple or Microsoft? Well, what
would someone like that have to have to believe in?
What kind of drive would they have to have to
want to put in the energy that it takes the
massive expenditure of energy that it takes to make that
a reality? Because make no mistake about it, it wasn't
easy. It wasn't. It wasn't simple to build the pyramids,
there's a lot of toil hard work put into that
it wasn't easy to build a billion dollar company like
Microsoft or Google, or Apple, there's a lot of a
lot of struggle there to create it, right, certain things
had to happen, certain energy has to be invested. And
there's no way that energy would have been invested. If
the person that was behind that effort. If the intellect
the mind that was behind that effort, was simply motivated
by avoiding a problem or finding a comfortable place for
themselves. And make no mistake about it, these companies and
the pyramids, and a lot of human achievement. Literally everything
that you see around, you can just look around the
house that you're sitting in, you know, the computer that
you're looking at the car that you're driving in the
city that you're in, all of that was created by
human intellect and and they had to start with some
sort of figment of imagination of idea, right, someone had
to think about wanting to create an LCD screen that
you're now watching this video on. Someone had to think
about how to code, the website that you're now looking
at. Someone had to think about how to structure the
internet, how to lay the cables through the through the
ground so that you could receive the electronic signals that
you need to be receiving, in order to look into
listen this right now, you know, someone had to come
up with the algorithms to code for the audio that's
coming through this video. Someone had to create the infrastructure
in your city so that you have water and electricity.
And someone had to create a government that would allow
you to have the stability and the luxury to sit
where you're sitting right now without worrying about somebody's ambition.
You and hitting you in the head over the head
with a with a rock, like in caveman days, might
happen without a stable government to protect you and to
ensure a certain stability and order in society. So all
of these things didn't exist 100,000 years ago, none of
that existed 100,000 years ago, right? And how did that
come about, because ultimately, it was a figment of someone's
idea, someone's imagination. And then because they had the vision,
they thought it was important to them, that they went
out. And they started doing that. And they accomplished these
amazing things. So if this is something that you like,
if you like being accomplished, and you feel like you
have something to contribute to society, and you have that
kind of drive, whether it's with your work or something
else, then I would submit to you that you need
to get on the positive motivation, track, right, not be
driven by the problems, be driven by your vision. Because
ice cream truck is coming by so it's playing in
the background. Here's the thing, if you're driven by negative
motivation, as Robert Fritz talked about it, a lot of
the problems that you have, are not even going to
be solved, if you're coming at it from the problem
solving mindset. Because what's happening is you're solving one problem,
and another problem pops up, you're solving that one and
another one pops up, instead of doing it that way,
What's better is to go out and simply focus on
what you want, not what you don't want. So this
is classic law of attraction, right? The idea that you
want to shift your attention on the things you do
want rather than what you don't want. Because if you
focus on what you don't want, paradoxically, what's gonna happen
is actually going to get that by moving towards it,
because your mind is on it so much, that you're
going to look at that so much, you're going to
worry about it so much, this can become a self
fulfilling prophecy. Whereas in the opposite example, if you're focused
on what you do want, even though there are obstacles
and problems, nobody's denying that there are those, your focus
is avoiding them, right, so you're not distracted, you're not
demoralized, by all the problems and obstacles in your way.
Because you've got that vision that's driving you. And you're
always focusing on what you can do what you want.
The problem with the problem solving mindset is that makes
you a victim, you're always looking at things that are
problems, things that are obstacles, and so a lot of
times you'll get demoralized, just by the fact that you
have so many obstacles in your way. And what's gonna
happen is you're gonna, you're gonna think about, oh, you
know, I'd like to start a business. But there's this
problem. And there's that problem. And another problem, another problem,
I don't have the funding for it, I don't have
the time, I can't quit my job, I've got a
family to support. So all these problems and obstacles come
in the way. And if you're thinking about it like
that, then you're not going to be very motivated to
start that business. Unless there's some really negative, harsh kick
in the ass, that just kind of forces you to
do it. So maybe you get fired from work. And
that's going to be enough to start getting you to
start your business. But that's not ideal. The better scenario
is to focus on really the business, you want to
start, why you want to start it, why it's important
to you. And then as you're focusing on that, you're
so excited about all the potential and all the movement
progress you're making towards that business, those problems are still
there, you still have a family that you need to
support, you still have money you got to make, you
still need capital for your business. So all these problems
are still there, but you're not focusing on them, you're
focusing on the solutions. And ultimately, what's happens is that
you end up finding those solutions, because your mind is
focused on looking for them. And right, what you focus
on is what you tend to see. So we have
this tendency as human beings, our human mind tends to
seek validation. So whatever you think, should be the case,
a lot of times, you will discount all the contrary
evidence. And so a lot of times, that's why you
see if you read biographies about people that start some
of these amazing businesses, and that accomplish a lot in
their life, they go through a lot of adversity, but
they're always looking for that crack that crack in the
wall that they can squeeze through, right, and then the
next crack and the next crack. And so they're very
opportunistic about how they do that. And that's what allows
them to be persistent and successful. Whereas people that are
focused on the problems, well, there's always a problem. There's
always an obstacle. If you look for one, there's always
a reason not to do something. Right? And there's always
a reason to do something. So it's really a question
of inner game and what you want for yourself. The
other problem, the the thing that I hate about negative
motivation, is that it leads to a certain yo yo
effect. And this is what Robert Fritz called and oscillating
structure. So think about there are two structures here. One
structure is that you're solving problems and avoiding pain. The
other structure is that you're moving towards a greater vision
that you have the structure where you're avoiding pain, right?
The problem with that is that you probably can find
experiences, instances of this in your life is that as
soon as you reach your goal, what happens is you
get satisfied and so then you want to drop back
down to where you were, and then as soon as
dropped back down to where you were the pain pain
of being at, at that bad condition will want you
to rise above again. But then as soon as you
rise above and you reach that goal, then you'll yo
yo back down. So this is what I call the
yo yo effect, where I've really seen this very, very
evident was with, with maintaining my weight, right? A long
time ago, I was overweight, that was about seven years
ago. And then I dropped about 65 pounds in in
five months. And so that was something that I was
spurred on to do. Actually, as I was preparing for
this video, I was thinking about what it was, that
really motivated me to do that. And initially, I thought
there was a lot of negative leverage there. That like
I just got really tired of being fat. And because
I was overweight for most of my life, and I
got tired of how I look, I got tired of
not being attractive to the opposite sex. And I got
tired of my self confidence issues and all that. And
so one day, I just kind of snapped and decided
to change. But actually what that snap was, it wasn't
a negative, it was a positive. Because what happened was
that I saw a vision of myself as being very
lean, toned, fit healthy, being attracted to the opposite sex
being very confident, I saw a vision of myself of
that, and I talk about that another video where I
talk more about exactly all the steps that I took
to lose 65 pounds in five months. But in that
case, it wasn't that I was set up and experience
a lot of pain. And therefore I changed it was
because I saw a vision of myself. And I really
felt it. It wasn't just like a logical, like, oh
yeah, I could be fit, I could I could drop
65 pounds, it was like I saw myself and I
saw how I would feel I felt like how I
would feel if I had already done it. And it
was such a captivating vision that the next day, changes
started to happen, right. And that was an inner game
shift, because I tried going to the gym. Before that
I tried dieting for a long time before that many
times. And it always failed. And that was because I
didn't have a strong enough vision. All I was doing
is I was running from the discomfort and the pain
of being overweight. And so that was how I lost
35 pounds. But getting back to this idea of the
yo yo effect after I did lose that those 65
pounds, 65 pounds, and I wasn't my target weight, which
was about 170 pounds. That's what I wanted to be
at. And I stayed there for about a year. And
then I found it difficult to maintain that weight. Because
what happened was that my motivation had waned, right, I
no longer had that vision, that vision of being at
170 pounds, I've already achieved that. And so I had
it. And then at that point, all I felt like
I was doing was that I was maintaining, right and
I was going to the gym, I was working just
as hard. But all I was doing was maintaining, I
was getting the results. And so it became challenging, because
what would happen is I wanted to say at about
170. And so what I would do is I would
go to the gym, I'd hit 170. And then I
would feel pretty good about myself. And then I would
still want to snack and you know, have some tasty
stuff, have some desserts, ice cream, burgers, etc. And so
I was still eating pretty unhealthy at that time. And
so what I did is I would go to, you
know, I'd go I eat i I'd splurge a little
bit. And then all of a sudden, over the course
of the next week, I would notice myself gaining like
three or four pounds off of that. And then I
would weigh myself. And then as soon as I saw
myself hitting that 173 174 mark on the scale. Immediately,
like the stab the thorn kicked in, and it was
that negative motivation. And it was telling me that, oh,
if you if you keep this up, you're gonna, you're
gonna gain all that weight back that you lost, you
didn't really make a sustainable change, I feel really bad
about myself, I would get myself into basically then going
on the diet again. And then I'll get myself back
down to 170 over the next week or two. And
then once I was at 170, I became pretty happy
again. And I was motivated by the pleasure of going
out and eating a little bit of this little bit
of that and getting lacks, again in my diet and
getting lacs on the gym. And then all of a
sudden, I would notice that over the next week or
two I would rise back up 173 174 And then
again, I would freak out and then go on a
diet and go back to 170. And so this yo
yo effect was happening, happen for for a long time.
It's happened for months, even a few years really because
I lost my vision and I was just being motivated
by comfort or lack of comfort and discomfort and trying
to avoid the pain. Right? I tried to on the
one hand avoid the pain of going to the gym
and eating healthy. And then on the other hand, I
was avoiding the pain of of being overweight. So I
was trying to try to Yo Yo my way back
and forth. And so what happened was that there was
a plateau there for me a couple of years, but
really I didn't get I didn't really get any he
gains the gym, even though I put in so much
work. And I always felt bad about myself, because there
was like guilt there, right, I was guilting myself into
doing things. So I think this is such a common
example. And one of the biggest problems with the negative
motivation is that it will lead to this oscillating Yo
yo, yo yo effect, where you become stuck, and you
start, you stop getting the results that you want to
get you stop achieving. And of course, that means that
your fuel kind of ran out. So that's what I
mean by negative motivation not being enough to get you
to where you ultimately want to be. If you want
to accomplish great things. Instead, what you need is positive.
And what it took for me to move beyond that
yo yo effect was exactly that it took a vision.
So after a lot of a lot of frustration, a
lot of struggle with this Yo yo, feeling bad about
myself, ultimately, I somehow got into bodybuilding, sort of researching
it got interested in it. And you know, I started
getting an image of myself of being very fit, not
just at a certain weight at 170, I started setting
higher ambitions for myself, I started thinking about, you know,
what would it be like if my body was really
healthy? What if I actually was eating not simply to
maintain my weight, but I was eating to maintain my
health? Because I care about my body? What if I
lived up to that value? And then I also thought,
you know, what, if I get ripped, you know, I
liked the idea of just getting ripped, like just very
low body fat percentage, like I wanted to be at
8%. And what if I put on some some nice
bulk put on some muscle at the same time. And
I actually went online and looked for images of the
kind of body that I wanted to have. And I
found some some like inspiring images, I printed them out
as posters, I posted them around my room. And that
created a lot of motivation for me. And this was
positive motivation, right? It was no longer about avoiding this
or avoiding that. I was really looking towards my vision,
there was something that I wanted to create, I wanted
to create a certain body, I wanted to create a
certain physique, I wanted to create a certain feeling I
wanted more energy. And I also wanted to live up
to those higher values of just being healthy, and treating
my body well. And so once I put that in
place, and son, I started seeing a lot of gains
the gym, I started to put on muscle, I started
to shred fat, I started to look for techniques, I
started researching and started watching videos, providing me a lot
of motivation to really get me to that next level
at the gym. And that was really great. And I'm
still working through that right now, I'm still trying to
get to my six pack, still trying to get to
like 8% body fat, it's really a struggle, when you're
at about 1211 10% to get down those last few
percent are can be really, really difficult. And I think
one of the challenges is that if you don't have
a strong enough reason, strong enough vision, you'll never get
there. Because at that point, you know, what are you
really trying to do, you're putting in a lot of
effort, you know, you're really monitoring your diet, to be
very careful about how your diet is it, you have
to be very careful about what kind of exercises you
do, and what times during the day you eat, etc,
etc. And you're just not going to do that if
all you're trying to do is avoid discomfort, because quite
frankly, there's a certain discomfort involved with with getting to
that kind of level of physique, to building your body,
you know, go to the gym. That's not, that's not
always a comfortable experience. But if you have that vision,
then the discomfort kind of melts away. So that's the
beauty of it is that if you're always motivated by
the pain, you're always in a kind of reactive mode,
you're always in lower consciousness thinking because you're always trying
to avoid something, it's just like, you're always dissatisfied. Because
you're you're dissatisfied with that thing. So you try to
avoid it. And then all of a sudden, your mind
finds another thing that you're dissatisfied in your life. And
another thing, another thing, you're always dissatisfied, you're never really
content, you're never fulfilled or happy. Whereas if you're working
towards a vision, even though going to the gym is
still painful, because you're not focusing on it, because you're
so excited about what you're going to the muscles you're
gonna put on in this example, then you don't really
care about the pain. And that pain becomes just part
of the journey. And you can even learn to appreciate
it in certain sense. So that was my weight loss
example. And, and I like this point at the end
here about how you feel because if you're motivated by
the negative motivation, I just find it very difficult to
imagine a scenario where someone motivated by negative motivation is
ever going to be content in their life. Right? Can
you can you picture how that would work? Because you're
always solving problems and problems always keep coming up. They're
never gonna, you're never gonna run out of problems to
solve. So you're always going to be looking, you're always
gonna be reacting, you're always going to be in a
negative mood. Whereas if you're creating a lot of the
obstacles that are there are simply going to dissolve for
you. Those problems are not going to be solved. They're
just literally going to be resolved or just kind of
navigated around And so that is an important element of
why you want to transition yourself away from the negative
into the positive. Now, to answer a few objections, I
think one objection might be, and this is kind of
a case, in self help. I think Tony Robbins, a
big supporter, proponent of this, and some other heavy hitters
in the self help arena, is that negative leverage can
be a powerful way to get yourself to transform, right?
Let's say you are on the brink of of losing
your job. And so that fear gets you motivated to
go out there and, and do better perform better and
ultimately make some sort of drastic improvement in your life
there. Or maybe, you know, maybe you have a death
in the family. And that's a really painful experience. And
all of a sudden, that makes you realize something that
you should be doing with your life, that you should
be doing more. And also, now you're driven by that,
by that negative emotion that you have. So examples like
this, I think all of us have points in our
lives, where we experienced something very painful, that then told
us that we would never want to experience that again.
And so therefore we're driven away from that, from that
thing, and so we're driven to change. You know, I've
done that many times myself. And so I think that
is, that's definitely a way to motivate yourself. And if
that's something if you're not motivated at all, and you
have the option between not me being motivated at all,
and being motivated by pain, or fear, or anger, or
whatever it is, go ahead and use that, you know,
if you're gonna get positive benefit from it, if you
hate your boss, and you want to use that, as
leverage to start a business, go ahead and do that.
If you hate your weight, and you want to use
that as leverage to, to get healthy and eat healthy,
go ahead and do that, you know, if you're, if
you're on your third, if you're about to have your
third heart attack, and because you're eating so sloppily, that
and you're so overweight, that you got to fix that
you know, and you're afraid of dying, then then maybe
that's what you got to do, and you got to
work on. But that's like the first step, right? That's
not a very high quality way to, to run your
life, you can do that in the short run, and
get some good benefit out of it. But it's going
to be hard to sustain that. And ultimately, what is
your life about you want to experience joy and happiness,
and it'd be a piece, right, you don't want to
always be driven by these negative negative experiences in your
life. And quite frankly, those negative experiences, it's enough to
shift you away from that thing. But it's not enough
to really shift you into excellence in anything else. So
maybe, if you're afraid of having that third heart attack,
you will start going to the gym, exercise a little
bit washing your health, but you're doing it for the
wrong reason you're doing it for this reason that you're
worried that you're going to die prematurely. And so you're
going to be taking the outer actions that you need
to be taking, but inside you're going to be resistant,
you're gonna be struggling it, you're always going to be
down on yourself, you know, why do I have to
monitor my health? Why do I have to eat these
certain things? I hate eating these things, why do I
have to go to the gym, I hate going to
the gym. And so there's going to be a constant
struggle, even if you do manage to do it, and
make times you won't manage to do it, you'll fall
off. Whereas if you actually make an internal shift in
why you're doing it, maybe all the sudden, what you
do is you use that pain to then create a
vision for yourself. Right? The vision is now that you're
healthy, that you've had a lot of energy that you
love going to the gym, that you like monitoring the
stuff that you put in your body that you actually
are interested in, in your own health, and you're you're
reading about health, and you're reading about taking supplements and,
and taking yourself off medications and looking for alternative medicines,
whatever, then that might be a positive vision, that will
get you much further right, because now all of a
sudden, you're on board, your brain is on board with
your body. It's on board with what your doctor is
telling you. It's on board with what your friends and
your family are telling you. And what's most important to
get yourself on board with what you want to accomplish,
not your body. Because your body can always do the
actions go through the motions. But if your motivation isn't
there, and that motivation comes from, from a division of
what you want, then you're really always going to struggle.
So I would ask you right now, what in your
life? Do you have a strong vision for that you're
pursuing? And what areas in your life are you doing?
Simply because you're trying to avoid something, you're trying to
avoid some negative reaction from somebody else, like maybe a
boss or a family member or a spouse. Or maybe
you're trying to avoid some negative situation like you're trying
to avoid getting your electricity cut off by the electric
company. So you go on your pay your bill, or
you're trying to avoid looking looking fat. So you're going
to the gym and you're struggling through that. And think
about how you can shift that from the negative motivation
to the positive. Think about what a positive vision for
yourself might mean there and draft it out actually write
it out what that positive vision is. Try To get
connected with it, try to review that vision on a
daily basis. Right? It's important that if you create a
vision, you don't just look at it once, it's something
that you come back to repeatedly, because that's something that
you have to work towards over the course of the
next weeks and months and years. And so, seek for
that vision, because I promise you, once you have the
right vision, and that vision is aligned with your deepest
values, the action becomes effortless, right. And you start reaching
new levels, you start reaching new plateaus that you have
not been able to overcome before now you start overcoming
them, because that's what it takes, you're probably on a
plateau, because you're going through that yo yo effect, and
the pain that you use to get you to where
you are right now. Well, it's kind of run its
course that fuel has burned out. And now you need
a new source of fuel. And so that new source
of fuel is vision, I encourage you to create a
vision, create a vision right now for one thing in
your life that you want to improve. And then that
will be positive motivation that will fuel you much better
than the negative motivation that you've used in the past.
I wanted to add a couple more points that I
forgot to add that I thought were important for this
idea of positive negative motivation. So I started talking about
personality types than traditional psychology. They like to say that
there's some people that are pain avoiders, and then others
that are pleasure seekers, and that some have a tendency
towards one more than the other. Here, my thoughts on
that is that I don't want that to limit you
in what you think you can accomplish, and who you
are. Because even though you might be the kind of
person that is, that has so far in your life
been motivated by pain, I don't want you to think
that that is like fundamental or core to who you
are like that's your identity, and that that cannot be
changed. I think that's total nonsense. And that even if
there is this divide between like half the population is
more driven by avoiding pain and half is more driven
by voting pleasure. I don't think that's in any way
inherent biological or any of that kind of nonsense. This
is something that can be shifted. And it's important to
realize the benefit of making that shift. So if you're
heavily heavily motivated by negativity, by pain by discomfort, you're
always solving problems, you want to shift away from that,
because that can only get you so far. And if
you want better results. So you got to have to
make a deeper shift within yourself from positive I mean
from negative to positive right. Now, one example that I
use with this is that psychology also has this personality
type distinction between introvert and extrovert. And so something that
goes back all the way into like Carl Jung, talking
about that there are people out there general population, some
people are very introverted, some people are very extroverted. And
then there's, there's some radiant in there. So it's kind
of like a range. But ultimately, that this is, this
is something that's inherent to human beings is that you're
either introverted, which means that you're very in your head
about things. And that reality for you, is about not
what's out there. It's more about how you perceive it,
and how you think about it. So all the time
you're scanning, you're looking you're taking stuff in, but it's
not real for you until you can analyze it and
process it and chunk it down for yourself. That's how
an introvert sees the world and interact with the world.
Whereas the extrovert is more about just being in the
external environment, the real world is out there for them.
Right? They don't need to process things as much, they're
more likely to just say something without thinking about it.
Because for them saying it is what's real thinking about
it, that's, that's like a secondary, secondary function. Whereas for
the introvert, they have to be very careful about what
they say, because they want to make sure it's right.
It's true to their real inner models of reality, and
then they'll say it, the extrovert, exactly the opposite. And
so this is why the extrovert, interestingly enough, always has
seems to have a lot more energy and gets charged
by the environment is charged by being around people is
because they're not expending a lot of energy processing. They're
soaking up energy from the environment. And they're just in
it, they're more present to the moment. Whereas the introvert
is always analyzing, and that takes a lot of mental
energy to do. And so what happens is that they
become fatigued when they're in high stimulus environments, when they're
around people talking to people, that sort of thing. So
they like to retreat into themselves, they like to have
private time they like to sit at home, they like
to do quiet things, so that they can recharge their
batteries. So that when they do go out into the
world, they need that energy to be able to interact
in with it and process it. So these are two
distinctions. I think they're generally valid. But I think this
idea that you're an introvert or an extrovert, and that
you're somewhere along this range, and that you're just stuck
there. And maybe that's how you were born, or that's
how you grew up, and now that you're stuck with
that, but that's total nonsense. In fact, I've really proven
to myself that that is not the case. Because I
consider myself an extreme introvert. I very much like my
private time very much my life alone time. In the
past, I've had real difficulty interacting with people being being
outspoken, being around people. It's just not something that I
enjoyed. It's not something that it's something definitely something that
that drain me of energy. And so I always considered
myself an extreme introvert. But then what I what I
realized is that, that this was not something that I
was happy with, because it was limiting me in my
life. I was an introvert and even though I liked
being an introvert, you know, I don't, it's not that
I want to change because I don't like being introvert,
it's just that I saw that there are certain things
that I couldn't accomplish. Being an introvert, like I couldn't
do public speaking well, I could not run a business
successfully by being an introvert, I could not, I could
not have the kind of impact that I want in
the world. Really, without going out there and interacting with
people, I couldn't have the relationships, that intimate relationships that
I wanted, unless I got this part of my life
taken care of. And so what I did is I
resolved to really take a lot of action to start
to shift my my brain wiring and my chemistry and
my brain chemistry to to go more extreme extrovert. And
it was challenging, let me tell you, because first of
all, I doubted whether it was possible to do. And
I didn't want to just do it on a superficial
level, where it's like, I'm able to chat people up
and do small talk and be out there. But still
feel inside. Like I'm an introvert, just acting and doing
going through the motions of extraversion. But, you know, I
went through this through this crazy process of cold approach
pickup, if you read the Game by Neil Strauss, then
you might have an idea of what I'm talking about,
although that's a very caricature eyes kind of cartoon version
of what called approach pickup really is. But basically, it's
going out and pushing yourself to do a lot of
approaching in bars and noisy bars and clubs, to get
very comfortable flirting with the opposite sex and, and handling
logistics, and just understanding female psychology, that sort of thing.
So for me, that was a really big and very
dramatic experience back to it was probably the most challenging
thing that I've ever done in my life. And I've
done some challenging things, you know, I've like I've lost
a lot, 65 pounds, in five months, I've started, I
started six figure businesses. So those things, all those things
were much easier for me then than mastering called approach
pickup. And getting this introversion extroversion thing shift. Because I
think it was something that I was changing really deep
within myself, you know, I realized that I need to
change some something about how I interact with people. And
so I took two going out for hours and hours
and hours every single night for over the course of
years, over the course of months and years, in order
to get myself comfortable, and it was really excruciating, because
the body wants to react against it, right? My brain
was just wired in such a way where I'm much
more comfortable staying home and reading a book than I
am going out to some last night club and approaching
random strangers and flirting with them. That was something that's
totally uncomfortable for me. And so it took a lot
of just kind of brute force, brute force, brute force,
brute force night and night and night again, until finally,
like my brain started coming around. And I won't say
that I made that that full transition by no means
I still consider myself a pretty hardcore introvert. But I've
definitely made a shift. I've been doing it for about
a year and a half, and going out so much.
spending so much time doing it. It's just like the,
the the trauma of doing that, that at the events,
the experience I've had was so traumatic, so exhilarating. so
eye opening. So just like mind blowing, that it just
there's no way that it's not going to shift the
neurons in your head to rewire and to start to
see things differently. So I've noticed myself inching over more
towards the extrovert from the introvert that I was at.
And I definitely see that if I keep doing that
for like another five years that I will really make
some, some like, I can make probably a really solid,
full transition to extrovert, and I'm not talking about just
through outer motions, I'm talking about a deep interchange, right?
Your psychology is actually changing when you're doing this, your
personality, your identity, what you think you are, is changing,
because you're just so open to the experience, you're not
holding yourself back, you're not clinging to who you are.
And these events are coming in and you're starting to
see new perspectives on the world. And your brain is
changing along coming along for the ride. So basically, the
bottom line of why I'm talking about this is that
I just wanted to use this as an example to
say that things that you think are fundamental to you
are not necessarily as fundamental as you think they are.
And this idea of personality types that you're this type
of that type I think is total nonsense. You might
lean towards one or the other. But ultimately you are
what you create yourself to be and what you want
to be so if you're not happy if you're not
happy with the results that you're getting in your life,
if some aspect of you is holding you back and
you want to change Just go ahead and change it
don't let any kind of limiting beliefs hold you back.
Like it's not possible. I like to approach every everything
I do with personal development as that it's possible for
me to become whoever I want to be, it's just
a matter of who do I want to be, and
putting the effort forward to do that. So if you
are identifying with this idea of being driven by, by
pain, by being driven by negative emotions all the time
by negative motivation, then don't let that limit you. And
don't say to yourself that well, I'm just, I'm just
that kind of person. And that I can't shift to
a positive I'm not I'm not a positive thinking person.
It has nothing to do about positive thinking. It's about
the vision that you have, can you create a vision
for yourself? Are you empowered by that vision, if you
start creating visions for yourself, and you start acting on
those visions, and you're always focusing, using law of attraction,
always focusing on the things that you want, or the
things that you don't want, you're going to start to
make that progress. And if you do that long enough,
and you do that diligently enough, you're going to make
that shift, and I'm talking about you're going to go
from negative motivation to positive motivation. And that's not just
going to be some outward, superficial change, it might start
that way. But eventually you will internalize it, right. It's
that fake it till you make it mindset. So at
first, you might have to fake it. But eventually you
fake it long enough, you start to believe in it,
you start to adapt, it starts to become real for
you start to internalize it, your brain chemistry literally starts
to change, and to formulate a new identity for you.
So if you find yourself stuck where you are, you're
not happy with the yo yo effect that you've been
having. You don't like the frustration of being motivated by
negativity, and fear and pain and anger, then, now you
see that there's this new avenue for you positive motivation.
Go ahead and take the actions necessary to make that
shift for yourself. Start by creating a vision. And maybe
the vision for you right now is that you're going
to be positively motivated instead of negatively motivated and that
from now on, that you're committed to looking only at
the things that you want to create in your life
and not the things that you don't want
