hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about how to change the
world alright so this is a deep topic pretty big
topic but this is a quick self-help segment so in
about 15 minutes I'm going to cover my key thoughts
about how to go about starting to change the world
if you're listening to this and and you're interested in
this idea that I applaud you because many people out
there are so concerned about themselves so caught up in
their own problems in their own emotions in paying the
bills in looking good in front of their family or
in front of their friends or living up to society
standards that they are really not even thinking about ways
to change the world to improve the world and I
think that that is going to be a major shift
that happens in the next century in the next hundred
years is that more and more of us as we're
getting our basic needs satisfied are going to start to
ask the question of what is there beyond just living
a comfortable kind of life where we're secure and we're
safe what is what is the next level of evolution
from that and that is the self actualized life that
is the purpose driven life that is the life where
you are very clear about the kind of impact that
you want to have and you're very passionate about committing
basically your life energies towards creating a better world in
whatever kind of way that is and that can be
in subtle ways or it can be in very dramatic
ways so a dramatic way might be to go out
there and to start a company that produces electric cars
and maybe your vision is that you want to eliminate
petroleum use in vehicles around the whole world and that's
a very big positive vision that you've got it's a
bold inspiring vision and maybe that's the kind of change
you want to create and you want to be a
part of that you want to be the mastermind the
visionary behind that or you want to maybe just contribute
to that kind of cause so that's one big dramatic
way maybe a more subtle way is through being a
personal role model of how you want other people to
act in the world in the future right do you
want to set an example for how to live an
inspiring life you want to set an example for how
to be passionate you want to set an example for
how to be compassionate do you want to set an
example for how to be loving because everyone that you
come into contact with throughout your life as simple just
as your friends and their friends so friends of friends
that little social circle that you've got your family members
people that you're talking to even the grocery clerk that
you're interacting with when you're buying your groceries all of
those people are interacting with you and those are opportunities
and those are interactions each interaction is an opportunity for
you to influence them and you can influence them in
any kind of way that you want positive neutral negative
anything could happen so what kind of impact do you
want to have there maybe you want to demonstrate something
some sort of value that you want to embody and
you want to have that rub off on other people
perhaps you've had a mentor like that in the past
maybe an old teacher from high school from college or
maybe a parent grandparent somebody that you really admire someone
that was a role model for you and think about
how that impacted you and how your life was changed
and the trajectory really of your life has been altered
and that's why you're now grateful to that person but
maybe you want to have that kind of impact whatever
it is changing the world is where the real fulfillment
in life comes from so I applaud you for even
thinking about this idea and the problem with changing the
world because I've always been driven to do this I've
always just had this need to go out there and
to do something really positive not because I want to
be a mother Teresa type figure but because I get
enjoyment out of that that sense of contribution is just
so such an amazing feeling there's hardly any other feeling
like that in the world when you actually go out
there you do that and you see the smile this
puts on other people's faces and the impact that it
has and how it just progresses humanity and how it
honors some sort of higher ideals that's just so so
so rewarding very very fulfilling it's not the kind of
shallow success that you get just with going and earning
a bunch money and so the idea here is that
this is a really I think this is one of
the most powerful goals to have for yourself is to
change the world in some positive way the trick of
course is that when the rubber meets the road it's
not that easy to change the world and this goes
back to the very beginning that I was talking about
this point of that most of us are so concerned
about ourselves that we rarely have the opportunity to go
out there and make a big difference and I find
that that's very very very true and the biggest thing
there's going to prevent you from changing the world is
mastery of yourself mastery of your own thoughts and your
own emotions because if you cannot master yourself if you
cannot master your own addictive compulsive behaviors if you cannot
master your own negative thinking if you cannot master your
own self sabotaging behavior you can't master your own finances
and you can't master your own fitness and your own
health and you can't master your own relationships if you
can't handle that and be comfortable in that then there
is no way you can ascend to the next level
it's really Maslow's hierarchy of needs this is what it
goes back to because on that hierarchy Maslow talked about
the needs that human beings have the psychological needs of
course we have the need for very basic things like
food water oxygen but then we have the next rung
up which are things like shelter and certain sense of
security the idea that we're not going to get harmed
or stabbed in the back then the next level up
is maybe having some social connections some friends some relationship
going where you get some love the next level up
from that is a sense of belonging to a to
a larger community than just yourself and then maybe the
next step after that is really the peak the peak
of the pyramid and that is self-actualization and that's when
you're going out there and your life is about something
that's greater than yourself it's about creating both an inner
self mastery but then also taking that and channeling that
energy because now you've got the rest of it taken
care of right you've got your you've got your basic
national security handled you've got your health handle got your
relationships handle what's next well next is making that big
change to making that impact and to do that you
really need to summon the best of yourself because to
change the world this is a difficult thing why well
because the world is the way it is and it
has a certain inertia that doesn't mean that you can't
change it that just means you can have to go
up hill in many cases to change it so if
you want to change the petroleum industry and you want
to change the way that cars around the world work
and you want to get them all working on green
energy well that's they're going to have quite a few
obstacles to doing that there's a big system in place
already you can change that system how are you going
to do that well it's going to all start with
you first of all are you motivated enough to do
it do you have a vision for how you want
to do it are you going to be healthy enough
to do it are you going to have the money
to actually go out there and have the time to
think about the problem rather than be thinking about how
to pay your bills right these are just fundamental logistical
challenges you're gonna have not to mention the the higher-level
challenges of convincing people are you gonna be able to
go out there and convince people of your vision are
you going to have the skills the technical skills you
need do you need to have engineering skills you need
to have communication skills you need to have some sort
of other technical abilities to get this kind of vision
passed are you going to have the financial capital to
get it passed are you going to know the right
people right are you going to persist past all those
obstacles are you going to know how to keep yourself
motivated are you going to know how to think positive
thoughts when you're feeling negative so all of those are
going to be huge huge huge factors and that's why
people do not accomplish more change is because they have
not mastered themselves well enough to be able to get
even even halfway through that process that I just described
they just never make it that far because for them
it's mostly like okay I need to pay my rent
next month I need to pay down the credit card
bills and I need to make sure that my friends
are not going to leave me and hate me so
I'm going to I'm going to do something to to
appease them and I'm going to try to appease my
family and I'm just going to try to fit into
my community and most people stop there that's like that's
their whole struggle in life is they struggle just to
get that done health I didn't mention but that's also
a big one right people struggling with their health so
when you're struggling with all that then how can you
be thinking about changing the world or changing the petroleum
industry or doing something big like that you can't it's
not going to happen you're too self-centered you're too self-centered
what you've got to do is you got to say
okay if I really want to change the world it
would be nice to be able to go out there
right now and maybe join a soup kitchen or maybe
start on that big project start my own business or
whatever say it screw it I'm just going to go
for it the challenge with that is that to change
the world this is going to be something you have
to do over the long run you can't do it
in a week you can't do it in a month
you can't even really do it in a year it's
going to take a long time so that being the
case you have to ask yourself to do that to
get that kind of sustainability what what needs to happen
what are the changes need to happen in my life
and what you're probably going to notice is like oh
damn well if I really really want to make that
kind of impact on the world I'm gonna have to
start at the beginning and the beginning is right here
with me because if I'm addicted to television and food
or drugs or alcohol or smoking or depression depressive thoughts
anxiety if I'm addicted to those things there's no way
I'm making any difference so I got to fix all
those first then maybe I need to go out there
actually learn study acquire some skills so that I can
have the ability to to shape my environment the way
that I want just so that I can open the
doors for myself right because right now you probably don't
even know how to go about creating that kind of
change maybe you don't even know what that change exactly
should be you just know that you have that kind
of Drive you have that ambitious and that's good that's
you know you got to start somewhere and I think
that the fact that you've got that drive is amazing
that's you're in top 1% already and I really want
to encourage you because you're listening to this I want
to plant the seed because this is critical if you
get this down this will make the change between you
wasting your life in mediocrity and you living in amazing
kind of life and going out there and really change
the world in a positive way I want to plant
the seed that you have to start with yourself start
becoming much more aware start reading books about psychology start
studying the psychology of success start practicing with yourself sort
understanding how you work start mastering your health your relationships
start mastering your your financial situation start mastering your career
get those things handled because when you've got those handled
you're going to have a foundation from which you could
have a massive impact but you're not going to do
that by just going for that massive impact right off
the bat and having a shaky foundation it's like you're
trying to build a skyscraper you cannot build a thousand-foot
skyscraper a hundred stories skyscraper on on on a bed
of sand it's not going to work you need something
a lot more solid because that thing has weight to
it and literally that's what's going to happen here is
that when you try to change the world the world
is going to bear its weight back on you it
will whether its physical barriers you're coming against technological barriers
human barriers in society obstinacy whatever people not accepting you
those that's like a big weight and a big pressure
on your shoulders and you are going to crumble you
are going to crumble just like a skyscraper standing on
a bed of sand if you do not master yourself
and you to understand how to withstand that you need
to build up yourself to be able to withstand the
kind of pressure that you will have to change the
world and then you can go out there and you
will be able to rock it and you will be
able to give us something really amazing in the next
hundred years and I really look forward to hearing about
what that is so I'm going to wrap it up

world this is personally my mission and what I'm doing
