            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FoYs1YqQI7w' target='_blank'>The Power Of Routines - How Your Daily Routine Holds You Back From Your Dreams</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Routine is Crucial for Success</b>: Leo Gura stresses that one's daily routine significantly affects success levels and overall feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. He notes that strong, successful people have robust, beneficial daily routines. 
</li><li><b>Routine Relates to Choices</b>: It's a matter of choices. Every day provides opportunities to either uphold your routine or slip back into comfort and put off responsibilities. For example, deciding to wake up at a set time instead of sleeping in already sets the tone for that day's routine.
</li><li><b>Living up to Potential</b>: He emphasizes using routines to live up to your full potential, being in alignment with your values, and acting on what you think is important. Failure to do this may lead to dissatisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Neglecting Routine</b>: Neglecting to follow through with your routine or daily actions can lead to unease and discomfort. Sitting around and not accomplishing set tasks can lead to feeling worthless, even if one has chosen to avoid difficult tasks in favor of more comfortable ones.
</li><li><b>Building a Strong Routine</b>: Advanced personal development involves establishing a strong routine. Such a routine should promote improvement in all life areas, including career, relationships, and personal development. 
</li><li><b>Execution of Routine</b>: Routines can start the moment one wakes up, with set actions like listening to audio programs in the shower, taking daily supplements, performing visualizations and affirmations, reading a mission statement, and even meditation. Each activity accomplished adds momentum to one's day.
</li><li><b>The Role of Habit</b>: Leo asserts that everyone is a creature of habit, and the quality of a person's life is ultimately determined by their habits. Shoddy or non-existent routines can lead to feeling like a "leaf in the wind" and cause fear and avoidance of life's challenges.
</li><li><b>Importance of Good Habits</b>: Laziness and procrastination can lead to a defensive attitude, excuses, and fear of losing comfort. Inaction and bad habits will eventually disrupt the comfort zone leading to negative feelings of weakness, fear, disempowerment, guilt, and shame.
</li><li><b>Power of Positive Routines</b>: Positive routines, when consistently followed, lead to higher consciousness, advancement of personal values, goals, and overall vision. They make one feel stronger, fearless, and aid in gaining momentum in life.
</li><li><b>Momentum and Patience</b>: If you've been stuck in a negative spiral, it's important to be patient and understand the concept of momentum. You need to take baby steps and slowly work your way through the backlog of tasks, rather than trying to fix everything at once.
</li><li><b>Routines Train Mind and Body</b>: Routines train your mind and body to handle stress and challenges. They keep you on track and help you gradually work towards your goals and vision.
</li><li><b>Building a Positive Routine</b>: It is essential to identify and structure a daily routine that aligns with your values and goals. This could include waking up on time, exercising, eating a healthy breakfast, and being punctual. Developing a routine that contributes to advancing your values and goals will significantly enhance your quality of life and outcomes.
</li><li><b>Creation of Powerful Routine</b>: Consciously develop a powerful routine for yourself and stick to it, understanding that it takes effort, patience, and consistency to see substantial results.
</li><li><b>Importance of developing small habits</b>: Leo highlights the significant role small habits, such as 5-10 minutes of journaling or 20 minutes of visualization in the morning, can play in improving one's quality of life and overall successfulness. 
</li><li><b>Observing successful people</b>: Successful people tend to have robust routines that they adhere to persistently over weeks, months, or years until they become automatic, demonstrating the powerful impact of an efficient routine on success.
</li><li><b>Facing the initial challenge of routine creation</b>: Leo points out the initial challenge of creating a routine, which demands a high investment of emotional effort. Committing to it consistently, even when it's tough, will eventually lead to habits becoming automatic and easier to maintain.
</li><li><b>Similarity between developing a routine and a rocket escaping Earth's gravity</b>: Establishing a routine is compared to a rocket trying to escape Earth's gravity. It requires enough fuel (commitment and energy) to get out of orbit (comfort zone) and not fall back in.
</li><li><b>Loss of structure post-schooling</b>: Leo discusses how the structure provided by school or family activities can assist in developing routines. However, many people lose these routines when they become independent and fall into negative habits and procrastination.
</li><li><b>Crafting a personalized routine</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of consciously creating and committing to a custom routine that aligns with one's goals. The routine should start basic, and then different activities or techniques can be gradually added, depending on what works best individually.
</li><li><b>Role of personal development</b>: Leo accentuates that real personal development comes when theory is put into practice. Constructing a potent routine for daily execution is a way of practically implementing personal growth tactics, aiding in building momentum that leads to fulfillment and success.
</li><li><b>Active elimination of negative habits</b>: Leo encourages viewers to be active in recognizing and cutting out negative habits, such as watching too much television or excessive internet use, which can impede focus and productive routine development.
