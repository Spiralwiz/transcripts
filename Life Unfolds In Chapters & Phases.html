[Music] you in this episode we're going to be talking
about how life unfolds in chapters and in phases and
this is sort of a return to basic personal development
this is a very practical topic we're not going to
get too metaphysical here but it can be very useful
to start to think of your life in terms of
unfolding chapters and phases each chapter in your life which
there will be many will be composed of four main
phases which we're gonna call here the limbo phase that's
number one number two is the starting phase number three
is the middle and number four is the end so
we're gonna talk a lot about these different phases and
what they look like and what you should do and
the various traps that you might fall into with with
with each stage so just to briefly summarize them for
you here the limbo stage is a time of inaction
where you feel lost where you need to decompress and
you need to heal and think things through so this
is a period of isolation the starting phase is when
you find a new sense of direction in your life
and now this is the time where you start to
take action and start to build momentum then once that's
concluded that leads into the middle or sort of the
peak of the cycle and the peak is when you're
really hitting your stride you're building a lot of momentum
and you're in the zone and you're getting success and
that's one of the maximum that you reach and then
it starts to go downhill from there and then you
reach the end and the end is where things start
to get stale yes you have success but then there's
something new that you need to look out for and
now it's time to start thinking about wrapping up this
this whole chapter all these four phases are part of
one chapter starting to wrap that up and opening up
to the new chapter so those are the phases I
got this idea of these phases from Ipek which is
the coaching program that I took some years back I
highly recommend it if you want to become a life
coach Ipek is a great program I actually was just
going through my notebooks old coaching notebooks from when I
was when I was learning that how to coach they
have a lot of great techniques very practical tools that
you can use on yourself and on your clients to
help them to figure out how to manage their life
and so one of the models that they gave theirs
they gave sort of these different cycles they had different
names for them and so forth but a lot of
the information that I'm going to be talking about here
today are coming from them so credit goes to them
for for this model it's really handy because when you're
working with a client you can assess where in their
cycle they are which phase they're in and then you
can help to steer them in the right direction because
you know nothing is new Under the Sun human beings
have been growing for for thousands of years so we
kind of know how the human psychology works and how
people work in on their relationships in their business and
what kind of cycles and phases they go through so
it's really nice to be able to understand that because
then you can sort of orient and normalize whatever is
going on with you you don't feel lost so that's
the whole purpose of this episode so let's get into
the first phase in some detail number one limbo that's
what I call it so this is a phase where
you feel groundless lost and uncertain this is a time
of most inaction where you're not really doing a lot
of work you're not getting a lot of success you're
not earning a bunch of money or stuff like that
this is a low energy phase this is a time
to heal to reflect to take time off to introspect
to slow down it's a time to decompress because of
course it goes in a cycle that means that this
limbo that you're in right now came from a prior
phase which was the end of some other chapter so
at the end of a chapter you go into limbo
before the new chapter begins you're not sure what the
new chapter of your life is going to hold yet
and so during this time there's not much to work
on yet and probably you need to learn lessons and
decompress from stuff that happened in the last chapter so
during this limbo phase it's a to do research and
to start to look in new directions to see what
kind of new opportunities are available to you what is
your next chapter of life gonna be what's the theme
gonna be it can also involve coping with loss from
a previous chapter maybe the previous chapter closed without a
full resolution or maybe it ended in catastrophic failure it
doesn't always end in success the way you want maybe
the last chapter was you starting your business and then
it all came crashing down and your business went bankrupt
in some bad turn of the economy and now you're
dealing with the fallout of that and now you got
to think about well what's next what's my new business
or am I getting a job or am I going
to be homeless well you know what what's the next
phase it's important to use this time to integrate lessons
from the previous chapter there's probably a lot of stuff
you learned whether you succeeded or failed in the last
phase it doesn't matter there's many lessons that can be
learned from success or from failure and probably you had
a mixture of both maybe you succeeded in certain areas
but failed in other areas so spending time just contemplating
and really extracting the lessons making the lessons explicit that's
important this is a time also to get honest with
yourself and to face your own and inner demons and
inadequacies so probably if you had any failures in the
Pratt and in the previous chapter it's because you had
serious inner obstacles that need work that's why personal development
is done that's why consciousness work and spirituality is done
so you get honest about that so maybe your business
failed not because the economy took a downturn but really
because of some personal flaw that you had that now
you need to own up to and of course that
can be difficult to do so this limbo phase can
be sort of a a melancholy challenging phase because you
are turning inwards and you're introspecting and you're also admitting
of various mistakes you're you're kind of looking at your
own performance in the past and seeing you know what
did you like what didn't you like you're accepting responsibility
for your mistake maybe you have certain regrets about how
you handle situations that you want to handle differently next
time and so the danger here with this phase is
that people might want to move through it too quickly
without really going into it and doing the introspection and
really doing the inner work they might distract themselves with
external activities and hobbies and things when really they need
to give themselves the opportunity to fully go into this
phase so during this phase you might feel alone you
might feel lazy you might feel listless you might feel
purposeless you might even feel depressed you might fear for
the future fear of the unknown because you don't know
what comes next you might have a sense that this
is it this is like the most that you would
ever get in life is the previous peak that you
got and that now the best chapter of your life
is over well of course this is just an illusion
it doesn't have to be this way but it can
feel that way it can feel especially when you're depressed
or you're stuck in a rut it can feel like
it's gonna last forever and that you don't know how
to break out of it of course that's totally normal
which is why it's helpful to know that coz just
by knowing that already helps you to break out of
it whereas if you start to take it too seriously
and you think that it's gonna last forever then you
completely lose hope and then that's when things start to
go wrong during this phase you're gonna doubt yourself a
lot there's gonna be a loss of control a surrender
a facing of some of your greatest fears admitting things
about yourself and your life that you don't want to
admit maybe admitting that you wasted a lot of time
or maybe admitted that you you sorted the wrong type
of business or you entered the wrong type of relationship
for whatever personal reasons that you had during this phase
you are realigning with your top values if you're doing
it correctly if you're doing it incorrectly then you're ignoring
your values you don't even know you have any values
and you're going off and you're distracting yourself with television
or getting into some of the kind of rut during
this phase you also need to be challenging limiting beliefs
because it's during this phase that you're starting to get
little Inklings of what life could hold for you next
maybe it's a new business maybe it's a move to
a different country maybe it's breaking with a relationship or
moving away from your family or you know something and
you're getting little glimpses of what it could be us
a vision is starting to materialize but it takes time
for that vision to become concrete at first it's just
little Inklings and of course as the vision starts to
materialize all sorts of limiting beliefs come up like for
example maybe you start to see the vision of how
you're gonna start your own business whereas before you were
working in some dead-end job and and now that's exciting
that you're starting to see this possibility but at the
same time you have all these fears and limiting beliefs
about like how well I've never run a business so
I don't even know what that looks like how am
I gonna do it I don't have the money where
am I gonna get the capital who's gonna loan me
money and you know what if I'm not good enough
I don't have enough experience I don't have any connections
and so forth so all those need to be challenged
and your vision needs to be able to conquer all
those limiting beliefs otherwise you can't really move into the
next phase so as this phase begins the limbo phase
usually you might start off in victim mentality playing the
victim with all these excuses about well I can't do
it I don't know how to do it or there's
something wrong with me so various kinds of victim mindsets
like I'm too old I'm not experienced enough and so
forth and then as you're going through this phase and
you're getting to the end of the limbo phase your
vision is starting to form and now you're taking more
and more responsibility and you're starting to to see that
wait a minute maybe I can do it maybe I'm
just doubting myself too much maybe this vision really is
worth the effort that I'm gonna put into it maybe
I should just take a leap of faith and commit
to this vision so you're getting that towards the very
end of this phase and that's taking responsibility and so
really this is like the beginning of a new slate
for you you can sort of start your life anew
you can be reborn that's the power of these chapters
every chapter is a new slate and here we're sort
of at the beginning of the new chapter it's sort
of like you're sitting down to write a novel and
you just have a blank screen on your computer and
you can write anything and that's kind of scary and
exciting at the same time it's scary because like well
what am I gonna write I can I can write
all sorts of stupid stuff and I don't know where
to begin I'm not inspired yet by anything I don't
have any kind of concrete direction that's right because that's
how every beginning is it's totally open its freedom it's
so much freedom that it's stifling you're stifled by the
freedom on the other hand it's exciting because there's all
these possibilities and so that's what you're dealing with you're
trying to make decisions so at this point you might
also be very indecisive you might have multiple visions of
what you might want to do maybe there's three different
types of business that you want to start but you're
not sure which one or you're trying to find your
life purpose but again you're not sure which one should
be art or music or should it be filmmaking and
you're not sure which one to choose and so you
can be very self doubting in this respect but also
this is a time for exploring new opportunities getting into
totally new things that you hadn't done before in your
life maybe it's a new hobby maybe it's hanging out
with new people maybe it's studying a new subject that
you hadn't studied before maybe it's starting to take your
health seriously where before it was not even on your
radar maybe it's now beginning spirituality and discovering the possibilities
of spirituality so you're starting to like enter new realms
of life new domains that weren't on your radar before
so that's phase one now what do you do here
when you're at this phase the limbo phase well first
of all it's important that you allow yourself to decompress
to take time off so one of the biggest mistakes
you can make at the limbo phase is trying to
speed up and trying to guilt yourself for underachieving those
of us who are very ambitious and high achievers and
we want to be winners and we want to be
getting more money more success we always want to be
working on something those of us who are workaholics those
of us who are super creative we also want to
have we always want to have some project that we're
working on you know we don't waste our time we
can be too hard on ourselves and that we're always
expecting to be like delivering results and this is just
a phase in your life where you're not going to
be delivering any results so you got to be okay
with that if you're a workaholic you're gonna struggle with
that and that's that's a problem because you know the
problem is workaholics is that they just get kind of
stuck in the cycle of doing the same work over
and over and over again they never really go inside
and reflect and ask themselves more fundamental questions like is
this work even helping mankind is this work even aligned
with my top values why am i doing is is
this work really gonna fulfill me in the end and
those are really important questions to ask it's important to
be gentle with yourself in this phase don't guilt yourself
don't try to get results out of yourself just chill
and hang out and take it easy and enjoy that
trust that by taking the time to decompress and to
relax and to introspect that some new purpose will emerge
for you but not necessarily in a day or in
a week or in a month it might take time
and I'm deliberately not giving you timeframes here for how
long these different phases could take because for different people
it'll be different really we're talking on the order of
months and years here so a phase might take six
months or maybe it might take a year or two
years or three years that's roughly what we're looking at
of course there's no hard and fast rules it's gonna
be different for everybody at different times in their lives
it's important during this phase to break old patterns and
to do new things because really what this phase is
is sort of a discovery process you're discovering deeper aspects
of yourself peeling back the layers of the onion of
the self becoming more authentic more true to yourself realigning
yourself with your top values really thinking deeply about what
you really want from life and allowing yourself to dream
to vision to get inspired by stuff and the way
you get inspired is by participating with new aspects of
reality so stuffily you know like that you didn't do
before that the old stuff that you used to do
it doesn't inspire you anymore because you've exhausted that from
the previous chapter so now maybe there's new books you
want to read new people you want to hang out
with new kinds of industries you want to explore new
career opportunities you want to explore maybe there's a new
part of the world that you want to live in
or travel to that's all really great you got to
sort of follow up with that because all if all
you do is you just hunker down and sit back
stay home and keep doing all the old stuff you
used to do well there's not enough new information to
come in to inspire you and there's also not enough
new opportunities to give you hope and then you can
become depressed because of that so you got to open
yourself up to life there's so much within life that
can inspire you whether it's movies or art or museums
or travel or new people or psychedelics or maybe you
discover self-help maybe you discover spirituality maybe you have a
mystical experience that that opens up a whole new realm
for you to then explore to get excited about to
give you new business ideas to give you new directions
for your career new ways of thinking about your relationships
and your family and your friendships and so forth this
is a time to really review what's most important for
you in life and of course it really helps that
you know your top values and you have a sense
of life purpose so for that check out my life
purpose course that's what it's all about there's there's quite
a lot involved to get a person to really start
to understand who they are even though of course you're
you and you think you know who you are and
what you want actually most people have no idea who
they are hard what they really want and I'm not
even talking about enlightenment here I'm just talking about who
you are as a Ito as a personality you don't
even understand what that is yet nevermind enlightenment during this
phase consider maybe working on new areas of your life
that you've neglected in the past so maybe in the
past you weren't focused on business and now you can
be or maybe in the past you weren't focused on
family and relationships but now you can be or your
health and now you can be or your spirituality and
now you can be allow yourself during this phase to
be a little bit lazy and to be a bit
in a rut that's ok as long as you don't
get totally mired in it for years that's ok allow
yourself to get inspired by life be careful not to
fall into addictions and distractions with pornography television smoking weed
habitually this sort of stuff that can just kind of
numb your mind put you into low consciousness and actually
take you out of introspection mode that would be a
mistake and if you get caught up in that that
very long deep rut then you can waste several years
of your life in this and it's gonna be painful
and unnecessary so watch out for that during this phase
also cherish your solitude be alone get comfortable being alone
it's ok you don't need to always be surrounded by
friends you don't need to always be busy minimize your
life so that you have time to enjoy your solitude
to introspect and to think and along these lines a
really great technique is to schedule a week or two
for a solo retreat somewhere secluded out in nature rent
a cabin on Airbnb somewhere in the mountains in the
forest in the desert all by yourself and just live
there for a few weeks not meditating per se not
doing psychedelics per se although you could but just like
just just be there by yourself decompress and think about
what you want in life maybe take a journal with
you and just journal you'd be amazed at how effective
this simple technique is see most people will never take
the time to actually schedule something like this because they
think like oh well Leo do I really need to
do it I mean like yeah it sounds like it
would be helpful but yeah what if I just stay
home for a week and watch TV but see if
you do that you're not gonna get anything near what
you would get if you actually took the time to
to schedule a cabin out in the forest and be
there all by yourself without any television internet or cell
phones it like one of these solar retreats can make
or break your whole life it can mean the difference
between finding your life purpose and not that's that's how
important this is it's it's during these periods where you
have inspiration where you have new visions and you develop
them you dream and you find the next chapter in
your life a strong powerful compelling chapter that's what you
want here you don't want a weak chapter you don't
want to waste because you know one chapter is gonna
probably take you to complete a whole chapter with four
phases we're talking five years roughly speaking you know five
maybe even ten years for a whole chapter so it
would be a great shame if the next five or
ten years you devoted to a week piddly chapter you
don't want that so it's highly worthwhile to invest a
couple of weeks a couple of months to really figure
out what your next chapter is gonna be that's highly
worth it and it's gonna pay huge dividends in terms
of money and everything else so it's worth a little
bit of investment if you have to spend a thousand
dollars to do this retreat it's still highly worth it
this is also a great time did you travel rent
a car travel around wherever you are go to some
parks go to some new attractions go to some museums
go somewhere you've never been before again open yourself up
to new influences and traveling by yourself is really great
because while you're traveling you get to think while you're
in the plane while you're in the train while you're
in the car driving somewhere one of my favorite things
in life that I get a lot of inspiration from
is driving solo driving I'll just drive for 4 hours
or 2 hours whatever it is just drive somewhere doesn't
matter where it could be just around town with nowhere
in particular to go or somewhere to a different state
to a desert to a forest to a mountain that
I've never been to to a city have never been
to I'm actually starting to do a lot more that
lately and as man is this it's really great for
decompressing and for for thinking and for for inspiring yourself
also during this phase do activities which bring joy in
you bring out the joy find your bliss as Joseph
Campbell would say and to follow that you can't find
your bliss unless you're you're doing stuff that you actually
enjoy so stuff that's not work what do you enjoy
about life and if you don't enjoy anything well that
just shows you you need to spend a lot more
time figuring out what you really enjoy testing out different
things maybe you enjoy travel maybe you enjoy cooking maybe
you enjoy hanging out with friends or whatever and just
just give yourself the space to participate in that because
that's where your inspiration comes from then from that some
new business idea could come or a new career idea
or whatever so don't be too practical in this phase
the ultimate goal of this phase is to build a
new compelling vision for the next chapter of your life
so that's really what you're working towards without a compelling
vision you can't really start on anything you can't begin
the hero's journey so the hero's journey begins here you're
kind of stuck in a rut and then you discover
some new opportunity some new vision comes your way and
then is presented to you the call to adventure will
you accept the call or will you reject it will
you cope with excuses and reasons for why you shouldn't
go on this adventure this adventure will be the next
three phases of this chapter that's opening up to you
here and of course a lot of times we hesitate
we don't just jump on the adventure because adventures lead
into the unknown they're dangerous they require expenditure of energy
and resources they requires to break out of our comfort
zone that requires to find some deeper motivation within ourselves
and so we hesitate and we stall that's very common
but eventually you will find your vision and you will
accept the call to adventure and you will commit to
some path and you'll get some direction and that leads
us now into stage two or phase two this is
the beginning the start the start of your journey the
start of your adventure the start of you going down
some particular road so this really begins with a clear
vision purpose direction and certainty about what you want to
do there's a sense of clarity now that you're in
Phase two you have some kind of loose plan it
doesn't need to be very detailed but there's definitely a
loose plan that you have and this plan is gonna
require a lot of action to implement it whatever it
might be might be a new business plan might be
the vision to start a family to find a wife
or a husband settle down start having kids you know
it might be that where it might be a plan
to to lose a lot of weight and to get
yourself into shape and start to eat healthy and start
to work out go to the gym I know there
was a phase in my life where I definitely had
that chapter of working on my health and fitness so
stuff like that during this phase you are committing to
a new field exploring some new realm you're not just
dabbling and exploring now you've you've done a bit of
the preliminary exploration of different fields in phase one the
limbo phase now you've actually found a new field and
you're committing to it in your same cave this is
the thing I'm gonna do for the next five or
ten years or however long this is something I really
want to focus on whether it's your fitness or some
particular type of business maybe you want to become an
artist or program better speaker and communicator so you're saying
okay I'm gonna focus on speaking and communication for the
next five years that's my vision to become a great
communicator a great leader or whatever during this phase there's
usually a lot of optimism about the future because you
found something juicy that you want to work on there's
engagement here there's a sense of passion so this is
like what happens at the end of depression once you're
done with all your depression your hopelessness then you find
a new vision and energy passion and optimism this is
a time for training work and networking there's probably a
lot of new skills that you need to learn in
order to master this new field that you're moving into
your eager in this phase to explore to build and
to create you're pushing yourself to new heights you're discovering
new aspects of yourself you're discovering entirely new realms of
life and you're amazed because what might seem like a
realm that didn't even exist for you before like maybe
spirituality and meditation you start to go into each other
train your meditation concentration abilities and then all of a
sudden you discover this amazing realm of spirituality and all
the possibilities there you start to read a bunch of
books and go to workshops and lectures and you start
to watch videos and so you discover a whole new
realm that you want to commit yourself to or maybe
it's within dating and pick up you discover this and
you start to get real serious about it or maybe
it's some new business snitch that you discover that you
see that there's a big opportunity there and you got
to strike while the iron is hot to jump into
that business during this phase you start to work a
lot lots of overtime but it doesn't often feel like
work because it's so exciting and so new and so
fresh during this phase you start to get a lot
of done this is where you go into action mode
and you become very practical this is a high energy
phase whereas the previous phase was low energy some of
the problems that could arise here is a fear of
failure and feelings of inadequacy and insecurities because you're entering
something new and of course you're comparing yourself to all
those people who are really good at that thing who've
been practicing it for years but you're just a newbie
and so you have that problem of feeling like a
newbie and feeling like you're never gonna make it you're
not good enough to succeed in this business you're never
gonna develop the right skills that you're just flawed in
some way you're not talented in this area and you
got to push through that and it's it's also very
easy to quit in this face and to run back
to your old life see so don't just assume that
it's gonna all work out automatically for you know you
can really get crippled by your insecurities and adequacy and
fear of failure you have to really get your inner
game dialed in so that those limiting beliefs don't you
and that you keep building your momentum here and that's
really what this phase is doing it's building a lot
of momentum and it takes work to build that momentum
first doesn't come easily so what do you do in
this phase make sure that you stay focused on your
training there's gonna be a lot of training happening here
and you got to be disciplined about it and you
got to be building good habits and routines make sure
that you're building up momentum it's important to be executing
every single day on something so like if you're getting
into spirituality then every single day you got to be
doing your yoga or your meditation like clockwork and not
skipping days or if you're getting into business and every
single day you're working on your business or if you're
writing a novel then every single day you got to
be writing you know at least a couple of pages
of your novel every single day to build that momentum
that's very important and that's quite challenging for many people
to do because you're coming out of a rut you're
coming out of being lazy and most people they've never
seriously disciplined themselves to to work on projects independently outside
of being prodded by a boss or by a family
member some like that or by the need to pay
your mortgage like being a - to teach yourself how
to build momentum and how to follow through on your
own personal visions and projects is one of the most
basic aspects of personal development and building a high quality
life which many people just have never have never done
and then of course that's why they get so depressed
it's important to stay optimistic in this phase and to
keep working on your vision don't assume that your initial
vision is the end no it's really just the beginning
you have to really keep working on that vision keep
asking yourself is this really what I want and refining
it so it's not really about changing your vision you
want to be careful not to just be changing your
vision every single month your vision needs to have some
stability to it but once you do have your vision
you can keep refining it and then as you're as
you're working you can see well am I am I
really working is what is is the stuff that I'm
doing really totally aligned with the vision then you'll see
it's not and you can kind of expand your vision
more and more and more and build it up and
that only gets you more excited about the possibilities it's
very important that during this phase you don't quit and
run back to your old life so be very careful
about succumbing to easy tempting addictions like porn video games
social media watching YouTube videos watching television eating terrible food
hanging out with terrible friends chronically smoking weed everyday and
this sort of stuff this is gonna completely destroy any
possibility of building up that momentum and really launching the
next chapter of your life also make sure that you
do pace yourself don't burn yourself out it's always exciting
to start something new what's really difficult is to build
enough momentum on that thing and to kind of stick
with it for at least a year or two so
it's very important that you that you really focus on
building momentum here also be prepared for obstacles whatever new
project you start whether it's a family or fitness and
nutrition or dating or a business it's always gonna be
harder than you thought and there's gonna be some element
of grind and boredom to it as well and there
are going to be threshold Guardians as I talked about
with the hero's journey go check out my episode called
the highest hero the highest hero's journey where I explain
what the hero's journey is that that episode really dovetails
with this one here so there's gonna be threshold Guardians
no matter what you're trying to do whether you're starting
a new business or you're learning a new musical instrument
or you're getting into a new relationship there's gonna be
obstacles and you're gonna be tempted to quit so make
sure that you stick through those get good at identifying
threshold Guardians so that when something bad happens that that
tries to derail the start of your next chapter you
realize that oh this is just this is just a
threshold Guardian I just have to work with it not
quit during this phase become a serious student because there's
a lot you have to learn to become good at
whatever you're trying to master emulate various role models who
are doing or have done the things that you want
to do and be good at find the best teachers
find resources books to read how-to courses all of this
is available online easily these days so once you've done
all that now you're ready for phase 3 which is
the middle or the peak or hitting your stride by
this point momentum has been built up and now you're
in the zone and you're on fire success is coming
to you faster than you expected and you're amazed by
your results so all that hard work that you did
learning and and pushing through your limiting beliefs and holding
onto your vision now all of that is coming to
fruition you can actually sense that your vision is starting
to have become actualized in the real world what was
once just ideas and pipe dreams now you're actually starting
to see it money is pouring in people are starting
to take notice of your work if this is business
that we're talking about if this is career then you're
starting to reach a point where people recognize you for
your skills and for your achievements and now people want
to work with you employers want to hire you maybe
you have multiple employers competing for your attention trying to
give you higher and higher salaries and this feels great
you're on top of life at this point you're at
the peak it feels amazing you start to feel very
grateful you start to feel like man if only everybody
knew that life could be so good but of course
the danger is that when you're hitting the peak there
is an illusion now that comes that it will always
be like this it's you're gonna want to try to
hold hold on and ride that peak for as long
as you can thinking that this is it you're kind
of maxed out on life and if you can just
maintain that then this is what life is all about
during this phase you're focused on what's working because you
figured out some niche that seems to work there could
still be self-doubt and self-sabotage during this phase you got
to be careful with that you could also get too
arrogant or too cocky and too complacent and then suffer
some catastrophe because of that during this phase you're usually
very busy your attention is focused outwardly you're not introspecting
very much so what do you do in this phase
well enjoy it enjoy the ride while it lasts you're
riding a sort of wave and you're at the peak
it's like surfing so you're at that point where you're
actually surfing on the big wave and you're you've stabilized
and you're in that tunnel you're in the zone and
everything's working great so of course enjoy that that was
the whole point of your vision is to get to
this point celebrate your success keep doing what's been working
don't try to innovate too much here if it's been
working for you producing results double down on that triple
down on that master it finish the mastery process so
you were getting good you're getting good but there's still
more to master so keep mastering and don't get complacent
remember that this peak won't last it's just a phase
and it will pass so sort of emotionally prepare yourself
for what's coming next and what's coming next is gonna
be a bit of a downturn be careful not to
get lost in materialism like the fruits of your success
like money fame sex these things you've earned through this
hard work now and it can be easy to get
kind of lost in that in those trappings but remember
that these things are not really why you were doing
all this and that these things never really give you
any true fulfillment anyways and so in this phase you
will discover just how little fulfillment you get for money
Fame and sex and that can be a very valuable
lesson in and of itself for you to realize that
and then of course after that oftentimes comes a downturn
and a depression you're never gonna be more depressed in
your life than the moment that you get everything that
you've ever wanted if you get a million dollars and
you get a bunch of Fame at a bunch of
sex the very next day is gonna be the most
depressing day of your life because you're gonna realize how
little that really did for you how spiritually hollow that
materialistic stuff is and of course that can be very
sobering because you realize well wait a minute léo then
what the hell have I been working towards why have
I been I've even chasing decision because my whole vision
was about money Fame ins and sex and and a
big house and and all this and and now you're
saying that it doesn't work how was I doing it
well that's very good that's very good to discover why
were you doing that see it's by going through this
process that you learn more about yourself you peel the
layers of your onion the onion that is you and
then you get more and more authentic about what you
really want out of life what your top values are
and you don't just do that by sitting on a
couch of course you could to some extent but you
also do it by actually looking at the results that
you get in your life and going through this cyclical
process also be careful in this phase not to overwork
yourself and to burn yourself out or to ruin your
health by overworking because you know you start to get
sex and more success and more fame and more money
and more sex and you just kind of you know
you go to this into this vortex of just becoming
one minded in your life of just like pursuing your
career and that's it for example to the neglect of
your family your health and other things finish what you
started in this phase don't run off the next thing
just yet bring it to its completion exhausted also be
prepared that there might be uh there might be a
major obstacle right at the peak of the face in
the hero's journey this is known as entering the belly
of the whale this is where you come to confront
your your greatest obstacle or you fight the dragon and
then you got to conquer the dragon so that's you
reaching the very very peak the very climax and then
once you do that whether you succeed or whether you
fail at conquering the dragon then comes the end this
is phase number four all good things come to an
end so this journey this chapter might end in a
success or a failure and it doesn't really matter which
you can learn a lot from both oftentimes you learn
even more from your failures so maybe you were starting
a business and it worked out and you made millions
of dollars great but now it's coming to an end
you've exhausted that business or maybe you started a business
but it failed because it was a bad business idea
and you were so experienced also great you've learned very
important lessons there that now need to be integrated and
you got to look towards the next thing so this
is the end during the end this is a phase
where there can be a lot of denial and resistance
to the chapter ending especially if you had great success
because you want to maintain that success and you don't
want to earn less money and get less fame and
less sex you want to get more that's only natural
you want to keep expanding you can't have a life
of never-ending expansion life doesn't work that way it's always
cyclical there's ups and downs so be aware of that
during this end phase there can be a clinging to
the past and a resistance to the new chapter that
is now calling you so maybe you've succeeded in this
business but now you're realizing well yeah this business it
was nice and I got some money out of it
that's important and I grew a lot I learned a
lot of stuff but this business is not really what
I'm most passionate about there's an even higher level there's
even something more important than business but of course I'm
scared of going after it because now I've got the
successful business I want to lose what I've built over
the last five or ten years see so there's sort
of clinging but during this chapter you have to start
to realize that your life has that this chapter has
run its course and that that now there's a next
chapter waiting for you during this phase projects that used
to excite you can now start to feel stale trivial
and meaningless there can be a loss of meaning a
sort of hollowness to success that you're starting to realize
you might start to feel unhappy or dissatisfied and unfulfilled
you might search I wonder is this all there is
to life is just this more of this because it
feels very empty in hollow your energy and motivation which
used to be high now is starting to wane at
the same time you're getting comfortable you're getting comfortable with
luxury and success and the fruits of your work that
you've accumulated so you're resistant to changing or to getting
out of that comfort because you know that if you
sort the next chapter that means you have to go
to your uncomfort and comforters uncomfortable uncomforta own and you
don't want to do that you'd rather stay comfortable you
don't want to move to a new city you'd want
to move to a new country don't want to change
careers you don't want to you know you don't want
to change your chips your friends your spouse your family
don't want to change stuff during this phase you can
start to feel like a victim you could start to
get angry or upset because you're trapped and cornered in
life life is starting to feel stale you can start
complaining and bitching and moaning you feel entitled you can
even become corrupt with your success you can become an
option noxious and arrogant and now you're starting to get
into a rut you're going through life just going through
the motions you're starting to not feel so creative anymore
yes you're going to work yes you're going to your
business you're working on it but it just it doesn't
excite you anymore and it just feels like the same
old thing every day and you're not inspired anymore because
you've maxed out your vision you've actualized your vision so
you need a new vision but at this point you
have no idea what the new vision is because you
haven't thought that far you were so busy trying to
actualize your first vision and it was so difficult to
do that that you never even consider that there might
be something beyond that but now of course you have
to start considering that there can be a fear of
collapse or a fear of losing it all at this
point because you might think like well okay I've built
this business but now it's time to move on to
something else but this business who's gonna run it I
don't know how am I gonna keep keep this business
up and so your attention and your motivations could be
split now between your old business or some old project
you had in some new projects that you might be
considering and now the energy is starting to to fall
off getting to into a low energy state depression could
happen a sense of isolation can start to happen a
withdrawal starts to happen towards the very end of this
phase which of course leads us right back into the
very first phase that we started with which is limbo
and then it's from limbo that you start to open
up the next chapter so what do you do here
in phase 4 the end first of all accept that
everything comes to an end and at the end is
near and don't be in denial about it it's also
very important in this phase that you acknowledge your achievements
your growth and your gains which people forget to do
if you have been doing this process correctly for five
or ten years working on this chapter of your life
by the time you get to the very end you've
grown so much you've had so many achievements and gains
eat if you've had failures that you need to acknowledge
that because if you think back like you were a
different person when you began this journey by this point
you've changed and it's very easy to overlook that because
anything you achieve you just try to take as the
new normal so acknowledge how far you've come even if
you don't have everything you want yet that's fine but
acknowledge how far you've come also don't get too attached
to the old realize that life is all about finding
the next chapter and remember how exciting it was to
be beginning your new chapter when you originally began it
so that is gonna come but it might take a
couple of years before you get to that level of
excitement again know when to walk away from a relationship
from a business from a project that you have exhausted
don't just keep milking it and milking in a million
so like you know with the with TV shows if
you have a good TV show the producers will know
when the TV show is kind of coming to its
peak and once it's past its peak then you got
to wrap that thing up don't just keep it going
and going and going like put it out of its
misery you know some TV shows like The Simpsons you
know they've the Simpsons have been on for like thirty
years now or twenty-five years and they keep pumping it
out but I mean the Simpsons are have died like
a decade ago the peak of The Simpsons was a
decade ago or even more so they got a really
just kill that thing see and I can only imagine
like the the people the poor people who work on
us Simpsons now still some of the original people like
some of the original voice actors and so forth of
course a lot of the old old producers and directors
left but some of the people who have still stuck
around you know they must be so miserable because they've
been doing the same goddamn thing for like 25 years
doing the same voices like they need something new like
you've got enough money that you don't need the Simpsons
money like quit just go away start something new start
a new project you need to work on a new
show you know that's what you need otherwise you're gonna
stagnate so that's what I mean by knowing how to
walk away look for ways to tie up loose ends
so if you have a business or a project oftentimes
you can't just leave it on the turn of a
dime you gotta like make sure that your employees are
satisfied your business partner has to be satisfied you got
to wrap up the loose ends so start doing that
that will free you up to then move on to
the next thing so start kind of planning your transition
for you now what's important is free time to think
and to reflect and to decompress so try to create
that space for yourself because you know you've been so
busy for the last few years riding the peak that
you don't have that space you gotta create it now
is when you create it start looking forward to the
new chapter start asking yourself what's next for you what's
the next level of life for you how do you
evolve yourself next what's the next level for your soul
to evolve to plan time off plan for serious introspection
expect less money less results and less action for the
next few years and be okay with that if you
have some silly idea that your your income has to
be growing every single year that's gonna be very counterproductive
in this case you see because that's just not how
it works I remember I had to do that when
I started actualised org to start actualize I don't work
I had to take a pretty big hit in my
income for a couple of years and it was counter
and to because I didn't want to because he I
got accustomed to earning six-figure salary from my previous business
and I just wanted that's continuing I wanted my salary
to increase every single year but I had to let
that go to create a possibility for something new also
during this phase be okay with not having a plan
you don't know yet what the next phase is gonna
be for you that's gonna take some months or even
a few years to figure that out and that's okay
and also start exploring new possibilities you need to find
new sources of inspiration new realms and new fields of
life all right so that explains the four phases and
what one whole chapter looks like now let me make
some general points about this whole model so first of
all it's very important just to understand the basic here
which is that phases are totally normal and healthy this
is how it should be don't expect constant action constant
motivation constant upward growth that's silly it's not how life
works that's not how human growth works so don't place
those false expectations on yourself realize that ups and downs
are normal and totally to be expected also it's important
to understand that those quiet periods where you're not in
a lot of action those low energy phases growth is
still happening during those inactive phases in fact they are
still active it's just that they're active on the inside
if you're doing them right so you've got two of
these phases which are really active on the outside and
then two of these phases which are more active on
the inside and being active on the inside in some
sense it's even more important because being active on the
inside sets you up for then a lot of action
on the outside it's pointless to take a lot of
action externally on the outside when you don't know yet
what you're supposed to be acting towards when you don't
have a vision C so don't don't dismiss that if
you're too materialistically minded it's very easy to dismiss that
getting caught up in always generating results there's a an
old parable about bamboo the way bamboo grows I don't
know if this is true or not but what they
say is is that bamboo when it grows it grows
really fast it grows like a foot every couple of
days but it doesn't grow that way all the time
really the way bamboo grows is that it takes five
or ten years for the bamboo roots of the plant
to establish themselves and during that time nothing is growing
up top the root system is growing and preparing itself
for a massive spurt and births burst of growth at
some point but it's not there yet and then when
when the root system is developed then it starts to
sprout really quickly like feet per day quickly and it's
amazing so that's exactly kind of how it works with
with us as well so don't discount those periods where
you're laying the foundation where you're doing the research where
you're introspecting where you're dreaming where you're coming up with
visions externally nothing's gonna be happening your family your friends
they might look at you your colleagues they might look
at you and they might see that you're a loser
that you're not getting anything accomplished that you're not earning
a lots of money you're not bringing home two paychecks
you're not maybe even working during this time they might
think that you're jobless and homeless and all this but
they don't see what you see which is that you're
building this root system that's going to support massive growth
in the future so keep that in mind also don't
resist the phases lean into them acknowledge which phase you're
in and then kind of just go with it don't
try to rush through a phase enjoy each phase for
what it is be willing to let a chapter and
or close without holding on too long be willing to
walk away be willing to take the time out to
relax and to rethink your life be willing to be
cost confused and sad that's all normal allow yourself to
explore totally new opportunities that's very important for discovering the
next chapter trust that you will fly your next chapter
watch out for wasting time getting stuck in a rut
in those low consciousness addictive activities like I said because
those keep you from doing a high quality introspection make
big changes just for the sake of something new so
for example when you're reaching the end of a chapter
you might just make sort of a spontaneous decision to
just do something new like move to a new city
move to a new country get a new job it
is totally out of out of left field consider a
new career consider a new business consider changing your whole
diet consider changing all your relationships and friendships consider a
new hobby consider a new lifestyle and then just by
doing something new without even knowing where it's gonna lead
trust that it'll eat somewhere even if the thing you
do ends up not being perfect for you just to
die fact that you did it and you change something
was healthy to break you out of the old chapter
and begin the new chapter see it's better to do
stuff and fail at it and realize that it's not
right for you than to just sit back and be
paralyzed not doing anything at all because you don't know
what to do if you don't know what to do
do something and then just evaluate the results of the
thing you did that's how you really learn who you
are what your values are and what you want out
of life do stuff that you hate just to learn
that you hate it that helps you of course you
shouldn't deliberately do stuff that you hate but you know
if you're just paralyzed go go and do something new
it doesn't have to be perfect if you're waiting for
the perfect vision the perfect business idea that's not gonna
work out so well you're gonna discover that that's an
evolutionary process you see it's not something you just sit
on the couch and you discover one day it could
be but usually it requires exploration first before you have
that brilliant new idea for the future of your life
research therefore is very vital always be researching always have
new opportunities in the back pocket have more opportunities and
ideas that then you will be able to actualize in
multiple lifetimes keep a log a journal of a list
of all the opportunities that there exists for you see
be reading lots of books be talking to new people
this is how you do research and you find new
stuff in life that will excite you sometimes it's just
pure luck and pure coincidence and serendipity that you discover
something you know some friend or some colleague mentioned something
you hear it and then it's like oh yeah that
would be perfect for me but you can't hear it
unless you're talking to that colleague or you're talking to
some new person also it's important to remember that you
shouldn't expect old friends and family to follow you on
this journey to follow you into the next chapter expect
resistance from them which is why you have to isolate
yourself you have to learn to listen to your own
inner voice and inner heart and soul and then work
on it quietly don't don't make a big announcement to
them that all I'm starting this new business I'm pursuing
enlightenment or I'm gonna go start a family don't keep
that to yourself because they probably won't understand and you
need to lay more groundwork first because your friends and
family the only thing they're gonna really react to is
the external results they're gonna react to the the bamboo
that's above-ground they don't see what's really going on inside
of you that's generating all that external growth so make
sure you really work on on your root system and
the last general point that I'll make here is get
comfortable being all alone with some of these phases that's
totally normal and okay and in fact necessary so get
comfortable being alone that doesn't mean you to become a
hermit or a recluse or abandon all your friends you
can be social but just realize it'll be faced in
your life will be your be very social in other
phases will your gonna be a recluse and that's all
right now let me just draw a few obvious parallels
here between this four phase model and the hero's journey
I really recommend you go watch my episode about the
hero's journey and if you took my life purpose course
we talked about the hero's journey a lot there so
go check that out in even more detail if you
really want to understand the hero's journey the life purpose
course shows you how to live a hero's journey and
all the trickiness and challenges and obstacles that come there
but quick-quick skeletal over you so the hero starts out
just in ordinary life basically just doing mundane stuff stuck
in a rut then some new trigger comes which is
a call to adventure some new grand possibility opens up
but of course the hero is lazy stuck in a
rut and fearful so he rejects the call to adventure
doesn't commit to it finally after being sick of his
rut he accepts the call to adventure and so of
course the hero begins sort of in the limbo phase
then he accepts the call as soon as he accepts
the call that's when the starting phase phase two begins
then a wild adventure ensues the here was learning lots
of stuff meeting wizards and teachers and masters and meeting
threshold Guardians and you know struggling with the initial obstacles
that's face to the start he's conquering those then eventually
he becomes proficient and he starts to conquer the ultimate
obstacle wishes the the dragon defeating the dragon that like
stage three and by defeating the dragon and becoming very
proficient becoming a master that's now he's reaching the peak
of his journey and so once he defeats the dragon
what else is there to do now it's all sort
of downhill from here he's he's actualized his journey he's
risen to the occasion he's become the hero people celebrate
him he's famous he gets money and women and all
this and fame and adoration and approval in love but
he still has more life to go so now what
is he doing well now he starts to feel a
bit depressed the journey is over the journey has run
its course what's next he doesn't know so now he
starts to go downhill this is the the fourth phase
this is the the end and now he returns back
to his ordinary life and now he's probably lazy he's
drunk he's smoking weed he's watching TV he's stuck in
a rut again until the next thing comes along so
he's back in limbo mode now I want to give
you some examples from my own life of how this
worked it's not always going to work perfectly it's not
always going to just like completely aligned with these cycles
but actually you could be surprised at how closely it
can align with these cycles it's just that the timing
will be different for everybody so you got a you
got a look at this for Phase model rather loosely
you know kind of metaphorically not too literally so I've
had multiple chapters and multiple cycles and phases in my
life so I'll just begin in an arbitrary place which
is sort of like almost exactly ten years ago when
I started my first business I started an online business
because I felt like I was stuck in a rut
in my old job I didn't like working for people
I didn't I didn't like having a boss that's one
of the most important lessons I learned in my whole
life is that I never want to have a boss
ever again and that I only want to work for
myself and so when I realized that that for me
became the vision that became my hero's journey as to
to build financial independence that I could be completely unbeaten
to any anyone else's agenda and that I could completely
be free to build my own life and my own
business and career and have the impact that I want
to have and to have the creative freedom that I
want to have and so that became my vision I
got really excited about that possibility so I got to
work immediately building my business within six months I had
a business that was starting to earn money and I
worked hard to get it off the ground so this
was me going from the limbo phase into the start
phase number one we're actually the started phase number two
so I was in number two I've worked there for
a few years getting the business off the ground making
passive income and all this until the business was basically
running itself and I started to get good at business
and marketing and understanding how that works and then I
started to feel like okay I've kind of maxed that
out I was getting to the to the top of
business and then I didn't know what was next I
wasn't sure what the next phase in my life was
gonna be I was still very young there were still
areas in my life where I had just done zero
work like with relationships intimate relationships and sexuality so I
wanted to really work on that because before that my
whole focus was just on my career and on business
and money so I was starting to explore new possibilities
like I knew that already that the business that I
built wasn't the ultimate business that I wanted it was
just a stepping stone it was a way to become
financially independent and I achieved that but my real dream
business that had to be yet to be invented and
I didn't know exactly what that was gonna be so
I was exploring different stuff and during this time I
decided to get in to pick up and learn dating
learned to get better sexuality learn to understand masculinity and
femininity much better so that was like a whole new
field and as I got into that I also discovered
self-help and personal development as this exciting new field and
so I got into that I also got into weightlifting
did that for a few years was really excited by
the possibilities there and that was great and I was
learning again and so that was sort of the beginning
of the next chapter for me right around this time
as I was getting into that it was very fortuitous
because my old business basically started to collapse it started
just like within a few days I started earning much
less money than it ever used to and so I
realized that okay this is the end I have to
let it go and I have to move on to
something new but of course I was afraid I didn't
know what that was I had no idea really if
I could even pull off another business I had a
lot of doubt about whether I could be successful again
and during this time while I was doing pickup I
discovered life coaching as a possibility is very interesting I
was actually in a bar in Dallas talking to just
flirting with some girl I didn't even want to talk
to her but I just did it out of a
sense of obligation to you know to practice and to
train myself I was just talking to her and she
told me about life coaching and immediately as I heard
that I realized oh that's what I gotta do that
that's perfect for me because I right around this time
I was very interested in reading self-help books and so
I thought that this would be the perfect next step
so I I immediately enrolled in in life coaching training
put $10,000 down committed to that and decided that that
was gonna be my next you know direction and I
was very doubtful about it I I knew that you
know I could just lose my ten thousand dollars and
not really get anything out of it but I decided
to do it anyways because I didn't really have anything
better to do and also around this time I did
traveling I traveled and lived in Austin I lived in
Las Vegas for a month here and there and was
meeting new people and sort of really discovering this whole
new domain of life which was dating and and women
and that was a refreshing change from sort of the
cloistered life the business focused life that I used to
have then I moved to Las Vegas mmm really started
a new lifestyle here living on my own away from
my family and during this time I started actualised org
and I started experimenting with YouTube videos and I wasn't
really sure how I was gonna do life coaching or
where that was gonna take me but through doing these
videos and starting my youtube channel I discovered this opportunity
I've kind of found my niche on YouTube and I
saw that this was this was a time to strike
this was still back in like 2012-2013 where YouTube wasn't
as big back then and so I saw that there
was an amazing opportunity here with these videos and with
teaching this material but at the same time I felt
very insecure very inadequate I was battling many limiting beliefs
about whether I could do this whether I was qualified
to do this and so forth whether I could be
a good teacher and so that's where I sort of
discovered the possibilities with actualize that or that's when I
really had my full vision for actualize that org and
I started building it and I worked feverishly for four
four or five years working on that so this this
is me moving from the starting phase into phase number
three which was sort of the peak with actualized org
striking while the iron was hot and I worked for
about four straight years just pumping out content every single
week and the result of that was that I learnt
earned a lot of money gained a lot of subscribers
built a whole business mastered how to communicate I mean
I'm Hastur but became decent at it sort of figured
out YouTube figured out how to start my new business
figured out how to be a self-help teacher started figuring
out spirituality and enlightenment so that was all discovered during
this time and then like in the last year or
so I'm starting to feel like I've kind of I'm
starting to peak with this chapter of my life it's
starting to feel a bit stale starting to feel a
bit grindy I'm still excited about pumping out videos but
at the same time I've sort of evolved my consciousness
to the point where I don't really need to create
videos anymore and I'm sort of like looking towards a
new horizon what else is there I'm starting to see
possibilities with enlightenment with yoga with psychedelics with writing a
book with doing travel with maybe getting more involved with
intimate relationships than I was and so yeah so that's
kind of where I am right now I'm sort of
at the peak and starting to maybe move towards the
end phase and it's kind of scary especially when you've
had a lot of success because you don't want to
let it go you get comfortable and I've already had
several calls to adventure about stuff that I could do
you know just totally new chapters in my life that
I could open but of course I'm hesitant that ego
is always hesitant and cautious when it comes to just
accepting a call to adventure it's amazing how how conservative
the ego tends to be with that sort of thing
oftentimes you got to be forced into it a lot
of times in the movies a hero is literally forced
into it like his home is destroyed or his family
is all burned and killed like Luke Skywalker in the
first Star Wars movie you know literally his whole family
is charred and killed and he has nowhere to go
nothing to do but to accept that call and so
that's kind of where I am now and so I'm
trying to figure out you know what the next thing
is it can feel a little bit like you're getting
into a rut a little bit like you're feeling stuck
a little bit of playing victim coming up with excuses
for why not to accept calls and why you can't
you know again limiting beliefs come up and you have
to deal with letting go of past success and the
possibilities of earning lots of money like you know one
of the most tempting things that that trips me up
is that I can always extract like millions of dollars
more head of actualised org and it's always extremely tempting
but at the same time I know that that that's
not really what what the next chapter is for me
so it's tricky to figure that out and so I'm
in the process of figuring that out and seeing what
will come so there you go in conclusion start to
think of your life roughly speaking in terms of chapters
and phases start to imagine it this way that can
be helpful to guide you as you do this try
to focus each chapter on one thing maybe two but
not much more than that because you don't want to
split your focus up the power is to concentrate your
focus strategically into just a few hand a handful of
things maybe even ideally one thing to knock it out
of the park so whatever the next chapter will be
for you select a theme for that chapter for example
relationships or building a family or building a career or
becoming financially independent with your business or fitness and health
and nutrition or traveling the world or spirituality or getting
a great education or giving back to the community or
art and creativity you know something like that and make
that the focus of the next five years of your
life let's say see so that you're clear and you
know what you're working on every single day that's very
important otherwise you're gonna just be diffusing your attention everywhere
and nothing is going to get done and then you're
gonna feel like like a victim because you're not gonna
get that kind of success that you want from personal
development so don't try to do everything at once and
also the last tip I'll give you is it's helpful
to make formal clean breaks which you can do with
ritual and even ceremony try to demarcate the opening and
closings of a chapter so whatever that might mean maybe
like you go out into the forest and just camp
outside with a fire and just like dance around the
fire and that's like you demarcating the beginning or the
end of this chapter of your life or maybe do
it with friends or you know you can find various
ways in in more ancient more primitive cultures they used
to do these rituals and ceremonies and rites of passage
a lot where you know a boy becomes an adolescent
ready to become a man there's like a rite of
passage he goes through to demarcate the end of his
childhood in the beginning of adulthood that can be very
important there's a lot of wisdom in those rituals and
ceremonies which we've lost touch with here of course you
have to make sure that you're doing these rituals and
ceremonies not out of cultural habit because someone forces you
to do it you have to do it like consciously
yourself really you can totally create your own ceremonies and
rituals just don't necessarily expect your friends and family to
participate although maybe they could if you talked them into
it so that can be very helpful now of course
in practice it becomes difficult it's emotionally difficult to actually
create a clean break or a clean beginning or a
clean end because oftentimes you're clinging you're clinging to the
old chapter or you're scared to fully go into the
new beginning so you don't create a clear demarcation between
your beginning and your end well I mean you're just
trying to do the best you can you're not always
gonna succeed that's it we're done here please click that
like button for me and come check out actualize that
org that's my website you'll find my blog with exclusive
insights and videos that I post there check out the
actualized forum check out the life purpose course check out
my book list it'll all help you with figuring this
out and the last thing that I'll say is that
look these days I talk about a lot of advanced
topics metaphysical abstract topics spiritual topics and the bottom line
is that most of you most people who begin watching
actualised org are at a point of development or you
just need the basics you just need basic self help
most people what they need is like very practical sim
tony robbins style self-help spiral dynamic stage blue-and-orange self-help not
my metaphysical musings about the non-dual nature of god and
all this like if i think back five years and
i think about me watching my own videos five years
ago most the videos that i put out today i
couldn't stomach five years ago I wouldn't watch them I
would click the off button why is that because they're
too advanced they're too advanced and they're too outside of
you know my materialist paradigm which existed back then my
dualistic paradigm so so make sure that you're covering the
bases make sure that you're not just getting totally lost
and chasing these metaphysical advanced things that I talked about
without handling the basics like your financial independence your creativity
you know your relationships your sexuality business and finances and
fitness and health and your education get that stuff dialed
in the stuff that I'm teaching now I mean I'm
still gonna be teaching very practical topics like this one
for example is a very practical topic that will help
you if you're not even pursuing any spiritual stuff it'll
help you and I'll be releasing more content like that
in the future but really you need to find some
some books some courses some teachers who will also just
teach you the very basic stuff and then you listen
to me for them for the very advanced stuff you
see the metaphysics the epistemology the spirituality the non duality
that's the very advanced stuff for sure it will rapidly
transform your life if you can do it if you
can even stomach to listen to it let alone do
it but you also need to get just the simple
mmm the simple foundation of survival down in your life
teach yourself how to hunt teach yourself how to survive
in 21st century society teach yourself how to maintain a
job a decent career and this source of stuff and
then if you do that and then on top of
that you add all the advanced stuff that I talk
about these days damn that's gonna be that's gonna be
amazing see but but if you neglected the basics by
fooling yourself into thinking that well if I just become
a woke you know an awakened and enlightened that I
won't even need to worry about my career and my
health and my fitness and my family and my relationships
and dating in sexuality I won't need any of this
well realistically you're you're fooling yourself in a certain sense
that's true if you truly deeply awaken in a certain
sense you can bypass a lot of stuff but at
the same time you're still gonna have to survive you're
still gonna have to worry about keeping a household you're
still have to worry about your bank account mmm you're
still gonna have to work on your relationship you're not
gonna just be able to skip over all of that
if you do actually you'll develop pathologies in these various
areas so you might be enlightened but you're still like
a horny dog thirsting after after women because you haven't
handled that part of your life so uh so just
keep all that in mind I am very cognizant of
making sure that my my videos are practical even my
metaphysical videos I'm always trying to make them practical for
you because this work is is about actually embodying it
in your own life so really don't think of it
as like there's the practical self-help stuff and then there's
the metaphysical stuff which is not practical no no the
metaphysical stuff is the most practical the problem though is
is that you need to be able to appreciate that
you need to be at a certain level of consciousness
and development and open-mindedness to even be able to learn
the theory let alone to embody it it's extremely practical
and your biggest results and gains in life will come
from the metaphysical stuff which is why I talk about
it so much these days is because that's really where
the results are at the results you get with the
basic stuff is basic survival stuff you're never getting it
satisfied with that even though you still need it you
see that's why survival is so tricky you can't just
say well to hell with survival no you still need
it if you say to hell with survival you're still
gonna be unconsciously running through various kinds of survival strategies
all the time because that's basically all your mind is
doing all the time is looking out for your own
survival so you do need to develop some higher quality
survival strategies that's important but but really life is not
about survival life is about transcending survival and seeing what
lies beyond and so actualize that or ggest is supposed
to be a holistic teaching where we kind of talk
about both at the same time we talk about some
survival issues we talk about some transcendence of survival issues
and then we kind of intermix it and we we
see how actually the two interrelate with each other you
can't create a duality between survival issues and mundane everyday
life and business on the one hand and then spirituality
on the other that would be a terrible spiritual approach
to life really the whole point in pinnacle of spirituality
is that you you bring the spirituality and infuse it
into your everyday mundane life including your business your relationships
your family and everything else that you do so that's
what we'll be talking about going forward you
