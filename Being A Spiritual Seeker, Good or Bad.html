hey this is Leo for actualised how to work and
in this episode we're gonna take a look at the
question of being a spiritual seeker is this good or
is this bad I see a lot of confusion about
this topic of spiritual seeking a lot of people out
there are falling into one of two traps with spiritual
seeking that's what I want to take a look at
here and I also want to give you three rules
for how to do spiritual seeking properly so you don't
get lost so the problem here goes like this for
example I've talked to people who know about spirituality and
they know about enlightenment but they say something to me
like this well yes Leo I know about these things
but I don't want to like turn into one of
those spiritual seeker types you know they the stereotype the
spiritual seeker I don't want to be one of those
sheep that goes around searching for something so desperately and
that's their argument also what I see is that even
enlightened people people who are already very enlightened what they
tend to do is they tend to dismiss their own
journey and then they tend to dissuade people from becoming
spiritual seekers now actually you have two people two types
of in line people some which want you to become
a seeker and others that tell you no you shouldn't
become a seeker and they tell you stuff like well
you shouldn't become a seeker because enlightenment basically you start
seeking something and then you go full circle and you
realize that what you were seeking was there the whole
time so in a sense you've gone full circle and
you haven't really accomplished anything so just call off the
search right from the start save yourself the trouble there's
that line of thinking then there's other types of people
that say something like well enlightenment is easy leo like
I watched some of your other videos that talked about
how difficult enlightenment is and how it takes a thousand
hours to get enlightened it's like no none of that
enlightenment is very easy all you got to do is
you've got to be present got to be in the
that's all it really is don't make it too complicated
so there's that line of reasoning then some people tell
you that you're already enlightened they say that everyone's already
lightened as they are all you got to do is
just realize it so then there's that line of thinking
then there's even some some teachers that say that there's
no such thing as enlightenment enlightenment is just an illusion
even talking about it's already creating this fantasy in one's
mind that then one tries to pursue which is the
exact opposite of what enlightenment should be about so you
have all these different lines of reasoning and maybe you've
run across this in comments under my videos people leave
me comments like this all the time or maybe you
even read it in books from people that you kind
of respect like serious authors or supposedly in line people
so what do we do with these lines of reasoning
well look it's very simple for me in my mind
it's a very pragmatic matter like I don't like to
beat around the bush I like to just be very
pragmatic about this thing the fact is that you're not
enlightened until you're enlightened and in a sense yes enlightenment
is easy but in a sense also enlightenment is very
very challenging in fact I just got back from a
workshop where I did over 70 hours straight of intense
intense intense enlightenment contemplation this was so grueling it's like
it was unbelievable one of the hardest things I've done
in my life is like a a military boot camp
style of a workshop this was not one of your
little cozy relaxation retreats towards the end of the workshop
I would literally became physically ill they felt like I
had food poisoning not because I had food poisoning and
not because I was just tired but simply because I
was working so hard on it's just like burning through
my mind trying to exhaust my rational mind to break
through to enlightenment and I didn't break through but it
was a very eye-opening experience and just goes to show
that this can be a very hardcore path for those
I want to make it hard or so what do
we make of this okay so here's what I think
about this if you don't seek practically speaking if you
do not become a seeker you will not become enlightened
also if we take a look at people throughout history
and modern masters who are very enlightened what you will
see is that they were strong seekers themselves they did
not pussyfoot around and they didn't mind being labeled a
seeker and they didn't mind going in circles in fact
most of their paths were very circular and very windy
it wasn't a straight road that's how it tends to
be and the reason that is is because enlightenment is
basically the hero's journey and the hero's journey is often
circular in fact some of the most beautiful hero's journeys
are circular but just because a journey is circular note
that that doesn't make it invalid this is where some
of these people I think have faulty reasoning about this
is that they think that well just because I went
in a circle you know how I could have just
eliminated that circle but that's not true that's just not
true in fact if we take a look at some
examples of hero's journeys we see that the power of
the journey is in the fact that is circular there's
something beautiful about that there's something very true about that
that's how life works it tends to work in circles
you can notice if you study math or science or
physics that a lot of phenomenon in nature is circular
there's a lot of periodic and cyclical sine wave type
functions that happen all throughout nature from the way that
a spring moves to the way that a planet orbits
a star to the way that a star orbits a
black hole and so forth have you ever read the
book called The Alchemist it's a really popular book recommend
that you read it it's on my book list and
The Alchemist adjusted like this beautiful story of a young
shepherds boy in in Spain that has to go through
this journey through northern Africa and he has all these
trials and tribulations and then finally he ends up going
to Egypt to see the pyramids because he's looking for
his treasure and he's not even sure what the treasure
is but he just has this calling to go to
Egypt to find his treasure at the pyramids and so
he goes through this long journey and then in the
end and it has this beautiful beautiful resolution at the
very end that I don't want to spoil but basically
what he discovers is this boy discovers that oh my
treasure was at home waiting for me the whole time
and now you read that you might think well so
was the whole journey pointless and of course no the
journey wasn't pointless the journey was the thing that was
necessary for him to realize like oh now I can
come back home and I can finally understand that it
was there the whole time and there's something very poetic
about that it's beautiful that's how some of the best
hero's journeys tend to work personally in my own life
as an example of this you know I got very
interested in philosophy and seeking truth when I was even
still in high school and so for about four years
at the end of high school all the way through
college I got really interested in philosophy as for reading
books on epistemology that's the theory of knowledge and I
started studying that because I thought that well I have
a treasure to find there I need to find like
what is the ultimate theory of life what is the
truth in life and I felt like philosophy and epistemology
could could show me the way and so what I
did and I I went through a whole philosophy training
program at University read lots of books was really serious
about it spent a lot of time thinking about on
my own taking notes and this kind of stuff and
then finally what I realized is like Oh philosophy is
just models and theories and beliefs and that none of
these can get me what I was ultimately searching for
in a sense I kind of discovered that philosophy was
mental masturbation and the ego doing its thing to trying
to understand things that really can't understand and that was
when I said to myself okay well I'm kind of
done with philosophy now in fact I wanted to become
a philosophy professor but when I realize this I'm like
well I can't really be a philosophy professor anymore because
I realized the emptiness of philosophy now you might listen
to now you might think well so Leo you wasted
four years of your life going through this thing just
to realize that philosophy was was all for nothing and
of course the answer is no I went in a
circle and I came back but I kind of came
back to where I originally started but now with a
deeper realization a new perspective and that's exactly how the
hero's journey works the hero he leaves home he leaves
home he goes into the unknown into uncharted territory he
goes through trials and tribulations and he experiences difficulties and
it all seems so important and so serious for him
at the time and he goes through all that and
in the end what does he get he's after treasure
metaphorically speaking but really he doesn't get treasure the treasure
is just a metaphor for what he really gets which
he gets insight he gets perspective and in the end
the hero he has to come back home he doesn't
stay on the journey forever and the journey doesn't take
him to some magical new land where he now lives
know he comes back home but when he comes back
home he comes back home with a new perspective on
life and then what he does he shares that perspective
with all the people that were there the whole time
and in a sense he goes full circle but now
when he's back home even though it looks like his
circumstances haven't really changed much they've changed in a sense
completely because now his perspective on life and his perspective
on those circumstances has changed but to get that shift
in perspective he had to go through the journey you
can't just assume that you can't go through the cycle
and that's where I think that a lot of even
enlightened masters will make a mistake when they tell seekers
to stop seeking because in practice what I find is
if you tell a secret to stop seeking what they
do is it just say okay I should just stop
seeking and just fall back into my normal everyday life
and when they do that basically they get nowhere and
they don't get enlightened and they don't get that new
perspective that they need sometimes in life you have to
go through a lot of [ __ ] and a
lot of stuff that seems like dead ends like tangents
but in fact they're not those are all necessary those
are all part of your journey and one of the
things that I discovered lately in talking to more and
more enlightened people and just comparing different perspectives and comparing
different paths that different people have taken to become enlightened
it just becomes apparent that enlightenment is a very personal
journey we all have our own inner demons and bullshit's
that we have to deal with and for some people
that just means that they start somewhere they go for
five or ten years off on a tangent some dead
end it looks like and then they hit a dead
end and then finally they say ah I was wrong
all these ten years and that's enough to finally put
them back on track and then they finally get somewhere
where they really need to get to right and now
it's very easy to say well so those 10 years
were all wasted and lost but not really if you
needed those 10 years of going down a dead-end to
finally have your emotions click or your mind realize something
like oh [ __ ] I was wrong this whole
time there's like all I've been deluded or I've been
misguided or whatever then that's just your path that's what
you need don't dismiss that realize also that life itself
is a circle your life where do you start in
life you start in life basically dead you start nowhere
you started as nothing have you realized this you start
in life as nothing before you're born you're literally nothing
then you're born and you're alive and then you realize
that you're conscious and then you grow up and then
you mature and then you go through all the trials
and tribulations of life and then you become old and
then you deal with with that and then you have
diseases and you overcome those or you don't and eventually
no matter how good or healthy you are you die
and you returned back to nothing so you start at
nothing and you return back to nothing and that's how
life is the circle of life so this is something
that you just have to accept if you're gonna live
life and you're gonna live it well right is that
we have these circles and in a sense they're meaningless
and pointless circles but also that's just kind of like
a life it's like a play it's just like a
ballet it's life for the sake of life not for
the sake of anything else and if you really start
to contemplate this you realize well how else could it
be why would we want it to be any other
way this is in fact a good thing imagine if
you will Luke Skywalker imagine if you took Luke Skywalker's
journey he is the prototypical hero's journey and he goes
and he does what he develops new skills and he
meets new people and he meets new friends and he
makes new enemies and he has mentors and training and
he has battles and fights and this happens on and
on and on in the Star Wars universe and he
goes through three episodes of this and then finally he
has the confrontation with Vader and the Emperor so what
if someone just comes in and says well why have
Luke go through all those steps and all those battles
and all those trials and tribulations why not just have
him go straight from Tatooine and fly in an x-wing
straight to Vader and just confront Vader right off the
bat that would be the direct path everything else is
extraneous and unnecessary but of course that's to not understand
the hero's journey Luke couldn't have done that he needed
insights and realization and skills and techniques he needed to
meet four friends and he needed to make new enemies
he needed to go through all that in order to
finally build himself up to face Vader he couldn't face
Vader straight off the bat he would have lost the
battle he needs to himself he probably wouldn't have even
had the courage and the knowledge of facing Vader simply
by not even realizing that Vader was his father and
that he needed to be faced so these kind of
realizations that oh I got to face this problem in
my life it's like oh I've been afraid of this
my whole my whole life and now I finally realized
that it was fear that was holding me back and
now I need to confront my fear or maybe it's
like you've had this obstacle that you've been hitting your
head against the wall on for for a decade and
finally you realize like oh [ __ ] you know
I'm fed up with this and I'm gonna actually make
a significant structural change to my life to overcome this
obstacle forever kind of that that getting fed up with
hitting your head against the wall kind of feeling so
all of those kinds of things these are things I
need to develop it's like your mind needs to work
through that [ __ ] and on the path of
enlightenment your mind's got to work through a lot of
personal [ __ ] that you have in your life
and what I realized lately is that our paths are
very unique and different and just because one enlightened person
did it this way or some other light person did
it that way and then they tell you hey do
it my way or do it this way and you
don't need all the other stuff that's not necessarily going
to work for you might have worked for them but
it might not work for you because you're a different
individual you have different problems you have different neuroses that
you have to deal with you have different types of
fears you have different life trauma that you went through
as a kid and you're carrying around all this baggage
and one way or another you have to shed this
baggage how are you gonna do it well through spiritual
seeking you're gonna conquer your own inner demons let me
give you three rules though for how to become a
spiritual seeker and not get lost because it's true that
a lot of spiritual seekers do get lost and there
is something about this idea that hey you know you
don't really want to make an identity out of becoming
a spiritual seeker so here are three rules to make
this work for you number one realize that on this
journey it will be a cycle that ends back where
you started so if you think you're gonna go somewhere
and do something and then live in some magical land
that's not how it's gonna go how it's gonna go
is that you have your life and you're gonna go
and you're gonna meet new people and teachers and read
books and this and that and maybe even travel to
another country and live in an ashram or whatever and
then you're gonna come back home and you're gonna realize
like okay I'm enlightened now and I have to come
back home kind of thing so just set up that
expectation right from the very beginning so you're not under
this illusion that oh there's some treasure out there somewhere
else that I have to find no the treasure is
already inside you you just need to get in touch
with it enlightenment is an inner realization it's a shift
in perspective and this is not to be confused with
changing the circumstances of your life just because you go
live in an ashram somewhere or you start meditating in
a cave or you move to another country and you
think that that is gonna like be the thing no
that's just a change in circumstances the thing is when
it really clicks in your mind so just realize that
you are gonna go in a full circle the second
rule that I have for you is seek techniques don't
seek beliefs so many people get lost here what they
think the spiritual path is it's like oh I'm gonna
go and talk to this guru over there I'm gonna
go meditate with this guy over here and I'm gonna
read that book over there and I'm gonna suck up
all this information I'm gonna start believing and I'm gonna
build up a whole model in my mind about it
and basically what's gonna happen is that you're gonna become
dogmatic don't fall into that trap very dangerous enlightenment is
about finding the truth for yourself independent completely independent of
what other people say or whether schools say or what
Buddhism says or what Christianity says or what Judaism says
or any other school says you're not gonna find it
in any book and you're not gonna find it from
the words of any teacher you have to find it
yourself it's an inner journey that's where the journey comes
in but most people what they think the journey is
I think it's that it's a journey of reading and
processing information and figuring this out with their logical mind
and while there's some use in that that's not ultimately
going to get you there and in fact you can
really get you trapped and it can really damage your
life this is where people start to get caught up
in cults and you know weird religious practices and New
Age hippie thinking and just all sorts of crazy and
stupid stuff really good spiritual teachers and this is something
I learned from Russell Scott who's enlightened master and he's
been teaching people about this stuff for 30 or 40
years so he's got a lot of experience with this
but he says really good spiritual teachers they teach techniques
and not beliefs and not dogma so that's a really
good mark or a litmus test for finding quality spiritual
teachers does your spiritual teacher actually give you the techniques
you need to figure it out for yourself and in
fact try to withhold the answers really good spiritual teachers
they withhold the answers you ask them questions and what
they do is they actually deflect your questions whether they
remain silent or they look at you and they give
you a kind of a stare or a weird look
or a cheeky smile something like that to get you
to realize like hey I can't give you the answer
you have to find it for yourself but that's what
the human mind wants is that our mind wants easy
ready-made answers but that's a huge trap in this work
so don't fall into that one and the third rule
is and this is something that I think is very
important that even a lot of enlightened masters don't do
is you have to compare and contrast perspectives different perspectives
within spirituality so your trial is a broad spectrum there's
a broad spectrum of traditions you've got Christianity you've got
Judaism you've got Buddhism you've got yoga you've got Sufi
ISM you've got Islam you've got all this stuff and
these are major religions but each of these major religions
also has a a hardcore mystical core so the major
religious stuff that's mostly [ __ ] then you've got
the the hardcore mystical esoteric nugget within each one of
those traditions which actually has some good techniques and truths
in there but even that is very dogmatic stuff and
even that is just only a partial facet of the
thing that you're actually looking for so what I find
very important that almost nobody does is you have to
go and investigate each one of these really take a
look at all the different schools all the different techniques
out there without getting hooked on any single one of
them this is very difficult to do for most people
because their mind is looking for ready-made answers like I
said before and they just find one thing and they
just kind of like fall in love with it and
then they just think like oh this is my this
is my path and this is the only path and
they just commit themselves to this path and they might
even become enlightened by committing themselves to one path but
the problem is is that in their enlightenment is going
to be lacking it's gonna be partial because they don't
see that this is just one path out of many
paths and that in fact no one path really gets
you everything you need to investigate multiple paths and kind
of piece it all together like a giant jigsaw puzzle
that's personally what I'm doing in my life and this
is very difficult to do because when you start doing
this there's gonna be a lot of pressure socially from
the outside for you not to do this for example
you go to sin and if you learn Zen and
then you say hey you know you've got you know
guys you know Zen is great but let's go compare
how Zen works with how yoga works or how Christianity
works or some other spiritual practice works the Zen people
will look at you like you're like you're betraying them
right they're not going to want to do that they
don't want to do this comparing and contrasting likewise it
doesn't matter where you start almost I mean I wouldn't
say all but many many spiritual traditions will not want
to do this comparing and contrasting because that that disturbs
their their dogma they don't want to do that they
have preconceived beliefs about how their path is the right
path how it's the only path how it's the best
possible path and they don't want to hear anything else
because they've already been hooked by this stuff so you
need to be careful about not getting hooked by it
I found that even teachers who are very enlightened who
are dogma free so to speak it's very difficult to
just sit down with them and to get them to
start comparing and contrasting one tradition with another tradition and
I think that that's the real true mark of a
of a really high-quality spiritual teacher is that they have
studied multiple perspectives and in a sense on the graves
model I have a an episode that talks about the
graves model they're yellow which means that they're not buying
into any one absolute truth but they're kind of piecing
together partial truths and partial perspectives and that's what you
need to be here when you're on this path is
you need to be yellow instead of being blue blue
is the really dogmatic you don't want that I found
that it's really difficult even with very open-minded teachers to
get them to start comparing and contrasting they just have
like an inclination to not want to do that stuff
in a sense is because it can slow you down
because just by comparing contrasting different perspectives that you're not
gonna become enlightened that way but what I've what I
think is at least what I'm going on in my
own life is that if I do compare and contrast
all these other perspectives I'm gonna have a much richer
enlightenment even though it's gonna take me longer it's their
level I involve a lot more work and a lot
more mental strain to put all these pieces together it's
a very complex jigsaw puzzle that you're putting together because
you have to sort through a lot of [ __
] but when you do put it all together I
think what you're gonna have is gonna have a much
richer and in the end and you're gonna get what
you really wanted you're gonna get a more complete understanding
a fuller picture and it's going to be well worth
it and you're gonna avoid all the dogma that people
usually get trapped in all right those are my three
rules so don't shy away from being a spiritual seeker
just make sure that you avoid many of the traps
