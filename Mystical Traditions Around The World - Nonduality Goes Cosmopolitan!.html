hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about mystical traditions around
the world and the many diverse names for enlightenment so
as we embark on our mission to become more sage
like I thought that a very appropriate topic would be
to put our work to become sages into a broader
context into a historical context what is it that sages
have been up to for the last five thousand years
and that's exactly it is that sages and mystics have
been doing this work for at least five thousand years
and probably even much earlier than that we just don't
have very good historical records there's not much new Under
the Sun here so we're going to take a nice
deep look into what's really going on and this can
be very eye-opening to understand that the spiritual purification work
that you're doing the self actualization work any sort of
self-help techniques any meditative techniques any kind of New Age
stuff that you're into or that you're reading about you
got to realize that this goes back at least five
thousand years and that every single culture on every single
continent except Antarctica maybe ah has understood these truths and
has been engaging in this process of essentially what essentially
self discovery and truth realization that's the essence of it
so let's take a look at religion and specifically the
mystical kernels the mystical cores of every religion religion these
days gets a bad rap and understandably so and I'm
not a big fan of religion except we don't want
to throw the baby out with the bathwater and here's
the problem that a lot of rational people make when
they talk about religion it's that they forget the mystical
core at the center of every religion and it's actually
very shocking when you start to study mysticism historically it's
very shocking and very eye-opening to see the amount of
consensus and agreement between every single mystical tradition on every
continent in every country in every city around the world
throughout thousands of years of different cultures different political climates
different geological activity like there's so much diversity around the
world and yet if we take a look and we
do a real deep study of mysticism we see that
actually there's a lot of common elements here are the
commonalities every mystical tradition and every religion is ultimately grounded
upon the notion of searching for existential truth truth of
the capital t even the idea that there is such
a thing and that such a thing is accessible to
the human creature that's what all mysticism is based upon
and this existential truth is simply the question of what
is existence itself how come existence exists this is the
most basic and fundamental question that you could possibly ask
and you better believe that even though our ancestors thousands
of years ago we're living in caves they didn't even
have cities yet they didn't even have agriculture but nevertheless
they were asking this question what is existence and what's
really amazing is that they discovered the answer to this
and the answer to this is also common to all
mystical traditions and the answer is basically that existence is
a unity it's a formlessness it's a pure potential energy
it's a void which is what non duality means and
it's an absolute infinite singularity now those are just words
just ideas just beliefs ah the important thing to understand
here is that these are not actually beliefs but this
is actually an experience that one can have and that's
what all mysticism is predicated upon is having this experience
for oneself which is what differentiates mysticism from religion religion
is about beliefs and rituals whereas mysticism is about having
this experience for yourself recognizing that this experience is fundamentally
ineffable and transcendent and impossible to communicate impossible to believe
impossible to rationally understand or to write down in a
book and this is what leads to esoteric knowledge which
is another common element among all the mystical traditions esotericism
which basically means a sort of hidden knowledge knowledge that
is not revealed to just every Joe Schmo on the
street because this knowledge this is knowledge of the divine
this is knowledge of existence itself now why is this
knowledge kept hidden not because we have some kind of
conspiracy theory going on and we want to be elitists
and we want to hold this knowledge back no it's
not that actually true mystics love to spread mysticism the
problem though is what happens when the ego gets ahold
of esoteric knowledge when the ego gets ahold of esoteric
knowledge it really turns into a lot of bad stuff
which is why religion has such a bad rap and
also the reason the knowledge has to be esoteric is
because well we're persecuted for this knowledge even nowadays it's
very easy to get criticized for espousing this knowledge but
if you did it a hundred years ago five hundred
years ago let alone two thousand years ago you were
liable to get crucified burned at the stake stoned to
death beheaded tortured raped your family killed and exterminated right
or exiled or excommunicated from your community that's the reality
and that basically still goes on today around the world
so that's why this knowledge had to be esoteric another
reason the knowledge had to be esoteric is because by
its very nature it's paradoxical and ineffable and so you
can't grasp it the way you can normal knowledge you
can't just write it down in a textbook the way
you can with a mathematical formula or some scientific theorem
and so we see esoteric knowledge hidden knowledge the mysteries
these mystery schools and sects all around the world from
all you different traditions another common element of all mysticism
is altered states of consciousness the recognition that there's more
than just two states the way we normally think it's
not just dreaming and waking consciousness there's something else there's
many other states of consciousness and all mystical traditions in
one way or another understand this and they actually pursue
these altered states of consciousness and they don't hold waking
everyday consciousness as the most true and absolute of the
states and the way that they pursue this here's another
common element of among all traditions is through meditation contemplation
and prayer now prayer is interesting most people think of
prayer as praying for God to give me something that
I need that's not true prayer true prayer is more
like contemplation or meditation and you'll see that if you
start to study serious mysticism so there's a variety of
techniques hundreds if not thousands of different meditation contemplation and
prayer techniques have been developed in all cultures around the
entire world throughout the last five thousand years and you
can go study them and you can use them to
attain these altered states of consciousness and ultimately to reach
the highest understanding of absolute truth other common elements of
mystical traditions really quickly is the purification of materialistic cravings
that's a common element why because materialism is the biggest
thing that stands in the way of this ineffable knowledge
also there's a strong emphasis on ego transcendence why because
the ego is the biggest thing that stands in the
way between you and this knowledge there's also strong emphasis
on mind transcendence again because the mind is the biggest
obstacle there is a strong emphasis on cultural transcendence because
culture is a very big obstacle there's a strong emphasis
on wisdom and intuition / logic and rationality why is
that because the deepest truth is not accessible to logic
and rationality but only to spontaneous divine insight or intuition
there's also a strong emphasis on unconditional love you see
this embodied by all the greatest mystics unconditional love this
is actually the characteristic that makes them so magnetic and
charming and charismatic that they're able to draw crowds of
thousands of people around them who are very loyal supporters
how are they able to do that not by brainwashing
their followers but by radiating unconditional love which is an
honest signal you want an honest signal of enlightenment it's
unconditional love there is no more honest signal of mastery
of the truth than unconditional love when you can love
everything in everyone indiscriminately that is the true hallmark sign
of a master and that's a very rare thing and
this thing cannot be faked easily actually it can't be
faked at all it's very easy to see an individual
who is not capable of unconditional love individuals who are
capable of unconditional love are so rare that if you
ever meet one you've probably never met one but if
you ever meet one you will understand how religions get
started because this is such a powerful and palpable thing
that when you encounter it for the first time in
your life you will be floored floored at the mastery
that this individual has to exhibit unconditional love on the
one hand it's a very simple thing on the other
hand you're so far from it right now that it
almost seems inhuman another common element is happiness bliss and
goodness these are commonly emphasized in mystical traditions and here
happiness of course is not a materialistic form of happiness
or hedonism but a deeper much much much much deeper
unconditional form of happiness and all of this is grounded
you have to understand is grounded in direct experience it's
a big mistake to think that this comes from just
blind faith or from belief or from brainwashing yourself with
affirmations and with prayer no no no no no you
cannot get these things through any of that you can
only get a veneer a fake veneer of it through
affirmations and through prayer and through faith but not the
real deal and the real deal is so much greater
than the thin veneer so what I want to introduce
you to is the many different traditions that we have
around the world that are related to mysticism and that
ultimately turned into religions all right so these traditions I
have to just gloss over them because I can't go
into depth on all of them but the point here
is that I want you to get a big picture
understanding ah a survey of the land so to speak
so that you can see how all of this interconnects
that's what I'm trying to show you here the similarity
between all these traditions so we have Christianity within Christianity
we have many many many different sects and groups and
the mystical core of Christianity is agnosticism Eastern Orthodox various
monastic orders like the Franciscan monks the Benedictine monks and
there are many many many orders of different monks and
these people these were the original old-school Christians and they
understood what Christianity was really about it's not what it's
about these days it's a totally different thing right it's
about enlightenment also in India we have everything related to
Hinduism we have Hinduism we have a really a diversity
this kind of evolution and evolutionary diaspora of spirituality happening
in the Indian subcontinent we have Hinduism we have many
different forms of yoga and by yoga of course I
don't mean the physical yoga that you see here in
Western gyms you know mostly women working out not that
I'm talking about old-school serious contemplative yoga there's many forms
of yoga there's also the advised Vedanta tradition which is
all about enlightenment very direct method for enlightenment there's a
shy of a Tantra tradition which is pretty old it's
about a thousand five hundred years old goes back to
ancient India and there's a Sikhism which is a smaller
sect also found in India and there's a religion called
Jainism which is actually a very beautiful spiritual tradition if
you study up on it most people don't know what
Jainism is but the founder of it was Mahavira actually
predated the Buddha and a really amazing remarkable mystic so
that's going on in India primarily of course we've also
got Buddhism which you should probably be already familiar with
and in Buddhism we have many different strands and sects
we have Zen we have Tibetan Zog ten there's Theravada
there's Mahayana there's Vajrayana and those are just the big
categories then within each of those you have a lot
of different subgroups and sub sects and so forth so
of course Buddhism is from northern India but mostly then
China and southern Asia and Japan we also have Taoism
which has some remarkable sages and mystics in it I
mean that's sort of similar to Buddhism although different then
interestingly what a lot of people don't know about is
Islam so Islam is most definitely founded upon true mystical
insights and the mystical core of Islam is Sufism Sufism
then we have the Jewish traditions and the Jewish traditions
Mystikal kernel is Kabbalah then we have the Greeks I'm
talking about the ancient Greeks and you better believe that
the ancient Greeks knew a thing or two about non-duality
not all of them but many of the ancient Greek
philosophers knew a little bit about non duality if not
a lot Heraclitus for example was truly enlightened plottin as'
obviously enlightened then we have the illusion mysteries which were
happening in Greece and in Rome for over 2,000 years
imagine this 2,000 years the illusion mysteries were revealing mystical
secrets to initiates that were joining this secret cult and
there were all sorts of other cults throughout Europe and
throughout that area of the world in that time of
course we've got the ancient Egyptians and they really took
spirituality to a whole new level in fact I mean
we don't know that much about the Egyptians but just
based on speculation you better believe that the Egyptians knew
a thing or two about non-duality in one way or
another there's also even dating further back than that we've
got various forms of paganism and shamanism which is still
found around the world especially in the Americas in the
South Americas in the North America's we have all sorts
of paganism shamanism we have various Native American traditions which
you know are very spiritual spiritually oriented and so the
shamans and pagans and the Native Americans they all had
their own little twists on things and they definitely had
some sort of mystical insights upon which they developed their
rituals and practices and their beliefs and then more modern
times in more modern times we have the New Age
and the New Age movement you can think of it
starting like with the transcendentalists a couple hundred years ago
then there was theosophy teachings of people like Aleister Crowley
which get into more occult subjects and then you have
people like kerchief Spence key and so forth so there's
a lot of reinventing of the wheel happening in the
last 200 years in Europe and in America because well
this is a perennial thing right it never dies out
this is an evergreen subject matter what is the nature
of existence and everybody puts their own little twist on
things sometimes it seems like all these traditions and all
these different people and all these different teachings are all
so different and they're all so conflicting and so contradictory
but if you take a look and you study this
and you really zoom out and you ask yourself what's
going on on the highest elevation perspective you clearly see
that there's actually a lot of convergence and the convergence
is actually very shocking you would think that people in
India have nothing to do with people in South America
have nothing to do with people in North America have
nothing to do with people in Africa have nothing to
do with people in China have nothing to do with
people in Europe and that their cultures are so different
that they would come up with all sorts of crazy
different theories and stories about what existence is and yet
that's not the case it can seem that way on
the surface but deep down actually they all say exactly
the same thing which is that huh it's all one
thing it's all a unity it's all infinity it's all
void it's all emptiness and that's what I want to
get into a little bit here because see I'm not
a scholar of all these different traditions and we don't
have time frankly right here right now to get into
each of these traditions and to show you all the
different stuff that's there what I want to point you
to is doing the research and doing the study I
want to get you kind of interested and aware that
this field of study exists and you can go and
you can do lots of research on your own you
can buy books you can read and in fact I'll
give you some resources at the end of this episode
for doing just that so I'm not going to cover
in depth all these different traditions but what I do
want to do is I want to talk about the
different names for enlightenment and God that the traditions have
I think that this is valuable because once you see
that they are all basically talking about the exact same
thing using just different labels and different symbols then that's
an important step in your evolution to Sage hood very
important step now one caveat when I talk about God
all right now this word God I really in a
sense don't like this word I have a love-hate relationship
with the word god when I talk about the word
God don't make the mistake of thinking I'm talking about
some bearded man in the clouds who sits in judgment
of you and is somehow separate from and distinct from
reality no that's a childish notion of God I'm talking
about the original mystical notion of God God is simply
another word for reality or existence so that includes you
and that includes me and that includes the whole world
but not just that God specifically refers to an understanding
or a direct experience of what the nature of existence
or reality is fundamentally why does existence exist and believe
it or not it is possible to answer this question
and this is not an intellectual matter this is not
a belief that you have that you read in a
book this is something that you discover through the right
contemplative and meditative practices right so keep that in mind
so what I'm going to give you here now is
a list of over 50 names that I have assembled
I've been assembling this list for months now cross all
the different traditions that I've studied so obviously we have
enlightenment we have God we have truth that's true to
the capital T we have the absolute we have infinity
consciousness awareness presence no self the true self oneness nothingness
non duality ego death self transcendence self realization now remember
that all of these words are just labels that are
essentially pointing to the exact same thing but you're not
quite sure what it's pointing to yet the whole idea
behind this is that these words are pointers pointing to
something ineffable something that other human beings have discovered that
you have not yet discovered for yourself and these human
beings are telling you hey there's something very powerful ineffable
that can be discovered that I'm pointing to with these
words and if you want you can go and discover
for yourself okay so keep that in mind as I'm
going down this list so I said self-realization we also
have awakening liberation revelation illumination ecstasy rebirth cessation Holy Spirit
gnosis which is defined as knowledge of the mystical that's
where we get Gnostics the Christian Gnostic sfrom you know
the word knowledge itself where does that come from well
it starts with acknowledge know to know see the gnosis
to know that's the same root word and you know
the word ignorant ignorant what does that mean that literally
means a lack of mystical knowledge ignorant is a lack
of true understanding of reality we also have the word
Godhead which specifically points to the impersonal essence of God
the what of God what God is that's the Godhead
also have words from the Christian mystical tradition like theosis
which is defined as a transformative process whose goal is
union with God we also have kenosis which is defined
as an emptying of oneself and freeing yourself of your
own will so that you have room for God's will
there's agape which is a Greek term that means divine
love as distinguished from erotic love or the love that
our Father has for his child let's say or brotherly
love this is divine love agape from the Hindu tradition
we've got atman and brahman these are classical terms I
love these terms Atman basically means the I am or
the individualized self true self and Brahman means the universal
self or the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world
it's the ground of everything we also have terms like
the void emptiness Nirvana which literally means a blowing out
or a quenching yoga which literally means a union with
God or with reality moksha which is defined as a
deliverance from the wheels of birth and death a sort
of liberation from the illusion of life Buddha mind kensho
which is a Zen term which means seeing into one's
true nature Satori also a Zen term which means a
lasting realization of the true nature of existence stream entry
that's a popular Buddhist term for one who has had
a first glimpse of the nature of himself our hot
which title given to a fully awakened master fruition which
basically means the fruition of all your meditative and contemplative
practices which is enlightenment then we have words like progeny
ah which means the highest and purest form of wisdom
intelligence and understanding we have a word called gianna which
means insight or pure awareness free of any conceptual encumbrances
we have sunyata which means emptiness or voidness we have
a Hindu term Turia which means the pure background consciousness
that is the stage for all of existence we have
a Tibetan term rigpa which means knowledge of the ground
the ground of all being what is being grounded in
that's rigpa we also have Bodhi which is the root
word that we get Buddha from the Buddha means an
awakened one and Bodhi means awakening to the true nature
of things bood means to wake up to awaken from
the Taoist tradition we have wuji or womb which means
basically nothingness the ultimate boundless infinity that is reality from
the Zen tradition we also have the word mu mu
is a common a response that Zen masters give to
kelan's to send Cohens and what does mu mean it
means nothingness or the original non being that is existence
we also have nirvikalpa samadhi which is an indian term
which means the ultimate form of samadhi and absorption without
self-consciousness to such a degree that a distinction between the
knower the act of knowing and the object known becomes
dissolved and one is left with an undifferentiated cognition there's
also sahaja Samadhi which is a very deep advanced level
of Samadhi when you have a recognition that all of
identity the identity of spirit and of matter of subject
and object is one in that there is no more
sacred or profane there's no more spiritual or material but
that everything lives in a pure void then we have
the word Shiva Shiva refers to a popular major Indian
deity it's like the god is Shiva but what is
Shiva Shiva is not some avatar or some man living
in the clouds in heaven Shiva means nothingness that's literally
what Shiva is God is nothingness I love that word
Shiva when you actually experience it all these words will
make sense to you right now it might seem a
little crazy but wait till you actually experience Shiva for
yourself that's an amazing thing speaking of that Satchidananda is
another word which is a new beautiful phrase that perfectly
describes the experience of God or Shiva sat-chit-ananda is defined
as existence consciousness bliss it's a three-part description of what
it feels like to experience ultimate reality and I found
in my own experiences of ultimate reality that it's a
very apt description that's exactly how you feel at the
same time you understand existence consciousness and you're overwhelmed with
a feeling of bliss and love there's also a popular
favorite phrase of mine rather I'm self which comes to
us from the Kabbalistic tradition Judaism and ein sulf means
the zero the absolute zero that which has no end
or infinity I love how the Kabbalists talked about zero
and infinity it's very beautiful of course from the Islamic
traditions we have Allah and Allah possesses a quality called
tau he'd what is tau he'd it's the indivisible oneness
that is God that ineffable oneness of God that can't
be encapsulated in any form and then another very beautiful
phrase that I love from the Sufi tradition is fauna
all fauna which is defined as the passing away of
the passing away it's a non duality so deep that
even non duality falls away it's a complete and utter
annihilation of everything of the self and of everything that
remains after the self and have any ideas that you
are enlightened or that you are God or that you've
experienced the ultimate truth is a complete passing away of
everything it's to die before one has died fauna all
fauna and that's what we're all altima after here is
fauna all fauna so this is the list over fifty
different labels all talking about the same thing essentially now
we could split hairs and we could say well nirvikalpa
samadhi leo nirvikalpa samadhi is technically different from rigpa and
Ric Patek nicly different from faunal fauna and that's technically
different yeah um we can get into those debates and
once you reach higher levels of attainment spiritual attainment then
maybe it will be worthwhile for you to make those
distinctions but right now for most people that's not important
right try to see the commonality here rather than the
little differences so what I want to do now is
I've selected three mystics from three different traditions that you've
probably never heard of that I want to quote to
you from so that you can get a little taste
of the similarity here and how we're always talking about
the exact same thing just using different styles and different
language and I specifically selected sticks that you've probably never
heard of before probably from traditions that you've never even
known existed why because I want to show you how
much breadth and depth there is to this and that
it really is worthwhile for you to dig in a
little bit deeper to do a little bit more research
on your own it's fascinating stuff so without further ado
let me quote to you firstly from Rabbi Israel of
gorona who is a 12th century kabbalists Jewish mystic here's
what he writes quote if a questioner asks who can
compel me to believe in I and Soph what do
we say and he says quote know that everything visible
and perceivable to human contemplation is limited and everything that
is limited is finite and that everything that is finite
is insignificant conversely that which is not limited is called
ein Soph and it is absolutely undifferentiated in a complete
and changeless unity and if he is without limit the
nothing exists outside of him and since he is both
exalted and hidden he is the essence of all that
is concealed and revealed and quote next I want to
read to you from pseudo-dionysius the areopagite a sixth century
Eastern Orthodox Christian mystic here's what he has to say
quote God is therefore known in all things and distinct
from all things he is known through knowledge and through
unknowing of him there is conception reason understanding touch perception
opinion imagination and name and many other things on the
other hand he cannot be understood words cannot contain him
and no name can lay hold of him he is
not one of the things that are and he cannot
be known in any of them he is all things
and all things and he is no thing among things
he is known to all from all things and he
is known to know from anything and quote I love
that I love the paradox of that how about that
for confusion and lastly let me quote to you from
eben attaullah 13th century Sufi Islamic mystic who writes quote
how can the heart be illumined while the forms of
creatures are reflected in its mirror or how can it
journey to God while shackled by its passions or how
can it desire to enter the presence of God while
it has not yet purified itself of the strain of
forgetfulness or how can it understand the subtle points of
mysteries while it has not yet repented of its offenses
while on the way to Allah one can experience flashes
or illuminations but only when one has accomplished fana al
fauna the passing away of the passing away only then
can one see in the light of Allah Himself the
real is not veiled from you rather it is you
who are veiled from seeing it for were anything to
veil it then that which veils it would cover it
but if there were a covering to it then it
would be a limitation to its being every limitation to
anything has power over it but he is the omnipotent
above his servants end quote I want to give credit
to Professor Luke Timothy Johnson of Emory University who is
a professor of mysticism and religion from whom I pulled
three of these quotes so there you have it you're
getting a little bit of a taste of the diversity
of styles and ways of communicating about the ineffable source
of all of reality so you might wonder well why
am I telling you all this what's the significance here
sounds just like interesting trivia it's more than just interest
trivia though what I want from you is I want
you to become fluent in non-duality to such a degree
that you have a integrated holistic understanding of this entire
field so that you see the ultimate picture so that
you are able to converse fluently with a Christian or
a Jew or a Muslim or a Buddhist or a
Hindu or an atheist or an occultist or if you
got into a time machine and you travel back in
time 5000 years ago to the ancient Egyptians you would
be able to understand where they're coming from and so
that you see how all of this interconnects and how
all of it basically points to the exact same thing
of course allowing for a lot of diversity and a
lot of stylistic differences you have to understand that all
of these mystics and all these traditions um were started
in totally different corners of the world on different continents
different climates different geopolitical situations different city-state situations wars factions
famines different cuisines you know different ways of storytelling different
languages so that accounts for a lot of the differences
but even still if you overlook the differences you see
the incredible similarities and this is something that you need
as a sage and this is something that you need
to really master this field of non-duality because you know
what I've met enlightened people I've even met enlightened masters
who are still ignorant of one or more of these
traditions and who react in a petty sectarian sort of
way against Moslems or Buddhists or Hindus or Christians or
Jews because they don't see haven't really studied the that
tradition and so they can't see the interconnections that it
has to their enlightenment and so therefore they actually are
not fully masters I don't consider the Masters I consider
them only having partial understanding of the entire field right
this is one of the things I mean when I
say enlightenment is way more than just about enlightenment right
because it's very easy to get enlightened and then look
at the entire world from your little corner of your
little perspective from your little culture it's like you become
enlightened then it's like the Buddhist way of enlightenment is
the only way it's the highest way and then if
you're a Christian then it's it's your Christian way that's
the only way and if you're a Hindu what's your
Hindu way that's the only way and this to me
speaks of ignorance right just downright ignorant because you can
tell that these people even if they do have some
kind of higher spiritual realization or insights that's great but
also it's important to put it into proper context and
to see that okay I discovered the truth but you
know what nobody has a monopoly on the truth no
culture no religion no one mystic not the Buddha not
Christ not anybody and a truly enlightened master will not
claim to have a monopoly on the truth if they
do that's how you can tell that they're still ignorant
and they still don't have the most integrated biggest picture
perspective possible and that's one of the traps that I
see people falling into when they listen to me talking
about enlightenment is that they get on board they start
to do some meditation techniques they maybe even have an
insight or two maybe they do some psychedelics or whatever
and then all the sudden they get cocky and they
think that they understand non-duality and they think that their
particular method was the one right method and then they
start criticising and bickering about how oh no that teacher
over there he's wrong and Leo what you're saying here
is egotistical and this over there and that over there
and so you start to fight with everybody and believe
it or not this happens to even enlightened people is
that because they are ignorant of the bigger picture they
can go on a crusade just spread their enlightenment because
you know why yeah it feels like you've got the
truth and maybe you do got the truth but you
got understand that there are many different paths up the
mountaintop it's the same [ __ ] mountaintop just because
you took one path doesn't mean that's the one path
that everybody should take different people resonate with different paths
different people are from different cultures what I want to
help you to do here is to become sort of
a cosmopolitan non duelist rather than a parochial non duelist
it's sort of like you're becoming a citizen of the
world and this is actually very important because otherwise if
you don't do this what will happen to you is
that you will get triggered one day you'll be discussing
non-duality with somebody and they'll be from a different culture
from a different tradition have different preferences and stylistic differences
from you and then you guys are going to get
into some heated debate when in fact there's nothing to
debate you both agree on the fundamental truth but the
ego loves to debate doesn't it the ego loves to
play sectarian games the ego loves to say Oh leo
you just said you know the Sufis the Sufis discovered
the truth and you're I'm Islamic so Leo does that
mean that Islam is the one true religion that's what
it means that's what you said and that's not at
all what I said yeah it's true that there are
some people in the Sufi tradition who have discovered the
ultimate absolute truth of existence and so that's a part
of Islam it's also true though that there are Buddhists
who have discovered the ultimate truth it's also true that
there are Hindus who have discovered the ultimate truth there
are Jews who have discovered the ultimate truth there are
Christians there are atheists there are cultists there are African
there are Native Americans okay and I want you to
be comfortable with that so that you don't cling to
your little corner of the world and then try to
proselytize everybody to follow your style you have to leave
room open for stylistic differences in the same way that
you know when you travel to another country you accept
that they have different cuisine different customs different culture different
etiquette right and the wrong way to travel would be
to say like you know what islands of America so
I'm gonna go to Asia and when I'm in Asia
I'm gonna try to impose all the American values American
culture American cuisine on the Asians because the Asians got
it wrong no see that's a that's just a lack
of worldliness that's something that happens to somebody who's lived
in America his whole life and then maybe travels to
Asia once and then he looks like a [ __
] fool right so you don't want to do that
with your non-duality you want to be much more accepting
and also it's important because this actually leads to a
lot of suffering and damage when you don't have this
cosmopolitan big-picture perspective why well just take a look through
the last five thousand years history what has it been
it's mostly been history books are filled with what with
a spiritual Crusades and all manner of evil in the
name of spirituality wars ah torture inquisitions trials persecution segregation
like all these things why because our ancestors didn't have
the big picture cosmopolitan perspective now we can forgive them
though why because frankly you know 2,000 years ago what
was happening there was no internet there were no airplanes
there were no airports there were no trains no automobiles
so if you became enlightened in your little corner of
the world you didn't even know that the world was
freaking round and that there were other races on the
other end of the world you didn't know that and
there weren't very good books in print there wasn't the
Internet where you can go and learn all this stuff
so it was very difficult to get a big picture
cosmopolitan perspective back then so we understand you know society
had to evolve to where we are now but you
are different you are alive in 21st century we now
have the luxury of the Internet and so forth and
it's very easy to learn about these things so you
really have no more excuses to be sectarian you need
to be cosmopolitan because that's ultimate non duality non-duality is
not about saying oh I'm a Buddhist and the Buddhists
are right everybody else is wrong no that's antithetical to
real non duality real non duality is embodied not just
known or spoken and to embody it means that everything
is one and if everything is 1 that means the
Buddhists the Muslims the Hindus the atheists the Egyptians the
Jews the everybody they're all your neighbors they're all your
neighbors and as Jesus said treat your neighbors as you
would treat yourself that's very important it's very important that
you understand this this is not just a philosophical pedantic
philosophical or like a scholarly point ok all right so
enough of me ranting about that let me sum up
just by saying what your biggest takeaway here should be
this is a good start but what I need you
to do if you're on board with becoming a sage
is to go and research this stuff a little deeper
because this was just a really quick overview I want
you to become familiar with the language of non-duality all
the different labels and words that I mentioned all the
different traditions at least have a cursory overview now don't
get me wrong I'm not saying that what you need
to do is to become a master in every single
tradition and field there's virtually no way that you'll be
able to do that nor am I saying that you
need to pursue all the techniques in all the different
fields to become enlightened that would also be misguided you
need to select one or two or three sets of
techniques and just work those and the most important thing
that I want you to take away here is that
this is all about having a direct experience for yourself
the practical benefit that I can see to understanding this
bigger picture and to studying these traditions is that actually
it produces motivation within you because here's what will happen
you start to study and read this stuff you start
to make all the interconnections between all these different traditions
and then it hits you like oh my god all
these people over the last 5000 years on every continent
around the world have all been talking about the same
damn thing and it's an experience they're talking about an
experience they're not talking about a belief system it's an
experience and I don't have a reference for all these
labels I'm missing this reference experience I don't have an
experience I don't know what the ultimate nature of existence
is if I'm honest I don't know that's what I
want you to experience is that state of not knowing
that realization that there's something bigger something esoteric about life
that you don't yet know because that is the true
beginning of the spiritual path is when you get to
that point and we need a lot more people getting
to that point okay so you can think of this
as an exercise in building your motivation as also opens
your mind and makes you more cosmopolitan and then the
most ultimate takeaway is that after you do this research
and you study these traditions is that here would be
the mistake is if you did that and then you
became the academic scholarly know-it-all trying to impress your friends
with trivial facts about these different traditions it's like oh
did you know the Hindus and did you know the
islamics and did you know this and this and is
that that would be a mistake the point here is
that you study all this stuff and then you recognize
that now I need the direct experience of what the
[ __ ] all these people are talking about I
need to know it's almost like you know if your
friends went to see some great new movie that came
out and they just loved it it's like the best
movie ever the best movie of the year right and
they all talk about it at work with you like
oh man you gotta go see this movie guys to
see this movie it's like it's so funny they start
telling jokes from the movie and they start making a
little little um allusions to oh this happened and that
happened but you not having seen the movie you kind
of get it but really you don't right you can't
laugh the jokes you can't really appreciate the things you're
talking about you just get a little outsider's perspective so
what does that usually do well that gets you excited
to go see the movie right and then you go
see the movie so that's the idea here the mistake
would be to get caught up in all the stories
about the movie go read online reviews about the movie
and then say oh yeah you know I've read all
the online reviews so I don't need to go see
the movie that would be the deadly mistake and I
don't want you to make that mistake here right so
be careful all right so that's it but I'm gonna
leave you with the following homework assignment I have some
Wikipedia links a couple dozen of them that I'm going
to post down below below this video go peruse these
links these links point to many of the words about
enlightenment that I talked about in this episode they also
point you to different specific mystical traditions that I want
you to research because I don't think you've ever studied
them they didn't teach you this stuff in school they
didn't teach you this stuff in college most likely so
you just don't know right so go and spend a
couple hours at least perusing these links reading through them
and as you're doing that look for the commonalities the
commonalities and that will create a really nice foundation for
you then to go out and pursue enlightenment in whichever
way you want and then you can select you know
which methods and techniques you want to use and you're
going to be much more likely to find the tradition
and the methods and techniques that will appeal and resonate
with you alright so that's it if you do this
a whole new world will open up to you non-duality
is an entire field it's a very rich and beautiful
field to study it's the most meaningful thing to study
that's why mankind has been ranting and raving over spirituality
since the dawn of time that's why because this is
what you're here to understand so now is the best
time to begin all right I'm signing off click the
like button for me please post your comments down below
share this ups with a friend and lastly come check
out actualize run right here it's my website sign up
to my newsletter it's free stay tuned with me as
in the future I will be releasing more and more
topics about how to become a sage and it's going
to be deeper and deeper topics like this if you
dug this topic you're going to dig a lot of
the stuff I'm gonna be sharing with you in the
future and it's going to be a mix of sort
of abstract philosophical intellectual stuff but then also practical stuff
and when you blend the theory with the practice that's
when you get the strongest combination just doing the practice
with no theory that is not the strongest combination you'll
discover that as we go along because you'll see some
of the topics the very conceptual topics that I'll share
with you in the future will be absolutely instrumental to
your success on this path and in your life so
I hope you stick with me and I'll see soon
with more you
