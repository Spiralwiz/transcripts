thank you welcome to understanding the liberal mind we are
continuing and concluding this two-part series the first part was
understanding the conservative mind this is the liberal mind really
the way this series is designed and that you is
that you can watch it in any order so I'm
going to repeat a little bit of the intro from
part one just in case you start with this episode
here so again what are we doing here we're not
looking to be political particularly or to advance any kind
of ideology what we're interested in is giving you in
this series the goal is to give you the deepest
most genuine sense of the opposite of whatever your political
worldview is so if you are a conservative this episode
is for you I want to help you to understand
the liberal mind because for many conservatives you look at
the stuff you see on YouTube a lot of sort
of straw Manning goes on on YouTube of the liberal
worldview and of course vice versa both sides do it
to each other but what this leaves you with is
this leaves you with a crippled understanding of your opponent's
world view and then even to the point where you
think that they are mentally ill or insane because you
can't understand how anybody could possibly believe something so so
silly or so stupid or so impractical or impossible so
our job here is epistemological not political I will present
the most charitable steeled man position of both World Views
I've already done that with the conservative world you go
check that out if you don't believe me I think
I did a pretty good job uh of not demonizing
it and so I'm going to continue that here I'm
not going to be demonizing liberalism here this is going
to be a nonpartisan non-judgmental uh most charitable look at
the liberal worldview now here's an important warning for you
conservatives is that if you've been watching a lot of
conservative media you have to understand and just trust me
on this that you do not understand the liberal worldview
the liberal worldview as it is understood and portrayed by
conservative media is not the actual literal liberal worldview it's
something totally different it's complete a complete bastardization most conservatives
could not articulate a charitable steel manned version of the
liberal worldview and that's really a shame because this creates
a lot of polarization and political dysfunction so you have
to be very careful about straw Manning the left just
as I told the Le the right I mean yeah
just as I told the left in the other episode
they have to be very careful not to straw man
the right which they of course are also guilty of
so there's a lot of misuse of the mind on
both sides here okay so don't start pointing fingers at
like oh but but the left is worse than the
right no this you're already falling into the Trap right
you're just shifting blame and you're you're playing this kind
of what about ISM game what we're interested in here
is is genuine understanding do you genuinely care to understand
why people are liberals if you say no then can
you see how already you're not really serious about policy
you're not serious about governance how can you govern if
you don't understand half the people in the world but
if you say yes you have to now take on
that responsibility it's a big responsibility to now genuinely set
aside your prejudices and personal preferences and so forth and
to really try to see the world from the Liberals
perspective that can be difficult if you grew up as
a conservative and vice versa so let's explore what makes
the liberal worldview so emotionally appealing because again as I
said in part one these World Views they're not about
logic and facts and objectivity you should be wise enough
to understand this they are emotionally held they're ideological there's
an emotional appeal behind the liberal and the conservative worldview
so what is that for the liberal why is the
liberal so triggered why is the liberal so passionate about
their beliefs why do they believe they're right well that's
what we're going to explain now again another quick note
here which I explained in part one is that by
conservative I simply mean anyone right of Center these could
be moderate conservatives or extreme conservatives and by liberal here
I mean everyone left of center everyone from the most
moderate Centrist neoliberal types to the most extreme radical Socialist
Communist Anarchist types so we're just trying to draw a
very general distinction between these attitudes they're really like attitudes
that you have liberal or conservative right or left so
if you are uh naturally more comfortable on the right
up Center then here's a key you have to realize
is that I want you to acknowledge to yourself that
there exists an intelligent formulation of liberalism depending on how
much right-wing media you've watched how much propaganda you've watched
uh the more you've watched of it the more extreme
far right you've gone the more you're going to tend
to believe that there is not an intelligent formulation of
liberalism because the more you go to the extreme the
more the extreme demonizes the opposite Pole right I want
you to understand that this is a trap this is
not true there is an intelligent formulation of liberalism and
there is also an intelligent formulation of conservativism which I
talked about in the previous episode so the question now
for us if you believe that there is such an
intelligent formulation what is that formulation we're not looking for
all the dumb stuff we're looking for the most intelligent
stuff that's how we actually grow and we make some
progress and we don't don't just waste our time in
a partisan food fight so I'm gonna start building up
to that to help you understand that so first we're
going to begin just as we did in the other
Series in the other part is we're going to begin
with a feature of the liberal world view and attitude
a sort of a feature list so here's the list
generally speaking and again I have to warn here that
these are going to be generalizations this is not going
to be true of absolutely all liberals in fact a
lot of people will mix and match liberal and conservative
to their personal liking you know whatever suits them so
very rarely do you find someone who's just a purebred
liberal or a purebred conservative usually you see strange mixes
of things especially these days where our politics is kind
of topsy-turvy and uh we're sort of going through political
realignments right now and um this this can this can
get pretty hairy and messy so I'm sort of trying
to to distill the essence of liberalism just as I
did with conservativism and then um in the real world
it's going to be a little bit more dirty than
this it's not going to be as clean so this
is kind of stereotyping here but generally speaking the liberal
mind and that's how you want to think of it
the liberal mind versus the conservative mind the liberal mind
grew up in a more loving and favorable environment so
just right off the bat Liberals are surviving in environments
where survival is easier people are nicer and kinder to
each other this is necessary to allow for liberalism because
if you grew up in an environment where people are
just shooting and raping and murdering each other genociding each
other this does not allow for liberalism to flourish that's
a super important point that many people don't understand I've
discussed a lot of this already and that series or
that part about the conservative mind so I won't go
into that too much deeply here but um generally speaking
because of the more favorable survival conditions for the liberal
mind uh the liberal mind grows up less fearful less
sensitive to Danger because there are less dangers in the
liberal Minds environment and therefore it doesn't make much sense
to be paranoid and very reactive and sensitive to threats
this is what makes you liberal this is what makes
you sort of relaxed or as the conservative mind is
more anal the reason the conservative mind is more anal
is because it perceives threat everywhere it looks from its
neighbors neighboring countries neighboring ethnic groups and so on see
and what you have to understand here is that there's
not one right way to be in the sense that
well Leo so is it correct to be very paranoid
in Life or is it correct to be so carefree
and just careless that you you walk into a forest
and you see a bear and you you know you
just care you just just say oh well it's just
a bear it's just a cuddly bear and you just
keep walking and the bear mauls you what's the correct
survival strategy well there isn't a correct survival strategy survival
is a very complex nuanced hairy kind of situation there's
no black and white here it's it's all gray areas
and so depending on your survival situation one survival attitude
can be more appropriate than the other one can be
healthy at one time and then unhealthy at another time
so for example if you're walking through a wood through
the woods where there's a sign that says you know
there's a lot of bears around and I've had this
happen I actually have I've gone to Yosemite National Park
in California there's so many bears there um and they
tell you you know hide your food lock it you
know lock your car and you know don't leave food
in there and blah blah blah blah blah because there's
so many bears so in that kind of environment yeah
you got to be on the lookout for bears and
it would be intelligent of you to bring some pepper
spray to bring a knife to bring some sort of
loud horn you know whatever that will help you with
that maybe watch a few videos on how to deal
with a bear encounter what you're supposed to do you're
supposed to run away are you supposed to stand your
ground what do you do see see that that would
be intelligent um so it's that would be sort of
a conservative approach you know prepare yourself whereas if you
just go in there willy-nilly and start taking psychedelics while
you're there start tripping on mushrooms that's going to be
dangerous on the other hand if you're sitting at home
safely with your family uh you know back in the
city and you're paranoid about a bear coming at you
that would be dysfunctional you see so it's very context
dependent now the liberal mind is generally higher in personality
trait openness the conservative mind is more closed what does
openness mean openness means in just very generically openness to
all sorts of different experiences new experiences the desire for
new strange experiences you could think of it as novelty
seeking or adventurousness if you could put that into a
personality trait or a sort of a measure the liberal
mind is more adventurous it's more open to new ideas
to new people to new cultures to new systems and
ways of doing things new ways of practicing religion and
spirituality whereas a conservative mind wants to just do religion
or spirituality the old way the way it's always been
done you know don't change it if it ain't broke
it's that kind of attitude whereas the liberal mind wants
to go out exploring and even if it ain't broke
the liberal mind wants to improve it a lot of
times the liberal mind might want to reinvent the wheel
again is this good or bad well don't look at
it so simplistically there's going to be advantages and disadvantages
depending on the time the situation the context it's all
about context here none of these things are absolutely good
or bad by themselves the liberal mind is focused on
advancing positive outcomes versus preventing negative ones whereas the conservative
mind since it's more insecure and more threatened and the
reason it's more threatened is because it grew up in
a more threatening environment and it probably still lives in
a more threatening environment therefore it has to be more
defensive by its very nature and it's more motivated by
avoiding negative outcomes than it is by advancing positive outcomes
here's a quote for you quote liberalism is focused on
positivity and social gains and thus regulates via interventions as
opposed to tight restrictions end quote whereas the conservative mind
is more about putting on those tight restrictions telling people
what they can and can't do setting up rules and
then those rules become the culture those rules become the
norm you can't have gay sex for example whereas the
liberal mind doesn't care what kind of sex you have
doesn't matter because the liberal mind is not threatened by
gay sex whereas the conservative mind is now is it
legitimate to be threatened by gay sex again we're not
judging that here it doesn't really matter that is going
to depend on the context um there are legitimate reasons
to be scared of gay sex uh one of which
is catching diseases and there could be other ones as
well for example legitimate concerns about the future of uh
human families and are we going to sustain the birth
rate necessary to sustain human civilization these are some legitimate
concerns but also it could turn into paranoia and homophobia
as well so which one is it well it depends
very much depends the liberal mind has a larger sphere
of concern and empathy and generally the liberal mind is
going to empathize more with creatures and beings that are
different than itself so the conservative mind tends to only
empathize with its family its team its tribe the liberal
mind wants to empathize with more it wants to empathize
with animals with insects with other kinds of beings if
we find aliens the the liberal mind will want to
uh empathize with the aliens agenda and their perspective and
their concern and it empathizes with minorities and with various
kinds of cultures marginalized groups all around the world and
then if you take it to its ultimate extreme if
you take liberalism remember all this is on a spectrum
so some people are just mildly liberal some people are
really liberals and some people are like crazy liberal so
if you're crazy liberal you're going to expand your whole
circle of concern and empathy is going to expand to
the entire universe literally the whole universe so as the
result of having a larger circle of concern the liberal
mind has more capacity to love it's more empathetic it's
more forgiving it's less judgmental it is more capable of
seeing the good in people and even for example in
criminals all of this is related Your Capacity to love
is basically the size of your sphere of concern now
does this mean that Liberals are perfect at loving and
that they're perfectly apathetic and that they never judge no
remember there's many degrees of liberalism and many of the
most sort of like highest Peak forms of liberalism here
even socialists and marxists you might think that they're so
liberal but actually they're not able to actually be the
sympathetic and be this loving it takes a lot of
spiritual and moral development to get to the point where
your circle of concern expands to the entire universe and
you're able to love everything equally right this is this
is a level of empathy and love that most of
the Progressive YouTubers and stuff like that that you see
in the media they're not capable of this but even
though they're not capable of that they're still generally better
at it than most conservatives again we're generalizing some conservatives
are of course more loving and have a larger sphere
of empathy than some liberals but generally speaking this is
how it works you have to understand that there's pros
and cons to this it's not purely positive to expand
your circle of concern to the entire universe this might
threaten your survival so there's always a balancing act between
how unconditionally loving you want to be on this side
and then how much you want to protect your tribe
and yourself on this side there's a trade-off there and
one is not better than the other per se so
when I say that the liberal mind has a larger
capacity to love or a larger sphere of empathy as
a conservator you might say well but Leo isn't that
sort of not being charitable towards the conservatives because it
sounds like you're saying that the Liberals are nicer people
than conservatives isn't that what you're saying and then nice
means good so that means Liberals are good and conservatives
are bad right wrong this is much more sophisticated than
that uh it's not it's not about being better than
right you have to stop framing it this way I'm
not really interested in who's better than who here in
fact that way of looking at the world that itself
is a sort of a sticking point for the conservative
mind the conservative mind tends to see the World As
Good and Evil and then that makes you judge but
consider looking at the world in a way where you
don't judge people as being better than or worse than
or good or evil you just see it as it
is you don't judge it and this in fact allows
you to be more loving ironically love is a very
sophisticated and sneaky thing I've talked about it elsewhere if
you want more information about how love works go see
my episodes called what is Love part one part two
where we explore that I also have episodes explaining what
is evil and how devil reworks if you're interested in
that go check that out that's also something that trips
many conservatives up so the liberal mind is more lacks
it's more loose it's more lenient why is it this
way because it can afford to be given its survival
conditions if you grow up in a part of the
world some liberal democracy like in Scandinavia you can afford
to be more loose and more lenient because you got
a great safety net social safety net welfare system um
you don't have to worry too much about health care
and running out of money these sorts of things life
is nice in these kinds of countries right it's not
like growing up in in Somalia or someplace or in
in Afghanistan where you can't afford to be this this
loose there's pros and cons of course to being loose
and being laxed the nice thing is that you're not
always stressed all the time uh you're kind of carefree
and easy going you're easy to get along with you
get along with others easily even if they're different than
you that's one of the benefits but there's also downsides
which I've discussed in the other episode the liberal mind
is less structured than the conservative mind it's less it's
more disorganized more disorganized so the the conservative is going
to have a tidier room all else being equal than
the liberal on the Myers-Briggs personality type there's a one
metric called the uh the perceivers versus the judgers right
that's one axis of measurement of personality type you're either
a p perceiver or a j a judger a p
is generally again just generalizing a p is generally a
person who um doesn't like holding to a strict schedule
so just ask yourself this do you like having a
strict schedule every morning that you wake up you know
exactly what you're going to do and everything is tidy
and organized or do you like to just kind of
wing it and do whatever and just kind of have
free time for this or for that thing just kind
of like no schedule so this uh correlates with whether
you're more conservative more more liberal the PS the perceivers
are going to be more liberal and the JS since
they're more structured they like structure they're going to be
more conservative also on the Myers-Briggs there's the intuitive and
the sensor axis so are you intuitive are you a
sensor if you're a sensor you're going to be more
conservative you're going to be intuitive you're going to be
more artistically inclinated and um more abstract and therefore more
liberal the liberal mind is more questioning of authority and
hierarchy it's more critical of authority in government now this
is a little bit tricky because these days especially in
the American political system if that's your understanding of liberal
versus conservative it's just the American political climate today in
the 20 first century things have been twisted up a
little bit such that um it can trick you some
things are kind of inverted so you might think that
like today it's the the Maga people or the conservatives
who are like anti-government and anti-authority because you know they're
anti-big government and it's the liberals who are pro-big government
and pro-corporate and pro-establishment and pro like Silicon Valley and
stuff like that um this really muddles things up because
if you really look at what the liberal and the
conservative mind are like in their sort of purest most
purest form when they're not sort of like intermixed in
this twisted uh way that they are today it's actually
the opposite of that um even these so-called Maga people
and so forth it might seem like they're anti-government or
anti-authority but actually they're just anti the liberal government or
the liberal Authority they're not actually principled on this point
which is one of the problems with Maga is that
it's a form of conservatism that is not principled and
uh there are also uh liberals and you know um
there are neoliberal types and centrists who also are not
very principled about their liberalism in which case they can
support big government and uh sort of quasi-authoritarian tendencies in
the government just because they're interested in keeping power this
is what you have to understand is that the mind
is extremely tricky so most of the time whenever the
Mind claims to have some sort of ideological Purity like
it says that I am a true pure Christian or
a true pure Muslim or I am a true pure
conservative or liberal or Progressive or whatever what you have
to understand that is that in most of these cases
the mind is lying to itself and in fact the
more the mind exhorts its ideology and its purity of
towards some sort of ideology the less that mind is
actually going to be in Integrity with that because if
you're actually in Integrity with being a liberal or conservative
or a Christian or a Muslim you're not going to
need to go out there and try to convince everybody
that you are that way so the people who who
yell the loudest about being the truest conservatives usually they're
not the truest conservatives you have to understand this a
lot of times these people are very unprincipled and so
what they do is they're just looking for power and
then in the name of power they will sell out
their principles so for example the Maga people really what
they wanted is just power and in the name of
power they will overthrow their conservative principles they will they
will violate constitutional Norms they will overthrow democracy whatever as
long as they can get power that's the problem with
people who become power hungry now again liberals can also
be guilty of that I'm just talking about Maga here
because it's just a particularly poignant example in current times
and there is an asymmetry right now in our political
climate in America between the conservatives and the Liberals it's
not always equal it's not the case that both sides
are equally debased equally corrupt and equally power hungry this
is a mistake you can't assume that at different times
in history different sides of the aisle will be more
power hungry more corrupt and more Shameless in the way
that they go about pursuing power now does this mean
the Liberals and the progressives are innocent of this no
they are not innocent of this they will also sacrifice
some of their integrity and some of their principles in
order to attain power so you have to really be
careful about like ideological Purity versus Power because these things
get traded off this is what happened for example in
the Soviet Union um in a lot of communist regimes
what happened was that a communist comes to power proclaiming
all the benefits of Communism or socialism but then in
practice what they really want is that this is just
a this is just a facade to take authoritarian power
that's what Stalin did that's what Mao did because you
have to understand that the human mind what it really
is concerned with the most is not truth or ideological
Purity it or or being principled or having Integrity it's
concerned about raw survival its own raw survival so even
though I might have the most beautiful utopian ideology if
you elect me into office once I'm in office my
family is threatened I'm threatened I could be assassinated my
family could be kidnapped I could lose all my money
the opposition party could imprison me for whatever made up
phony reasons right so I'm in great threat every politician
is in great threat when they get elected to power
and so the the the challenge for politicians is that
how do you maintain your integrity despite all the personal
threats on your life and uh you know you're going
to be getting threats both from the left and the
right because some people even in your own party are
going to think you're not radical enough and then of
course the opposition will think that uh you're not correct
either and so you're going to be getting attacked from
both sides of the aisle it's really not easy people
underestimate how difficult it is to be in these political
positions and so there's enormous pressure to surrender your principles
and uh truth and your own integrity and to get
corrupted whether by money by sex by extending your term
in office by you know various kinds of political donations
lobbying efforts uh and all sorts of corruption like this
can happen and so um you have to understand that
that this Dynamic of corruption this is this is not
something that's particular to liberals or conservatives every human mind
is prone to corruption corruption is such a deep Transcendent
force of nature it really is a force of nature
that nobody is immune to corruption and one of the
mistakes that both the partisan sides in the political debate
make is that they they make the mistake of thinking
that corruption is something unique to the opposite side to
the conservatives or to the Liberals now but also as
I say that we have to be careful because I'm
not saying that both sides are equally corrupt at all
times there will be times in history and parts of
the world where the left is more corrupt than the
right and vice versa this is all dependent on the
exact situations right if you want to know more about
the fascinating nature of corruption and how sneaky it is
and how pervasive it is go check out my episode
called how corruption works very important episode if you want
to understand politics so generally speaking the liberal mind does
question authority in hierarchy and government more than the conservative
mind because look the conservative mind is looking to conserve
tradition culture Society how do you do that usually conserving
your tradition your religion your culture your Society your language
your ethnic group the way you can serve these things
is by supporting the existing systems and structures you have
to start to look at what liberal and conservative means
not just in today's time of the last 10 years
of American politics see a lot of people have gotten
sort of like a lot of newbies have gotten dragged
into politics through social media through these sort of outraged
videos that you see on YouTube and on Facebook and
stuff this is really distorting your understanding of politics and
of what liberal and conservative means you have to look
more historically historically over the last Thousand Years what have
liberal and conservative Minds how have they behaved and the
way that conservative Minds have behaved over the last thousand
years is that they generally support the existing systems in
power for example a liberal will say hey you know
the Constitution is not so great there's not there I
mean there's good elements to the Constitution but there's also
stuff in the Constitution that just is outdated it just
needs to change let's go um introduce new amendments and
really change the Constitution radically see that's the liberal mind
that's the truly liberal mind thinks this way the conservative
mind says no no no no what are you talking
about the Constitution is the original founding document which makes
America so unique relative to all the other countries it
is the Cornerstone of all of American government we have
to treat that thing as sacred we can't change the
Constitution it's dangerous it would be too dangerous to change
the Constitution and the liberal says no it's not dangerous
the greater danger is not changing it the greater danger
is getting stuck in the past the Constitution is 250
years old or so um it's just not equipped to
deal with all the technological advances that have happened in
the last 250 years see this is really where the
debate comes down to the liberal mind loves to challenge
the status quo and subverts conventions and social norms again
if you're looking at it just from the American perspective
it might seem like no Leo in today's American political
climate it's the conservatives who are challenging the status quo
no you have to understand that this Maga stuff that
Trump has been doing this was not really a challenge
to the status quo we have to understand that Trump
is not a honest Faith actor he's not acting with
any ideological Purity or integrity Trump just hijacked the conservative
movement for his own personal Ambitions to power that's all
that was so the only extent to which Trump challenges
the status quo is to the extent he needs to
to attain power but then once he has power he's
not interested in challenging the status quo anymore which is
why if you look at his legislation it's all very
pro-status quo there's very little difference between the actual policies
that previous conservative presidents have have passed and supported and
what Trump supports so it's a fake rebelliousness true rebelliousness
would actually want to would want to radically change the
status quo if you really wanted to change and challenge
the status quo and convert uh subvert conventions uh you
would be a liberal in that sense you would get
into office and you would you would start to do
radical things like change the economy from capitalist to socialists
for example or you would start to modify the Constitution
you would start to really change the the way that
um for example money affects politics you would maybe Outlaw
all lobbying or all political contributions these would not be
seen as conservative moves this would be very radical and
you would be opposed by the entire establishment which would
include Mo all the right wing and much of even
the left wing because you would be proposing such radical
changes that it would threaten the survival of even many
of these sort of moderate Centrist um uh leftists in
government and you would also threaten many of the bureaucrats
and so forth now Trump threatens the bureaucrats in a
different way Trump isn't threatening the bureaucrats by doing some
very Progressive you know agenda Trump is threatening the bureaucrats
simply because his governing style is so erratic and so
narcissistic and so authoritarian you know he just wants to
his ego to rule that um the American bureaucracy the
way it's set up is you have checks and balances
those checks and balances are getting in his way and
he's getting in the way of those checks and balances
so yeah in that sense the Trump is fighting with
the Deep state but sort of from the other end
right you can fight with the Deep State because you
want to dismantle the Deep state so that you can
create sort of a you know a more maybe Equitable
Society that's not what Trump is doing Trump is fighting
the Deep state so that he could have more power
so that he can just act out his ego his
egoic impulses these are two very different reasons for challenging
the Deep state so uh the liberal mind is the
one that really um will question culture see the conservative
mind wants to preserve culture doesn't want to question culture
it doesn't want to deconstruct culture the liberal mind wants
to deconstruct culture it wants to change culture the conservative
mind doesn't like that it feels uncomfortable with just changing
culture see the liberal mind wants to take the Christian
Bible and then it wants to take a red marker
and erase all the bad stuff in the Christian Bible
and then reprint it so that it only contains all
the modern good stuff right so we're going to cross
out the stuff about um killing homosexuals and the bad
stuff about maybe um mistreating women and slaves and this
is you know we're going to remove slavery from the
Bible all this kind of stuff we're going to remove
all that so it's just sort of like the pure
you know Jesus love kind of version of the Bible
much of the Old Testament would be marked marked up
and edited out um but if you tell that to
a conservative the conservative is going to lose his mind
it's like what do you mean you wanna you wanna
improve the Bible you can't improve the Bible this is
the word of God it's perfect we've got to preserve
it as it is so this is what I mean
by um the liberal mind challenges the status quo and
really subverts conventions it's more rebellious it's more iconoclastic it's
more non-conformist it's more avant-garde and more transgressive and this
is why if you've ever wondered like why is it
that the progressives and universities these Progressive University kids that
are sort of uh straw man and demonized a lot
as examples of like ridiculous liberalism you know excesses of
liberalism and leftism uh why is it that these kids
are wearing nose rings and they got tattoos and they
got purple hair and they got like um weird dress
style they dress like punks or they dress some weird
way like this why is that because why can't they
just dress normal why don't they just like wear a
nice tuxedo all buttoned up and and kind of like
you know Jordan Peterson it's actually very interesting just watch
the way Jordan Peterson dresses and just compare that to
the way that um some of these University kids dress
this tells you just this is like the starkest example
of of how the conservative versus the liberal mind looks
at the world because Jordan Peterson always wears these like
nice um old school sort of Suits they're not just
like traditional business suits they're a little bit more of
like on the sort of old-timey old-fashioned like he used
to even wear like fedoras and like gangster outfits like
Al Capone gangster outfits this was like back before he
was popular he has a few videos like this but
now uh in modern uh you know currently um he
still you know dresses very nice he believes you know
buttoning up and also whereas when you look at at
liberals um you know look at Destiny Destiny has like
blue hair now why does he have blue hair imagine
Jordan Peterson painting his nails pink and his or black
and his his hair his hair blue see uh the
reason the liberal mind does this is because it likes
to experiment with changing culture it doesn't want to just
take culture as something that's been given to it that
needs to be preserved and loved as it is it's
like no culture is a co-creative process I am a
participant in culture I get to Define culture my way
I get to self-express I get to change what the
Fashions are and I don't like the old school Fashions
those were you know some Boomer old Fashions we don't
need those let's invent our own fashions let's be avant-garde
let's create new types of art new types of media
new types of film new types of uh pornography new
type new ways of of taking drugs let you know
let's innovate that's the liberal mindset in its sort of
purest form to the liberal mind the highest good is
challenging the status quo to create progress innovation creating a
more peaceful and fair Society that's the liberal mind's bias
the conservative mind's bias is let's preserve the good within
the society and culture that our ancestors have created for
us let's not innovate too much because the Innovations can
be worse and more dangerous than the tried and true
and tested um systems of the past the liberal mind
emphasizes fairness and reduction of suffering this is where the
social justice Warriors come from that's their attitude if you're
a conservative I want you to ask yourself you know
you probably like to Snicker and ridicule the social justice
Warriors but but really ask yourself social justice Warrior what
does that mean as a conservative for example don't you
value Warriors that's part of your ethos you like the
war your ethos um you like your ancestors who were
you know who who fought valiantly in battle to protect
your civilization so you like Warriors brave warriors is the
conservative value and then social justice don't you want to
live in a just Society so in a certain sense
what could be better than being a warrior for social
justice after all all those Warriors that you idealize and
look up to whether it's superheroes you know Batman Spider-Man
whatever what are they doing they're fighting to protect the
weak that's like Batman's whole thing um uh fighting against
you know against bullies who who would do harm to
the weak in innocent civilians of Gotham City or if
you admire for example um the movie 300 Leonidas the
general you know the Spartans from 300 why are the
Spartans revealed because they were warriors but also what were
they doing they were fighting the armies of Persia and
Xerxes and all this kind of stuff and that movie
you know watching that movie can bring you to tears
because they're fighting for justice think about Braveheart Mel Gibson's
character William Wallace and Braveheart what was he fighting for
in that movie he was a social justice Warrior he
was fighting for the freedom and uh the security and
equality that his tribe and his people were denied because
they were oppressed by some King so be careful demonizing
the social justice Warrior stuff now of course it can
go too far you can you can go crusading too
much that is a problem um but understand that fighting
for justice is a tried and true um Motif throughout
all of Mythology that's what all the mythology is about
that's what Star Wars is about what does Luke Skywalker
doing in Star Wars he's a social justice Warrior the
rebels are social justice Warriors against the oppressive Empire you
see so be careful demonizing social justice Warriors try to
understand their intentions even if sometimes they go too far
or they do something ridiculous understand what their intentions are
their intentions are to create a more fair Equitable Society
where people are not getting bullied and what's funny about
that is that then the social justice Warriors themselves get
bullied by the status quo which is actually what the
conservatives represent as a conservative you're representing the status quo
which is why you don't like these social justice Warriors
because they're upsetting the apple cart and sometimes the reason
you do that as a conservative is because it can
be painful to admit that there are problems in your
Society because as a conservative you're more attached to your
culture and your Society the way that it is to
your religion to your ethnic group and so forth to
your civilization like Western Civilization if you're in the west
you're more attached to that therefore you feel threatened when
people point out to you the limitations of your culture
or your Society or the way that things have been
done in the past you know if you're a Christian
you're going to be threatened if I point out to
you that for example the Earth is not 5 000
years old that's going to threaten you you're going to
want to deny that or invent some kind of excuse
or you might find some way to a demonize or
ridicule me so that you don't have to take in
the fact that there's a factual error in the Bible
or if I uh you know um if you're a
capitalist and I point out to you that there's problems
within capitalism systemic inequalities within capitalism just admitting that to
yourself you have like it boggles your mind it literally
pains your mind to admit some of these things because
you've been growing up believing that your system is the
best one and you're attached to it it's sort of
like me coming to you if you have a child
and telling you something bad that your child did at
first glance you might not want to admit that your
child did that you know I might come to you
and say your child raped my daughter and if you
really love your child at first you'll probably deny it
you'll say no Leo what are you talking about your
daughter's just making up some [ __ ] story you're
not going to want to admit that your son is
capable of uh raping my daughter see but if you're
honest and you're really you really care about equality and
Truth in this case then at some point you have
to say wait a minute maybe my son actually did
rape his daughter and if that's true it's true you
know I can't I don't want to like delude myself
here so let me go find the truth and then
but then see if you find the truth and the
truth is as I say as I as I accused
then that's going to be very painful for you for
most people it would be much easier for them just
to demonize me the message and shoot the messenger and
that's some sort of story about me then you don't
have to go investigating whether your son is actually a
rapist so this is what's going on with conservatives a
lot of conservatives are in denial about some of the
stuff that Liberals are trying to point out to them
of what's wrong with these systems that you're defending these
systems are hurting many people are you acknowledging that they're
hurting minorities they're hurting black people hurting poor people indigenous
people people in third world countries what are we going
to do about that this means our systems and ways
and habits and culture has to change but then what
if you're attached to Defending Your culture you know and
this is actually exactly what happens with um in the
Catholic church when people come to accuse the priests of
abusing sexually abusing children in the Catholic Church what happens
the pope and his subordinates and Cardinals and so forth
they they generally deny it they try to suppress it
why because if there's any admission that this kind of
sexual abuse is going on this is going to tarnish
the reputation of that whole system and then you can't
defend it and love it so easily it becomes harder
to love the system this is why uh radicals and
critics of these sorts of systems have have usually been
killed throughout history they're killed because they're they're um you
know shaking the boat upsetting the apple cart and people's
livelihoods depend on that and people love the way that
these systems have been established people get attached to them
the liberal mind is non-patriarchal and less hierarchical it's more
feminine more relaxed more feeling oriented more open-hearted more intuitive
more heart-centered more soft there's a better integration of the
feminine and the masculine it's not that the masculine is
thrown out or rejected it's that there's there's a there's
more of a balance in the liberal mind the right-wing
mind tends to be more about like that sort of
Macho machismo a lot of right-wing dictators and fascists like
to play that up the strong man people feel comfortable
see people feel comfortable having a strong man leader why
because in the past that was a good way to
survive if you had a weak soft feminine leader in
the past that would probably get you killed in a
military situation but today you have to understand that our
environment is changing so the kind of machismo and strong
man hyper masculine ways of leading people in the past
a thousand years ago that was effective today that's less
effective why is it less effective well because nowadays it's
actually more about being intelligent more about being diplomatic more
about being um uh you know shrewd it's not about
brute power the the army that wins today is not
the one that has necessarily the most bombs it's the
one that is able to deploy those bombs in more
intelligent and strategic ways and also even just being able
to use diplomacy such that you don't even have to
get to the point of having to deploy those bombs
because in the end in a war both sides are
losing in a war even the side that win still
loses so if you really want to win in government
then the way you do that is is to be
so good at diplomacy that you never even have to
drop bombs and then in fact you can take those
resources from the bombs and reinvent them reinvest them into
your schooling and and other parts of your civilization and
your Society scene so our technological ability has actually equalized
the just the raw power disparity between the masculine and
The Feminine such that um a lot of situations are
better handled by the feminine approach than masculine again it
would be a mistake to assume that one is better
than the other it's not it very much depends on
the situation sometimes you need a masculine approach for a
situation if somebody is um you know shooting up a
school you need a masculine approach you go in there
you shoot them in the head that's a masculine approach
to that problem it works well a feminine approach there
would just get exploited if you try to go in
there and then just kind of like talk that guy
down he'll probably just shoot you in the head not
gonna work but in a lot of situations these days
the masculine action the masculine approach actually becomes counterproductive it's
too forceful it's too brutish it's like uh you know
it's like giving a um it's like it's like asking
a gorilla to paint a painting what is the gorilla
going to do it doesn't have enough dexterity and Nuance
to to paint Fine Lines it's just gonna like smear
[ __ ] on the on the [ __ ]
um on the canvas it's not going to produce a
good painting but if you ask a gorilla to go
beat someone up the gorilla can do that so um
much of our civilization these days actually benefits from a
more feminine approach uh but a lot of times conservatives
demonize that approach and that's that's generally if you notice
in um especially in American politics the way that um
political campaigns have been run in the past between conservatives
and and liberals is that the conservatives love to paint
the liberal as being soft and weak weak on military
right there's that sort of Trope the liberal is weak
too soft why is that because it's true the liberal
mind is more feminine in its approach it's more willing
to compromise it's more willing to do diplomacy rather than
just bomb someone to death as a result it's less
violent and less warlike now see when I say that
as a conservative you might say wait a minute Leo
but that's not that seems like again you're sort of
demonizing the right because you're trying to claim the moral
High Ground for the left is not a bias of
yours because like you're trying to claim that that the
left is less violent which is a good thing and
violence is bad thing again no it's not that violence
is a Bad Thing per se violence is good when
it's appropriate in the right situation but a lot of
times violence is used in the wrong situation it's very
inappropriate in fact mostly that's how violence has been used
but sometimes it is appropriate if somebody is shooting up
a school full of children the police have a legitimate
claim to violence there to take that guy out um
so when I say that right Wingers are more violent
again this is a very gross generalization of course most
right-wingers are never going to kill anybody or harm anybody
physically but they are generally more prone to violence they're
more supportive of brute forms of resolving conflict which is
why in a presidential election they even make fun of
liberals for being being soft and not being strong man
enough because throughout human history there's been a lot of
violence and we know that the best way to keep
yourself safe is just you know is be extra aggressive
if you're extra aggressive No One's Gonna [ __ ]
with you but what's the downside of being extra aggressive
well if you're too preemptive with your violence let's say
I moved to a neighborhood and I'm so I'm so
like threatened and secure that you know I think that
my neighbors are going to come and and uh attack
me and rob me so I'm threatened by that so
what I decide to do is I say well I'm
going to be a macho man I'm gonna buy a
bunch of guns and I'm gonna go attack them first
even though they're just they're just peaceful Neighbors see this
would be dysfunctional on the other hand if I moved
her to a really bad neighborhood where my next door
neighbor was a drug dealer and the other one you
know had a huge stockpile of guns then actually me
being preemptive and maybe taking their guns away or killing
the drug dealer that might actually save my life and
my family's life you see so it's all about the
appropriateness of your responses there's no right or wrong absolute
way the liberal mind cares more about fighting for the
rights of oppressed minorities freedom from bigotry and bullying the
liberal mind is more imaginative creative and artistic it's more
insightful and flexible in its thinking patterns it's more cognitively
complex and better at tolerating cognitive ambiguity now you might
think that this is just stuff that I'm making up
here because I'm biased and try to you know portray
the Liberals to be better than the conservatives I'm not
there's actually been quite a bit of scientific research and
studies within neurology that have actually done brain scans fmri
scans and so forth of liberal and conservative brains and
actually comparing them there's also been tests you know they
give sort of psychological assessment tests and tasks for the
liberal versus the conservative brain to perform and what they
discover is that actually um you can objectively demonstrate that
the liberal brain is more insightful and more cognitively complex
is better at tolerating cognitive ambiguity and has more flexible
thinking patterns you can find some of that research online
I will actually be posting on my blog over the
next week I will post links to some really interesting
studies that you can go read so you have to
take my word for this um and you will see
the differences that they found scientists have found researching this
stuff one thing they found is the following is that
the liberal brain has an enhanced error detection system literally
they will give a task to liberals and conservatives where
they give them a set of images where there are
certain errors and they ask each person to detect the
air as quickly as possible as the images are flipping
through and what they find is the liberal brain is
able to detect these errors faster and more reliably that's
because what they found in another study is that the
liberal brain is able to do deeper self-reflection and as
a result of this self-reflection it has Fine more fine-tuned
filters for looking for these kind of errors and that's
also going to explain why it is that liberals tend
to see more problems in existing systems because when a
conservative mind looks at a certain system like religion or
capitalism or you know whatever um they're going to look
at and say oh it's it's pretty good it's working
fine whereas the liberal mind is going to look at
it with a different set of filters and say oh
well there's a problem and there's a problem and there's
a problem and there's a problem and it's gonna focus
on the problems more than what the system is actually
doing again this is not good or bad by itself
in the absolute sense it's all context sensitive the liberal
mind has a greater emotional awareness otherwise known as EQ
emotional intelligence higher emotional intelligence this comes as a sort
of a byproduct of that more feminine softer approach the
more emotionally aware you become the more your approach to
life softens in how you deal with people you're less
Brute Force about it you're less driven by just your
Reptilian Brain and your knee-jerk instincts you're less animalistic here's
a quote about the liberal line for you uh quote
when the task challenges habitual ways of thinking liberals tend
to outperform conservatives end quote and also quote liberals have
a higher tolerance for cognitive tasks that require novelty complexity
and creativity end quote I pulled some of these quotes
from the online studies that I will be linking on
my blog the liberal mind is more focused on the
future versus the past it's more about your vision for
what Society could be 50 or 100 years from now
whereas the conservative is more Traditions oriented looking at how
to preserve the past glorifying the past the liberal doesn't
glorify the past because the liberal sees a lot of
problems in the past see when a conservative looks at
American history and so the last 300 years of American
History when a conservative looks at it he says look
uh the founding fathers came over and they began the
beginning of the greatest civilization and democracy that has existed
on this planet so fundamentally we're doing pretty good when
a liberal looks at the last 300 years of American
History they will say well yeah the founding fathers came
over but most of them were slave owners and they
were racists and they were sexist and they were homophobes
and they believed in all sorts of weird superstitions and
religious mystical nonsense and um uh they set up a
system which promised democracy but didn't really give full democracy
until just as recently as 60 70 years ago till
the Civil Rights Act and there were all sorts of
abuses and Horrors and genocide of indigenous people and and
these people and those people in black people and Asian
people and and then conquering different you know lands and
then stealing territory from Mexico and from those people and
these people and then you know it's like see if
you look for problems you're going to find problems in
anything on the other hand if you look for the
good in things you're going to find the good in
everything so which is right it's not right or wrong
it's glass half full glass half empty the liberal mind
glories in his vision of the future and is a
champion for change it's a quote generally speaking the liberal
mind is more educated more Metropolitan and urban wealthier more
worldly more Cosmopolitan more Global more Multicultural this is why
um everywhere around the world the most liberal people live
in the most urban areas and the more you go
out into the countryside the red States so to speak
or even the red parts of the country you're going
to find more conservatives this is not an accident because
when you're living in a large Urban metropolitan area you
are forced to confront A diversity of ethnicities Sexes sexual
orientations backgrounds Cuisines cultures and all sorts of stuff like
that because people are living in literal physical close proximity
you're living in the same high-rise whereas if you're living
in Wyoming on a farm somewhere and you have 100
acres and your nearest neighbor is is 10 miles down
the road well you're much more isolated and your neighbor
is going to probably share exactly the same religion as
you go to the same church as you eat the
same food as you believe in the same things as
you look like you racially ethnically so liberalism flourishes where
there is a Melting Pot of many different perspectives and
a liberalism likes that see to the conservative mind it's
kind of icky and uncomfortable because the conservative mind is
more simple it doesn't like all the complexity of dealing
with all these different perspectives it's messy dealing with these
perspectives but the liberal mind actually thrives on this so
it values and appreciates multiculturalism diversity the bigger the Melting
Pot the better as far as the liberal is concerned
because all these different perspectives create a rich ecosystem it's
sort of like the difference between those kind of fish
that live on the bottom of the ocean like deep
deep deep where there's not even any light there there's
very few fish and they're few and far between and
then most the fish there are blind they don't even
see the fish down there can't even see because there's
no light so why do you need eyes to see
uh versus consider the ecosystem of the shallow Coral areas
you know tropical areas in Hawaii and Indonesia Fiji other
places like this uh Australia in these coral reefs they're
very shallow uh there's a lot of sunlight the water
is very warm because there's not a lot of depth
to it so it heats up from the Sun and
there's a multiplicity A diversity just like a complete Cornucopia
of you know all sorts of Critters and corals and
and sea life and plants and animals and and Marine
you know mammals and all this kind of stuff and
they're all together and it's just like there's there's millions
of them and it's just like this this playground right
and they all need to have huge eyes to see
all this because you got to see all the Predators
all your potential mates so you got to see all
of it because there's so much stuff going on so
that's like the liberal mind and the conservative mind is
like you're living a thousand feet underwater where there's no
light and also notice it's actually it's harder to the
survival conditions are actually harsher on the bottom of the
ocean than they are in these shallow coral reefs in
the shallow coral reefs there's a lot more mating opportunities
a lot more food opportunities a lot more shelter opportunities
whereas on the bottom of the ocean it's just like
a bare sand floor there's nothing there there's no food
like once in a while you find some other Critter
you can eat but otherwise there's no food there's no
plants there's no Oxygen it's it's like really it's like
a desert it's the equivalent of a desert underwater and
so therefore like um have you wondered have you ever
been to a desert I live in a desert uh
have you ever wondered why all the plants in the
desert have spikes and thorns and uh and then when
you go to to the Jungle you go to the
Jungle in Hawaii or something or in Costa Rica there's
no there's not that many thorns and spiky plants why
is that because surviving in the jungle is easier than
it is surviving the desert because in the desert there's
no water in the jungle there's a lot of water
you're in rainforest and so because of this every plant
in the desert has to be much more defensive and
it has to be spiky literally spikes are [ __
] growing out of it so so also if you
want to think of a conservative mind think of the
conservative mind as a cactus it's got these spikes it's
very defensive because it's very terrified of someone coming in
sucking up all of its water and the liberal mind
is sort of the opposite I don't know what would
be the opposite of that it's like big juicy coconuts
come take one it's like that you know it's more
open like a flower you might say here's another quote
for you conservatives are concerned with marking clear intra-group boundaries
whereas liberals focus on intra-group variability and interdependence end quote
and again the reason that is because as a conservative
you're you're living more separated from other people so the
boundaries there actually help to defend you whereas when you're
living in a Melting Pot cultural Reef environment there's so
many organisms all swarming together that you can't draw these
boundaries and you got to learn how to how to
live with a lot of diversity you can't just put
up a wall you see isn't this interesting like Maga
the whole Maga movement is like just put up a
wall and then um the liberal attitude is like no
walls don't work well walls can work or they don't
work depending on the situation of course the problem with
these walls on the border is that you can easily
build you know dig a hole underneath it build a
tunnel or use a ladder and a rope to climb
it so how effective is that wall really so the
liberal the liberal position would say that you can put
up these walls but in the end the fundamental for
the the driving forces are driving people towards more Oneness
and unity uh no matter how many walls you build
and how many immigrants you kick out in the end
the whole human race is going to have to come
together at some point like if you want to take
this to its ultimate radical liberal extreme you figure that
uh in the end every human ethnicity is going to
have to [ __ ] and intermix with every other
human ethnicity to the point where in a thousand years
from now all of our babies are gonna be mixed
race babies where you're not even going to be able
to tell the difference between a black white asian or
Latino baby anymore or a Jewish baby because they're all
going to be intermixed so much that it's just going
to be sort of a homogeneous um averaging of all
of those ethnicities to the point where we're just going
to have only one ethnicity it's just a matter of
how many thousands of years will it take to get
there that's what the liberal would say and the liberal
would say well that's just inevitable we can't prevent that
so and and why would we even want to prevent
that that could even be a good thing why do
we need these ethnicities let's let's just let's move towards
that and um and it'll be great in fact have
you actually noticed this you know I've gone out I've
done a lot of pickup in doing pickup what I've
noticed you know I especially where I do it I
do a lot of pickup in Vegas and in Vegas
we get people from all over the country and all
over the world that's what's so interesting about it we
have a very sort of Multicultural mix of people that
come here I meet girls from Brazil and from Japan
and from from China and from from Europe from Scandinavia
from everywhere very uh very interesting to just to meet
people from new places that I've never heard of before
you know meet some girl from the Middle East interesting
right just interesting to learn about that culture and so
forth um but what I've noticed is that the girls
that I'm the most attracted to what I would call
like the hottest girls are always mixed race girls it's
like Asian American mix or South American Scandinavian mix like
like interest or like uh Thai and German I met
a girl like that like um these are some of
the hottest [ __ ] girls like I don't know
if this is just a personal preference of mine maybe
it is but um but I think it's more than
just my personal preference I think what you can actually
do is you can take photographs of the averages of
each racial group I've actually I've posted this on my
blog years ago I posted an image of the average
faces like superimposed on top of each other of of
people from every ethnic group and you can look from
every nationality you can see like you could look at
a German girl's face at a Japanese girl's face and
stuff like and when you average out all their faces
they become more beautiful just within that ethnic group like
if you want the most beautiful German girl's face take
a hundred German girls and average out their face like
in Photoshop superimpose them all on top of each other
and you're gonna get basically the face of a [
__ ] German supermodel and if you do that with
a Japanese girl you're gonna get a Japanese supermodel and
so on but using that same logic now we can
extrapolate sort of one level more meta take all of
the race all of the girls faces from all the
races superimpose them into one you're gonna get a really
beautiful girl I guarantee you and of course this applies
to to to men's spaces as well so I don't
know why you conservatives are so against interracial couples and
marriages and mixing cultures we're going to get some really
beautiful sexy humans if we do this so I think
personally you're shooting yourself in the foot so that that's
my case for interracial sexuality anyways um but also look
even if that wasn't true you have to be realistic
with yourself as a conservative like um are we are
you really going to be able to stop this do
you really think that creating an ethno state is going
to work it's not going to work this is this
is one of the most foolish ideas that I've seen
from far right Wingers these right Wingers who want to
create an ethno State now this is not true for
most right-wingers most right-wingers don't want to do that but
a few on the very far right want to create
a Christian white ethno State and they want America to
be that and then they say well I don't really
hate the blacks but let's just move the blacks out
to Africa and in Africa they can have their own
black ethno State there and then you know the Latinos
can have their own Brown ethnic state in um in
Mexico or someplace and then we'll just everyone will be
happy and we'll all just get along this is Pure
Fantasy the reality is that even if you did that
which is just completely impractical and it would be completely
unfair to you know Deport such huge numbers of the
population you're not going to deport 15 20 of the
black population in America and Africa right it's silly um
but even if you could the problem is going to
be once we're all separated into these ethno states what's
going to happen we're gonna have War like we've never
had before because each state is going to start to
hate the other state because you're not comfortable with the
other state right you're not comfortable with black people brown
people that's why you don't want them in your state
you're not going to want to allow them to travel
to your state there's going to be traveling problems there's
going to be trade problems and then eventually there's going
to be War we've already gone through this in human
history much of human history has been one ethnicity fighting
another ethnicity because they were just local tribes you know
some Germanic Drive fought with some French tribe or with
some Italian tribe or with some Scandinavian tribe we've already
had this this is the majority of human history at
this point though we've mixed enough to the point where
we're comfortable enough that we don't need to kill each
other just because we look different or have different culture
and different food and different language so if you separate
us out we're gonna there's gonna be a force in
nature that's gonna try to merge us back together so
really you're fighting against the forces of nature uh as
a right-winger here when you're trying to draw these walls
and this goes so profound this goes to a metaphysical
level go check out my episode called Division versus Unity
where I discuss how the whole struct the metaphysical structure
of reality is about uh creating distinctions then re-collapsing and
merging those distinctions into Unity the nature of reality is
Unity but also the nature of reality is division that's
a really deep Rabbit Hole I won't go into here
but just connecting that episode with this one here for
those of you who are a little bit more sophisticated
in advanced and really wanna deeply interconnect your understanding of
these topics here right so I want you to see
how all the metaphysical spiritual stuff that I talk about
connects with with politics so uh the liberal mind is
less tribal as a result of all this it sees
the whole globe as one Village and wants to treat
all humans as one this is why the right Wingers
smear the Liberals as globalists globalists this has become some
sort of Boogeyman word but also like if you're a
right winger and you believe in this globalist nonsense you
think globalism is bad just look um ask yourself do
you believe that we're one globe are we not on
one planet is that not true are we not one
species what happens when some alien civilization some evil alien
civilization comes and attacks us isn't it the case that
we're all going to act together as one species to
defend the planet so are you going to be so
stubborn that you're going to resist treating Humanity as one
globe and that you're gonna have to sit there and
wait you're gonna have to wait until some evil alien
civilization comes in a thousand years and forces us to
unite that's what you're gonna wait for why don't we
just do that of our own volition preemptively not just
because we want to protect ourselves in the future from
Aliens and so forth but also because look the globe
everybody on the globe is interconnected you see um this
should be obvious but it it isn't from actually for
most uh right Wingers because our atmosphere is all one
the pollution you pump in China is the same molecules
you're going to ingest in in Africa or in America
it all circulates the ocean is one it all circulates
you know um if we ruin the ocean in one
place we're probably going to ruin it for everybody in
any other place you know radiation will spread through the
atmosphere through the ocean through the food supply viruses spread
through the whole world you can't just you can't just
build a wall around China and contain covid they've certainly
tried if anybody could contain covid through lockdowns and strict
boundary setting it would have been China they failed miserably
at that so don't get mad at China for that
it's just that it's impossible it's impossible in an interconnected
world where we all have you know internet connections connecting
us to everybody on the planet basically smartphones computers cheap
air travel we're living in one globe now of course
there's some there's some valid arguments about some of the
harms that have come from globalism especially trade policy and
so forth there are some legitimate concerns there and we
could have a more protectionist policy towards trade and Outsourcing
jobs that that's fine I'm not dismissing any of that
but fundamentally you have to understand that globalism is our
future if you look a thousand years into the future
what's going to happen the whole planet is going to
become one one civilization there's going to be skyscrapers built
across the whole planet basically um and all the countries
are going to have to get along there's gonna have
to be more there's only going to be more trade
more communication more travel more interconnection more mixing of cultures
more mixing of races more access to different cuisines in
a thousand years you're going to be able to literally
go into a into a store and there's going to
be food in that store from every single corner of
the world every fruit that exists in every nation will
be available in that story you'll be able to click
a button and Amazon will deliver to you any fruit
any cuisine any any book in any language any religion
anything you want you can click a video on YouTube
you will get a spiritual teaching from that tradition you
want to learn a language you can literally learn 50
000 different languages just type it into YouTube or Hugo
and you'll get it that's what's going to happen a
thousand years so why resist that why don't we Embrace
that and just work towards it because if you resist
it you're just resisting the inevitable you're fighting against Evolution
basically the liberal mind is more open to science facts
and rationality now again if you're a conservative you might
say well Leo that's not fair you're being biased because
you're trying to claim liberalism as scientific and what conservativism
is not scientific but this isn't true because sometimes conservatives
Advocate things that are more scientific than liberals look we're
generalizing here also you have to understand that conservative and
liberal are very relative so for example in America many
conservatives are somewhat scientific and open to rationality but in
a lot of other parts of the world and throughout
human history they have not been and if you look
at American history conservatives have actually generally been anti-science and
anti-rationality why because generally it's more associated with religion the
conservative mind can you have a conservative that's not religious
and just atheist and secular yes you can but most
right-wingers are religious and the more right-wing they are the
more fundamentalists they tend to be and the more you
go back into human history or you go around the
world in less developed parts of the world like in
the Middle East and so forth all right-wingers in the
Middle East are religious and many of them deny science
and rationality and scientific facts because it doesn't suit their
religion why because they're defending that system that status quo
of religion now of course conservatives evolve conservatives don't stay
still the conservatives in America are much more devolved than
the conservatives in Iran or in Afghanistan and in a
thousand years there will still be conservatives but they will
be much more involved than even today's liberals the conservatives
for example in the UK are much more Progressive than
the conservatives of um of America for example in the
UK no conservative is interested in defending gun rights or
allowing people to have guns no conservative is interested in
really dismantling the free health care System the National Health
Care system that they have because they've Advanced beyond that
so you have to understand how this really works is
that whatever you consider conservative to be it's always evolving
so in the future all conservatives will be open to
science and rationality some of them are today but many
around the world are not now sometimes liberals can take
it too far with post-modernism and stuff to the point
where they see post-modernism these things sometimes work in very
kind of like cyclical ways where first there's a trend
of of denying science because of because you're so religious
then there's a trend of accepting science because you now
reject religion and then there's another new wave of sort
of science criticism that comes after you've accepted science and
rationality where you realize science and rationality has limits and
you want to transcend those limits and go trans-rational you
want to go transhuman you want to go beyond science
you want to go more into mysticism and then your
critical of science for those reasons as I have been
in some of my past episodes so you have to
be careful about this this notion that I I've called
it in the past criticism from above or criticism from
below you can criticize science From Below or from above
likewise you can criticize liberals From Below or from above
I'll have an episode about that in the future just
about that concept of below and above all right moving
on um the liberal mind is more open to relativism
it's better at understanding relativity if you want to understand
what that is it's a very deep topic that I
have a lot to say about that I can't cover
here I have an episode called understanding relativism part one
go check that out and I'll have a part two
coming soon as well so uh basically what I mean
by relativism and relativity is that the conservative mind tends
to see the world from its own absolutist perspective it
tends to take its own perspective as the absolute best
truest rightest one it's like Christianity is the one true
religion or Islam is the one true religion that's absolutism
and it's almost impossible to take a fundamentalist Christian or
Muslim and to convince them that no that's just a
relative perspective and you know from your perspective Christianity is
a true one from Islam's perspective Islam is a true
one and then which one is actually true well there
isn't a true one it's just relative the conservative mind
cannot accept that generally speaking uh the liberal mind is
much better at accepting that although the issue of Relativity
is so profound so metaphysically profound and radical that even
the most radical marxists and post-moderns and progressives do not
understand the full implications of relativism and they can also
distort it and abuse it so there's abuses that come
with relativism um which I I will I have discussed
and I will continue to discuss in my series about
relativism so go watch that if you're interested seriously and
some deep metaphysics and epistemology also the liberal mind is
spiritually um it views spirituality as not as Orthodox religion
not as following a set of rules but as in
a more free and open way it's more about individuality
to the liberal mind you want to customize your spirituality
to yourself this is where the new age comes in
the new age is really a mixture a hodgepodge a
Melting Pot of all sorts of different spiritual Traditions from
the East and from the west and from the Pagan
called from paganism from Shamanism from Sufism you know it's
a mixture of all this kinds of stuff and a
lot of conservatives don't like this because it's not pure
it's not orthodox but the liberal mind doesn't want Orthodox
it wants to sample the liberal mind looks at spirituality
like a buffet I'm going into a buffet in Vegas
and I get to sample a little bit of everything
and that's the ideal and then I get to customize
it to me the conservative mind says no no that
that's dangerous that's crazy what do you mean customize it
to you you can't just go in there and kind
of willy-nilly pick and choose parts of the Bible or
parts of the Quran and mix them together and do
whatever you want that's that's like you're violating God's Commandments
you're just picking and choosing you're not sticking to the
true words of Jesus or Muhammad what are you doing
you're just you're just inventing whatever kind of nonsense your
ego you know wants and you're building a spiritual ego
around it and you're not being disciplined about anything and
you're just one of these flaky hippie new agers well
that's a different perspective on religion the liberal mind is
more secular humanist it values separation of church and state
it's more bohemian go look up the definition of bohemian
it's a good word the liberal mind values the liberal
arts values novel forms of education and abstract art the
liberal mind is more open to mind expanding and altering
drugs and intoxicants that loosen you up for example in
most of the Middle East much of the Middle East
alcohol is outlawed because it's not allowed in Islam and
old school Christianity and just in generally very old school
religious fundamentalists generally pooh-poo all intoxicants they're very anti-intoxicants many
Buddhists are also against mind expanding drugs psychedelics and intoxicants
why because they want to be very buttoned up that's
their approach the conservative Orthodox approach is to be buttoned
up and not allow any kind of intoxicants to loosen
up your mind literally the conservative mind is afraid of
being loosened up and expanded because it's dangerous to loosen
your mind who knows what will happen if you loosen
your mind too much maybe you'll get the idea to
kill your children if you loosen your mind too much
maybe you'll get the idea to experiment with sexual with
homosexuality or with bestiality maybe if you lose lose in
your mind too much too much you'll lose your mind
and go insane or kill your neighbor or maybe you'll
just discover some ugly truths about yourself that you've been
hiding and repressing and denying maybe you've been denying that
you have homosexual urges and now you're going to have
to admit that actually you have those urges and that
you're lying to yourself you see so loosening up the
mind is dangerous but also you know as liberals we
love to loosen up our minds with psychedelics and weed
and mind expanding drugs we like to go party and
have fun and um open ourselves to new experiences and
New Perspectives ultimately these drugs open your mind to radical
New Perspectives that are beyond anything you can imagine with
the normal human mind the only thing that a Buddhist
or a Christian could imagine but there's a trade-off there
will you be able to handle it I've talked about
that in many of my psychedelic videos go check those
out generally speaking highly liberal minds are a smaller percentage
of the population most of the world is pretty conservative
why is that because most of the world at this
point in our evolution is just struggling to survive most
people are kind of down to earth people they work
with their hands they do basic jobs they're not very
college educated there's fewer people who are college educated than
those who are not and this becomes truer and truer
the more liberal you become people who are extremely Progressive
very very liberal they represent a much smaller percentage of
the population and that's something that many progressives and liberals
extreme liberals um struggle to to to cope with because
they think that the rest of society is like them
the rest of the world is like them they are
not you represent the top 10 or 5 or maybe
even one percent of Minds on this planet because you
happen to have been so lucky and fortunate to have
been born in a Western democracy you could go to
a university your parents were able to pay for you
they didn't abuse you they didn't rape you they didn't
molest you uh they were they were loving decent parents
they educated you properly you had good role models and
mentors in University and they educated you um in the
right ways to see in multiple perspectives and therefore you're
a very Advanced intelligent mind you've studied history you've traveled
around the world you've interacted with many different kinds of
cultures and people and cuisines this is rare most humans
do not have the money to fly around the world
they can't even afford a 500 ticket to Europe or
to Asia because they're so poor and because they don't
have time to travel around on vacation they got to
work to pay for their children just to get food
that's the reality for most people so um one of
the things that many one of the things that progressives
struggle with is that they're very frustrated because they want
to win elections and they they keep losing elections and
they keep wondering like well why you know we have
these great Progressive ideas and visions of How Great Society
can be why isn't everybody else voting like are they
stupid uh and the answer isn't so much that they're
stupid it's just that most people aren't educated and aren't
developed enough to get to the point where they can
even have the luxury to care about these things you
care about you have some vision of how society and
econ and the economy will be 100 years from now
this socialist Utopia most people are just worried about how
to pay their uh you know their rent this month
they don't got time to be thinking about socialist Utopias
and Promises of a future and a healthy Earth environment
and all all humans coming together into one Global race
and fighting off feeling like they don't have any that's
not real for uh for most people on the planet
you see that's not real that's fantasy for most people
for most people what's real is tomorrow I gotta go
into a factory I gotta wake up early I gotta
work at the factory for 10 hours then I gotta
come back home and take care of my children and
then I gotta repeat that again the next day that's
most people on this planet so their mind literally doesn't
have the opportunity to read the books you read to
watch the Youtube videos and podcasts that you've been watching
for years to go to university lectures and to to
talk to high-minded intellectuals about philosophy and art and no
there's no room for this you work in a [
__ ] Factory or you starve and when your life
is like that it robs you of even the impulse
or desire to go out there to expand your mind
with psychedelics and with traveling around the world and tasting
different Cuisines you lose even your desire to do that
because what's the point if I'm just gonna have to
come back and work at my factory job which I
have to work for 40 years how am I going
to keep doing that knowing that there's all this stuff
out there I want to [ __ ] kill myself
this is serious stuff it's no joke the liberal mind
is more optimistic has a more optimistic view of human
nature It generally sees Humanity's Oneness and our ability to
come together and to be peaceful and to coexist and
to empathize with each other and to tolerate each other
and to live together in harmony this is sort of
the liberal ideal whereas a conservative mind tends to be
more realistic and pessimistic about that and says well that's
a nice that's a nice ideal but in practice humans
are pretty vicious we're tribal we don't really get along
many times we fight with each other so we got
to be careful and protective the liberal mind tends to
want to do away with classes casts and hierarchies to
equalize everyone putting everyone on the same level the liberal
mind wants every voice to be heard isn't it a
shame that some voices are not heard in society just
because they haven't been given power or because they've been
picked on and marginalized so the liberal mind wants to
bring forth and honor everyone's individual voice and the liberal
mind values highly self-expression see the conservative mind wants more
about uh is more about suppressing self-expression in order to
fit in with the established tradition whereas the liberal mind
is more about no I want to express myself my
individuality so like if I'm a Christian in a Catholic
Church Orthodox Catholic Church I'm not really allowed to express
my own spirituality and be spiritually quirky and say things
that are not written in the Bible I have to
stick just to the Bible but that can feel very
constraining you see the liberal mind feels that government must
be careful not to trample on the individuality of its
citizens so that each citizen gets to self-express you know
the problem with being a Nazi in a certain sense
it's not just the killing and the racism and all
that stuff and the war the problem with being a
Nazi is that when you're a Nazi you're just like
every other Nazi you're not original you're not thinking new
thoughts you're just following Hitler following some leader who tells
you how to dress how to salute and all this
kind of stuff what to you know what to eat
and and what to say and what to believe then
you just follow that to the liberal mind this is
not appealing it's way too monotonous and regimented the liberal
mind is more accepting of the costs of Freedom now
today in American politics this has kind of turned upside
down where a lot of Liberals are actually calling for
protection and are willing to sacrifice freedom of speech for
example in order to have more safe social spaces and
so forth but generally speaking um it's the liberal mind
that wants to be free to do whatever to believe
whatever to have sex with whoever to take whatever drugs
to believe whatever ideas and um and that comes with
costs and generally the liberal is adventurous enough to throw
caution to the wind and to accept those costs but
again a lot of Liberals are just mild liberals you
have to understand they're not radical liberals radical Liberals are
actually quite rare and one of the reasons that is
because it's dangerous to be a radical liberal radical liberals
either get killed uh by their own tribe uh or
radical liberals um end up just killing themselves either by
Suicide or by mental illness and instability or just by
being Reckless and doing something uh you know foolish the
liberal mind is more revolutionary more willing to throw established
structures to overthrow established structures in the name of equality
the liberal mind would rather have equality the conservative mind
would rather have um tradition and structure over equality so
it's a matter of priority to the liberal mind the
greatest threat is exploitation and bullying of the Weak by
the strong unjustified inequality so the liberal mind has a
great sensitivity to Injustice abuse corruption and unfair treatment the
liberal mind is more focused on seeing all the problems
of Institutions and all the ways to improve them and
the conservative mind sort of does the inverse of that
the liberal mind is more sexually open secure free and
willing to experiment and explore with sexuality it does not
demonize or Shame about sex liberals tend to be comfortable
with sex workers they generally want to legalize prostitution they're
comfortable with all sorts of alternative kinds of weird sex
and um conservatives try to repress all that stuff even
though many conservatives actually want and have cravings but they
don't allow themselves to act on those Cravings or if
they do they hide it and they feel ashamed and
guilty about it because they perceive it as Sin whereas
to the liberal mind there is no such thing as
sexual sin as long as it's between two consenting adults
it's not a sin the liberal has a more of
a sort of a pagan attitude towards sex rather than
the Orthodox Christian attitude towards sex and finally on this
list of features the liberal mind is unconcerned about moral
Decay and degradation it finds traditional Norms too restrictive of
individual artistic expression whereas the the conservative mind is very
concerned about moral Decay and degradation such that when the
liberal hears the conservative complaining about moral Decay and degradation
the liberal is almost like laughing because it's like dude
like culture is always changing morality is always changing morality
is relative so don't think of it as decay it's
just it's always evolving and changing so what are you
worried about don't be so uptight that's the liberal approach
so here's another way to look at the liberal Outlook
just very kind of big picture the big picture of
liberalism is like this Make Love Not War mankind is
capable of empathy love and tolerance in fact this is
our truest and highest nature let's stop being selfish and
brutal let's stop being animals and chimps let's start being
loving peaceful and intelligent about how we conduct our civilization
violence oppression competition and war is ultimately unwise and unintelligent
resources for war are giant waste and should be funneled
into the Improvement of the economic conditions of the entire
planet let's do away with all the boundaries all the
walls all the divisions we don't need them if we
can just learn to coexist this will be a win-win
scenario for everybody war and conflict and demonization and bullying
each other this is a net loss for everybody what
comes around goes around because we're all interconnected and Karma
will come back to haunt you even if you win
some war or some bullying contest or you end up
trolling somebody successful successfully this is going to come back
to haunt you you're going to regret this so let's
wise up and start to work peacefully together towards a
common goal as one species let's give everybody the basics
they need to survive uplift everyone so we can transcend
our brutish animalistic nature let's give people access to a
guaranteed job guaranteed Health Care guaranteed education and all of
these kinds of basic guaranteed housing so that nobody is
born or suffering from a situation where they are deprived
and are not able to make the most of their
potential in the end what we want is we want
to enable everybody who wants to work at it and
is motivated to to work towards His Highest Potential and
then of course there's going to be some people who
are lazy and don't want to work and they don't
have a very high idea of potential for themselves that's
fine those people will just kind of coast along but
in general we're not going to have this kind of
situation where somebody wants to go to university but then
they can't because their parents can't pay for it or
somebody wants to um you know start a business but
they can't because they're crippled by debt from you know
credit cards because they've been exploited there or something or
somebody um wants to you know has a great idea
for an invention but then they can't build that invention
because uh they can't afford to pay for their health
care and they they are sick and then they die
this is not an efficient system surely you can agree
as a conservative this is not an efficient system and
not only that but that in the future all of
this will be fixed it's just a question of how
soon we do it and obviously the sooner we do
it the better it's going to be let's work towards
equality before the law let's ensure that our laws are
uncorrupted and they treat everybody equally black brown Asian man
woman child adult everybody equally we treat everybody with respect
everybody with dignity even the criminals even the offenders we
treat everybody with compassion we try to help everybody try
to redeem everybody who can be redeemed some people can't
be redeemed but most people can and we will ensure
that we do the most we can towards that the
planet is globalizing no matter what and there's no stopping
this therefore what we need is a robust pluralism we
need A system that will allow the cooperation and inter-working
together of all the different cultures and perspectives and religions
and World Views everybody's voice should have the ability to
be heard as long as it's not undermining the entire
system so there will be some people who will be
anti-pluralist and those voices need to be silenced the reason
those voices need to be silenced is because if they're
not then they're going to try to monopolize and take
over and Destroy pluralism so we need we need a
sort of an environment where all perspectives are allowed as
long as your perspective is not a perspective that wants
to destroy all the other perspectives if that's your perspective
then that is not allowed in the same way that
if you go into a grocery store you're allowed to
be there anyone's allowed to be in a grocery store
but if you go to a grocery store with a
gun and you want to kill everybody there that is
not allowed obviously many elements of our social hierarchy are
grossly unfair corrupt and based purely on self-interest and bias
let's create a genuine meritocracy we will flatten the hierarchy
somewhat we will maintain the hierarchy as necessary so that
there's function we don't want to just completely remove the
hierarchy there's going to be some hierarchy but the hierarchy
we're gonna we're gonna purify it such that it's only
meritocracy if someone's at the top of a hierarchy we
need to make sure that the only way they can
rise up that hierarchy is if they truly deserve it
that means they work the hardest they have the best
ideas they're the most intelligent um the most charismatic or
whatever other qualities they need to have and they're not
just there because their daddy put them there or because
of tradition or because you know your daddy went to
Harvard so you get to go to Harvard no let's
ensure that the the best people go to Harvard and
that you you can't pay your way to get into
Harvard out with the old in with the new that's
our motto old systems and institutions are incapable of dealing
with modern problems and Technology our ancestors created some great
stuff we won't deny that the constitution has some good
stuff the Bible has some good ideas and so forth
however this was hundreds of years ago and technology is
advancing very rapidly and it's accelerating even more so we
need a very responsive set of systems that are adapting
so we cannot stick with just the old we need
to recognize that Society is going to evolve anyway so
why not push it along why waste energy resisting like
a stubborn mule let's make this happen let's make this
our life purpose let's all contribute to this in our
unique way whatever that is if you want to do
it through government do with regardless you want to do
it through engineering do it through engineering if you want
to do it through ART do it through ART everyone
has a role to play in this uh ultimate objective
of engineering a Utopia that's ultimately what we want don't
we want to live in a Utopia let's engineer it
let's do it after all look it's not like we're
not doing it anyways since the beginning of human civilization
since the ancient Egyptians every civilization whether they admitted it
or not explicitly they have all been in the business
of engineering Utopia because I mean what else do you
want if you're living in a civilization or in a
community which you are you have no other real choice
about it you might as well make it the best
possible right why would you want anything less so let's
make it the best possible now of course are we
ever going to achieve Utopia realistically no but we're working
towards a more perfect union as they say we're going
to do our best we're gonna aim towards the sky
and see how far we can get and even if
we fall way short of that we're still gonna just
by aiming so high we're still going to get to
a great place we don't need perfect Utopia we can
but we can fix many of these problems and we
can make civilization a lot better than it's been and
the the reason we know we can do that is
just look through history look at how much better Society
is today than it was 2000 years ago or even
a hundred years ago we're making amazing progress let's keep
doing that let's not put our foot on the brakes
let's not be pessimistic we can do this ultimately the
Longview picture of mankind is extremely positive despite all the
petty [ __ ] that we're going through right now
all this partisanship and some of these minor wars being
fought here and there this is all a blip on
the radar screen towards our progress towards incredible things think
about the kind of Technology we're going to have in
a thousand years flying cars and nuclear fusion free energy
for everybody like it's going to be incredible what we
can do if we just work together and the only
enemy is really ourselves that's all we got to realize
we're getting in our own way let's stop getting in
our own way and the number one thing we need
to do to overcome that is opening our minds we
need to open our minds to the difference in perspective
that different people have because if we can't understand all
the different perspectives we can't unify them and we can't
live peacefully and then we're going to be working against
each other there's going to be too much friction lack
of openness and understanding creates friction which is the resultant
war and exploitation and slavery and genocide and bigotry and
racism and all this kinds of stuff that's that's my
best uh Steel Man of the liberal worldview here's a
list of liberal values progress Innovation creativity compassion empathy tolerance
open-mindedness self-expression artistic expression respect for individuality Freedom questioning Authority
equality fairness peace kindness diversity rationality secularism science technology free
sex environmentalism love defending the weak secular education femininity Mercy
exploring diverse perspectives inclusion worldliness empowering minorities correcting unjust social
systems and education for its own sake here's a list
of characteristics of the liberal personality the liberal personality is
eccentric sensitive individualistic artistic idealistic utopian pie and Sky Carefree
free-spirited open-minded open to experience adventurous tolerant flexible accepting of
everyone permissive lenient unpredictable impulsive spontaneous loose creative imaginative curious
Desiring for novel experiences and diversity complex nuanced abstract worldly
intuitive emotionally connected feminine quirky transgressive rebellious playful humorous and
the jester or the Joker archetype here's a little bit
more about how to appreciate the liberal worldview imagine how
powerful mankind could be if we all started to act
like adults with Consciousness wisdom and compassion our number one
priority should be to eliminate all conflict and War on
this planet because right now we are wasting tens of
trillions of dollars on War on the military-industrial complex on
bombs on military bases just think about the fuel we
waste scrambling our Jets on training exercises or um piloting
our ships into Foreign Waters this this wastes billions of
gallons of fuel every year for what just patrolling our
borders against our brothers and sisters what are we doing
these trillions of dollars need to be poured into Education
Health Care getting people jobs building infrastructure roads internet access
satellite technology space exploration this is where our money and
resources should be going what mankind is doing right now
is just downright stupid but also it's necessary for the
time being but if we wise up we can change
that and we can funnel those trillions into creating a
really great society right rather than fighting each other there
are fundamentally enough resources on this planet for everybody there's
enough energy we don't have a shortage of sunlight or
wind or geothermal power or nuclear power or fusion power
we have all these things there's enough steel and wood
and granite and diamonds and gold on this planet for
everybody and even if there aren't we can fly to
the moon or to Mars to mine for more imagine
for a moment how an advanced alien civilization would conduct
themselves a civilization that's way more intelligent how would they
live on their Planet obviously they would not be at
war with each other that's not intelligent because war is
a lose-lose situation for everybody and if they were at
War they would have killed themselves a long time ago
with nuclear weapons or Fusion weapons or laser weapons or
anti-matter weapons or something even worse so obviously they figured
out how to coexist peacefully with themselves and with their
neighbors and to do that they need more understanding more
openness more compassion higher developments in Morality more equality more
fairness more love they need to be less tribal and
less authoritarian do you really think that some Advanced alien
civilization is exploiting some minority group within their species no
obviously they aren't obviously they figured out how to equalize
it and make it fair do you think they have
corrupt corporations and governments that are exploiting the innocent people
scamming them and enslaving them in capitalistic wage slavery obviously
not they've solved these problems so obviously if they could
do it we could do it our greatest challenges cannot
be solved through dumb Brute Force they have to be
solved through intelligence we have to start to recognize our
inherent Oneness and act in alignment with that all hold
ons Within our planetary system should be protected and honored
go check out my episode called what are hold ons
for more on that all the basics of a good
life should be provided to to everyone so that no
one is born lacking why are we allowing some children
on this planet to be born into horrible miserable conditions
into war zones into abusive families and to into poverty
into racist environments why are we allowing this this is
unconscionable and obviously an advanced alien civilization would not tolerate
such inequality eliminating the corruption in our systems of which
there is plenty to go around and everyone is to
blame for this corruption requires upgrading all of our systems
and processes obviously our systems and processes cannot stay the
same and this corruption has to go and we need
a world government because we need a global coordination effort
just to survive to deal with external enemies and threats
that might come from Aliens or whoever else to deal
with global pandemics and viruses to deal with climate change
to deal with various environmental disasters like super volcanoes Supernova
blasts Sun you know Rays radiation you know solar radiation
waves um asteroids hitting us from outside all of these
things require Global coordination Global governance but this Global governments
cannot be such that it it stifles and oppresses all
the local governments it needs to also be sensitive to
the local governments which is what I meant by all
the whole Lawns on the planet need to be protected
which includes local governments local States local cultures local languages
they all need to be cared for so that we
don't just turn into one purely homogeneous you know oppressive
authoritarian World System that's not what's being advocated so that's
a little vision for you of sort of the best
of the best of the liberal worldview what are some
of the top liberal fears it's this environmental destruction confrontation
violence the status quo or the establishment not solving our
problems fast enough not evolving fast enough regression into old
ways and systems that are Antiquated and brutal getting stuck
in Petty parochial squabbles authoritarianism fascism bigotry stifling of self-expression
monotony suffocating discipline and rules lack of empathy cruelty shutting
down diversity of perspectives selfishness and exploitation of the weak
what are some liberal blind spots here are a few
of the biggest ones the liberal mind tends to overlook
the wisdom of the current existing system in favor of
some idealistic utopian unproven scheme there is a deep intelligence
for example to capitalism there is a deep intelligence to
organize religion there is a deep intelligence to the way
that many large corporations are run there is a deep
intelligence to Wall Street a lot of liberals and progressives
especially cannot fathom this they think they are more intelligent
than these systems which makes them very foolish and stupid
these systems do have corruption and they do have problems
and eventually they will all be replaced and upgraded however
the path towards doing that requires first understanding why these
systems exist and why they work as well as they
do why they're sustainable only when you have a deep
appreciation understanding of these systems can you start to begin
to Tinker with them at the edges and perhaps make
some progress otherwise you're gonna create new systems out of
whole cloth and they're gonna fall flat on their face
so this is perhaps the biggest blind spot the other
one is that the liberal mind fails to recognize the
selfish and brutal aspects of life it tends to it
tends to believe that these aspects of Life are not
important they're not they're not serious or that just it
doesn't realize that most people are living in such brutal
survival conditions that where they they just are forced to
be selfish they don't have the luxury of being so
open and so free and so loving and compassionate and
non-tribalistic most people have to survive inside their little tribe
the liberal mind fails to address uh the egos down
to earth survival needs what most humans on this planet
need are not some sort of wacky new art or
some sort of new age spirituality or non-duality or psychedelics
or any of this kind of fun fluffy stuff or
even socialism what most people need is um they just
need they just need a decent job that fits their
level of intelligence and capability and they need uh just
uh some some basic support structures a church they can
go to you know a school they can go to
um some basic Health Care Systems it just need some
very basic stuff like this and um and these people
do not need their their whole culture and tradition radically
transformed and [ __ ] with they need it preserved
because they're not ready for sort of crazy you know
Progressive culture the liberal mind overestimates people's level of development
and education you have to understand that the majority of
humans on this planet Are as dumb as [ __
] animals that's the reality and their levels of development
are much lower than you think they are and in
fact your level of development is much lower than you
think it is don't assume that most people are ready
for Progressive ideas they aren't if they were they'd be
Progressive that's why you lose life another liberal blind spot
is a that many of the changes that liberals want
to make they just become unsustainable and lead to Eco
backlash what happens when you try to develop or to
push development on people who are not ready for it
or societies that are not ready for it is that
you push them you push them you push them and
eventually they just get fed up with it and they
um they get angry at you they they bite the
hand that feeds them so when you're when you're feeding
for example I've actually posted videos of this on my
blog in the past I posted a video of of
a guy whose whole thing on YouTube is he rescues
like feral abandoned kittens and puppies and stuff and then
he rehabilitates them these are kittens for example their mother
died or they were abused they come from some abused
household they didn't get enough food or water or anything
so he rescues them kind of on the brink of
death they're in very bad condition such that when he
picks them up he has to pick them up with
gloves thick gloves on because they they claw and bite
they're like super aggressive it's like it's like a [
__ ] rabid animal this little kitten it's terrified it's
angry um and this guy is not threatening at all
but the kitten is just coming from a place where
it's on the brink of death he rescues it and
then over a period of of a month he rehabilitates
this kitten and the way he does that is just
by like gently petting it gently giving it food he
he literally feeds little every little bit of food to
the kid he feeds from his own hands and he
does this and the kidnap first the kitten bites them
and scratches them and resists and is afraid and hisses
at him right over time he does this slowly over
weeks and then the kitten calms down and then it
takes some weeks just to get the kitten to the
point where he can pet the kitten so then he
starts petting the kid and he starts watching TV with
a kid he starts sleeping with the kitten do those
and then a month later the kitten is it's not
fully rehabilitated it's a little bit kind of like touchy
uh and kind of frisky but um it works it's
workable that kitten will be okay so see that's the
approach that is really needed and that's the approach that
many liberals and progressives don't know how to do because
they just want to crank the gas they want to
just put pedal to the metal and they just think
well if there's a lot of people suffering the best
way to help them is just to press on the
accelerator as fast as we can go full speed 100
miles an hour ahead and just start changing everything and
then fix all the problems as fast as we can
and that's going to do it and if you're opposed
to that then you're our enemy this is um this
is not intelligent this is not how human development works
it's not how social or national development works so a
lot of this has to do with timing just timing
and like um you know if you had a child
and you started to try to force the child to
learn faster and more and and bigger and read more
calculus books right but the child is too young for
calculus and you try to push it on them you're
going to traumatize them and you're going to make him
hate you you have to take the child slowly through
12 years of of mathematics to get him to the
point where he can pick up a calculus textbook and
even then it's difficult so this is something that liberals
have a pretty big blind spot in and in order
to fix that blind spot the most important thing is
watch my previous episode understanding the concern of mine where
I explain to you why conservatives are the way that
they are and why you're uh your attempts to change
them are not going to work here's some points on
what the liberal mind struggles with the liberal mind struggles
with staying grounded admitting to itself that its own ideals
are not going to work in the real world we
liberals love to be so idealistic and utopian but then
the reality is that most of our ideas there are
too impractical to actually work another area where liberal mind
struggles is just being practical dutiful and doing the nuts
and bolts of the work a lot of Liberals are
very artistic and they have a lot of ideas and
a lot of interesting political ideas maybe Marxist social ideas
but then when it comes down to like the brass
tacks you're not able to actually execute you're not able
to go and canvas and get the right people politically
engaged to actually go out and vote or even if
they do vote that voting alone is not enough you
have to build organizations you have to build support systems
you have to like it's a whole a lot of
just like very mundane technical work has to be done
to govern and to change society and to build new
systems you can't just sit around smoking weed and doing
Pie in the Sky Marxist philosophy that's not going to
change the world another area where the liver mind struggles
is with integrating less developed more hateful insecure people it
really struggles with this bigots racist homophobes transphobes fascists Nazis
bullies and tyrants the liberal mind simply cannot understand these
perspectives which makes the the liberal mind demonize and attack
all these perspectives and when you do that it's the
same thing as taking that little kitten who's terrified and
you know uh lashing out at you and you just
you just try to grab it and you just try
to manipulate that kitten this is only going to make
the thing worse and then you start to hate and
demonize this kitten for not reacting to you in a
sweet manner the way that you expect well you're a
fool because you understand where that kitten came from all
these bigots racist homophobes transphobes fascist Nazis these are just
like that kitten these are not evil people these are
just people who have been through very difficult survival situations
that's made them very aggressive and closed-minded and defensive and
insecure and so if you want to rehabilitate them that
is some serious work that requires you to get a
much higher meta understanding of the human mind which I
can help you with uh the next uh struggling point
is liberals struggle to understand how backwards and ignorant most
of mankind is just the depths of Mankind's ignorance Global
ignorance is so profound it's so profound no liberal understands
this I can help you understand this in fact in
the future I'll have a whole episode understanding ignorance we
will talk about that but if you've been following my
work you know I've already done an implicit job pretty
good job implicitly of explaining this stuff to you you
should already know how deeply ignorant you are and most
of mankind is uh the other struggling point is the
liberal mind struggles to integrate materialism capitalism and raw survival
corporations these just tend to be demon eyes and kind
of like dismissed as as simple problems these are not
simple but these are extremely delicate nuanced complex hairy problems
that cannot just be dismissed or glossed over in the
way that many marxists try to do and also lastly
the liberal mind struggles with integrating unfairness and inequality solve
on fairness and inequality you have to really deeply understand
the source of unfairness and inequality which most progressives do
not understand all right let's go like I did in
the in the other episode let's go through how a
liberal would view certain issues within politics so I'm not
necessarily going to be stating my actual true perspective I'm
just going to be stating a Steel Man of the
liberal leftist Progressive view of some of these issues like
feminism religion immigration we're going to go through that okay
so first feminism what is the liberal perspective the liberal
perspective on feminism is that um yeah it's true that
in the past strongman leaders were probably necessary when we
were more chip-like in the way that we LED our
tribes and people um but this sort of hyper masculine
approach to leadership this is becoming way outdated and the
reality is that women have a lot to contribute to
society and to government and to our politics but not
just that it's not just women it's femininity um our
Human Society for thousands of years has been way over
skewed and over indexed as they say on masculinity that
masculine approach leads to a lot of War a lot
of violence and stuff like that masculinity is more aggressive
and more brute in the way that it handles its
problems we're getting to the point where we're evolving beyond
that and femininity is actually something that every masculine person
needs to integrate um and also femininity is a very
beautiful thing so you as a masculine man you like
femininity and you're women um but it's not just that
it doesn't just stop there it's not just about having
sex with the feminine it's it's also about recognizing the
the important features of the feminine that you can integrate
into yourself to become a more whole human being and
feminism offers that now there are some excesses to feminism
if feminists start to demonize the masculine that becomes a
problem but really the healthy forms of feminism are uh
can be valuable even for men to integrate um to
integrate the feminine the masculine because that's when you're going
to be at your spiritually holist and uh and strongest
and you're going to feel better about yourself and you're
also actually going to be able to relate better to
women a lot of Highly masculine men have problems relating
to women simply because they don't know how to be
emotional how to be spontaneous how to deal with feminine
energy so incorporating that more into yourself will actually make
you more secure this sort of like Macho attitude that
many masculine men aspire to and think is the ideal
it's not the ideal this is actually an immature form
of masculinity true masculinity is secure enough to also incorporate
the feminine in a paradoxical sense all right next issue
is transgenderism the liberal perspective look the reality is that
gender is a is very much a mentally constructed thing
it's not give God given that there's two genders um
some plants and fungi have many different genders Beyond two
some fungi have hundreds and thousands of genders um all
throughout the animal kingdom gender Norms very you know the
male seahorse carries the young and gives birth for example
um people are born with different brains different genetics different
metabolisms different numbers of chromosomes even so all this stuff
is highly variable there there's no um uh there's nobody
that says what your gender should really be gender open
your mind to the possibility that gender is much more
fluid than you've ever thought it to be even though
traditionally there was just two genders and we had very
strict masculine feminine roles in today's society we no longer
need those simplistic categories and we should expand our mind
and allow people to experiment with their with their gender
in in in safe ways there are some going to
be some safeguards you're not just gonna let anybody do
anything they want there's safeguards for children there's going to
be safeguards for when you can use hormones and when
you can get surgery you have to wait a certain
age get certain you know um medical recommendations and agreements
and and authorizations and then if you want you can
you can transition and the reality is that 95 percent
of transgender folk who go through transitioning seem to have
a positive results and they don't regret their transition there's
only about a five percent regret rate so that's a
pretty good pretty good rate as far as surgeries and
uh Medical Treatments go so um uh we need to
be open to experimenting with the stuff and you know
in the future in the future humans are going to
be experimenting with mixing different kinds of DNA eventually you're
probably going to have humans that are half [ __
] human half cat or half dog or a mixture
of all sorts of weird stuff and that's literally coming
so you might as well metaphysically epistemically prepare yourself for
that um don't see it as a bad thing see
the see the good in it don't be afraid of
it next issue is religion the liberal perspective on religion
the problem with religion is that it's so structured and
so stifling really what we need to be talking about
is not religion but spirituality religion is just a subset
of spirituality spirituality can include religion or it can include
a new age it can include Orthodox versions of spirituality
or unorthodox versions of spirituality and the reality is that
look people need um as a spiritual teacher I can
tell you one of my biggest lessons from studying all
this spiritual stuff for years is is that people are
very unique spiritually people are born at different levels of
consciousness they have different reactions to psychedelics they have different
reactions to meditation techniques or to breathing techniques or other
medical I mean other spiritual practices so really you have
to customize your religion so to speak your spirituality to
yourself what will work for you a cookie cutter approach
the way that many Christians or Muslims approach Christian approach
religion simply doesn't work for most people and um as
a liberal it's not that we want to do away
with religion in fact we value spirituality a lot uh
as a liberal we want to open spirituality to be
effective to be more than just ideology and dogma and
stuff that you recite but don't experience the focus of
spirituality and religion should be on helping people to experience
God to experience mystical States and expand their consciousness and
this is going to include psychedelics meditation a mixture of
all sorts of different traditions and there's beautiful stuff within
all religions and so what we need to do is
we need to create sort of a a religious mixing
pot take the best from all the religions there's also
some crap in all the religions and all spiritual teachers
are to some degree full of [ __ ] including
myself so you have to separate the signal from the
noise throw away the noise amplify the signal and um
and don't worry about us losing connection to God through
this process we will be more Godly and more spiritual
uh and more jesus-like than we've ever been in the
past through following the Ten Commandments or any kind of
Orthodox practices right next issue is gay rights and gay
marriage uh well just like with transgenderism you know when
it comes to to sexuality the reality is that for
the last couple thousand years most major civilizations on this
planet have had very repressive attitudes towards sex and this
is dysfunctional because sex is one of your most uh
potent motivating drivers in life you know this you know
how horny you are and how um How Deeply you
crave sex and how it drives you crazy and you
can't you can't really help yourself so the reality is
is that this attitude of trying to control sex through
repression through denying it through not teaching it not talking
about it through demonizing it through putting all sorts of
laws against it this it it doesn't work it doesn't
work it's like trying to ban alcohol it doesn't work
so the reality is is that um we need to
help everybody to be comfortable sexually with however they are
uh this includes gay sex and other forms of sex
and so you just need to become comfortable enough not
to be bothered by people having weird quirky Alternative forms
of sex around you uh once you're comfortable with your
sexuality you won't be threatened by the sexuality of others
and once you're comfortable with that then you'll be comfortable
and okay with gay marriage and so forth and you'll
realize that um people who have sex in different ways
than you they're not threatening you they're not threatening civilization
this is not going to lead to the end of
the world it's going to be all right um and
in fact maybe you'll discover that you have some sexual
Cravings that you've been denying and you'll feel better about
yourself once you integrate those and are able to express
those in a healthy Manner and also as we do
all this we can um we can create some sort
of infrastructure for ensuring that these Alternative forms of having
sex are are healthy and safe because when we keep
it underground we create sort of a dark market for
it and then the stuff on the dark Market is
is is dangerous uh even though it could be done
otherwise in a safe manner same same situations with psychedelic
drugs okay next issue is capitalism the liberal View capitalism
is just a stage in our Economic Development and all
of us even if you're very conservative you've you've experienced
some of the problems with capitalism capitalism even if you're
an Ardent capitalist so to speak and you're anti-socialist and
anti-marxist you can't deny that um many of your favorite
companies have exploited you your favorite Brands influencers celebrities or
the boss at work has exploited you not paid you
enough screwed you over in some business deal this kind
of stuff um and so obviously these things need to
change and you have to admit that there's structural problems
within capitalism so why don't we start thinking about what
comes next after capitalism it doesn't have to be Socialism
or Marxism or communism although we could borrow ideas from
those systems in the end it's not really about a
system it's about identifying the Corruptions and the inequalities and
problems and fixing those with whatever methods will work and
we've got to test which methods will work and which
ones won't and we can do those tests um but
clearly capitalism has not delivered on its promise of providing
for everybody equally I mean it probably never even promised
that but the reality is that we want economic fairness
isn't that what you want you want economic fairness especially
if right now you're in a position where you're not
succeeding and a lot of that could be systemic not
because you're not working hard enough maybe you work really
hard but the reality is is that under this current
system working really hard doesn't necessarily make you wealthy and
mean and then at the same time there's a lot
of people on Wall Street in in crypto and other
places that don't work at all basically or work very
little but then they become Millionaires and billionaires this is
not proper and correct and so we need to find
a system Beyond this obviously capitalism is not the end-all
be-all system so start opening your mind thinking about what
comes next with caution being aware that um you could
engineer a system that's worse than capitalism right but just
because that's the case doesn't mean we shouldn't try right
we got to try we got to try to make
something better it's inevitable next issue environmentalism if you look
at the majority of the most serious climatologists and scientists
and intellectuals on this planet and academics which will quickly
realize if you're honest with yourself is that they are
very concerned about the effects that mankind is having on
the environment and on the planet it's not just about
global warming it's also about pollution it's also about Mercury
in our rivers and in our fish supply it's also
about overfishing it's also about over over deforesting um nature
exploiting nature strip mining nature polluting the ocean with plastics
microplastics other sorts of chemicals in the water and in
the food how can you not be an environmentalist how
can you not care about these things this planet is
all we really have to sustain us and if we
keep going um and not treating this issue seriously look
maybe some of the environmentalists are a little bit overboard
maybe they're a little bit in a panic about it
too much maybe they're fear-mongering a bit but also just
consider that if they're wrong and we act on environmentalism
and we clean up the rivers we we stop overfishing
we we clean up the microplastics and the Mercury and
we stop raising the temperature and polluting what's going to
happen is that going to be a negative for us
in the end if we if we handle all those
issues sooner that's only going to be better right we're
not going to lose by doing that but if they
are right in their panic then we could really screw
ourselves in irreversible ways or ways that are going to
take thousands of years to correct and it's much easier
to address those problems early than it will be once
we're already there upper you know Upper Creek up [
__ ] creek without a paddle as they as one
of my old uh teachers in in fifth grade would
say that phrase oh [ __ ] creek without a
paddle um so we don't want to be in that
situation and all these environmental problems they contribute to world
problems they make our politics difficult they make more war
they might make more famine they make more droughts they
make a worse crop yields and um um more tribalism
um destroy species destroy environments you know Florida could be
underwater in 50 years a hurricane can come and destroy
your house in Mississippi or in South Carolina or you
know now nowadays on the TV I've even seen hurricane
warnings like even like on the west coast there's hurricane
warnings occasionally now so if you listen to the scientists
they say that this is getting worse NASA actually has
satellites that are tracking there's now now a climate change
satellite that's actually tracking precisely where all the CO2 is
coming from on the planet you can actually watch this
thing and it shows you you can see which regions
of every country generate how much CO2 we can track
this stuff we can track how much the temperature is
rising on the planet so even if it's not as
serious as they say it is it's better to treat
this problem as though it were serious than just to
pretend like it's not there and in the meantime as
we do all that we're also going to create green
jobs amazing new technology New Opportunities new investment Ventures all
that kind of stuff so good stuff will come from
this it's not just going to be all gritting our
teeth and pain this technology is inevitable we need this
technology anyways and if we delay on it some other
country will take the spot like China Take the Lead
China might take the lead or Germany might take the
lead we could be the first okay next issue immigration
I've sort of already made the case my best case
for immigration earlier where I said that look um actually
um when we enter a breed we create more beautiful
humans so that's one that's one great point for immigration
um another good uh positive for immigration is that the
more immigration you have the more of a mixing pot
the more ideas the more creativity there's actually a book
I read in the past about which analyzed um where
great ideas come from and one of the amazing facts
from that book is historians actually looked at historically where
have the greatest ideas in human civilization come from they
did not come from rural rural Villages they came from
bustling urban areas the most bustling urban areas at the
Times why is that because you had a lot of
mixing of different perspectives when you mix a lot of
different Source material it's almost like one of those art
AIS these new art AIS are amazing they create amazing
art how do they do it they take a a
billion different photos and pictures and then they combine them
together mix them up together they have a lot of
Base Source material that allows them to be very creative
and create a lot of cool stuff that's kind of
how it works if you're sitting alone in your you
know your country house you have no one to be
creative with and you're going to have a lot less
innovation whereas if we allow immigration our Cuisine will become
richer our entertainment industry our music industry will become richer
our education system will ultimately become richer our media will
become richer because we have a more diverse set of
perspectives they're all going to intermingle and intermix and from
that a lot of new innovation will come new technology
new patents new inventions this is one of the strengths
of America that I think conservatives underestimate a lot of
conservative streaming is like no America is degrading because more
and more immigrants are moving here no it's actually the
opposite of all this the reason America is so powerful
so Innovative we have the most patents we have the
best research universities we have some of the best culture
the most influential culture um some of the best films
the best music you know hip-hop rap all this kind
of stuff like this is all Multicultural stuff amazing cuisine
some of the best restaurants in the world are in
America because we're a Melting Pot this is good this
is what you want this is actually a strength not
a weakness so look at the positive make sure you
don't overlook the positives of this immigration stuff now should
there be some controls and limits and stuff yeah of
course we don't want to just open the Border entirely
it has to be done in a sustainable logical reasonable
legal framework it needs to be done in a way
that doesn't completely freak people out um obviously you don't
have a bunch of illegals running around and so forth
um but also understand that a lot of the the
work that these immigrants do no Americans want to do
it and that America in a sense runs on immigrants
immigrants clean all your toilets and make all your beds
and hotels handle your your lawn work and this kind
of stuff so immigration is a win-win it's a win
for us and it's a win for them because people
are really suffering in these poor countries and look you
don't have to be afraid America is a huge country
there's so much land so many resources here you don't
need to worry like if we were a tiny island
nation like maybe Taiwan or Japan or something like that
you might worry about lack of resources but America has
so much land so many resources you know we could
take in millions of immigrants and you're basically not even
going to feel it so stop being paranoid about that
and the last issue is punishment of criminals the purposing
here's the liberal perspective the purpose of punishing of criminals
is not retribution or getting evil or punishing evil doers
it is about rehabilitation even criminals deserve sympathy and deserve
respect a lot of these criminals simply were born in
bad situations they made mistakes they didn't know what they
were doing they didn't know the law or they're very
sorry about how they behaved and they can correct themselves
as long as we give them an opportunity to do
so and in fact we have uh already examples of
how this works really well in Scandinavian countries where they
have um very liberal prison systems which are all about
Rehabilitation and not just punishment incarceration and um we can
learn a lot a lot of lessons from that and
in the end these criminals can become upstanding members of
society we waste a lot of energy and money trying
to um incarcerate these criminals and they cut they go
out and they commit more crime then they we put
them back in and they come out again they commit
more crime why play this this game if we can
rehabilitate many of them now some of them we can't
rehabilitate in which case we might even have the death
penalty for those worst divorce Defenders that are beyond help
but maybe 80 or even 50 let's say of criminals
can be rehabilitated we should invest resources into that and
um this is also going to be a win-win situation
um for us and for them because we're going to
have less crime and not only will we have less
crime we'll all we're also just going to have more
workers more taxpayers um uh more fathers and mothers more
children all right so we're done with that the next
section is I want to help you to visualize the
emotional appeal of liberalism so we're going to quickly go
through some visualization exercises here very quickly here we go
number one imagine growing up under an authoritarian father who
was such a stickler he didn't allow you to have
any fun he was anal he never expressed his love
for you and he was impossible to please and this
was a very traumatizing experience for you when you think
about how traumatizing that is you understand what it's like
to govern somebody else without love and empathy without care
and sensitivity and femininity if it's just all pure masculinity
that's not enough to feed the soul and to raise
a healthy child or a healthy adult or a healthy
citizenry next Imagine creating a society where everybody gets along
everyone accepts each other world peace no borders no dictators
no exploitative bosses no grinding work weeks plenty of vacation
time to play and to explore imagine that what can
be better than making that our life purpose to create
that collectively next imagine an advanced alien civilization they are
too intelligent to resolve their differences with violence everyone's needs
are taken care of money Fame sex and power are
not objects of pursuit for them their only purpose for
existence is to help each other to evolve to higher
Consciousness intelligence and love why can't that be us do
you have a better way of living collectively than this
next just think about the kinds of social progress and
improvements that we've made in the last Thousand Years 500
years 100 years let's accelerate this progress let's keep doing
this why hit the brakes why resist this it's inevitable
next imagine being so close-minded that you refuse to change
and then you go extinct like the dodo birds next
imagine a communist Utopia where everyone is equal no oppressive
power structure exists no bullying no money everyone's needs are
met why can't we create that do you hold such
a low opinion of mankind that you believe we cannot
create that really how do you know how do you
know that's impossible what if it's possible next imagine being
stuck as a minority in a system that bullies you
how do you feel about that is that right is
that fair is that just imagine if we eliminate all
the bullying in the world all war all conflict all
racism all sexism all hatred all genocide all enslavement all
exploitation all Empire all colonialism imagine permitting your children to
play and to self-express and to follow their highest Passions
without giving them a bunch of rules to follow imagine
them deriving their own rules for themselves ones that suit
them perfectly like a glove next imagine being totally comfortable
with your sexuality and not being bothered by anybody else's
no more guilt no more shame no more judgment next
imagine all the suffering caused by all the unfairness in
the world what else is more worthwhile than making it
our purpose to end that next imagine being so open-minded
that you explore the mind your own mind so deeply
that you transcend the limits of Being Human you access
transhuman dimensions of consciousness you access mystical Realms of Consciousness
and God reaching levels of consciousness like the Buddha or
Jesus or Muhammad and living from that place next imagine
a world where everyone is allowed to practice spirituality however
they wanted to without imposing it on anybody else true
freedom of religion next imagine everyone lived with uh imagine
everyone lived their passion their life purpose and that Society
enabled that and how much more happy productive and Innovative
mankind would be in that situation think about all the
people who are not able to live their passion and
their life purpose right now not because they don't want
to but simply because the economic system has stifled them
and has not given them the required support and education
this wouldn't just be increasing their happiness this would also
be about contributing to civilization because when people are not
working on their passions and on their life purpose then
they're not at their strongest they're not contributing their best
they're maybe only working at 10 percent of their productive
capacity think of the 90 percent that we're losing right
now for most people in the world we're losing amazing
medicines amazing Technologies amazing art because people are not able
to live their passions next Imagine The Thrill of exploring
new alien planets new alien cultures alien biology alien science
alien technology think of how exciting that would be next
Imagine teleporting a thousand years into the future and walking
around New York City try to imagine what that would
be like what kind of people you would meet there
what kind of Technology would exist how people would treat
each other what kind of culture there would be how
Multicultural and diverse it would be how much more developed
and compassionate people would be how much more empathy there
would be next imagine having a whole year off to
do whatever you want no work no chores no bedtime
no no need to bathe no rules nothing complete freedom
no structure next imagine having so much money you can
do whatever you want buy whatever you want you never
have to think about money again you never have to
save again next imagine that everyone in the world was
radically open-minded and not threatened by new ideas and perspectives
imagine if we introduced everybody to the kind of radical
epistemology and relativism that I teach and talk about how
powerful and transformative that would be next imagine having to
go to school or work wearing a uniform not being
able to dress however you want and express yourself through
your clothing in fact I want you to imagine a
society in which the society is so conservative and strict
that you have to wear a single uniform your entire
life you have no option for how to dress at
all how do you feel about that what do you
think is lost in that next imagine how it feels
when some authority figure is repressing you setting rules upon
you telling you what you can can't do imagine the
stinginess and backwardness of the Quakers think about how they
live imagine if somebody forced you to live as a
Quaker for your whole life how would you feel what
do you think would be lost what do you think
the Quakers are losing in the way that they live
the very regimented lifestyle they have next imagine that you
were alive in the past and you supported slavery or
Nazism or segregation just because you were supporting the status
quo or your culture or tradition next imagine living in
a theocracy like Iran Saudi Arabia or the Taliban in
Afghanistan how would you feel if spirituality was limited to
that and government was completely mixed with church state was
mixed with church in that way and finally I'd like
you to consider this possibility imagine God what is God
you might wonder well you could think of it this
way imagine that God is infinitely liberal God is an
infinitely liberal mind infinitely open-minded infinitely non-judgmental infinitely open to
new experience infinitely exploring New Perspectives infinitely relative infinitely merciful
and infinitely loving what if love is nothing other than
opening your mind to absolutely everything that Consciousness could possibly
imagine and not holding one form of Consciousness is any
better than any other what if that's God and your
mind is too closed to understand it or to experience
it what if you're missing out on God simply because
your mind is too close then you're too conservative okay
now a few questions I'd like you to consider this
is uh some homework assignment for you uh a list
of questions to contemplate number one where in your life
are you liberal pinpoint specific places rather than just saying
that I am a liberal I am a conservative find
places where you are liberal I guarantee you that even
if you identify as a conservative you can find places
in your life where you are liberal maybe it's with
your food maybe it's with how you have sex maybe
it's with your speech or or whatever next where are
you idealistic and utopian next question where are you eager
to make progress and change where do you love to
see innovation where does innovation excite you next question where
do you like to explore new experiences next where are
you self-expressive individualistic quirky rebellious and artistic where are you
open to radical new ideas where are you optimistic about
human nature and lastly where do you shake your head
at rigid and closed-minded people who are stuck in the
past AKA Boomers where do you criticize and ridicule Boomers
for being Boomers don't you understand when you call someone
a boomer what you're basically saying is that they're conservative
and you're liberal that's all that Meme means you're criticizing
someone for being too conservative and too rigid and too
outdated all right so now we're wrapping up this is
the end a couple of final points remember there are
many examples of dumb liberals and progressives that you could
find online social justice Warriors and feminists and so forth
this is um this is not going to give you
a proper understanding of the liberal worldview after hearing this
you might be in a state right now a bit
of a shock because what I've presented as liberalism is
very different from what the right-wing media and propaganda has
portrayed liberalism to be so I want you to take
some time here to really reflect and to allow your
mind to experience a paradigm shift liberalism is not what
you thought it was you have been misled by the
media very few right-wingers understand what liberalism is which is
why they can't properly explain it to you which is
why they demonize it they're not necessarily demonizing it uh
out of some kind of evil they just don't understand
they don't have enough perspective to understand to be able
to articulate it the way that I've done here it's
taken me a lot of development and study years and
years of development Decades of development and study to be
able to articulate this kind of stuff to you this
is this is advanced stuff please understand this is not
some sort of you know cheesy political video that you're
watching here this is this is serious what we're talking
about here is really we're not talking about politics we're
talking about something deeper we're talking about political science we're
talking about sociology we're talking about epistemology we're talking about
um like some really deep stuff this is heavy stuff
also notice how different the tone and the content and
the structure of the things that I'm saying are different
from the typical political commentary that you find on social
media very different and even though this is a long
conversation you know three hour conversation you might say well
God it's so involved but look recognize this you've wasted
way more than three hours listening to stupid trolling straw
Manning political commentary on YouTube and elsewhere you've wasted probably
a hundred hours listening to this kind of [ __
] and where has it gotten you has it really
gotten you a deeper understanding of mankind of yourself of
your neighbors has it helped to actually create a better
Society or has done exactly the opposite so just be
aware of the straw mans that you find in right-wing
media and uh you need to start to upgrade the
quality of the sources of media that you watch these
right-wing political commentators they're trash they're trash pure trash they're
propagandists in many cases they're idiots they're fools they have
low levels of development their egotists their narcissists uh they're
doing it because it helps them make a lot of
money but they're not doing it because they actually want
a deep understanding of of anything in reality and this
is not a way for advancing mankind I strongly encourage
you to find the most intelligent articulations of liberal thought
that you can find online perhaps it's known Chomsky perhaps
somebody like Daniel schmachtenberger or myself um maybe Ken Wilbur
you can find very intelligent articulations of liberalism there are
some silly and foolish progressives that you'll find out there
who are a little bit radical and a little bit
too utopian idealistic and a little bit too demonizing of
the right yeah you're going to find this kind of
stuff this is kind of standard it's the most popular
stuff I recommend you avoid that and go for the
go for the serious intellectuals people who really think deeply
about this stuff and who are not ideological and they
also don't demonize conservatives I recommend the following episodes of
mine if you found this episode useful and informative definitely
check out my conscious politics part one two three and
four that's like a 10 hour long series about politics
it'll change your whole understanding of politics super important go
watch that go out check out my other episode called
how Society evolves I present a lot of research and
data in that one check out my series on spirodynamics
really powerful will transform your whole understanding of human nature
if you watch that series also my series called Nine
stages of ego development part one two three that will
also be very helpful for you really what we're talking
about here is developmental psychology and developing psychology applies not
only to individuals but to collectives and so really you
can't understand politics unless you understand psychology and specifically developmental
psychology so that's why you want to watch that spiral
Dynamics series and the nine stages of ego development and
you can also check out my episode called understanding democracy
versus authoritarianism uh I want to address a couple of
just like last little minor points on politics Point number
one is that this topic of individualism versus collectivism you
might wonder so are conservatives the individualists and the Liberals
the collectivists or vice versa sometimes it seems one way
or the other this is a common trap that people
fall into uh it's not the case that conservatives are
are individualists and Liberals are collectivists this alternates depending on
the spiral stages and levels of development so there are
there are stages of development in which the conservative mind
will be more individualist and then there will be stages
where it becomes more collectivist and vice versa they oscillate
the liberal and the conservative oscillate in this way so
for example if you go to the Taliban in Afghanistan
is very conservative and it's also very collectivist it's very
tribal in America conservativism tends to be more individualistic less
collectivist although the fundamentalist Evangelical Christians are a very collectivist
uh basically they want a theocracy they want a Christian
Nation they want a Christian Collective that's collectivism but then
you get uh you get some conservatives that are more
Libertarians when it gets into libertarianism then it becomes more
of an individualist thing that's like spell Dynamic stage Orange
but then you evolve beyond that you get into liberalism
liberalism also oscillates between origin orange forms of liberalism like
libertarianism can also be considered liberalism um there's Liberal Liberal
and conservative forms of libertarianism it can be individualistic um
but then stage green which is more of the social
justice Warriors and the kind of stuff you see on
University campuses progressivism Marxism socialism this tends to be very
collectivist but then you can go beyond that you can
evolve beyond that into spiral Dynamic stage yellow and that
becomes individualist again so don't oversimplify this be careful you
know sometimes like Someone Like Jordan Peterson will will get
this wrong and he will claim that conservatives are the
individualists and and the the Liberals and the marxists and
the postmodernists they're the collectivists this is um there's some
truth in that but it's it's an oversimplification and it
mischaracterizes the complexity of the situation also I want to
say it's important to remember that Mo that both conservativism
and liberalism ultimately are forms of love that's the unifying
characteristic of both it's just love expressed with different emphasis
Different World Views different survival conditions and different developmental levels
but all of it is about love how do you
want to love the conservative loves in a certain direction
and the liberal loves in a certain other direction so
it's very important that you understand that both liberals and
conservatives are expressing love with what they're doing with their
politics even though they themselves don't really understand what they're
doing and they might be doing some some you know
some toxic stuff just because something is toxic doesn't mean
that it's not an expression of love uh love can
be expressed in extremely toxic ways what Hitler was doing
was love it's a very toxic love but love and
uh what the you know Soviet marxists were doing what
Lenin was doing was love his form of love what
China is doing is love what Cuba is doing is
love what Putin is doing is love yeah that's that's
the complexity and beauty of love and finally remember it's
not about being liberal or conservative don't try to create
these two camps and then try to like identify with
one or the other you shouldn't have an identity as
a liberal or a conservative ultimately what you want is
you want to be flexible and intelligent and to apply
the best solutions to the situation at hand whatever that
is situation will change depending on what culture is doing
what people are doing what what era you're living in
what the climate is what your neighbors are doing around
you you're going to need different responses sometimes you'll have
to be very conservative in a certain situation other times
you're going to need to loosen up and be more
liberal and so you want to be extra careful to
distinguish between healthy and unhealthy functional and dysfunctional appropriate and
inappropriate applications of conservative liberal principles throughout your life I
don't recommend that you try to be one or the
other exclusively this would be stupid you gotta use the
right tool for the right situation that you're in you
know maybe with your finances it's better to be more
conservative and maybe with your social life it's better to
be more liberal or vice versa it all depends it's
all relative and you gotta actually like work through it
there's no Ten Commandments there's no Communist Manifesto here that
tells you how to solve these problems which is why
these problems are perennial problems political problems notice they've existed
since the ancient Egyptians and long before them they have
existed and they will exist for another many thousands of
years so when you see something existing across such a
long time span in all countries all cultures All Peoples
and there's war over it and conflict over it over
and over and over and over again you have to
understand that we're dealing with something here that's extremely complex
extremely sophisticated and extremely sneaky it's gonna easily fool you
if you don't treat it as something serious and intelligent
something very intelligent is going on here namely survival also
Consciousness also love that's what's going on here in a
nutshell but then the mechanics of how survival Consciousness and
love all manifest and play themselves out this is man
this you could spend your whole life studying this it's
amazing it's amazing to study this stuff I recommend that
rather than listening to all this all these blowhards on
YouTube you know criticizing and straw Manning each other left
and right I recommend you go uh like buy some
books on politics buy some books on history study the
history of of maoism in China Study the Soviet Union
study Germany and Nazism and fascism study the American founding
fathers study the United Kingdom in the fall of the
British Empire you know study what happened in Africa study
colonialism study capitalism study socialism study others have to think
deeply about it independently for yourself don't subscribe to any
ideology socialism Marxism these are ideologies these are not going
to be true solutions to the problems we have going
on there's good ideas in many different places you can
pick and choose you got to pick and choose the
good stuff again separate the signal from the noise there
is some signal in Marxism but there's also noise and
Marxism there's also signal and capitalism and there's also noise
and capitals there's corruption in both capitalism and Marxism corruption
is not limited to capitalism that's one of the things
you Marxist uh foolishly don't understand capitalism is going to
be as corrupt as as as capitalism is corruption's a
separate thing go check out my episode about corruption so
um uh personally in my life over the last five
years like I've gotten really deep into studying history political
science um these kind of social dynamics to me it's
just it's it's like it's one of the most interesting
things that I get to to do mentally is think
about this kind of stuff it actually gives me a
sort of a medium that I can apply a lot
of these abstract metaphysical epistemic spiritual principles that I've discovered
and sort of shared with you guys uh over the
years like I love being able to apply it to
solve and understand human social dynamics really fascinating stuff this
gets us into sociology go read some sociology books if
you want ideas for kinds of books to read check
out my book list and um also make sure you
go check out my blog I post so much amazing
stuff on my blog I feel like people are missing
out on that I I try to share amazing political
perspectives there resources like really high quality stuff I try
to put on my blog so um it's all free
don't don't uh don't miss it alrighty we're done here
I'll see in the next one
