hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and this video
I'm going to talk about self-confidence okay self-confidence let's talk
a little bit about what this is and how it
really works the in-depth mechanics of how confidence is developed
I actually have other videos that I'm gonna link down
below in the comments section that talk about how to
more practically build confidence here I really want to get
into not so much giving you a little technique but
I want to to really get into like the core
about confidence is why some people have it once why
some people don't so this is going to be a
fascinating topic and it'll help you understand maybe where your
own lack of self-confidence is coming from and how you
can start to turn it around not just with a
little simple patch-over solution but really understanding it at its
core I find that's the best way to solve problems
is understanding them at the core so that's what I
want to cover here self confidence I mean I've had
my own self-confidence issues for a long long time I've
had them since I was a kid so I was
six or seven years old and there are various areas
in your life where confidence can be a problem so
we're gonna look at some of the different areas and
we're gonna maybe see what is the area that you
are having the most problem with confidence in because just
saying generally like lack of confidence I have lack of
confidence that's painting with too broad of a brush what
you want to do is you want to say I
have a lack of confidence in a particular area confidence
is something that we're going to talk about is very
context dependent so we're going to take a look at
that and other things along those lines so what are
some examples of where confidence could be lacking or where
confidence could be required an example might be a job
interview maybe you have a job interview that you're going
to and you're feeling worried about it you feel like
stressed you're not feeling confident how about public speaking or
speaking in front of others or being in a social
situation you're maybe extrovert I mean an introvert or you're
just shy and you have lack of confidence in social
situations or you have confidence problems when you need to
go up and give a presentation at work how about
starting a business Wow takes a lot of confidence to
be able to start a business how about starting a
new hobby or some sort of endeavor that you're trying
to master maybe you picked up a musical instrument that
you're trying to master maybe the guitar the piano maybe
you've got some other hobby like a sport maybe golf
or something like that that you're trying to get good
at and you're struggling there because you don't have enough
confidence how about with the opposite sex especially guys approaching
girls for me huge confidence issues there I had to
work really hard to work those out now I just
I have those and a lot of guys generally don't
have confidence when they're approaching a girl to talk to
a girl to chat her up so lack of confidence
with women for men is a huge problem how about
lack of confidence with doing something in your life to
improve yourself such as losing weight or putting some other
kind of positive habit into your life like a gym
routine or even confidence at the gym maybe you're at
the gym and you're pushing yourself and you're not confident
about exercise that you're doing or the weight limit that
you're trying to reach so all of those are just
like little little areas out of a big big big
list that we could talk about for 15 or 20
minutes so I don't want to do that I just
want to give you some ideas to start to get
your mind connected what we're really talking about and I
want you to get clear about where it is that
you're specifically having your confidence issue because what I don't
want you doing is using a broad brush just kind
of say that you have low confidence that's not true
I'm sure we can find many areas in your life
where you have fairly good confidence so it's just the
the problem areas that we need to look at okay
what is confidence what is it really what is it
like physically what's this existential nature confidence is a vibration
of energy confidence is a thought wave that's is it's
a mind state that's what confidence is when you're going
in to do something and you're calm and you're grounded
and you feel like you have no problem accomplishing it
then what what are you you're confident right that's what's
happening when you're going to brush your teeth in the
morning that's what's happening when you're driving your car that's
what's happening when you're going in to give some sort
of presentation and you feel good about that you don't
have any worries about it that's what's happening when you're
cooking your dinner if you're good at cooking dinner or
anything else and let that you've quote/unquote mastered you're gonna
feel like you're able to do it you're not gonna
worry too much not gonna second-guess yourself well what's the
opposite of that the opposite of that is when you're
going into something usually something new something you don't have
a lot of experience in something that you have zero
mastery in so let's say you're going to swing a
golf club for the first time or let's say you're
going on your first date let's say you're having sex
for the first time let's say you're going to an
important job interview for the first time let's say you
have a big presentation in front of a hundred people
in your company or in your division and that's something
that you've never done before so all of those things
because they're new and fresh to you you don't have
a sense of confidence and so what's happening is that
in your mind literally it's a different vibration of energy
so a vibration of confidence is it's grounded you know
that you're going to be able to do it a
vibration of insecurity is all this worry and anxiety negative
thoughts doom and gloom scenarios and negative visualizations that are
going on so it's important recognize what confidence is actually
it's a vibration it's a thought it's a mind state
now how is confidence developed we already gave you some
clues but it should be pretty clear that nobody is
born with confidence confidence is not something you're born with
and now it might not seem that way on the
surface because you probably know people or you know friends
or you know family members or people that you work
with co-workers that have extraordinary levels of confidence and you
envy them for that you wonder to yourself well how
can I get that is it possible for me to
get that and why is this person so goddamn confident
like why what's the difference I'm having such such trouble
in this area but that person has it totally handled
well the difference is not that that person was born
with it he or she wasn't born with it it's
just that they have the experience that you're lacking right
right now we could probably find some area in your
life where you are very confident at something maybe you
know how to paint maybe you know how to play
a musical instrument maybe you know how to use the
computer in a specific way maybe you have some applications
there may be you know a programming language whatever that
is you know something that you've mastered in you're really
good at and you can look and you can see
that peep there are people in the world in fact
probably millions of people who don't know that thing that
you know and so they're not confident about at all
there are millions of people who are not confident about
how to use a computer or how to paint or
how to play a musical instrument or whatever it is
that you're good at so it's important to notice that
in that area actually you are the one who has
self-confidence and other people don't so when you're feeling lack
of confidence it's simply you be on on the opposite
side of that equation right and so you see somebody
who does have that confidence you don't have it why
is that that's because you lack the experience that's necessary
the other reason is not only do you lack the
experience but you might also have a lack of mental
control over your mind state so you might be an
anxious anxiety prone person you might be a neurotic type
of person you might have a lot of pessimistic and
negative thoughts coming up so that even when you're doing
stuff that you do have experience with you still have
a lot of anxiety and you still have a lot
of worry and lack of the confidence that's necessary so
there's really two two parts to this one is getting
the requisite experience that you want the other is getting
your mind handled which is a lot of the videos
that I'm shooting and bringing to you with actualize that
org is about how to do that that's a really
in-depth topic so I'm not going to cover that all
in this video let's take a look at an example
a couple of examples of people who are real really
confident I tend to find that the reason that some
people are kind of naturally perceived as being confident is
because they got that initial experience that's necessary to have
confidence they got it really early in life and that's
probably true for you too for those things that you're
really confident about in your life you say you probably
got those early on when you were a kid or
a teenager and now you perceive as those things just
being a natural part of you and that's what really
confidence is it's just like it's thinking like well you
know what that's just me I'm just like a naturally
good golfer or I'm like a naturally good with math
or I'm naturally good at this instrument or I'm naturally
good at painting and drawing or whatever else a naturally
gifted speaker if you think that way then that like
even solidifies your confidence even more you feel this vibration
of like unlike like strength within you rather than the
weakness if you have to go and acquire those skills
later in life then your confidence level is not going
to be quite as high as some of those Naturals
the people that got it earlier in life not that
you can never reach those levels but it's going to
take you longer it's going to require more work so
a really good example that I've seen is I've been
studying a lot about the dating community and just how
dating works like I've been studying the psychology that AMEX
are baiting for the last few years and one of
the things that I really noticed is confidence levels that
are associated with good looks so guys who are good-looking
tend to be extremely confident and guys who are worse
in their looks they don't have that same confidence level
the same thing applies with women women who don't have
good looks don't have high confidence and women who have
like really gorgeous looks like really a stunner girl she
tends to have quite a lot of confidence at least
within that context not everywhere in life but at least
within that context within dating and relationships now why is
this we'll just think about it I mean if you
grew up and you're knew that you were really really
good-looking since you were a kid maybe you got some
good genetics or maybe people were just telling you in
lavishing with attention and praise and compliments and you always
thought of yourself as like this beautiful person really good-looking
in the top 10% of everybody else around you so
you thought that you were kind of the well if
you grew up like that and you work that way
through early schooling and then through high school and then
like through college think about how much more confidence you
would have it would be like the snowball effect that
just built up and then of course you would feel
more confident and you would go out and you start
approaching girls you start dating and that confidence would actually
become a self-fulfilling prophecy because you think that you're good-looking
people are gonna register that from you because you really
believe it it's not so important that you actually are
good-looking it's simply important for you because it's kind of
like a trick that your mind is playing on itself
if you could get that kind of belief in yourself
when you were bad looking you would still be able
to get really really good results with women if you're
a guy but most guys can't generate that kind of
confidence because they're kind of broken inside if they've always
felt like they're inferior now the same thing with women
usually women that are really really gorgeous like hot women
I mean you'll see them at clubs you'll see them
at bars you can go talk with them and what
you realize is that the reason that they have so
much confidence is because again they have those good looks
it's easier to have that confidence when you are good-looking
now that doesn't mean that you can't be confident if
you're not quite as good-looking if you're kind of average
or even below average it's just that it'll take you
more work because your mind is going to be hooked
on the external stimulus that you're getting what the what
the environment is gonna be feeding you for example if
you're in American culture you're going to be fed by
all these images magazine covers and beautiful people TV shows
with beautiful people actors movie celebrities people talking about it
also the dating experiences that you hear about from your
friends so all this stuff is going to be bombarding
you and if you've got a weak mind especially when
you're growing up you have a weak mind you haven't
really strengthened it you don't have much self-control then you're
going to be buying into that you're going to just
be absorbing that like a sponge and that's a dangerous
thing because because that means you're just accepting what the
surroundings are telling you see it takes a strong line
to go against this things when people are telling you
that you're ugly or you're looking funny or something like
that imagine how confident you have to be to take
those and not really care to just kind of shrug
them off some people are actually we'll able to do
that and that shows that they have like real confidence
and it might even be true that they're ugly in
someone tells them that they're ugly and they just don't
care how cool would it be to get to that
level that level is definitely possible you have to work
at it though and you have to start unhooking yourself
from all the external inputs that you're getting from society
and media and all your friends and even your own
mind is tricking you into believing this stuff so confidence
is really about the mental game the mental aspects of
what you think about yourself it's really about your self-image
right it's who you believe that you are I have
another video on self-image I'll link it down below you
can check it out but self-image is very important because
it determines subconsciously it determines what you think you can
do in the world who you think you are how
do you think the world works how you feel about
yourself these are really deep subconscious beliefs that you have
and what's nice about this even though it can be
difficult to change what's nice is that the self-image can
be totally changed and that that something which is rather
arbitrary this is just stuff that is accumulated from your
childhood and your past experiences and now it's in there
but you can go and you can use various techniques
to work this stuff out so context dependence of confidence
let's talk about that for a second I want you
to find a couple of things that you're really really
confident in in your life I want you to prove
this to yourself everyone can find at least a couple
of things that they're good at that they are totally
confident they can do and then I want you to
write those down and then I want you to find
a couple of other things where you're not confident so
this should be even easier because that's why you're watching
this video because you already have a couple of those
on top of your mind but write those down as
well I want you to compare those side-by-side and just
see what is the difference why are you not confident
in a couple of areas and then confident in some
of the others what you're going to discover some of
the stuff that I'm telling you is because of the
early experiences that you've had through childhood maybe traumatic events
that have caused you to feel insecure about yourself or
it's the experience that you have right the reason your
confidence on the other stuff is just because you've really
worked on it really really and you feel like it's
part of you part of your self-image when you feel
like you know what that's me that's true that's me
like I'm a math person I'm really good with words
I'm really good with people whenever you feel like it's
really you that's the self-image talking so that's where you
want to get to when you get confident at something
okay so the two avenues for building confidence are going
to be confidence through competence right become competent at the
thing that you're trying to do so this means taking
action and committing yourself to a path of mastery you
have to master the thing that you want so if
you're looking at this video and you're asking yourself well
how can I become confident in this one area that
I have a trouble in here's the answer one answer
is to take a lot of action build a lot
of competence fail a lot learn your mistakes take the
hard knocks and then you're going to be confident that's
how everyone really builds confidence is through that process it's
just that you don't see it in others because that
process is usually hidden in it's internal and the second
way to build confidence is through sheer will it's the
inner game right I like to say that there's like
the external component and internal component the external component of
confidence is going out there and building mastery through action
the internal component is by building up your mindsets that's
all the videos I'm sharing with you understanding yourself understand
your psychology mastering that practicing various techniques like affirmations visualizations
meditation journaling getting coaching on whatever area that you're having
trouble with and I mean the psychology of it not
the practice of it the psychology right so it's one
thing to go and work on your public speaking skills
to actually become an articulate public speaker that is going
to build your external mastery and it's going to build
competence which will lead to confidence but that alone won't
be enough you also need to master the inner psychology
of it how are you thinking about your public speaking
how are you thinking about yourself do you believe that
you're a naturally gifted public speaker can you program that
into your mind what about your subconscious mind what kind
of limiting beliefs there are holding you so all that
stuff you have to work on and really if you
want to work on that stuff then that's what this
channel is about that's why I encourage you to subscribe
and watch more videos because that's what I'm really excited
about is showing you how to do the inner work
because the outer work that's a little bit more obvious
about how to do that and that's gonna be very
specific to what you're trying to master okay so this
is it this is really what self-confidence is about hopefully
this gives you a better understanding you can go out
there and start to build self-confidence in whatever area of
life you need it in the most right now this
