hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video what I want to talk about is how to
follow personal development advice all right welcome back let's talk
about how to follow personal development advice now why is
this even important why am i shooting a video on
this topic actually I started to shoot this video and
the reason I got an idea for it is because
I've shot a lot of video now there's a lot
of video out there on my website and on my
youtube channel and people have been responding I've been looking
at the comments and one of the things that I'm
noticing is that there's a little bit of a disconnect
between my style of delivery and the way that I
want you to be receiving the information so here's what
I mean by this and the whole general theme here
is that I want you to be an independent thinker
right you have to take everything that you hear whether
it's for me or from anybody else that's teaching you
anything in life any kind of wisdom that you take
or advice that you hear from other people there's a
certain way that you need to go about implementing it
and hearing it and receiving it so that you're getting
maximum results in your own life from that advice the
fact of the matter is that there's a lot of
people out in the world especially nowadays that will be
giving you advice free advice paid advice whatever you know
your friends your family stuff you buy books you read
videos you watch on YouTube or anywhere else and the
important thing here is to realize that no matter who
you're listening to no matter how smart they are how
wise they are how much of an expert they are
in whatever field are teaching you when they're giving you
a piece of advice that's something that they learned themselves
right and the best advice is usually a combination of
stuff that you learned through learning and book smarts as
you might call it you know theory and best practices
but then also in combination with your own life experiences
when those two things come together you get a very
solid piece of is a lesson for yourself which then
you can distill down and pass on as advice to
others so somebody might give you some real relationship advice
or some business advice or advice about school or the
the way that you should run your job or your
career or whatever else and the problem with that is
is that they've got their own biases right everyone who's
telling you anything has their own biases and I'm no
different I've got my own biases too and it's just
it goes even deeper than just bias as it also
goes down to values see every human being has certain
values that they have these values you either grow up
with them you develop them as you're growing up maybe
even some of them are biologically instilled in you from
your genetics and premi√®re your family background and all that
stuff and so you're growing up and eventually you you
come up and you become an adult and when you
by the time you're an adult you have values that
you're living your life by now most people don't consciously
know what their values are which is a problem in
and of itself I'll talk about that in other videos
but the idea here is that these values there's about
ten of them that really govern your life these are
like core principles by which you live this is the
stuff that you find very important to you well for
every person that's slightly different and for some people it's
radically different you could take two people have radically different
values and this will explain why they pursue radically different
things in their life why they lead totally different types
of lives why they hang out with totally different types
of people and why they have different types of problems
in their lives and so this being the case just
by the way that advice is structures by the way
these videos are structured I'm delivering my advice to you
the stuff that I've learned and I've really taken advice
from from numerous sources hundreds of different places books and
and incredible experts and authors and all the people and
the clients that I've worked with so there's a lot
of different perspectives that I'm synthesizing and bringing to you
but in the end still it's coming through the filter
of me right it's my values that are getting filtered
here and so what I'm delivering something I try to
deliver it forcefully because I think that's one of the
problems and self development is that sometimes you get a
week delivery a wofully delivery and people will tell you
well maybe you should do this or maybe you should
do that and because of this you end up not
doing anything because it's very easy to just say well
it doesn't really matter or you're not really clear so
I want to give you crystal clear advice and I
think that there is some really hard and fast principle
that you have to follow if you want to be
successful and happy in life and create the kind of
extraordinary that you want so I'm sharing these with you
but in the end I've got my values right I
have certain values about relationships I've certain values about about
money I have certain values about career and business and
health and fitness and so this is the kind of
stuff that my advice is getting filtered through these values
which is which is why sometimes I'll say something but
in the end if you're watching a lot of my
videos you don't want to just be taking it all
wholesale right because what works for me even though I
try to take out what is particular to me what
worked for me what works for some of the clients
that I have doesn't necessarily mean that it will work
for you you might be different in some important way
there might be something about your life that's different maybe
you're living in a very different country where the political
circumstances are different maybe you grew up in a big
family so family is very very important to you and
you value that and so that's going to shift what
you're chasing in life or maybe you've had some very
traumatic events early in your life that have shaped who
you are or maybe you have a physical disability or
a disease or a health problem that I don't have
or that an average person doesn't have so if this
is the case then you need to apply what I'm
telling you with some intelligence not blindly and that's what
this video is trying to tell you to be intelligent
about the way that you apply some of the stuff
that I'm sharing with you you have to trust yourself
above anyone else in life I see a lot of
times people don't do this it sounds simple when you
say it but a lot of times people will go
out there and they'll listen to one person here and
one person there and they'll just be like a leaf
blowing in the wind and they take the advice in
the opinions of other people or even society or organizations
or social constructs they'll take those more important than their
own opinions this is a problem because nobody can really
tell you what's gonna fit in with your life no
one's gonna really tell you what fits in with your
values no one knows but you only you can know
that and even for you that's a that's a struggle
it takes time it takes months and years to really
understand what will fit in for you in your life
what will make you happy what will align with you
what will really make you fulfilled maybe you get into
a relationship and you get married because everyone around you
is getting married everyone's telling you should get married and
so you get married but then later on you find
out that actually marriage was not something that was right
for you because you've got some quirks and you've got
some different values and you don't like being hemmed in
a marriage or maybe people are telling you to go
get a nine-to-five job and become an engineer or a
computer programmer and so you go and do that and
you think that that's going to work for you but
then after a few years of doing that you realize
you know what engineering and programming aren't actually what I'm
passionate about I'm really passionate about art or I'm really
passionate about working with people or something like that so
see these are you know simple kind of situations and
you can extrapolate these out and just and just imagine
beyond this all the different things that people are telling
you that culture is telling you if you are just
blindly following those and vacuuming them up like oh you're
sucking them up without thinking about them then your life
is not going to be very happy it's not gonna
be very fulfilling the whole secret to life is that
you're this complex rich and unique machine running through life
and so you're trying to set up your life so
that the circumstances that are around you are the way
that you want them to be not the way your
mom wants them to be or your dad or your
brother or your sister or whoever else in your life
or even me that's why the stuff that I'm giving
to you you have to custom tailor you have to
be open-minded enough to hear it this doesn't mean to
be closed-minded this is a very important distinction because I
see a lot of people will make this mistake is
that they closed their mind and they tell themselves immediately
Oh I'm very different this couldn't work for me oh
well I'm very different I have this condition in life
or I have this life circumstance I don't have money
or I don't have a relationship or I was abused
when I was younger and so because of this now
this advice that I'm giving to you you're gonna say
now that's not gonna work see it's a little bit
of walking a fine line you have to be able
to develop a trust within yourself at the same time
you have to do two things on the one hand
you have to be very open-minded that means that whatever
ideas or advice is being thrown your way you have
to be able to listen to it to hear it
- honestly intelligently entertain it and then maybe even go
out and try it play around and experiment with it
but then on the other hand you also have to
be the final arbiter right you're like the ultimate authority
on yourself so if you tell yourself you know what
this thing that you're telling me leo it's really not
gonna work because I've experienced I have some experience and
then you know that really doesn't fit with my values
it just really fit with Who I am so this
this part of the advice that you're giving me isn't
gonna work and that's okay I want you to be
doing that right sometimes all all challenge people in them
in the comment sections sometimes they'll tell me all that
that wouldn't work or this wouldn't work and I challenge
them very sternly and I really kind of like clash
with them and the reason I do that is for
the following reason it's not because I think that everyone
should believe what I believe it's not because I think
that everyone should honor my exact set of values and
live life exactly like me I don't want to create
you know a million mirror images of me that's silly
that's not going to work what I want though is
I want you to be not having ego defenses up
and that's what I noticed a lot of people especially
victims people who are victims in life and really stuck
for example I want to talk about depression or when
I talk about anger control or when I talk about
taking responsibility for your life a lot of times will
happen there is that I tell someone what they're doing
wrong and then the reason that they're stuck in life
and their ego feels threatened by it and so it
does is it closes down the mind closes down and
immediately starts coming up with excuses and justifications for why
the the information that they heard is wrong and it
starts to demonize the information and one of the ways
that that happens is that your ego defense will say
well this person he's not like me at all what
does he know about my life how could he possibly
know you know the abuse I had as a child
or how could he possibly know that the crippling depression
that I'm under how could he possibly know about that
horrible miserable relationship where I was used in him and
manipulated and and you know and abandoned how could he
know about all that stuff and I'm sure that he
doesn't have those things in his life so if he
doesn't have those things in his life how can I
relate to him how could his advice actually work it's
a little bit hard right because on the one hand
I want to deliver this advice very clearly clear-cut advice
on the other hand I can't make it totally black-and-white
because there's a lot of gray area and so it's
this kind of balance between me being very clear in
black and white and on their hand allowing you the
freedom to customize what you want from the advice that
you're getting you need both if you don't manage this
right what's gonna happen that your minds going to close
the ego defenses will come up and you won't hear
the advice and so you'll miss the amazing opportunity that
some of this information wisdom can have on you so
that that'll keep you stuck on the other hand if
you follow me blindly then you're probably going to dishonor
some of your values and that will also get you
into some trouble so you don't want to be doing
either of those you have to use your judgment see
I wish there was just a simple 1 2 3
formula that I could give you that you could just
apply to everything that I'm saying and you would know
what works and what doesn't in reality if it worked
that way it'd be too easy you know there's there's
there's so much richness to life they have to go
out there and try experiment but don't use this as
a as an ego defense to say that what I'm
telling you can't work for you what I want you
to do is I want you to honestly believe that
anything I say can work for you you have to
go out there and try it out give it a
lot of effort do it honestly and ultimately what's going
to determine if this is working for you or not
is some hard and fast metrics right don't judge your
life or the advice that you get or the advice
that you try to apply by simply how you feel
about it or what you think will happen if you
apply it the way to judge the advice is to
actually go out there and apply it and see the
results right there's two things here you have to be
growing constantly and you have to be getting better and
better results if you're getting these two things in your
life then you're using a strategy that's good so you're
probably maybe already doing that if you're getting better and
better results every day every week every year good good
for you maybe there's a way we can make that
even even faster make those results even like supercharge those
and.and you're growing right and though in that case you're
growing every single every single day every single week every
single month every single year that's what you want but
if you're not doing that and you're noticing that you've
kind of been stuck in the same place in your
life for a while now especially for a couple of
years or more then you have to ask yourself wait
a minute maybe there's something here that I'm missing maybe
some of these reasons that I'm not following some of
this advice that I know is because of these ego
defense mechanisms which can be very very tricky very self
manipulative very self sabotaging and so we gotta save yourself
as ha wait a minute have I been growing very
consistently very powerfully over the last few years or not
if I haven't something is wrong or wait a minute
have I been getting better and better results at my
job in my business in my relationship with my health
with my finances with my internal emotional mood am I
getting better and better at those every single year wait
a minute if I'm not that means that I'm using
some sort of bad strategy because I can guarantee that
if you if you use strategies the way that I'm
using strategies I mean I'm taking stuff all over the
place and then I'm applying it in my life I'm
throwing stuff out too I'm filtering very heavily for what
works for me and when I find those strategies the
growth that I get is amazing that growth is that
you're not the wait years to feel it you you
can see that growth in weeks literally in weeks you
see that growth so when you're really on the right
track you know you're on the right track and that's
what I want for you I really want every year
for you to be like a powerful kick-ass year something
where a year passes in your life and you can't
even recognize where you were a year ago and this
is not this is not this is not something that's
ooh too lofty in fact pretty much every single year
for me for the last man probably for the last
five years it was like I was having major major
growth I like to the point where I look back
war just one year I can look back from today
one year I'm like damn like my life was so
radically less than it is now it's like every year
expansion expansion expansion and that's why I'm excited to shoot
these videos because I want that same expansion for you
when you when you get that taste of expansions like
oh man that's so amazing just the feeling of knowing
you grown so much just that in and of itself
for me is really really rewarding but of course it's
not just that it's that your life is improving and
you're feeling better you're having more success you're getting success
in all these different areas in your life it's kind
of like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle and it's
a very customized jigsaw puzzle everyone's is unique that's what's
beautiful about life is that you're crafting your own life
and I bring you the principles and the stuff that
I think is just very fundamental see sure you're gonna
customize a lot of stuff but it's also the case
that there's some basics to life that you have to
have in place for example if we're gonna build a
car you know there's there's a lot of detail to
a car and there's a lot of customization you can
do there's a lot of different cars out there and
your taste in cars might be different than mine but
on the same level there's a lot of similarities between
cars - right most of them have wheels most of
them have four wheels most of them have tires most
of them have an engine in the front most of
them have a trunk most of them have rear view
windows and mirrors and so you've got all this stuff
which is kind of like the fundamentals and what's actually
refreshing about that is that if you get like the
basic fundamentals in place which are the same for most
human beings to be happy and successful then the the
details you can you can customize those exactly how you
want and that's actually really rewarding because your life then
when you're customizing these details and you're doing this little
like fine-tuning and polishing work on your life it's it's
kind of like detailing a card so it's like it's
fun it's rewarding and it's it's a form of self-expression
your life can be a form of self-expression your life
itself the way you live it the way you grow
the things you involve yourself in the kind of principles
and values that you embody and live up to and
some it's a really powerful place to be in life
and I want that for you so I want to
help to put the fundamentals in place so that you
can then get really curious and interested about that detail
work all right so this is the basics of how
to follow my advice but not just my advice anybody's
advice use your brain be a critical thinker you are
the final arbiter in the end I can't force you
to do anything nobody can force you to do anything
you are responsible completely for how your life goes which
advice you adopt which advice you leave on the cutting
room floor and I want you to be intelligent I
want you ultimately to be nuanced develop these characteristics within
yourself this is important because if you are going to
be a black-and-white thinker or you're gonna be hemmed in
with all these ego defenses you're gonna be putting all
these walls up against receiving new information for people and
considering other perspectives then your growth and success and happiness
in life is going to be very very limited and
that's not what we want here for you alright this
