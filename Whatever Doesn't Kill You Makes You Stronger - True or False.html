hey this is Leo for actualised at work and in
this video I want to talk about a classic adage
which goes whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger now
is that true or is that false all right so
let's talk about that is it true or false that
whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger before we dig
into that just to let you know I'm standing here
in the centre of Toronto downtown Toronto I've got the
CN tower behind me but in front of it I've
got this giant locomotive which is part of this railroad
museum that they have right in the downtown area kind
of cool so I thought I'd shoot a video here
but I've been thinking lately about this issue of you
know what doesn't kill you makes you stronger I want
to believe that right and I tend to tell that
to people as advice you know when they're going through
something difficult and just I just have to say you
know use it as as fuel for the road you
just fuel to keep you moving keep it going even
if so the bad happens to you there's always a
silver lining to it etc etc well here in Toronto
even go through a pretty bag a pretty bad legal
trial and that's been triggering me emotionally quite a bit
more so than I've been triggered in a long long
long time in fact just the other day I might
say I had one of my most brutal days of
my life spending eight hours in the courtroom so going
through that and some of the emotions that came up
for me I've really started to think about this is
this situation gonna make me stronger or is it actually
gonna make me weaker it's impossible to have a situation
that's so bad that you still live through it but
in the end you come out crippled maybe not physically
crippled but I'm talking about emotionally crippled and what about
that is it possible for situations to emotionally crippled you
and if it is and it's possible to actually get
yourself involved in a mess that will leave you worse
off in life than you were before you got into
it then does that mean we should be more concerned
with the kinds of decisions that we make in life
the kind of things that we undertake the kind of
projects that we start the kind of businesses maybe we
get ourselves involved with or the kind of relationships we
go into or anything else like that maybe relationships marriages
divorces so here's here's my opinion on this I think
in the in the short term in the short term
you can definitely get yourself involved in a in a
in a pickle and you can definitely kind of paint
yourself into a corner and maybe it's with a business
or with a relationship that turns into a marriage or
something else you can do something so stupid with your
life or with your finances that it's gonna take you
a long time to recover from it so this can
be a very catastrophic mistake and yet even in the
short run and even in the medium run if that
mistake is very bad it will certainly hinder your performance
and it might get you to doubt start down in
yourself it might make you fearful it might make you
cowardly it might make you retreat into your shell so
you don't go out there and you don't live life
to the fullest the way that you wanted to so
in that sense you know you got to be careful
about about some of the stuff you get yourself involved
with because it can it can really your life on
the other hand I'm also also comes to mind all
the scenarios where people have made really really stupid decisions
have really up their lives whether through drugs or getting
themselves involved with a marriage that then breaks up and
then they lose a large chunk of their money or
you know getting scanned and some sort of Ponzi scheme
or maybe getting getting fraud it out of some money
because of some business transaction didn't go their way or
just some bad luck maybe a death in the family
a death of someone that's really close to you a
child a spouse a loved one a parent yeah so
so those those really tough cases what's going to happen
is that basically in the short and medium term they're
gonna feel very very bad you can feel very painful
and you're just kind of like give yourself some breathing
to kind of grieve through it work your way through
it and kind of have the fears come out and
play that whole game and so that's gonna that's gonna
have to happen and in that time as that's happening
to you is starting to snow here is as that's
happening to you you are going to feel like this
is something that's very miserable and you're gonna feel like
this is something that should not be in your life
and that you are cursed with misfortune for having this
now certainly how I felt the last few days about
this trial is I felt like I would give anything
to not do it I would give anything to just
like pull myself out so I don't have to deal
with it I wish it's never happened I wish I
may have just different decisions in the past so that
I would have gotten into this trial in the first
place okay fair enough but I did but even today
I'm feeling much better about it I think that it's
it's it's the tough you know you might you might
make the case and say well what about like a
rape what about a near-death experience what about if someone
like kidnapped you and starts torturing you like in that
kind of scenario is a better for that to not
have happened isn't that better I mean doesn't that make
sense wouldn't it be nicer to just like cut out
all that traumatic or like if you lose someone close
to you isn't it better that you didn't lose that
person you know I don't know I think ultimately actually
I think there is a deep core truth and I
think this is Annie she's Nietzsche Frederick Nietzsche said this
is that whatever doesn't kill you truly makes you stronger
and and that's because yeah that doesn't mean that it's
gonna feel good in the moment that doesn't mean it's
gonna feel good a week or a month afterwards but
ultimately what it does is to build a certain psychological
resilience within you and especially those really trying times those
can be times that really define your character those can
be times that then create new sources of motivation that
you can use to go out there and take on
big projects that you wouldn't have otherwise done those can
be that's gonna be really powerful life shaping events and
those kind of catastrophic failures whether you lose a business
or a loved one or something like that you know
it makes you so much more so much more appreciative
of what you have so much more appreciative of what
you had and then in the future when you go
out and you still become successful you still you know
you're still gonna take action and do new things and
find you people to love and get into relationships have
new marriages what its gonna do is it's gonna make
you much more grounded and stable that's my feeling right
now because I went through this trial the other day
and how I feel like it's like it's so easy
I was bitching and moaning about how to come out
here and like shoot and it is really cold out
here so my fingers are really nam in fact a
video I was shooting on the seashore here in Toronto
you got so cold I was literally worried that I
would have frostbite because I was shooting a video and
I my fingers were I'm gonna feel my fingers and
I was out there solo Nicole to get the right
shot and it feels like this is head this is
heaven compared to what I went through yesterday so to
me this is like oh this is so nice this
is so nice it makes everything else so much easier
and I think that that's that's literally what is going
on here is that you know your psychology because more
robust it's kind of like like skin right we've got
when you've got sensitive skin and you keep puncturing it
and you keep you keep putting wear and tear on
it what happens is it starts to build up a
callus and the skin starts a hard enough and tough
enough and extra layers of skin grow and it builds
up a palace so then in the future when you're
poking and prodding at that skin it doesn't bleed it
doesn't rip quite as easily it's very resilient and that's
what's that's what's literally also happening with your technology as
you're going through life and experiencing tough events if your
life is just all smooth sailing and you have good
luck and money just comes your way and you happen
to get into awesome relationships and everything just happens to
be working out in your business if that's your life
I mean wow that's first of all congratulations you're extremely
lucky you're very rare to have that but also you
better pray every single day that that luck continues because
you know what if one day it runs out man
you're going to be in a world of because that
skate basically have said that the in layers can than
anything can puncture it they basically would have to be
literally doing is praying for a bit luck so that
nothing comes along it punctures it because if it does
it's gonna rip apart very easily and you're gonna basically
point out by the other hand if you're kind of
life where you have horrible luck bad relationships you get
involved with the wrong people that business you're losing money
everywhere just all this stuff that keeps happening to you
I mean yes that's tough and sure I would not
want to trade places with you but on the other
hand you're building up you're building up a lot of
psychological resiliency that tough skin that calluses building up in
your mind and that's actually making you very very resourceful
maker making you very powerful from that place you can
actually accomplish amazing things and many people many celebrities many
politicians many many big movers and shakers and life entrepreneurs
people that have really influence deciding in a positive way
they've come from exactly these kinds of places and the
reason that is is because once they go through that
trauma once they go through all the trials and tribulations
they come out with a very thick skin very robust
mentality a psychology that will let them handle the worst
of what the world can throw out you and sometimes
the world where throat will throw a really hard punch
and if you're not ready for it if you've never
been hit by a hard punch in your life then
that's gonna that's gonna really sting you and a lot
of times it will totally derail you no pun intended
it will derail you off your tracks and off your
course in life whereas if you're if you're suffering a
little bit here and there that's actually good that's actually
how it should be so ultimately I think that you
have to you have to just kind of like push
through push through push through stay on your track stay
on course and yes you're gonna have tough times you
have times where you think you're gonna you have to
quit you're gonna have tough tough times that you think
you wouldn't have ever wanted on yourself and that you
just wish could have been taken back but you know
let some time pass don't be too quick to judge
if it's a really traumatic event let a couple months
pass let a couple years pass and see what happened
to you maybe you can analyze your past and see
you probably have a couple of traumatic events you can
already analyze what you're gonna see is that actually you're
probably gonna be very grateful for the fact that you
have that experience and now that is a foundation on
which you can build your life you can build your
grand castle right all right so that's it that's just
what I have to say about whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger ultimately I think it's a very very
true statement maybe I would make an exception for very
extreme circumstances like if you were kidnapped and tortured or
raped but I think that there's even a case to
be made that even in those situations there is a
there's still a several silver lining and that you can
actually use those situations to to create a very powerful
kind of life so don't get discouraged if you're going
through something like that I just went through a traumatic
event just the other day with my courtroom trial but
now I'm feeling feeling alright not too worried right now
even though I still don't know the result of it
so we'll see but here I'm gonna go right now
