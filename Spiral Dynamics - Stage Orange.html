[Music] you in this episode we're continuing our discussion of
the psychological model known as spiral dynamics this is a
multi-part series this is the second part in the series
we're gonna be talking all about stage Orange which comes
after stage blue so go watch the blue episode first
and then come back and watch Orange otherwise you might
get lost so the way spiral dynamics works is you
have beige purple red blue orange and then after orange
you have green yellow and then finally turquoise I'm not
covering the lower stages because those are so basic that
most people wouldn't get much value from that but orange
orange is perhaps the most important stage to talk about
because orange is probably the stage that you are at
I would estimate that at least 50% of my audience
is at stage Orange because especially in Western democracies first
world countries and now even many third world countries stage
orange culture that has been exported from America and from
the first world all around the globe now through the
internet and through Hollywood movies and all of this it
all embodies the stage Orange set of values and worldview
and that's fundamentally what spiral dynamics stages are they are
a system of values and a worldview that you have
and the way you got this is you were programmed
and conditioned with this set of values depending on which
culture you grew up in and the era that you
grew up in the proble course though is is that
this is not just a worldview that you hold or
a set of values to you this is reality you
hold this as the absolute truth you hold this as
being the only way it should be and you of
course try to impose your worldview and values onto everybody
else and it's because you're looking at the whole world
from your limited worldview you don't really understand the world
and then when you have wars and political battles and
debates and religion and science and all sorts of crazy
conspiracy and all this sort of stuff happening all around
you you don't understand how come there's all this craziness
well it's because you're looking at the world from your
little corner of the world and you don't really understand
the the Greater complexity and how the mind gets programmed
with this mind virus like software which then runs and
determines how you interact with everything in life your color
on this psychological model like orange for example or blue
or green it's a set of values that basically determines
how you think about every facet of life it determines
what you think a good relationship is it determines how
you think human beings should interact with one another it
determines what kind of food is the right food it
determines what kind of clothing is right clothing it determines
what kind of government is the right government it determines
how education should be how politics should be how business
should be run it determines your views on sexuality on
gender identity on masculinity and femininity on how society should
be structured on what kids should be taught in school
or not taught in school what you should believe metaphysically
whether you should believe in a God or not believe
in a God or who you should pray to what
religion means for you or doesn't mean for you or
your relationship to science into rationality all of this is
dictated by the spiral dynamics stage that you are at
and this episode is going to be highly relevant to
most of you because right now especially in first world
countries and in America most people are stuck in one
of two places on the spiral dynamics model they are
between blue and orange and orange and green so very
few people in America and in first world democracies these
days are purely solid blue that almost cannot pass because
our culture and our media is so heavily influential and
it's very orange and I'll explain what that means in
a lot of detail here in a minute so most
people even the most conservative evangelicals and the the sort
of religious nut cases in America they are not solid
blue they are like maybe 50% blue 50% orange if
you notice even the evangelicals and the Christians and the
Catholics they're still very heavily influenced by the business ideals
and the sort of capitalist ideal that orange embodies so
a lot of people are stuck there and then a
little bit beyond that the more evolved people so to
speak they are stuck between green and orange or orange
and green so they have 50% orange in them because
of the the movies they watch and because they are
interested in money and success and business and this sorts
of stuff but then also they have some higher greener
values which is more about they care about equality and
they care about compassion for their human beings and they
care about the environment so this and so they're not
fully at green most people are not fully agree and
so now you have this battle that's what's taking place
in American politics is this battle between half blue half
orange people and half orange half green people really they're
not that far apart you could find positions along the
spiral which are much further apart and yet at the
same time it feels like there's such enemies and there's
these polar opposites it's very interesting how this works so
again I want to give credit to clare graves dawn
Beck and Christopher Cohen for their research and work in
developing this model spiral dynamics is a very complicated model
it's a very nuanced model which required a lot of
research years these these people dedicated their entire lives to
researching this stuff so don't think that wow that amaz
just is this simple little thing for stereotyping and demonizing
caricature izing other people that's not what sprawl dynamics is
it's much more nuanced than that and also I want
to give credit to the website spiral dynamics intramural dot
NL so the reason this episode is going to be
so valuable for you is because you are probably quite
thoroughly indoctrinated into Orange values in the orange worldview so
much so that what this episode is gonna do it's
gonna be like me pointing out water to a fish
you see most Americans are so indoctrinated with orange they
don't know that they're in orange they're blind to it
so it can be very helpful to start to become
conscious of just the mental software that is running pretty
much all your beliefs and all your behaviors and your
entire life so let's get down to it what is
the essence of orange its individual achievement improving the self
through artful calculation you start to act in your own
selfish interests and you're playing the game to win which
is a shift away from the blue worldview the blue
worldview was about sacrificing yourself for the sake of civilization
it was about sacrificing for your country for your religion
for your community it was about living for the afterlife
so all be working and disciplining myself really hard now
I'll be a good little boy in this life so
that I can get to heaven to the afterlife and
then orange says no wait a minute what's more important
than the afterlife is the here and now it's the
material life we don't really care about the afterlife let's
play this game here to improve our position and so
with orange comes the rise of business materialism consumerism secular
humanism the separation of church and state popular culture scientism
or science as a Dogma or science turned in to
the new religion technology success oriented self-help and the rise
of democracy as opposed to what we had in blue
which was more of a theocratic form of government so
here we have the rise of secular democracies let me
give you a list of all of oranges values this
is what is nearest and dearest to oranges heart and
these key words again that I'm about to give you
these key words are gonna resonate with you if you're
an orange person or if you have shades of orange
maybe you're mostly green but you still have bits and
pieces of orange chances are most of you watching still
have quite a bit of orange in your psyche and
these values will resonate with you and you can use
these key words to make rapport with orange people because
as soon as they hear you using these key words
are gonna be feeling like oh yeah that's it that's
exactly what reality is about that's exactly our my highest
ideals that's what I'm aiming for in life that's what's
driving everything I'm doing in my life in my family
life in my business life with my finances with my
pursuit of of the kind of videos that I watch
on YouTube and all that all of this has dictated
by orange values so here they are perhaps first and
foremost at the top of the list is achievement success
and excellence orange is about climbing his or her way
to the top in orange you have upward mobility whereas
in blue your mobility in the social hierarchy was limited
because you had caste systems and it was a very
fixed rigid system whereas in orange now there's opportunities you
can work for yourself you can become successful you can
improve yourself and you can achieve your way to the
top so upward mobility becomes possible and as that opens
up orange becomes obsessed with becoming number one becoming the
best being a winner do you feel that in your
own life like you're trying to be the best in
your career you're trying to be the best in your
sport you're trying to be the best in your school
that's the kind of value that orange indoctrinates you with
orange is about improving is one position in life orange
values efficiency progress productivity and optimization everything must be optimized
Orange values gaming the system min maxing and manipulation Orange
can be extremely manipulative manipulating resources to get the kind
of successful outcomes that he or she wants from society
creative exploitation orange has no qualms about exploiting a situation
or exploiting a person to get the kind of outcome
and results that orange wants Orange values action results in
pragmatism orange doesn't care about the afterlife or about fluffy
metaphysical philosophical ideas orange wants to take action orange wants
results orange wants tangible goods material profit orange values never-ending
growth always be growing that's oranges motto orange of course
values capitalism and libertarianism orange values competitive marketplaces deregulation and
D nationalization why do we need regulation we don't need
that let's just all be libertarian so let's just all
be fighting for ourselves it's all about individualism groups don't
matter community doesn't matter all that fluffy stuff that maybe
was something we needed back then but these days we
don't need that everyone can just be fighting gunning for
himself climbing the ladder and best man wins Orange values
hard work business and entrepreneurship Orange values competition and winner-take-all
situations orange prides himself on being a strong competitor Orange
values self-improvement and here we have the rise of the
self-help industry which before was religion self-help was really religion
but orange doesn't like religion orange wants to secularize religion
so orange is in to self-help and so a lot
of the principles from religion get sort of secularized and
transmogrified into the self-help movement and self-help books which don't
make any explicit mentions of God or anything like that
or spirituality but there's little bits in there but mostly
this sort of orange self-help is all about prosperity how
do you prosper how do you climb your way to
the top how do you manipulate better a lot of
orange self-help and of course there's also green self-help and
yellow self-help but orange self-help is all about how do
you manipulate the marketplace to kind of improve your own
station life because of this orange starts to value skills
knowledge and education the acquisition of skills becomes paramount for
oranges ability to climb his way to the top orange
values confidence optimism and charisma orange values entertainment and showmanship
orange values personal freedom self-reliance and independence and he believes
that everyone should strive towards self-reliance and independence and dependence
on the welfare state or something like that or on
the government's or dependence on religion that this is just
a crutch of course Orange values free speech towards dissent
orange values money sex and luxury orange values net worth
it's all about increasing your net worth that's how orange
judges his progress in life orange values physical appearance Beauty
youth sexiness and coolness so with this of course comes
consumerism and conspicuous consumption it's all about buying the newest
iPhone buying the newest Gucci purse or the newest Ray
Ban sunglasses to look cool to fit in with the
culture with the times and of course fashion is constantly
changing so it's all about having the fashionable clothes and
and putting up that image that you sort of like
you're on the cutting edge of culture brands is something
that orange values whether it's Rolex or Ray Ban or
Gucci or Dolce and Gabanna all this sorts of stuff
Chanel orange values popular culture celebrities and social media all
of oranges culture is just basically a sort of glorification
of celebrities because celebrities represent the Orange ideal actualized you
look up to people like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt
and sexy supermodels and and hot stars and Kim Kardashian
and Paris Hilton and all this sort of stuff it's
like yeah that's what I'm supposed to be I'm supposed
to become famous I'm supposed to become rich I'm supposed
to become admired I'm supposed to become that wealthy rapper
or that successful NBA player or that successful football player
with the hot girlfriend and the wife and the sports
car and all this sort of stuff that becomes like
that's what life is about that's the ideal and celebrities
they're the ones who succeeded so I'm gonna kind of
emulate in mere the celebrities I'm gonna read what the
celebrities tell me works and I'm gonna do that and
try to become a celebrity myself Orange values quarterly profits
mass-market and sales it's all about how to increase sales
how do you take a product to the biggest market
possible all around the world let's dumb down this product
and make it as mass-market as possible mass market books
mass-market movies mass-market products mass market food mass-market drinks everything
mass-market orange is all about math production and Industry which
of course is the whole industrial revolution and factories and
automation orange is orange values rationality logic science secularism and
humanism this is huge this is one of the defining
characteristics of orange because it's a swing away from religion
belief faith and just blind obedience to Authority so that
orange is becoming rebellious and swinging the pendulum in the
opposite direction so orange is all about sort of thinking
for yourself hard-nosed science orange is not interested in New
Age mumbo jumbo orange wants pragmatism empiricism scepticism orange applies
skepticism to everything except of course to orange and to
skepticism itself and orange of course doesn't apply skepticism to
science but that's that's another topic orange doesn't care about
metaphysics orange feels that metaphysics is just speculative religious nonsense
which gets us into trouble and so orange says on
metaphysics is just nonsense there's nothing within metaphysics of value
what we need to do is use hard pragmatism and
empiricism and utilitarianism and of course that ultimately lets paints
orange into a corner because in fact orange does have
a metaphysics in orange as metaphysics is materialism reductionism atheism
evolution this is oranges metaphysics but orange doesn't see this
as a metaphysics orange sees this as a reality it's
like leo that's not metaphysics materialism it's just true science
is just true evolution is just true atheism is just
true reductionism is just true science has proved this long
ago science works Leo look science works if science wasn't
true how could we have airplanes and how could we
have videos and look Leo here shooting this this video
on a camera you're posting it on YouTube how could
any of this book be possible if what you're saying
about science is is is isn't true how is that
possible well of course um that's that's the myopia of
orange orange doesn't see anything above because in oranges mind
there's only blue and orange and so orange is reacting
as blue and thinks that it's superior to blue because
it's transcended blind indoctrination and dogma and and sort of
religious faith and authority figures and that's good to transcend
that is good but there's there's something beyond that as
well orange does not recognize the limits of rationality or
science orange values technology very highly orange values analysis orange
values facts and too orange there is such a thing
as facts the physical facts these are not in dispute
to orange the data doesn't lie Orange values data analytics
models and orange tries to quantify everything everything can be
fitted with an algorithm with a mathematical equation orange values
science based fact-based education whereas in blue education was indoctrination
basically religious indoctrination orange moves away from that and for
orange now it's about the facts about teaching kids science
and math and and history and doing so in sort
of what orange considers to be a factual and objective
manner which of course is nonsense there's nothing factual about
the way that orange teaches children orange indoctrinate children into
orange but it's a different level of indoctrination of different
kind of indoctrination than blue it's superior to blue but
still very limited orange values double-blind peer-reviewed studies Orange values
scientific method the scientific method replaces the religious method that
blue had a blind faith in but of course orange
now has a blind faith in scientific method Orange values
IQ because everything can be quantified so of course intelligence
can easily be quantified with a few tests so let's
just quantify your IQ and of course IQ that's that's
going to determine how good of a rationalist you are
how good you can reason and do logic and how
good of a scientist you can be and that is
the truth so that's highly valuable in oranges opinion orange
values strategic thinking and risk analysis orange values innovation and
creative thinking orange values results and this attitude that the
bottom line matters the most it's all about the bottom
line Orange values maintaining a competitive edge Orange values competence
rather than rank or bloodlines in red and in blue
your position within an organization often didn't have anything to
do with your competence or your skills or your knowledge
or whether you had a PhD or not it had
to do with what your rank was what your caste
was and even your blood relations like are you the
son of the Pope if you are then you're gonna
be next in line this sort of kind of mentality
orange does away with that for Orange spouts how competent
are you how good are you at your craft Orange
values recognition and reward orange values win-win outcomes when orange
can get it but also orange will not have any
qualms about manipulating you and stabbing you in the back
to get an outcome that is just a win for
himself that's the values of Laurence when does orange emerge
along the spiral historically from an evolutionary perspective why does
orange evolve orange evolves blues starts to recognize the limitations
of itself when blue gets taken to its ultimate conclusion
blue starts to notice that wait a minute maybe this
absolute truth that I believed in with such certainty maybe
it's not so certain maybe the world is not so
black and white maybe the divisions between good and evil
are not so clear maybe there's a little bit more
gray in between maybe my religious authorities maybe the Pope
maybe the Buddha maybe Christ maybe Mohammed maybe they didn't
know everything maybe my Bibles didn't write everything correctly maybe
there were some things that the people who wrote the
Bible didn't understand about reality and you see that's a
big shift because now there's a shift away from just
blind obedience to Authority and religious indoctrination and now there's
a little bit more of a shift towards thinking for
yourself investigating reality empirically for oneself to verify and determine
what the truth really is and so with this historically
came the Scientific Revolution and then a little bit later
the Industrial Revolution that's how orange emerged out of blue
and as that starts to happen science makes new discoveries
which allow for new sorts of technology and this technology
starts to radically transform the culture and it starts to
undermine the certainty of religion and as that happens the
population start to desire more of a separation between the
church and the state the limitations of using church and
state together into a theocracy start to become very clear
because then what you have is you have oppression by
the religious authorities and really you sort of have the
worst of both worlds because the state government gets corrupted
by religion but also religion gets corrupted by the state
and that becomes a problem so now people want to
sort of separate them out and there's a separating out
of the domains of legend and science so science starts
say well we just do empirical investigation we don't really
care about cosmic metaphysical questions about God and about good
and evil and about morality those things are not scientific
so science will just focus on on the facts and
then if you guys want to debate about metaphysics or
whatever you can do that in your church so you
know there's there's some tolerance within orange for religion but
mostly it's kind of cordoned off and you don't talk
about religion and universities and sort of stuff there's a
sort of separation of religion from education and of course
that's very disturbing for blue because blue believes it has
the absolute truth so it wants to indoctrinate the truth
whereas orange now says no we got to do science
we got to do Studies we got to do research
this sorts of stuff Orange becomes much more skeptical oftentimes
in a in a neurotic and toxic manner with the
transition to orange there's an awakening to science and to
rationality which is why orange finds a lot of blue
people to be irrational you can't argue with them you
can't reason with them you can't get them to accept
the facts you can't get a creationist to accept evolution
of course because the creationist has not awoken to notions
of rationality and scientific investigation and Pyrrhus ism Orange becomes
highly pragmatic or starts to desire personal success because in
blue it was about sacrificing for the afterlife and after
a certain point you know you sacrifice you sacrifice your
sacrifice but then you realize like wait a minute what
if I only have this one life what if there
is no afterlife then I'm wasting my only opportunity here
and after all how can we be sure there is
an afterlife therefore isn't it the most rational thing just
to live this life and to get the most success
and happiness and pleasure out of this life right now
and then we'll deal with the afterlife if it comes
but let's deal with today first let's fix the problems
that we have a society here today because look we
have dysfunctional government so we have oppression of minorities we
have we have technology that can help to to make
the entire world more prosperous we can cure diseases and
we can we can make our lives easier but religion
isn't focused on any of that blue doesn't care about
that blue cares about the afterlife and that's that's so
far into the future who really cares about that orange
things and so orange says let's improve our conditions on
this planet for everybody and so orange then becomes this
pursuit not of the religious righteous life but the pursuit
of prosperity and the idea that technology will solve all
of mankind's problems that's really the only problem mankind has
orange thinks is it's just that we haven't built enough
cars and airplanes and advanced technology and computers and we
haven't interconnected the whole world with fiber optics to deliver
entertainment and televisions to everybody in food and and and
medicine to cure diseases if we just had this then
the whole world would be civilized and everyone would live
in happiness and that's sort of the ultimate ideal and
that's what orange pursues here are some characteristics of orange
or SHIVs characterised by a drive for personal results and
success and status orange strives for autonomy and independence it
doesn't want to be hemmed in by the bureaucratic systems
of blue blue is bureaucratic and hierarchical and orange is
all about kind of going off on your own becoming
an entrepreneur and exploiting the system a little bit to
get ahead orange seeks the good life and material abundance
orange is characterized by having this notion that progress will
come from learning nature's secrets and finding the best solutions
which we do through science orange is characterized by manipulating
the earth's resources how do we manipulate the resources so
that we can build the stuff we need to make
life easier for everybody if only life was easier then
all our problems would be solved and everyone would be
happy you know for orange societies prosper through strategy technology
and competition competition is a good thing we want people
competing otherwise people are just gonna become lazy and no
one's gonna want to work like in a socialist country
they orange thinks no one's gonna work because there's no
reason there's no incentive so we got to keep a
little bit of competition there's gotta be some danger to
life you can't just give everybody a universal income and
then everybody just lives happily ever after that that doesn't
work for orange because orange thrives on competition thrives on
outdoing other orange people orange desires to enhance life through
science and technology or just trying to uncover the mysteries
of the universe via science and mathematical algorithms there's an
aversion within Orange to religion spirituality and mysticism there's a
desire to secularize and demystify everything fundamentally Orange believes that
there's nothing mysterious about reality everything can be demystified as
long as we just keep doing more science the implicit
metaphysics of orange which orange doesn't recognize is the Big
Bang atoms and brains orange believes in an objective external
reality realities just there there was the Big Bang it
came from somewhere we got a bunch of atoms out
of these atoms complexity somehow evolved and then we got
these brains and from this brain we got consciousness and
now we're conscious of all this stuff that happened that's
oranges basic metaphysical story and orange is very certain that
that is all there is that's all there isn't there's
after life there's no god there's no angels there's no
demons there's no Devils there's none of no spirits no
ghosts none of this Airy fairy immaterial stuff reality is
purely physical purely material consciousness just neurons in the brain
psychedelics are just stuff happening in the brain that's all
it is religious beliefs and ideas are just mumbo-jumbo just
myths religion is just silly superstition all religions are false
miracles are impossible healing is impossible paranormal phenomena are impossible
God is impossible the devil is impossible reality is impersonal
reality doesn't care about you he doesn't care about happiness
or love or your afterlife none of this matters it's
just a cold brute reality there's really no meaning to
it because just a physical mechanical system maybe we're living
in some sort of matrix like simulation we can't really
know we'll never know that's a nun falsifiable proposition that's
not large things orange thinks that if you can't quantify
a thing it doesn't exist love what is love love
doesn't exist can you quantify it no so it doesn't
exist intelligence what is intelligence well intelligence is what we
can quantify through an IQ test that's all it is
what about God well where is God if God existed
we could quantify it you could point to it but
you can't point to it so therefore it doesn't exist
that's how orange things orange likes to point out the
hypocrisy of religious blue people orange is quick to point
out that religion has caused a lot of evil in
the world and that even though religious people claim blue
people claim to to be moral and righteous and claim
to be following the principles of God and the the
the lofty principles of Jesus or the Buddha in point
of fact they butcher and slaughter each other and we
have the Spanish Inquisition and we have all sorts of
religious fanatics and terrorists and this and that so really
the world would be much better off without religion that's
how orange thinks and in oranges eyes religion religious people
blue people they're just hypocrites they're full of [ __
] so orange it's much better to just be an
atheist just to admit that you don't really believe in
God you don't really know what the universe holds and
to just admit that you don't know and to just
deal with it orange thinks that blue uses religion as
a crutch and that what religion and thoughts of the
afterlife what that is is that that's just blues inability
to deal with the brute fact that you're gonna die
and that at the end of that there's gonna be
nothing another thing that characterizes orange is of course strong
emphasis on logical thinking and critical observation or just quick
to poke holes and any kind of religious theories or
books orange is big on acquisition of knowledge in a
material sort of fashion knowledge is accumulated like material like
possessions like physical books and facts and how many theories
do you know Orange values credentials from the academic community
like PhDs and certificates and diploma orange values scientific expertise
oranges focused on experience rather than Dogma or metaphysical speculation
that's what universities are built upon no one in a
universities gonna take you seriously if you started talking about
metaphysics or if you present dogmatic ideas they want you
to present articulated well reasoned arguments that are backed up
by scientific data and research studies orange is here to
play to win and to enjoy the competition for orange
self-expression comes through competition to orange the world is full
of opportunities so orange tends to be optimistic and energized
to go out there and build something to make something
of himself and because of this orange feels that losers
the losers in life they deserve what they get that
bum on the street he deserves what he gets because
he's not working hard enough if that bum bothered to
go go to the library read some books and pull
himself up by the bootstraps and work really hard he
can clean himself up and he could scrap together some
money he could be a rags to riches story but
he doesn't want to do that because he's lazy so
he's a loser orange has this interesting aversion to emotions
fuzzy thinking and to love orange is highly left-brained highly
logical and rational and orange believes that emotions compassion love
fuzzy thinking these are all sort of woowoo airy-fairy metaphysical
things these are higher-order phenomena these are not what reality
is really made of and so really your emotions are
just like distorting influences on your ability to just do
cold hard calculated reasoning so when I'm making business decisions
I don't want emotions to come in there I don't
want my my feelings for my employees or my my
feelings for the environment or for the animals that maybe
we're gonna pay over pave over some forest in order
to build our factory or something I don't want to
care about those animals I don't want to love those
animals or think about what they feel or how they
suffer now that that that prohibits me from optimizing my
mechanical strategy for dominating the environment and forgetting what I
want my success for orange success is mechanical factories technology
assembly lines accumulation a big pile of gold that's success
to orange or a well-functioning business with infrastructure factories and
assembly lines and workers and and all of this patents
intellectual property this is success for orange orange is profit
seeking and opportunistic orange will try to squeeze out every
last penny that it can wherever it can however it
can doesn't care about whether it's cheap it doesn't care
whether it's cheesy or whether it's a it's soulless it
just wants to seek the profit orange is all head
over heart cold calculating decisions heart is seen as weakness
that's something for girls and of course orange has a
problem with the feminine orange tends to be the sort
of highly masculine approach to sort of alpha male alpha
dominance over the world and so you see CEOs of
the biggest companies - for fortune 500 companies these CEOs
what are these are these are like alpha males it's
all about climbing your way to the top clawing your
way to the top you Beck's backstab a few people
here and there to get your way to the top
you exploit you manipulate you scheme your political to get
your way to the top and then once you're there
you're gonna be you're gonna be the big boss so
you got a dress dress in a nice big boss
suit with the big big boss Rolex gold Rolex on
yours and on your wrist and all this sort of
stuff orange is characterized by a serging self-centeredness because now
it's all about myself it's all about how do I
accumulate more increase my net worth and maybe also look
out for my family but it doesn't really matter what
happens to my employees or what happens to my community
that stuff doesn't really concern orange orange is characterized by
image over substance if we can fake the image of
success and of happiness then we've got happiness and success
having successes nothing but the image of happiness and success
it's a lack of substance that's fundamentally what materialism is
about and so therefore orange is obsessed with physical appearance
orange wants a good physical appearance from everything around him
all the people around him and of course orange wants
to have a good physical appearance himself women are viewed
as sex objects women are objectified orange doesn't really have
the capacity to love or to relate to a woman
and of course orange is not just exclusive to men
there are orange women as well mmm but still it
it's worse it's worse what a man is orange than
what a woman is orange because when a woman is
orange she still have has her her feminine side a
lot of times and so she still has compassion so
women actually lean a little bit more green than orange
and men tend to lean a little bit more orange
because it's just I guess it's because of testosterone and
because of sort of the the culture we have of
being masculine and not being weak and so for orange
the problem is is orange doesn't like looking weak or
feeling vulnerable or exposing his emotions or her emotions and
of course sex is just treated sort of as a
transaction it's not really about loving the person it's not
about any kind of higher spiritual notions or connections and
it's just a transaction the more sex I could have
with the more hotter people the better and I guess
for women the way this manifests is more like the
gold digger stereotype where the woman sort of just used
sex as a means toward maybe getting into a marriage
and kind of locking in the provider husband who's very
rich and who's gonna provide her with with a nice
car and that and the plastic surgery and the cosmetics
and the perfume and the shopping sprees and all this
sort of stuff so definitely women can suffer from the
sort of materialistic mindset as well for orange there's little
time or attention for people because orange is so focused
on material and orange will use people as material orange
tends to be cold and professional and the relationships tend
to be transactional so the reason I'm relating to another
human being if I'm orange is because I need something
from that human being and the quicker I can get
it the sooner I can break off this relationship because
once I get what I want from this transaction it's
like a business deal then I don't need this relationship
because the relationship is actually a vulnerability because the relationship
puts a certain burner on me I have to care
about the emotions navigating all this to orange this is
all like emotional fluffy girly stuff we don't need that
let me just get my sex then I'm out of
here or let me just get what I want from
that person and then I'm done with him sort of
thing so orange can use and exploit people orange is
like a shark it thrives on activity and sometimes it
can be little bloodthirsty orange can be blind to the
suffering of other people orange can be blind to the
suffering that it causes to other people in its transactional
style of relating orange can be interested in helping other
people but often is not in a personal way it's
a sort of mechanical roboticle way like orange would like
to help people in mass at a distance so if
I can build a website that helps people date or
hook up in that way I could help people as
an orange entrepreneur or as an orange entrepreneur maybe what
I do is I invent some gadget and then I
try to mass produced as gadget by the trillions and
spread it all across the planet and earn as much
as money as possible and yes I'm helping people with
this gadget I invented but at a sort of at
a distance you see I'm not really getting involved with
with people to help them I will help them through
some sort of mechanical process and I'm not gonna focus
on helping them emotionally I'm gonna focus on helping them
materially so if I can invent a gadget that will
help you to maybe have better sex like I invent
some Center sex pill that increases the pleasure of your
sex okay great I'll invent that that's a that's a
tangible material thing and then I'll sell that for lots
of money and I'll make the whole world happier this
sort of thing but uh but like I'm not gonna
care about depression I'm not gonna care about emotional problems
that people have this stuff to Orange doesn't really matter
because the chief problem with mankind in oranges eyes is
that it doesn't have enough material luxury to be happy
and so that's how well we gotta solve orange is
characterized by wanting to do fun things with fun people
orange now likes entertainment because in blue blue was very
uptight blue didn't let itself have fun or to laugh
or to go to a party to relax to let
loose orange now sort of takes that to the other
extreme now it wants to go to party wants to
go drink and do drugs and have fun and listen
to music and do this sort of stuff and go
on vacations and eat lots of food and gorge itself
it sort of becomes a little gluttonous and eveness hedonistic
rather orange is perfectly happy to bend the rules for
personal sess orange believes that more economic growth will solve
all our problems orange tries to monetize everything orange comes
with the rise of profanity and vulgarity because in blue
you could not be vulgar or profane because you have
to maintain an air of religiosity so you couldn't go
around telling people to [ __ ] off and you
couldn't wear shirts with with sort of rebellious slogans on
them and you couldn't be too vulgar you couldn't say
vulgar jokes in public because that would make you seem
like you're not religious whereas orange now the floodgates sort
of open to comedy and profanity and vulgarity and so
now everyone says [ __ ] and everyone says Contin
and everyone's cool with it and now it's sort of
like a race to the bottom of who can say
[ __ ] mo the most with orange comes the
rise of comedy comedians poking fun at the status quo
see a blue person would be scared of poking fun
of religion or the church or of their society this
was all off-limits but now orange because orange sees the
hypocrisy in blue orange goes to town the comedian's go
to town they rip apart religion they were part traditional
values or a part the family values all the hypocrisy
of blue they rip that all apart they use that
his father fought or grist for the comedic mill orange
prefers to use intelligence rather than force so rather than
sending in the tanks orange will just figure out a
way to manipulate the situation so that he he just
buys you out orange takes calculated risks orange looks for
loopholes in everything to see how it can exploit it
with orange there's a rise of the middle class which
tended to not exist in blue and red so this
can be very positive thing there's also a rise of
knowledge workers rather than manual laborers knowledge workers are much
more highly valued than manual laborers with orange the cathedrals
of blue get replaced by corporate boardrooms I love that
image thinking of it like that that sort of sums
up orange in a nutshell relative to blue and to
orange tradition and heritage and family values which were so
important to blue they just become sort of irrelevant who
cares about traditional cares about heritage let me just forge
my own path and make something of myself in in
the world that's how orange thinks all right now let's
cover examples of orange I've already been giving little bits
and pieces of it here but now let's really get
into this I have a long long long long list
of examples of orange now here's what I want you
to keep in mind is that I'm deliberately flooding you
with examples literally hundreds of examples here in a minute
because I want you to see the diversity of orange
there's a lot here it's not that every single orange
person fits into this narrow a little straightjacket it's a
much it's much broader than most people think spiral dynamics
every stage whether it's orange or blue or green it's
not like this narrow category it's a very broad category
and we have people who are towards the bluish end
of the orange spectrum towards the middle or towards the
extreme orange or now towards more orange greenish and then
you have different degrees like people who are just like
super super super passionate about their orange and they're completely
unabashed about it and they just kind of completely let
loose and other people who are orange but you know
they kind of temper their orange they're not like cartoon
caricatures of orange so start to notice this since I'm
going to be giving these examples so perhaps first and
foremost is America as a whole I think the way
that the third world or people all around the world
outside of America view America is basically as epitomizing this
orange set of values and ideals that we're talking about
even though of course much of Middle America is actually
still blue but what we export as a as a
culture through Hollywood movies and magazines and the fast food
in the KFC and the McDonald's in the Walmarts and
the Starbucks all over the world what are we exporting
we're not exporting blue values and broke blue worldview were
exporting orange Americana and of course capitalism capitalism is the
epitome of orange capitalism taken just like full-bore with no
stops that's orange emerging China even though of course China
has a lot of blue in it still and technically
it's communist but the economic system of China is really
capitalism businessmen CEOs business suits corporate boardrooms lawyers Wall Street
these are all the perfect examples of orange the movie
wolf of Wall Street the behavior of the main character
in wolf of Wall Street that's pure orange that's like
orange taken - it's sort of ultimate extreme where Orange
becomes this sort of just like hedonism and just this
kind of reckless pursuit of personal gain and wealth so
much wealth that you have a hard time spending it
fast enough other examples include insider trading the city of
Manhattan sort of is a good example of orange as
a whole hedge fund managers Goldman Sachs Big Pharma Big
Oil the big banks tobacco companies advertising almost all advertising
is an example of orange fortune 500 companies entrepreneurs libertarians
ayan Rand professional sports these tens of million dollar contracts
that that these celebrities and professional athletes get fifa the
NBA the Superbowl sponsorship deals high-fashion Rolexes and expensive watches
nightclubs pickup are you into pickup pickup is a pure
embodiment of orange it's all about how can you manipulate
girls to have sex with the hottest girls as soon
as possible and then move on to the next girl
that's basically what pickup is there are some people within
pickup who starts to lean a little bit more more
green because they start to see the limitations of pickup
but the essence of pickup is pure orange and there's
this belief that all you really need to be happy
in life is just to bang more girls and also
now you're gonna say of course those of you who
are into pickup and I know because I was deeply
into pickup so I'm speaking from experience here you're gonna
say olio but but it's not just about the girls
it's about growing myself and it's becoming a man it's
about weight lifting and eating healthy food and this is
sort of our SD mentality that's still all orange it's
still completely orange it's still completely self-centered it's still completely
you pursuing your own achievement in your own success damn
the consequences damn anything else MOG cow red pill the
bro culture these are all examples of orange Republicans Donald
Trump now Donald Trump and Republicans are interesting because of
course Republicans there's a range of Republicans you have some
Republicans that are very deeply blue but even when they're
really blue have plenty of orange in them they still
tend to be business people and they still tend to
be very influenced by lobbying and the source of stuff
so most Republicans are I would say are probably 50
percent blue 50 percent orange roughly in that area but
then of course you have some Republicans that lean a
little bit more solid orange and less blue and these
are the people that you actually see standing up to
Trump there's a few handful of Republicans who are not
accepting of Trump and and then you have you even
have some Republicans that have a little bit of green
in them these these tend to be the more moderate
ones so there's there's a range of Republicans and kind
of like what they represent but this sort of Ronald
Reagan ideal of like business and deregulation and just like
trickle-down economics this sort of stuff that's what I mean
is orange within the Republican Party and of course Trump
Trump is a great example of orange although most people
because they haven't studied spiral dynamics really so most people
like in the news media they assume that Trump is
pure orange and I'm not just talking about his his
skin or his hair they assume that he's just like
this typical fortune 500 CEO type of guy actually Trump
is not that evolved and towards the end of this
series which element I'm gonna come back I'm gonna talk
about red red which comes before blue you will see
that actually Trump has a lot of red in his
psyche so the reason that Trump is not like your
typical business person he's actually much shade here then your
typical kind of high-functioning corporate executive is because he's got
a lot of red that he hasn't evolved out of
yet and so it's a mixed Trump is like a
mix of pure orange and pure red and because of
this a lot of people in the media don't really
understand why Trump behaves the way he behaves because they
sort of see him as a typical orange person but
then Trump a lot of ways behaves as a corrupt
red person and then that baffles many people because like
but how could he do that because he's that red
that's how other examples of orange include trophy hunting breast
implants plastic surgery Botox liposuction pornography playboy hustler magazine Hugh
Hefner Larry Flynt strip clubs Hollywood as a business now
Hollywood's a little bit nuanced because you have to separate
out Hollywood as a business which is highly highly Orange
it's all about profits versus the Hollywood celebrities who tend
to be liberal green people so when you see at
the at Oscars you see these liberal elite liberal elite
celebrities and progressives who go out there and they criticize
Republicans and conservatives and they they talk about justice these
are the social justice warriors that everyone makes fun of
this source of stuff you know yes in that sense
those Hollywood celebrities mm-hmm they are definitely more towards green
in their political agenda but they're very orange when it
comes to their business careers and Hollywood as a whole
business model is extremely Orange Hollywood really doesn't care about
what it depicts on the television screen as long as
it earns billions of dollars which is why we see
this sort of race down to the bottom with all
these movies it's just of all about action and spectacle
and it's just all about entertainment popcorn flicks you just
eat as much popcorn and and soda as possible and
and you know this movies movies these days they don't
have much soul they don't have much heart they don't
present you with with sort of higher ideals spiritual ideals
these sorts of movies they don't make big money what
makes big money is these these these like stupid transformers
movies these superhero movies which are very very shallow very
materialistic and flimsy but they're popular so they work other
examples of Orange supermodels Silicon Valley start venture capital Bill
Gates and Warren Buffett now again these two are a
little bit tricky because these days Bill Gates and Warren
Buffett now that they're old now that they're getting close
to the end of their life they are becoming more
socially conscious and actually they're moving into green and even
into yellow like Bill Gates with his foundation Warren Buffett
also is donating large chunks of money and he's speaking
out about excess of capitalism this sort of stuff unfair
tax policies how he gets taxed less than his secretary
this sorts of stuff right so these people when they
were younger they were all orange acquiring billions of dollars
and now as they get older they see that off
this orange stuff it it's not really that meaningful and
so now of course you're giving away lost their money
and they're found they're starting foundations they're helping children in
Africa with vaccines and doing science and research and all
this sort of non profit type of work so they
are definitely moving up there I wouldn't classify Bill Gates
today as an orange person he's probably much more green
and yellow than he is Orange now but in his
in his like Microsoft days when he was doing Microsoft
he was probably much more Orange other examples casinos theme
parks Carl Icahn these sort of Wall Street people who
just wanna like buy up companies gut them like merge
them sell them chop them up and make killing on
that damn the employees the Koch brothers damn the environment
will just pass regulations or government law will do government
lobbying to remove regulations in order to maximize our profits
and that sort of stuff and to just kind of
have business run unfettered corporate raiders Walmart Amazon coca-cola McDonald's
Disney Monsanto Microsoft GE AT&T IBM Facebook EA Electronic Arts
all of these companies they are pure orange for the
most part look at what Disney is doing with its
monetization and kind of like buying up of all these
different properties Star Wars Marvel and all this sort of
stuff and then just kind of like monetizing the [
__ ] out of them like you can find star
wars bath salts star wars soap star wars tampons Star
Wars condoms like there's a Star Wars logo on everything
because it sells there's like no shame in what Disney
will do to to monetize its intellectual properties and of
course they are gonna pay for it which you're already
seeing with the degradation of the whole Star Wars universe
this generally happens with all these companies see all these
companies what they do is they just take orange to
their excess to its extreme and so what that does
is basically you're gonna milk the cow dry you're gonna
milk the cow so much so fast that it's gonna
follow her dead from over milking that's what all these
companies basically tend to do that's the problem with rampant
capitalism is that it actually eats itself alive Facebook you
see this with Facebook and now Facebook is trying to
put on this image of becoming more green it's like
we care about your privacy and we care about this
and that we're changing up our business model because Mark
Zuckerberg he was a purely Orange minded individual for most
of his life and now what's happening is that after
he's acquired his billions and all this now he's seeing
that there's more to the world than billions of dollars
and just increasing the number of his subscribers to Facebook
ultimately it's not satisfying so where's he gonna go from
here he's gonna become more green you see he's gonna
start to develop a little bit of a social conscious
he's gonna start to care what Facebook how its influencing
the world house influencing politics you know he doesn't like
the alt-right abusing Facebook or Russia abusing Facebook to you
know to manipulate like this sort of stuff this is
not gonna be satisfying to him so he's gonna be
locking down those channels but of course he's still probably
gonna be very stuck in Orange and so he's gonna
be worried about well yeah I want to I want
to make Facebook more green but I don't want to
lose all my profits and all of my subscribers how
do i reconcile that balance well that's the tricky balance
to figure out so that's what he's struggling with right
now Electronic Arts is a really good example for you
gamers out there you guys like playing games well video
games as a whole is a perfect example of a
stage orange gamer culture perfect example but see maybe you
can start to see the limits of orange when you
look at what EA does with its games and with
microtransactions you see microtransactions not popping up in all these
games of course you hate it these loot boxes and
things were the nickel and dimed you for every little
upgrade every weapon all the sorts of stuff and it
ruins all the good games that you're excited for what
is that that's what happens when orange goes to its
peak that's unchecked capitalism for you right there and you
know actually I was in the game industry back in
2007-2008 and I remember the very moment I was a
game designer at at irrational games and we were working
on BioShock Infinite at the time it wasn't even announced
I was doing pre-production on it and I remember one
of the heads of our studio walked in and he
says yeah I was I was talking to the CEO
of of take 2 which was like the parent company
that owned irrational and he said yeah we need we
need to put microtransactions into Bioshock and I'm like I'm
thinking to myself I don't say this but to myself
thinking what the [ __ ] I am not putting
microphones actions into my video games because I was sort
of like a very idealistic game designer like no I'm
not [ __ ] putting microtransactions into my games and
I actually I left the studio shortly thereafter because I
started my own business and that was that and I
sort of exited my game career but um but is
very interesting and then I didn't play games for quite
a long time mmm and now I kind of I
look back at the game industry I see how much
has changed like it's just completely filled with microtransactions out
just completely cheapened the artistry of games in my opinion
and so a lot of you gamers are feeling it
so there you go and as you feel that you
start to move a little bit more towards green because
you start to see that man orange orange orange unfettered
orange becomes pretty toxic other examples of orange enron research

shows news outlets like CNN MSNBC the liberal media as
its called people like to rail the right-wing lights to
rail on CNN MSNBC as being a very liberal and
there's definitely news anchors on there who lean green but
I mean mostly mainstream news is pure orange it's all
about the advertising dollars it's not about the ideological positions
for them and so if anything the bias that mainstream
news has is not against conservativism it's against well it's
towards rather I should say it's towards is towards money
is source preserving the whole capitalist enterprise it's actually against
true progressivism true progressivism can't really flourish on CNN or
MSNBC because that whole enterprise is all about making tizen
dollars see there can't really be a deep critique of
the whole cable news industry because the whole thing is
just corrupted with money and I don't really see how

poker players the self-help industry like I said the self-help
industry has different segments in it but mostly it starts
with orange like the Tony Robbins sort of stuff tends
to be very materialistic it's all about like how do
you personally succeed and and get a lot of wealth
and then once you kind of evolve past that then
you move into this sort of more Oprah style a
little bit more spiritual more woowoo type of self-help and
then you move into sort of the Deepak Chopra more

self-help which is what actualized org basically is business books

a marketing guru and his whole marketing philosophy is just
basically how do you market the [ __ ] out
of something without any kind of moral compunction whatsoever like
manipulate it exploit anything you can to market it to
its fullest people like Tim Ferriss Tony Robbins ty Lopez
ty Lopez is a really good example of staged orange

founder of skeptic magazine this guy has turned scepticism into
a religious cult and he founded a whole magazine about
it I mean he's deluded to the point where it
would take me a whole hour to explain all of
his delusions but this is what happens with orange is
that you take skepticism to this sort of a religious
level Richard Dawkins another example of this completely lost within
the limits of empiricism and rationality and and evolutionary theory
to the point of delusion physicist Lourdes Lawrence Krauss Daniel
Dennett Sean Carroll Stephen Hawking Christopher Hitchens all of these
people are stuck in orange to a certain degree mostly

race from Star Trek you remember the Ferengi x' they're
all about money the perfect stereotype of stage orange actually
you know the Star Trek races they were actually developed
based off of the spiral dynamics model or more accurately
the work of Clare graves so gene Roddenberry who was
the developer of Star Trek back in the early days
in the 1960s the the very first series with with
Captain Kirk he actually based the different races like the
the Klingons the Ferengi and some of these others on
different stages of the Clare graves psychological model and so
we have Ferengi is orange the Klingons are more reddish
and then you have like the who else blue blue
is the humans are kind of yellowish with their prime
directive not to interfere and you have the like yeah

got Kim Kardashian we got Kanye West Paris Hilton Bernie

against blue the midlife crisis shopping malls fashion shows NASA
SpaceX Elon Musk this sort of cult worship that L
on musk gets these days why is that why is
Ellen musk so popular it's mostly because people want to
glorify Orange and so that they have this sort of
fantasy that technology can save humanity from all of its
problems if only everybody's driving electric cars and we have
a base on the moon and on Mars and we
have SpaceX and rockets and all this sorts of stuff
and we have we're drilling tunnels in the earth if
L Musk's all of his dreams come true then we're
gonna be living in this sort of technological utopia now
some people will object - leo leo but Elon Musk
he cares about the environment and he wants to improve
mankind so isn't that kind of green definitely certainly LR
musk is a much more conscious CEO than probably the
CEO of a tobacco company or Halliburton or something like
that but still you see you see musk is sort
of like on this boundary between green and orange but
still very very heavily orange because sort of technology is
his is his area of expertise and there's no recognition
with an L on musk of like consciousness the importance
of consciousness the importance of emotions these sorts of things
like if he really understood that then he would actually
build his his his companies to reflect that but his
companies are all materialistic companies it's about cars it's about
rockets it's about altering the brain through like modifications through
the skull so it's almost like crude materialistic sort of
stuff and I'm not criticizing him really too much or
blaming him we need all that stuff we need better
technology we need green cars we need better batteries we
need to perhaps have a station on Mars just in
case we we blow ourselves up here you know yeah
we need that but it's not gonna solve mankind's fundamental
problems not at all in fact it's gonna create a
whole new set of problems which of course he is
sort of conscious of you know he's conscious of the
fact that artificial intelligence could could be a very big
problem and so that that's good he's looking out for
us a little bit but then you know the road
to hell is paved with good intentions as they say

example of orange Sigmund Freud's work in a sense of
sort of was identifying all the repressed guilt and shame
that came from blue and from the sort of the
moralization that came from this entire era of of religious
blue society and so Sigmund Freud was one of the
first to recognize that all that shame and all that
guilt gets gets buried deep in the subconscious mind and
creates all sorts of problems and neuroses and of course
he's right about that part but uh he had many

you have the cubism movement Abstract Expressionism surrealism these typify
orange values multi-level marketing is purely orange viagra DDT asbestos
billboards GMOs cloning the Human Genome Project stem-cell research robotics
computers birth control sex education Orange unlike blue believes in
science-based sex education which pisses blue off because blue thinks
sex should be repressed and hidden and shouldn't certainly be
talked about with children and you certainly shouldn't give condoms
to children or to teenagers because that's gonna encourage them
to have sex so instead what you do is you
give them virginity pledges and rings and stuff like that
which of course doesn't work because you can't repress sex
all-you-can-eat buffets Hiroshi Hiroshi is the Japanese word for death
through overwork that's what happens when orange goes to his
extreme Alex Jones Alex show is an interesting character because
he's got like half blue half orange and then another
half dose of crazy just pure crazy so that's three
halves he's a big guy three has to him look
with Alex Jones yeah he fights a lot for these
kind of blue conservative values but also a lot for
orange sort of independent values and of course the way
that he monetizes his entire operation and the millions of
knowledge that he earns every month from selling all these
vitamins and all this sort of [ __ ] nonsense
it's really quite disgusting that's what orange does or orange
monetizes everything and so you get this unholy alliance between
blue ideology and orange success and money and when these
things do come together like they do for a lot
of TV evangelists who make lots of money doing like
preaching prosperity these prosperity preacher evangelists they you see man
it's just as this toxic corrosive and sort of combination
of money and ideology that kind of like lock together
and you man you're not gonna split those apart that
turns into a sort of a stalemate situation where that
person gets gets stuck in at because the money is
so tempting for the ego on the one hand and
then the ideology is so tempting to the ego on
the other hand and when the money comes in based
on you preaching your ideology you become so convinced that
the ideology is true and correct because look the marketplace
is rewarding you for it and so it's just becomes
the sort of self-justifying circle of nonsense and then the
persons weren't just kind of gets lost in it Howard
Stern represents the sort of rise of vulgarity from blue
in a sense Howard Stern was reacting against blue and
if you watched his movie private parts really good movie
it shows you how sort of how he had to
deal with the whole blue radio business and he had
to sort of innovate he tried to be this kind
of shock jock and talk about all this vulgar stuff
on the radio but back in the I don't know
what it was the 70s I guess he was becoming
popular in the 70s or 80s like I'm America was
still very blue and it wasn't having any of that
so he was getting fired from different places he was
creating a lot of problems for saying vulgar words on
the air but eventually he sort of just like the
culture changed so much and he was instrumental to heip
to help American culture transition from blue to orange that
then it just sort of become acceptable and now he
gets paid millions tens of millions of dollars every single
year for just saying bolder stuff all the time and
people love it and that's the shift and of course
that pisses blue off because blue is all about decency
and they see that as a corruption of culture house
of cards is a perfect example this sort of Machiavellian
just like pure manipulation and exploitation playing these political games
just for one's own benefit the movie Avatar do you
remember the main theme of Avatar it was all about
this evil corporation that was trying to mine this this
this rare resource and it didn't give a damn what
the costs were so it destroyed all these trees and
all these blue cat like aliens and all this so
there's this epic clash between between nature and man's desire
to basically rape Mother Earth and so that was uh
that was a really good theme that resonated with our
current times I remember the movie boiler room have you
watched that one that was a great movie that shows
you what orange taken to its excess looks like and
the problems with that and the last example I'll give
you is Sam Harris and I left him for last
because he's a complicated character and I don't have a
time here to go into all the intricacies of the
problems with Sam Harris hmm but the reason I put
him in the orange category and he's not pure orange
certainly he has a lot of green in him he
has a lot of very liberal political ideas and he
even has little shades of yellow here and there and
he does spirituality does the Buddhist thing yeah he does
a little bit of that stuff but but fundamentally sam
Harris's reason for is to promulgate this rationalist logical materialist
paradigm which comes sort of from his reaction against blue
fundamentalist religion that's why yes problems with Islam and Christianity
all sort of stuff and so this is his whole
his whole shtick and the reason that sam harris is
sort of becoming this this cultural icon and he's becoming
so popular precisely because there are so many people who
find themselves in orange and they want a way to
sort of like entrench themselves in this this rationalist logical
materialist atheistic mindset and and sort of react against blue
and blue is such an easy target for orange you
know it's so easy to criticize crazy fundamentalists it's the
easiest thing in the world and so it's sort of
that that sam harris helps his audience to do that
that's the role he fills and so even though sam
harris is more evolved and more nuanced than most of
his audience most of the people who watch him and
who love him and who have become sam harris fanatics
what they are is they're just pure orange they're pure
orange and they're sort of by his body into the
whole orange metaphysics so what's interesting with harris is that
his metaphysics is orange which actually holds him back from
actually becoming fully enlightened and and his but but then
he has the sort of heavily green ideals of human
equality and the sorts of stuff and the other thing
with harris is that he's a moralist so ironically he's
a very confused figure a very sort of complicated figure
as many of us are is that he wants to
maintain the moralism of blue and at the same time
used the moralism of blue against blue so he tries
to moralize to islam and to the christians but he
wants to moralize from a secular position which is just
so funny i in the future maybe i'll shoot a
whole episode about sam harris and jordan peterson because you
know usually i would want to do that because i
don't like to just criticize people and snipe it i
don't want to like get into the mud fleeing contests
that happened with these kinds of political and like pseudo
intellectual debate with these sorts of people but on the
other hand you know these people they spread an ideology
Sam Harris is spreading a rationalist secular ideology and it's
very toxic it might seem to orange people that actually
this is good what Sam Harris doing is good and
it is when you compare it relative to blue so
certainly what seminars is doing is is far superior to
let's say becoming a fundamentalist Christian but the problem is
is that it then it then gets people entrenched into
orange and unable to see beyond orange unable to really
learn about spirituality and non-duality which is quite ironic because
he also teaches meditation so just very this is a
very complicated messy situation with him so maybe in the
in the in the future all kind of picked out
a part a little bit more so what I want
you to notice with all these examples is I want
you to notice how much diversity there is an orange
you don't have to check off every single box you
don't have to believe in every single value on the
list of orange to be orange certain areas you'll be
more involved in and in other areas not so much
as far as orange statistics goes about 30 percent of
the adult global population is orange quite a big chunk
and perhaps even more importantly 50 percent of the total
world influence cultural influence is dominated by orange so right
now people all over the world are predominantly being indoctrinated
into the orange value system through business through science through
politics and especially through the media and through Hollywood and
through video games and through music the government style of
orange is technocratic capitalist oligarchic and corporatist and now we're
going to take a quick intermission because I've been talking
for a long time you need a quick break and
when I come back I'm gonna talk about the the
excesses of orange and how to transcend orange which will
be very important so stick around alright let's talk about
the unhealthy manifestations and excesses of orange remember that every
stage has both its positives and its negatives and for
the most part orange is a huge step up from
blue and for most people most of the time orange
manifests itself in a sort of healthy sense of competition
a healthy sense of entrepreneurial spirit a healthy sense of
Independence and desiring to improve yourself learn new skills and
to develop financial independence and to learn to use technology
and to open your mind to science and to reason
so all of this stuff generally is healthy and the
majority of people at stage Orange are reasonably well-adjusted human
beings who are kind and decent most of the time
however when you get orange without any limits orange that
just runs amok and when you have lots of people
doing orange indiscriminately and when they create corporations and large
groups and organizations and tired governments entire systems entire mobs
of orange then you start to run into all sorts
of problems such as environmental destruction this is one of
the most unhealthiest manifestations of orange because orange doesn't care
about the environment it doesn't care about its effect on
the ecosystem so this leads to pollution deforestation global warming
overfishing endangering various kinds of species from whales to polar
bears to elephants to rhinoceroses to monkeys and so on
all around the world many of the species that's estimated
like 50 percent of of the planet species are now
threatened coral reefs dying plastic waste nuclear waste landfills depletion
of resources like water aquifers like they had this problem
recently in South Africa where the entire entire city their
entire region there ran out of water and so that
is becoming a problem more and more around the world
and it will continue to be as populations are rising
because see oranges idea is that hey we're just gonna
continue to grow our economy indefinitely right they need constant
growth but what happens when your economy starts to max
out what happens when your population reaches ten twenty billion
people on this planet and you're putting a strain on
the environment what happens then does the entire system come
crashing down I don't know what to see but we're
already starting to see the strains of that on our
planet and orange is usually in denial about this because
orange just likes the sort of fantasy that we're all
individuals and that we don't need to worry about ecological
problems we don't need to worry about communal problems but
of course we do need to worry about communal problems
and that's what orange sort of is denial in denial
about another unhealthy manifestation of orange is this sort of
secular materialist indoctrination which happens where people are programmed with
scientific dogmas and they don't think critically about what science
really is and they just assume that science can be
used as a cure-all solution to all problems and they
just assume that science tracks the truth they don't question
the epistemic or metaphysical foundations of science and so what
happens is the rise of scientism science and logic become
the new religion Orange think that it's so sophisticated because
it's left behind the old blue religion of the prior
stage but really what's happened is that God and the
Holy Bible has been replaced by scientists and PhDs and
materialism and the big bang theory and the atomic theory
and that sort of thing and logic see and the
deep irony is that the people like Richard Dawkins and
like Sam Harris who rants against the evils of stage
blew themselves follow to the very same trap of now
becoming dogmatic about materialism and not recognising the limits of
materialism another unhealthy excess of orange is capitalism turned into
a religious ideology many people treat capitalism as though it
is the cure to all of mankind's problems as though
there's like two choices either capitalism or communism and clearly
everyone knows that communism has failed in is evil and
therefore capitalism is all good this sort of very simplistic
notion of capitalism without recognizing its limits another unhealthy manifestation
is the misuse of evidence and scientific studies orange is
quick to use any kind of scientific study that it
can to justify whatever position it basically wants and it
never really seriously investigates the deeper epistemic question of what
is evidence what qualifies as a fact what distinguishes fact
from theory and Theory from truth these are all different
things but orange doesn't make these subtle and tricky distinctions
for orange there just are facts because there is an
external physical reality and that's what science tracks and human
science is just a universal objective discipline and mathematics is
just universal orange doesn't recognize that science is actually highly
human biased there's nothing Universal about science at all and
mathematics is also biased to the human species that's how
the human species looks at the world reason and logic
these are not universal principles this is how the human
species understands the world orange in its excess is in
denial about spirituality god-consciousness emotions femininity intuition love and magic
none of these things are real for orange and orange
has difficulty dealing with them or understanding other people who
do orange is intellectually arrogant because orange looks down at
blue and sees all look at those blue superstitious people
because I am a champion of reason and of logic
and of science therefore I have transcended the whole problem
of human knowledge and ignorance and delusion because I've got
my scientific studies but see what I don't acknowledge as
orange is that scientific studies really don't mean [ __
] you've got a new study coming out every week
every month that's telling you some other conclusion and these
science are extremely these studies are extremely narrow and so
the question is which study should you choose to believe
and and these studies they don't have a holistic big
picture understanding of reality all one of these studies is
telling you is its tracking one little variable within some
some little domain which tells you nothing about how this
plays into the larger picture of how to live your
life and what reality is to use evidence and studies
requires actually a lot of very deep wisdom and intelligence
and intuition it's not something you can do through just
a blindly citing studies the whole problem of science is
that you have to very carefully differentiate between all the
different interpretations of all the data science is not black
and white in the sense that science tells you what's
true or not true because every system of understanding the
world and every fact is actually theory Laden your theories
and your concepts and your metaphysics and your pista mala
G colors what facts you get back from your experimental
data and your microscopes and your telescopes so the theories
that you use to get your facts determines what facts
you get back and so it creates this sort of
self-fulfilling prophecy effect which is the basically confirmation bias but
a stage Orange is not aware of its own confirmation
bias so stage Orange will be very quick to point
out the confirmation biases of stage blue but won't see
it within himself because stage Orange lacks a sort of
metaphysical and epistemic ability to self reflect in an unbiased
way that's because it's reacting it's blue stage orange conflates
blue religion with higher post rational levels of mysticism like
stage green or stage yellow or stage turquoise mysticism and
because of this orange just kind of lumps it all
together this is all it's all religion it's all nonsense
it's all just fairytales which of course is not true
at all stage Orange therefore cannot understand the true origins
of religion stage orange cannot understand why religion is so
persistent and continues to exist to this day and why
I play such a big influence in politics and human
affairs all around the world even today in the 21st
century stage orange just cannot fathom this and therefore stage
orange gets triggered and is always sort of in reaction
against this because fundamentally it's it's it's deluded about the
origins of religion stage orange doesn't see that religion actually
comes from mysticism and from non-duality stage Orange in its
excess cannot understand non duality or mysticism and therefore dismisses
it and therefore for stage Orange there's no possibility for
a deep spiritual connection to reality stage Orange therefore cannot
crack the problem of consciousness stage orange cannot overcome the
duality of mind and body and stage orange cannot understand
post rationalism because it's lumping post rationalism in with pre
rationalism because it's entrenched within rationalism in its excess stage
orange can become narcissistic and self-absorbed it can lack compassion
for others in its excess stage orange becomes oppressive in
a corporate sort of way corporate oppression predatory capitalism predatory
lending unethical business practices high-pressure sales tactics price gouging false
advertising the promotion of get-rich-quick schemes and pyramid schemes which
end up hurting lots of people and ultimately collapsing the
exploitation of third world countries by first world countries cruel
working conditions and sweatshops income inequality gross levels of income
inequality and poverty which stage orange just turns a blind
eye to and is in denial about and the way
that it gets away with this is stage orange traced
is just fit the sort of libertarian justification which says
that all those people who are poor or struggling or
are victims of this these cruel working conditions and sweatshops
and income inequality that actually that's their fault it's because
they're lazy it's because they don't want to go to
school they don't want to learn it's because they're religious
so it blames those people for these systemic problems of
capitalism of course with capitalism you have the problem of
oligarchy which will you see a rising all around the
world and when capitalism gets out of hand the middle
class starts to shrink as the gap between the the
middle class and the lower class and the upper class
upper class starts to earn more and more of the
wealth and so there's just a gross these gross income
inequalities which starts to actually lead to political destabilization and
we're starting to notice that now and it's getting worse
and worse in recent decades and we'll see where ultimately
that ends it could end in some very nasty political
uprisings revolutions Wars riots all sorts of things like that
we don't even know what the what the full ramifications
that will end up being in it's excess orange is
very legalistic it will use lawsuits frivolously as a weapon
wars are waged with lawsuits with expensive lawyers patent trolling
this sort of stuff orange also engages in disaster capitalism
disaster capitalism if you ever heard of it it's actually
really worth studying there's some great books written about this
I have a few on my book list it's quite
nasty stuff because stage Orange has taken on capitalism and
libertarianism as this sort of new religion it believes that
every country and every situation is improved by deregulation and
by freeing up the marketplace the the free marketplace is
supposed to solve all of life's problems and inequalities and
so what happens now when there's a disaster in some
part of the country or some part of the world
then capitalists come in there and they start to deregulate
everything be nationalize everything in an attempt to put in
the perfect capitalist system then what we see actually happens
as we see either a collapse in that region or
we see a even more gross income inequality or basically
you just have profiteering by these uh shady capitalists and
that region of the world is destroyed we've said we've
seen that happen for example with the post-soviet air after
collapse of the Soviet Union the disaster capitalists came in
there and try to make capitalism work but all that
led to is just gross income inequality and then what
happened was that the oligarchs and Russia seized the most
valuable and lucrative national assets all for themselves they basically
stole it for themselves became overnight billionaires and then the
rest of the country now is is under there for
the last decade or two and under Putin and all
of his cronies and his astra capitalism has been tried
in all sorts of other areas like after Hurricane Katrina
other places in the world like in Iraq it's been
tried and lead led to disastrous results yeah it's quite
nasty stuff with staged orange you can have unsustainable economies
because it relies on never-ending growth to maintain stability and
of course never-ending growth is a pipe dream it doesn't
ultimately work so in the short term capitalism works but
in the long term it's really unsustainable so we see
economic and stock market collapses like in 2008 which can
hurt lots of people and further increase income inequality there
is this nasty tendency with stage Orange to privatize gains
and to socialize losses like the big banks like to
do they make very bisque risky bets with their investments
and stuff knowing that hey if the bank collapses the
gun will just have to come and bail us out
because we are so important to them and because they
can't risk destabilizing the entire country so they're gonna bail
us out and meanwhile we're gonna align our pockets and
then who cares what happens in ten years if the
whole economy crashes in ten years doesn't matter to me
because I've made fifty million dollars I'll live on that
50 million dollars for the rest of my life who
cares what's happening around me that's the sort of orange
Wall Street mentality the military-industrial complex can also lead to
some nasty orange type of outcomes like wars for resources
or simply maintaining wars because it's good for business it's
good for manufacturing of all these military weapons Jets bullets
guns doesn't really matter who's getting killed with my weapons
my rockets my nuclear my nuclear weapons or my bullets
as long as I can keep manufacturing bullets don't care
cuz I'm not gonna see where all this all these
weapons get deployed in the third world doesn't matter if
I'm living in New York it doesn't matter it's not
gonna reach me unless of course you're working in in
the twin towers and then it does come back and
it reaches you you see the problem with orange is
that orange isn't systemic enough to see how the damage
that it causes in the third world and all these
other places it thinks that's not going to come back
and bite it in the ass but it will so
these these billionaires who own these coal factories and who
do this environmental pollution well one day they might wake
up and discover that their child has asthma or their
child was polluted or that there's the child has cancer
or they have cancer their wife has cancer or something
like that because of what has been putting in the
in the food or because of the pollution in the
air and then they'll start to understand like oh yeah
I can't just be a selfish bastard I have to
also care about the larger ecosystem orange can lead to
the corruption of government and corporate lobbying which we're seeing
in America right now and it's really corroding our otherwise
relatively good democracy that we have going it's it's it's
really getting corroded by corporate lobbying orange can lead to
arms races and really the worst outcome for orange is
a worldwide nuclear Armageddon orange people like to complain how
the greatest danger for the whole earth is getting overrun
by religious theocracy the stuff in Saudi Arabia and Iran
and by terrorists that's not the greatest danger to the
world the greatest danger to the world is staged orange
the greatest danger to the world is that stage orange
will accidentally trigger a nuclear holocaust or that it will
build some kind of future technology like artificial intelligence which
will end up being the demise of all of mankind
but orange because it only seeks to maximize next quarters
profits doesn't care about that and so in that sense
orange can be so short-sighted that it can basically shoot
itself in the head without realizing that it's doing so
and then it's too late to fix the problem once
the nuclear weapons have been launched stage orange in its
excess can lead to animal abuse and factory farming which
can be quite disturbing and disgusting stage orange actually actively
lobbies and passes laws did you know that they're actually
laws in American states that forbid filming this kind of
stuff that happens in factory farms because it's so disturbing
that if you knew what went into making your sausages
that you loved so much in your bacon and all
that stuff that you would probably never purchase that stuff
ever again stage orange leads to monopolies which prevents small
businesses from being able to flourish stage orange leads to
deregulation which can create all sorts of problems stage orange
leads to shallow consumerist culture and then from that we
have all these other social problems that arise because now
when life is just about materialism and you're only living
for the now and you're trying to maximize your pleasure
in the moment then what happens you basically become a
glutton and a hedonist and they're therefore we get problems
like obesity people eating junk food all the health problems
that come from eating this toxic fast food and all
the the junk food that you find in the supermarket's
all the corn and and sugar and salt and and
fat and trans fat and all the sorts of stuff
and chemicals in your food this of course leads to
increases in cancer increases in ADHD increases in autism increases
in all the diabetes and heart disease problems and erectile
dysfunctions and and all of this what do you think
has come from this is from orange decadence orange leads
to sex addiction porn addiction shopping addiction drug addict Media
addiction unhealthy manifestations of orange leads to the treating of
women as sexual objects which of course leads the destruction
of a family unit increased divorce rates excess orange leads
to the sort of alpha male posturing that you see
happening within the pickup communities you see it happening within
the alt-right trolls online the sort of alpha male mentality
alpha males trying to out alpha other alpha males but
deep down they're really insecure about their masculinity so it's
a sort of a fake masculinity and deep down a
lot of these men they have self-image problems low self-esteem
problems so no matter how good they get at sleeping
with girls or acting macho no matter how many guns
you buy or how much money you earn fundamentally you're
still really not comfortable being a man and you still
feel like there's something wrong with you stage orange leads
to depression and lots of suicides you've seen the suicides
in the news almost every month or every year we
have a new batch of celebrity suicides whether it's Anthony
Bourdain or some fashion design or some celebrity or some
musician of Ichi you see this stuff what's going on
there because stage Orange recognizing not nothing else but materialism
it goes through this whole materialists rickum rigmarole and then
eventually it gets to the end of that it realizes
that materialism is completely Hollow there's no satisfaction to be
found within materialism and so at that point really you've
got two options option one is that you offer yourself
because that's it you're so depressed there's nowhere else to
go and option number two is that you find some
kind of new connection to spirituality you basically have to
evolve into stage green you have to start to reconnect
with human beings if they're reconnect with your heart reconnect
with your intuitions and emotions and your feminine side and
acknowledge there is spirituality beyond just materialism but of course
many orange people don't know that this is even an
avenue for them because they're so indoctrinated into the ideology
of materialism and of rationalism and of this sort of
cold logical approach to life the problem is that science
doesn't make you satisfied many of our best scientists and
Nobel Prize winners and quantum physicists and logicians they actually
end up in insane asylums or they end up taking
antidepressants and they are basically dissatisfied by the end of
the life even though they made all these discoveries and
they think they understand the world but really you don't
understand themselves they don't really understand reality all they have
is they have these scientific models but these scientific models
they don't do anything for you because that's not what
life is about stay George leads to stuff like ulcers
heart attacks insomnia ADHD all sorts of other kinds of
difficult to diagnose and cure diseases like chronic fatigue disease
dozens of different kinds of autoimmune disorders you go to
the doctor you try to get it fixed but of
course your doctor is deeply steeped in stage Orange he's
a materialist and all he's basically doing is he's just
peddling you pills that big pharma this whole capitalist system
is corrupt a medical system we have he just feeds
you these pills which don't actually address any of the
root issues they just try to dumb down your symptoms
a little bit and maybe they work a little bit
but fundamentally nothing really changes and so you're walking around
with all these diseases and conditions a lot of people
who end up transitioning to stage green do so literally
because they get to the point where it's like a
do-or-die choice they're either gonna have a heart attack or
they have to acknowledge themselves as stage Orange is not
working and they have to surrender and transcend to stage
green it's that kind of thing they have to stop
their job get to stop their crazy work schedule they
have to stop shoveling all this garbage junk food into
their mouth because otherwise they will die sometimes it takes
a heart attack to learn that or it takes a
near suicide experience to learn that or it takes a
cancer scare to really get you to wake up in
its excess orange leads to unbridled ambition and competitive stress
the competition becomes too much it becomes a stressful grind
to go into work every single day worrying about competing
with somebody else worrying about some other company out competing
and stealing your lunch taking your number-one spot that that's
fun for a while but you get you get tired
of that and then eventually you want to cooperate more
youth than you want to compete orange leads to workaholism
this whole rat race mentality of just kind of working
working working your entire life and then that can lead
to burnout and in the end orange discovers that there's
no satisfaction no matter how successful he becomes no matter
how many billions you earn no matter how many companies
Elan musk starts no matter if he creates a colony
on Mars or on Saturn on Pluto it doesn't matter
he's never gonna be successful through that I mean he's
never gonna be satisfied through that success see cuz orange
doesn't understand yet that there's no correlation between success and
Happiness that's an illusion that's what was motivating the rat
race but then of course orange is in denial that
he's in the rat race Leo what rat race I'm
not in the rat race but you're there what are
you doing every day why are you going to work
why are trying to be number one why are you
crying all this money and all this material stuff why
are you buying all this stuff why are you buying
these sports cars it's not making you happy why are
you having sex with all these women it's not making
you any more satisfied in fact the day after you
have sex with the most beautiful woman and you buy
the most beautiful car and you have the most expensive
house you ever wanted and you go to find vacation
the day after that you're gonna be at the brink
of suicide that's gonna be the most depressing day of
your life because you've you've gotten everything and now you
discover that [ __ ] it did almost nothing for
me because what I'm really lacking is that spiritual connection
which I've been denying because I've been acting against blue
orange leads to a sense of isolation and loneliness because
orange was always dealing with relationships in that transactional manner
that I talked about so orange never formed any true
deep meaningful relationships with intimate partners or with friends cuz
orange never really valued relationships because they were kind of
fuzzy and emotional and excessive orange leads to a stifling
of creativity art and beauty because of this sort of
selling yourself to the devil a lot of artists and
I think this is maybe what happened with Avicii the
reason of each he committed suicide I mean I'm just
speculating but it's certainly a very plausible theory because this
is very common what happens with orange is that orange
people they get so wrapped up in the trappings of
success you become a celebrity people start to value your
work but then all your managers and your handlers and
all your corporate sponsors they want you to keep pumping
out more it's like pump will pump out more and
more and more write more books make more movies make
them even more popular earn even more millions of dollars
for us and for yourself and for everybody else and
so they kind of get you to buy into this
materialistic fantasy this rat race but then as you're doing
that of course you have to sacrifice your own creative
soul and the artistry of your work in order to
go out there and to perform every single day and
to mainstream your products and then of course your audience
doesn't really like the products as much as they used
to and you don't any you no longer have a
passion for developing these products because they lack that kind
of soul really you would have been happier as an
artist to have a much smaller more niche audience who
is really passionate about your work because you were so
passionate about your work rather than going so mainstream that
it turns into like the next McDonald's where it's just
garbage but hey people buy it orange leads to a
cold technocracy where human beings are just like cogs in
a machine orange leads to a loss of connection with
nature people live in these urban environments these skyscrapers these
modern New York cities and and Tokyo's but they're really
they're disconnected from the way that mankind was meant to
live more you know sort of rural pastoral setting that's
why when you go out into nature and you disconnect
from all these concrete urban jungles your whole your whole
body your whole minds think in a totally different way
spirituality just naturally starts to rekindle with you when you
are out in nature looking at beautiful sunset beautiful canyons
beautiful oceans and islands and this sorts of stuff orange
in its excess loses sight of the human side of
life life becomes mechanical and that's not a fun life
you don't want a mechanical life you want a passionate
emotional human life you don't want to trade money or
you don't want to trade emotional connection and passion for
money which is often what you have to do in
order to be successful in some of these high-paying jobs
that are available orange leads to a dysfunctional health care
system like we're seeing here now in America where lots
of people die needlessly because they can't afford health care
because we have this sort of Big Pharma and insurance
industry dominated health care system and of course Orange is
in denial about all of these limitations especially the Libertarians
out there in the capitalists because hey it's not supposed
to be like that it's supposed to be the perfect
thing orange is supposed to be the highest stage of
course there's green beyond orange and then there's yellow beyond
that and their circle has been there's so much more
beyond orange but orange is oblivious to all that here
are some common slogans that are typical of orange greed
is good just do it the sky is the limit
win at all costs survival of the fittest nothing ventured
nothing gained can't take care of yourself grow up stop
being lazy I made a killing in the market today
trickle-down economics each is responsible for him or herself you
never get a second chance to make a first impression
there is more than one way to skin a cat
we can kill two birds with one stone every man
for himself pull yourself up by your bootstraps that's how
worse things what triggers orange in a nutshell blue green
and turquoise orange is very triggered by religion God creationism
myth and superstition orange is very triggered by the new
age any new age topic including spirituality mysticism any woowoo
pseudoscience type of stuff or just triggered by hippies you
want to trigger orange talk about Deepak Chopra nothing will
trigger Orange more than having Deepak Chopra talk about how
quantum mechanics justifies spirituality and God alternative medicine triggers orange
chakras and healing cancer using your mind all of that
triggers orange reincarnation UFOs intelligent design flat earth auras past
lives the paranormal cult leaders because orange perceives all of
this stuff to just be the superstitious myth that blue
is participating in and orange has concluded that that's all
false now of course what orange doesn't understand is that
it's throwing the baby out with the bathwater it's not
being careful enough with drawing these distinctions and just because
something sounds new-agey or just because Deepak Chopra is talking
about it just because doesn't fit your materialist paradigm just
because it doesn't fit your current established scientific consensus doesn't
mean it's not true because science is always lagging science
is never at the cutting edge there's always like a
hundred year lag between what modern science has a consensus
on and what is true today the 24th century it's
been a hundred years almost to the to the year
since the developments of Einstein's general relativity theory and quantum
mechanics and yet to this day a hundred years later
most of mankind still hasn't fathom the epistemic and metaphysical
ramifications of quantum mechanics and general relativity and in fact
orange will go to great lengths to argue with me
that Leo there are no such ramifications or just triggered
by astrology or just been triggered by feminism this whole
anti feminism movement that we see these days online this
sort of antisocial social justice warrior or your stuff that
you see online this is just orange reacting against green
it's resisting moving integrate or just triggered by irrationality or
unjust triggered by intuition orange doesn't like intuition because orange
want everything wants everything to be quantified and laid out
in a perfect logical linear sequence and of course intuition
is none nonlinear so that makes orange suspicious of intuition
and it makes orange think that intuition is just like
whoo religious dogma when in fact it's not into Wishon
is a very important thing and in fact the most
the most genius scientists rely on intuition to make all
their breakthroughs and discoveries that's the deep irony their orange
can be triggered by philosophy or metaphysics because orange thinks
that philosophy and metaphysics is just empty speculation and it's
not empirical enough for orange orange is triggered by constraints
on business and entrepreneurship or just triggered by having to
follow rules by red tape and by bureaucracy because orange
wants everything to be hyper-efficient orange is triggered by big
government intervention and government regulations and the welfare state orange
wants to do away with all this because orange think
said hey if everyone's just self-reliant and independent we can
all just achieve and we can all be success success
stories rag to riches stories of course the fact is
that the majority people cannot do this and all society
is built like a pyramid so societies basically a giant
pyramid scheme so what orange is not admitting is that
not everyone can be at the top of the pyramid
and so there's a necessity for the welfare state orange
tends to be blind to its own privilege if you
grew up as a white male for example in a
first world democracy you are really ignorant about how easy
you had it in your life and that doesn't mean
your life has been easy but it's very hard for
you to understand how difficult just how difficult other people
around the world or even within your own country have
had it if they were minorities or if they grew
up in an abusive childhood environment or if hmm they're
their mother or their father was an alcoholic or had
genetic predispositions to de pressure to psychosis to mental health
issues like all these things orange to sort of ignores
because in order to even become orange and to become
successful into to compete effectively you already have to have
a lot of things going for you which of course
then you tend to dismiss and you overlooking you know
you don't see the other people don't have that it's
only when you start to notice the gross inequalities that
exist then you start to develop some compassion for other
people you sure to think yourself man what if I
was born with a genetic defect what if I was
handicapped what if I was a woman what if I
was black what if I was a minority what if
I was born with low intelligence what would I do
then could I could I live the orange lifestyle then
would be pretty hard orange tends to get triggered by
losers bums and freeloaders when orange sees a bum on
the street that can trigger orange rather than triggering empathy
for green that would elicit empathy for orange it would
be eliciting judgment or just triggered by socialism communism and
communal thinking orange does not want to think about being
part of a community orange is triggered by touchy-feely topics
like love emotions and intuition orange is triggered by the
idea that the universe has human qualities for orange the
universe must be impersonal there is no way that the
universe can be metaphysically personal because it's just a bunch
of atoms bouncing around in a box orange is triggered
by identity politics and political correctness orange doesn't like political
correctness because political correctness means that orange has to like
care about a group has to fit into a group
gora orange is too independently minded for that or it
just cares about advancing itself doesn't really care about its
community doesn't care about the impact it has on its
community doesn't care about trying to improve its community those
are all secondary factors for orange or just triggered by
things or people who take too long to get to
the point orange is triggered when there's no strategy or
vision or just triggered by people who have a lack
of ambition to rise above average orange is triggered by
lack of focus on results in action too much talking
too much debating too much sharing of emotions too much
relating too much philosophy orange doesn't like this or just
wants to get into action get [ __ ] done
be pragmatic and then go enjoy life or just triggered
by archaic blue societies like in the Middle East by
theocracy by Saudi Arabia by Iran by Communist China sorts
of things orange can be triggered by Hillbillies and rednecks
now let's talk about how to transcend orange firstly read
in-depth about the limits of orange there are a lot
of books being written these days by a lot of
green authors which talk about the limits of capitalism talk
about the limits and the damage that are this being
done to our environment and and so on and so
forth I have a few of these books on my
book list and I've already given you a lot of
points to kind of follow up and start researching on
also read in depth about green because green is your
next stage Green is the stage that chances are you've
been resisting its progressivism it's caring about other people it's
about compassion it's about empathy it's all the sort of
bleeding-heart liberal stuff that orange often has a knee-jerk reaction
against so if you want to transcend orange you have
to open your mind up to green and for you
to do that you need to stop judging green I
would say that the number one obstacle for people right
now in America especially is that they are being fed
with these orange ideologies which judge green and demonize green
such that orange will never have an opportunity to evolve
into green so what you need to do is you
need to stop immediately judging hippies stop judging all New
Age topics stop judging spirituality stop judging religion stop judging
feminism stop judging beta males and soy boys and all
these stupid derogatory monikers that you come up with in
your online forums and in yarn online comments it sounds
funny and cute but ultimately you're hurting yourself because by
putting on this sort of demonization campaign against green you're
ensuring that you will have be able to become green
you understand that whatever you demonize you cannot then begin
to embody and become see that because then you would
be demonizing yourself and of course your ego is gonna
have a huge problem with that now of course many
people who are adamant about orange will say leo I
don't care about that I don't care about stopping to
demonize these people I don't want to become a feminist
I don't want to become this beta male soy boy
drinking sort of thing um I don't want to become
some vegan New Age hippie well then you're gonna stay
stuck at your current level of development and you're not
really gonna be truly self actualizing if you really want
to be self actualizing you need to go beyond green
you need to go through green and then beyond green
to yellow which is where I'm trying to take you
to but I can't take you there as long as
you're demonizing green you see stop judging emotionality stop judging
compassion stop judging love these are all things you're sorely
lacking and you need to round you out rather than
turning you into a beta this is actually gonna make
you more of a man believe it or not it's
counterintuitive stop judging political correctness stop judging alternative medicine judgment
is probably your number one trap and I say that
because that's the number one trap with all stages every
single stage judges every single other stage and that becomes
the biggest obstacle because it closes your mind down to
learning about the next level also to help you transcend
orange ask yourself what is the price of my success
sure I've been working for the last ten years to
become successful and maybe I have become successful but at
what price start to also notice that success is not
equivalent to happiness start to notice that every time you
become more and more successful all that happens is your
mind just comes up with new goals and so you're
in this never-ending rat race and you're never gonna win
that race no amount of success will ever make you
happy notice the technology does not make you happy either
you keep getting new computers new phones new graphics cards
today you have bigger hard drives more RAM you have
higher resolution displays than you've ever had in your entire
life even in just in the last 10 years look
at how much that's changed and yet has it made
you any happier no look at how video games have
progressed video game graphics have increased by probably a million
fold over the last 30 years has that made you
enjoy your games more no that's because the mind just
overlooks all that stuff it's called hedonic adaptation to overcome
orange starts to acknowledge community acknowledge that you are a
part of a community acknowledge that mankind is not a
collection of individual autonomous units this libertarian ideal is complete
horseshit mankind is a tightly knit community and even when
you fancy yourself an individual it's only because of the
community you're in the culture that you're a part of
the education system you're a part of this entire spiral
dynamics this entire model that you're a part of that
you're going through that all of mankind is going through
it's only thanks to that that you have accomplished anything
as an individual you are like an ant in an
ant colony thinking that it's the only ant in town
that it's the king ant when really you're just little
worker ant that's all you are even if you're the
billionaire of some giant corporation all you are still a
little ant you're part of a larger community and how
you interact and relate to an effect that community matters
a lot start to study spirituality serious spirituality not religious
dogma stop conflating religion with spirituality stop being so logical
and pragmatic there's something more to life beyond pragmatism in
fact there is no satisfaction frowned and pragmatism at all
yes you can get a lot of stuff accomplished using
pragmatism but so what yeah you got a lot of
stuff accomplished but at the end of the day you're
not any happier you're not any more passionate about your
life there's nothing pragmatic about passion you understand this what
you want is passion not pragmatism you're a human being
you're not a robot notice the limits of science and
technology notice that over the last 2,000 years look at
how much science has provided for us look at all
the the modern luxuries and material comforts we have hot
showers and air-conditioning and cars and airplanes and computers and
you've got access to porn into movies non-stop and video
games I mean you've got everything you've got more luxury
today the average person even a poor person has more
luxury than the richest Emperor or monarch had even 500
years ago let alone 2,000 years ago and yet are
you any happier no you're always wanting more you're insatiable
Science and Technology keeps delivering all this stuff to you
but so what notice that orange society is unsustainable acknowledge
the limits of capitalism as we've been talking about acknowledge
the damage that business does acknowledge the gross inequality in
the world acknowledge environmental destruction acknowledge animal cruelty and factory
farming acknowledge that socialism isn't bad make a distinction between
socialism and communism of the Soviet era and all the
evils that came about there and recognize that that wasn't
green that was blue I'm not telling you to go
back to Soviet era communism that's not what we're talking
about so stop conflating those two things find a heart-centered
life purpose the way that I talk about in my
course so that your life is not about earning money
or just becoming successful but it's about it's about living
your greatest passion and contributing something worthwhile and beautiful to
mankind into the world stop working so much you work
too much start deepening your relationships stop treating women just
as sexual objects start to actually care about the people
you're relating to stop buying a bunch of stupid [
__ ] that you don't need stop buying sports cars
and luxury watches and all this sort of stuff you
don't need it it doesn't make you happy at all
in fact it just makes you more stressful worrying about
all this stuff and maintaining all this stuff and losing
and breaking all this stuff and having to sustain all
this stuff with with working more and more and more
to acquire more and more money to pay all your
mortgages and all your car payments and all of this
you don't need it simplify your life down try psychedelics
at stage Orange you're ready for psychedelics at stage blue
a stage blue person is not going to benefit from
psychedelics because they're too close-minded but a stage orange person
who is ready to transition into green psychedelics will open
you up to true spirituality it will show you the
possibilities of consciousness that you never imagined were possible under
the materialist paradigm psychedelics can break apart materialism completely for
you but you have to approach them with an open
mind reconnect with nature and animals take a 10 day
solo retreat in the woods where you just sit in
the woods out in nature for 10 days straight doing
absolutely nothing you'll experience more growth and spiritual development in
those 10 days and you probably have in the last
10 years of running around in your rat race read
and start to do new agey type of stuff go
to music festivals try alternative and holistic medicines and therapies
start recycling start treating your employees like humans and not
just dispensable cogs in a machine notice that luxury is
hollow let go of data and analytics and trying to
quantify everything acknowledge the limits of analysis logic and quantification
notice that things within life are more than the sum
of their parts and that reductionism does not account for
everything in reality and start to become a holistic thinker
rather than just a narrow minded technical analyst surrender control
manipulation and the desire to game the system and to
exploit the system notice that exploitation doesn't actually satisfy you
notice the disconnect within your heart from your feelings and
your emotions and start to connect with that more cry
more speak your heart more be more emotional embrace your
feminine side embrace your intuition start to practice compassion empathy
and love cut out video games television and social media
and lastly to transcend orange the master key to transcending
any stage is contemplation and self-reflection think about everything I
talked about think about all the stuff you've read in
all the books that you should be reading and all
the research that you've done take notes on it and
then actually analyze your behavior see how you're behaving in
this orange mechanical style notice that orange is just a
mind virus that you've been programmed with there's nothing special
about it there's nothing important about being rational or logical
or about science or any of this you're just acting
out patterns in the same way that the blue religious
Fundamentalist is just acting out patterns so are you the
only difference is that you've been indoctrinated with a set
of secular values and you're living them out as though
they're your religion as though that's the only way to
live life and what you're discovering is that it's completely
shallow and Hollow and it makes you depressed and anxious
and stressful and it gives you all sorts of bodily
diseases that's all it does but to really understand that
you have to contemplate and self reflect sit alone and
think about everything marinate in it until it seeps in
deep into your mind and you start to see the
limitations that will then start to get you moving up
to green so that's orange in a nutshell a lot
of details here I felt like we should really cover
it exhaustively because most of you are probably very stuck
in orange I know I was for a long time
and I still am to a certain degree but man
it's really liberating to move beyond orange it's in green
and yellow where you start to experience the the real
joy and potential of life so in conclusion I want
to warn you again to be very careful about using
this model to stereotype people if you're doing that you're
abusing this model orange nor any other stage is not
good or bad they are healthy and unhealthy manifestations of
every stage do not make the mistake of starting to
demonize orange in yourself or in other people that's something
I'll talk more about when we're talking about green because
green has to have the problem and demonizing orange recognize
that you probably are not pure orange but you have
shades of other colors you're probably combination of blue orange
and green maybe feel a bit more evolved than your
combination of orange and green and and yellow maybe but
notice that this model that we're talking about is is
a nuanced and complex model it's not designed to put
people into narrow little pigeon holes and it shouldn't be
used as a weapon against other people you're supposed to
use this model on yourself to help you to see
where you need to go what your sticking points are
where you're judging too much and it's supposed to give
you strategies for how to evolve to the next level
that can be very useful this model can cut your
learning curve down by a factor of 10 so a
person who doesn't know about spiral dynamics and is stuck
in orange without spiral dynamics you'd probably stay stuck in
orange for the rest of his life maybe if he
started hanging out with the right people and he started
contemplating and introspecting a little bit he would start to
recognize the limits of orange and maybe he'd start to
evolve a little bit into green and maybe he'd be
half orange and half green by the time of his
death with this model that person can realise the limits
of orange and see green and see beyond green into
yellow and that into turquoise see that whole thing learn
the things I'm talking about learn how to transcend follow
this through and then in three years he can move
from orange to green and then in three more years
from solid green to yellow and then from there in
three or four five more years he can experience non-dual
States and mystical States and really crazy stuff that would
have been completely unimaginable to an orange person so that's
that's the practical value of this model remember that you
cannot skip over orange so if you're heavily in blue
and you're just starting to get into orange you're gonna
have to go through all of orange you can't skip
it to go to green and that's gonna be the
next stage which we're gonna talk about in the next
part of this series that's it I'm done here please
click like button for me and come check out actualized
org that's my website check out my blog I've been
posting a lot of insights there sharing a lot of
videos and resources that you'll probably find interesting check out
my life purpose course that will help you to take
your career really what life purpose course will do will
take your career from orange to and still make you
very successful at the same time so understand that to
transition into green doesn't mean that you have to surrender
all your money and surrender all your success you can
still have success green builds upon orange green doesn't replace
orange every single level creates a stack which is something
that people misunderstand so anyways check out my life purpose
course come sign up to the forum we have interesting
discussions there and actually speaking of the forum what I'm
doing with this whole series is I'm creating these mega
threads we're gonna have a separate thread for stage blue
green orange yellow and turquoise and then we're gonna go
back to red we're gonna have we're making these giant
threads of examples where we're taking prototypical examples from YouTube
videos of people behaving like stage green or orange or
red or whatever and then we're posting them there so
that you can go through you can look at all
these examples you can clearly see oh yeah this person
is like a orange robot or a green robot or
a yellow robot and so that's um that can be
very instructive to look at those examples that takes all
this abstraction and theory and boils it down to something
very concrete so come check that out and come check
out my book list I recently updated the book list
so there's a over 200 I open a book there
and really the last thing I'll tell you is if
you want to learn spiral dynamics it's not enough for
you to just watch this six-part series that I'm gonna
release even though it's in a lot of depth you
need to actually sit down and read some of the
literature read some of the books and I'll be adding
a few more new books that I'm currently still in
the process of reading I'll be adding those soon to
my list which are gonna take you even deeper into
the model of spiral dynamics there's a lot of research
that went into this model it's extremely complicated so a
lot of people who criticize for all dynamics do so
because they've just heard about it and they think it's
this simplistic stereotypical judgemental model that's not what it is
at all it's actually grounded in some real science but
you have to do some reading and some serious study
to start to wrap your mind around it the beauty
is is that it's gonna be highly worth it you'll
be amazed at how great this model is at helping
you to understand and make sense of everything that's going
out around in the world it'll sort of orient you
position you and then of course always remember that this
is just a model and that eventually you will have
to let go of spiral dynamics at some point you
will grow to such an advanced state of consciousness that
you will see that spiral dynamics is holding you back
and you will let the whole model go that's sort
of the ultimate stage that we're going to take you
to but you're probably very far away from that so
we have to build up to it with baby steps
that's why I share a lot of models and concepts
with you because most people are not capable of just
going from where they are now straight to enlightenment if
we could do it that way we would do it
that way but hey I have a difficulty doing it
myself so surely you're gonna have a difficulty doing it
as well because one of the things you learn from
Sproul dynamics is that human development comes in stages and
steps and oftentimes it takes a long time for you
get to a point where you're even receptive to reading
a certain book or hearing a certain idea a lot
of energy with my work has gone into trying to
undermine your epistemic and metaphysical foundations because people who are
stuck in orange which is where I know most of
my audience is they can't understand when I talk about
non-duality when I talk about God when I talk about
consciousness or intelligence or I talk about what my highest
vision is for you where you can go how to
become a sage how to have crazy mystical experiences how
to properly interpret and use psychedelics none of these things
are understandable given a materialist paradigm so we have to
work really hard to break that [ __ ] down
to deprogram you and most people they're so closed-minded they're
so programmed that they don't even know that they've been
programmed so they don't even know that they need to
be deprogrammed so a lot of actualizado already is helping
you to deprogram you might wonder Leah why don't you
just talk about enlightenment all the time because most people
are not ready to here about enlightenment and even if
they hear about it they don't understand it they can't
put it into practice it'll take them probably five or
ten years to be able to start to put that
stuff into practice so we need to build a staircase
that people can ascend and so that's what I'm doing
with actualized Dorian it's it's quite exhausting it takes a
lot of energy it would have been a lot simpler
for me just to talk about enlightenment all day long
like some non-duality teachers do but the problem is that
that makes your audience very small because the only people
who can understand what the [ __ ] you're talking
about is the people who are already at hi greener
at yellow you're not getting through to the blue into
the orange people so this was part two of the
series make sure that you stick with me for the
next part which is going to be the green stage
that's going to be a very important stage a lot
of you are sort of borderline at that stage and
I want to talk about the limitations there and how
to transcend beyond green into yellow so stay tuned for
that you
