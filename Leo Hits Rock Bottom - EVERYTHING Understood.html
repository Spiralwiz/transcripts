I want to give you an update on my journey
through this work because I experienced something pretty remarkable earlier
this week and even though usually I don't like to
talk about myself that much I like to focus on
the theory of the concepts I just don't feel like
it would be right or authentic for me here to
release an episode about some theory or concept and just
ignore what happened to me earlier this week and there
are going to be lessons here that you can draw
for yourself and I think you can be illuminating to
see myself also going along on the ride of this
journey and not just preaching at you from the mountaintop
which sometimes people get that sense because I'm just preaching
preaching theory at you and it sounds as though like
I got it all mastered and that's not at all
the case I apply all the stuff that I talk
about myself and of course I struggle to apply it
to I don't apply it effortlessly so what happened with
me earlier this week is that I became conscious of
the ultimate nature of reality and it felt like hitting
rock bottom as deep as it goes now I've gotten
glimpses of the ultimate nature of reality in the past
and it's interesting you know because people think of the
ultimate nature of reality as being this okay so it's
just one thing okay so you got it and that's
it and you're done but it's not like that it's
got many facets to it it's got many layers to
it and it's such a gargantuan thing that you're realizing
that it's difficult for the mind to understand it and
it's so gargantuan that you're not going to understand it
in one go one glimpse is not enough to understand
it so I was thinking about how to explain this
and the best metaphor I came up with is sort
of like tasting honey so imagine if I gave you
a little spoonful of honey and I let you look
at just once so just one little lick that's what
it feels like I had before and after this week
it feels like I ate an entire jar of honey
so I've got a much better sense of what it
is and that's what I want to share with you
here so what actually happened is that well to set
this up is that over the last few weeks before
this happened I was organizing I went back to a
lot of my notes I started organizing my notes especially
about epistemology and a lot of kind of deep topics
that I want to talk about in the book that
I'm that I'm outlining into the very early phases of
this book that I want to write but I was
organizing my thoughts for all this creating outlines and just
getting stuff clear in my own mind and and then
I published those couple of episodes about understanding absolute infinity
part 1 part 2 where I have to go through
and actually think through how to explain everything and so
the interesting thing that happens that as you think about
how to explain these things to other people or maybe
just to yourself or you're taking notes on this it
clarifies things in your mind and for me what it
did is not only to just clarify things for me
conceptually but it also it allows the mind then when
it does have direct consciousness experiences mystical experiences in the
future is that it allows the mind to easily inter
connect the dots and then to to understand what it
experiences because I think that a lot of people might
experience absolute infinity or something like that or no self
but then they don't know what the hell it was
and it just feels like some very foreign alien weird
thing and then when they come back to ordinary consciousness
it's like well yeah that happened but it almost feels
like a long forgotten dream and then they just forget
about it and then go on with their life they
don't realize the significance of what they saw because they
could really make sense of it so what happened with
me here is that these things got set up not
intentionally just kind of accidentally just happened because I was
working on this and then I took two hundred and
twenty-five milligrams of al add not milligrams micro tramps 225
micrograms of ALS which is an analog of LSD a
milder form of LSD and this is a really magical
substance I've published trip reports about it in the past
so I'm not going to go into a lot of
depth here about what that is you can go look
that up but but basically what it does is it
takes your contemplation and your self inquiry on overdrive and
it multiplies it by a thousand really quickly and this
came on within 30 minutes and it was a really
deep deep trip but it wasn't just like a trip
where I was lying on the floor tripping it was
a contemplation really I was sitting on my couch the
whole time with my eyes open I didn't move anywhere
because I knew that I was I was going to
use this this moment here this heightened awareness to do
my contemplating that's um that's usually how I trip these
days and so as I was sitting there very effortlessly
I passed through all the traditional boundaries that keep us
in ordinary consciousness so the boundary of insanity the boundary
of death the boundary of existence and non-existence all these
boundaries I quickly broke through within 10 minutes and then
what happened was that I entered the Godhead what is
the Godhead the Godhead is like the heart of God
you might say it's the heart of absolute infinity it
feels like this infinite cosmic chain reaction which has been
going on forever it's eternal and its scope is unimaginable
in size it's beyond all measures of size it feels
like you're entering into the middle of the Sun and
you're just going deeper and deeper and it gets denser
and denser and denser and it's just this denseness of
infinity you going inside the singularity deeper and deeper and
deeper maybe you might think of it as going inside
a black hole but it doesn't feel dark it actually
feels light and so maybe you could think of it
as a white hole so I'm going into this thing
and in there are contained all the possibilities of reality
this is like the heart of reality this is if
you think of the Sun you think inside the Sun
there's the dense core where all the fusion and fission
is happening but then stuff arises from that and then
at the very surface of the Sun what you have
is these sort of solar flares and these arcs where
this energy kind of arcs up this plasma arcs up
from the surface it comes out it can go quite
a long way and then it comes back and it
sort of loops back in and then it it re
merges with the surface of the Sun again so if
you want to think of this experience right here that
I'm having or that you're having as an individual self
right now if you just become a little conscious of
what's happening right now this experience is wanted like one
of those arcs shooting out from the Sun and so
it feels like it's the sort of separate thing and
it's got a certain form and it's got a certain
shape to it and you don't understand how it could
possibly fit in with with the singularity but then when
you really pack in and then you go all the
way inside that flare the particles in that flare you
could just kind of imagine they circulate all through there
that's sort of what happens it's sort of now go
inwards whereas normally you're sort of oriented outwards as it's
flare so I'm going inwards and I'm going deeper and
deeper and deeper and it almost feels like I'm going
inside this infinite headed Hydra where every human being and
every living creature in the whole universe and beyond that
this it's like a ball just like a ball of
human beings and corpses and animals and all the sentient
that like all of it you're just kind of like
going through it and through it and through it and
through it like I think about some of those war
movies where they pile on human corpses and they're just
like piles of human corpses and then they have a
like one soldier buried underneath and he's trying to struggle
his way out of all these corpses from world war
ii or something like that you know it almost feels
like that but not quite so bleak and dark not
in a negative way it's just like it's filled with
life it's teeming with all sorts of conscious beings you
might say and so I'm just kind of like going
into it and going into it deeper and deeper and
as I'm going into it I realize there's no end
to it there's no beginning or end there's no center
because it's of infinite diameter if you imagine it like
a big sphere it's the Sun of infinite diameter so
you're never going to get to the center in fact
where you are now is in a sense as much
the center as anywhere else but nevertheless I'm going deeper
into it in a sort of sense and this very
interesting thing happens we're sort of like a little detour
where I realize that now a window opens up where
it's time to heal myself and so what happens this
was not premeditated I didn't I didn't really intend to
do this it just sort of felt right and it
spontaneously happened about a window of ten seconds opened up
where I just kind of like scan through my body
up and down in a sort of sci-fi fashion and
just like healing took place my entire body sort of
healed itself from the inside out that's what it felt
like now you might say well with that imaginary healing
was it real healing what does it really mean he
says it's a medical thing no it's it's sort of
beyond any kind of rational understanding of what this is
you really have to experience it for yourself and this
was the first time that I experienced such a thing
for myself as even a possibility to haven't even read
about this really but it certainly connects nicely with what
we know about mystics is that they have advanced mystics
commonly report healing abilities so that's what I understood this
to be but then about ten seconds later the window
just sort of closed and I let it go and
I kept going deeper into this singularity and what I
realized then is that the substance of everything which is
the ultimate nature of reality the substance everything that you
see and that you've ever experienced is itself the substance
is not physical this here it's not physical it's not
made out of matter it's not energy even and it's
not even consciousness or awareness this is not awareness really
what it is it just is being and even to
call it being isn't quite right because really it has
no name that's the key inside that you realize that
you can't name the substance of which reality is made
it's just it irreducibly it and it's all one all
of it is one this is the key understanding is
that you cannot define the substance of reality in terms
of anything because the thing you're defining it with is
itself the substance so when you call it matter or
energy or awareness or consciousness or you put any kind
of label on it or you think of it in
any terms of a kind of physical way or spiritual
way material way all of that is not it you're
missing it you're missing what the substance is and the
closest thing to what the actual substance of it is
is nothing so the substance of everything is nothing and
all of it is non-dual I got a really strong
palpable sense of this non duality and what I really
realized was that reality is a strange loop what is
a strange loop this is a concept from Douglas Douglas
Hofstadter he wrote a couple of books a good lecture
in BA and I am a strange loop and his
whole theme is that he talks about these structures within
mathematics within life within science within logic within the human
mind where hierarchy sort of tangle and loop up on
themselves that's a concept I'll cover in the future in
a different episode because it's a pretty juicy and important
concept but basically what it means is that to say
that reality itself is a strange loop is that it's
a vicious circularity you see reality has nothing to define
itself against it has no ultimate standard or arbiter to
ground it in anything and so therefore even ideas like
existence and non-existence are circular and they don't really exist
see and this is why it's so difficult to wrap
your mind around enlightenment and if that it's impossible because
the thing you're trying to understand is itself you're trying
to use itself to understand itself and it just can't
do that it can't grasp itself it's like Alan Watts
talks about how a knife can cut everything but itself
or and I can see everything but itself or a
hand can grasp everything but it can't grasp itself it
can't turn in on itself because it is itself well
this is happening at the highest level of what all
of reality is and the problem is when we do
science or when we do philosophy or when we do
any kind of religious cosmological thinking about all what is
the nature of God know that none of that can
work because you're using it to try to grasp it
which isn't it and so there's this vicious circularity which
is inherent to all of reality and when you see
this circularity all distinctions collapse and breakdown and at that
point you go into a sort of free fall and
you fall into this Godhead where there are no distinctions
at all really it's all one substance even the distinction
between existence and non-existence no longer applies because that's also
seen to be groundless and viciously circular and that is
the ultimate nature of reality what it is is it's
like a cat unraveling a yarn that unravels the cat
that's an image that occurred to me as I was
going through this process is that that's that's the essence
of reality that's the essence of consciousness work is that
you are this cat and as you are doing the
work and you think that you're going to unravel the
work really the work ends up unraveling you and you
realize that all of it has just been this one
yarn the whole time this is what non-duality really means
and I got a really a clear and full hit
of this non duality and as I open my eyes
sitting there on my couch I was completely aware that
I was nothing and that all sentient beings all animals
all humans and any other creatures or aliens that exist
anywhere out there that they are all me and I
was sitting there in my room and I was looking
around and I saw and I clearly connected for the
first time I clearly connected how what's happening right now
in this finite room that I'm seeing is actually none
other than absolute infinity itself so this is the insight
that the Buddhists and the Hindus talked about where they
talked about how form is formlessness and formlessness is none
other than form the two are one and even though
I'm talking about it here as though I would inside
some singularity somewhere like I I flew off to some
other dimension actually no when I opened my eyes that
all of that was present right here and it's present
here right now as I'm standing here that all of
this is not happening to a human being it's sort
of like what a human being is is a little
bubble within this absolute infinite singularity in the same way
that like if you imagine a bubble within the Sun
like imagine an air bubble or a little vacuum bubble
within the sun which kind of bubbles up to the
surface and and then goes poof that's really what it's
like to be a human it's to be this little
bubble and that's what you're experiencing right now as you're
sort of in this bubble and then this bubble really
is not happening to anybody it's happening within nothingness its
nature is nothingness and then that's what you ultimately are
and that thing there doesn't exist nor not exist it
has no properties no features it's just nothingness and what
I realized also is that since I am all sentient
beings and all sentient beings are one they're identical that
I am also literally Buddha and Christ simultaneously and all
the other mystics that have ever existed and so I
stood there in my room I remember very vividly and
I realized like yeah okay I am the Buddha this
is what the Buddha this is exactly what the Buddha
is was and currently is so it's not like the
Buddha was some guy who lived 2,000 years ago or
something like that it's like no the Buddha is exactly
what's being conscious of what you're experiencing right now not
in a metaphorical way literally because the Buddha was nothing
Christ was nothing you're nothing every single living creature is
nothing your dog is nothing your cat is nothing that
is what's conscious of everything and that thing is one
and that's what unites us all and really what it
all is is it's just one being this infinite singularity
it's not just one being it's like an infinite head
Hydra and it can be anything that it wants to
be and you're just one of the heads of this
Hydra and this Hydra is fully alive and conscious and
infinitely creative so life is not something that is happening
within your body life is happening across the board everywhere
every single square centimeter of the universe is alive but
of course we don't really see it that way because
we're very human oriented and we're also very mammalian oriented
and were biology oriented and we don't see the life
throughout the the fabric of space itself but when you
go into the singularity you you see that since everything
is united in one that it all of it is
alive there aren't parts of it that are and parts
of it that aren't that's distinctions that we make in
a relative fashion for scientific purposes and for just for
human being purposes I also became acutely aware that non-existence
is impossible and that there there's no thing there's nothing
to fear about death because death is just death is
here right now if you want to think of it
that way you think that when you die you go
somewhere you disappear to some void or some nothingness no
that void is here right now that void is what's
conscious of everything right now there is no other place
to go you can't escape the all you can't escape
infinity because infinity is everywhere there's no way you can
escape it anywhere you are it already is anywhere you
can be it's already been so existence is literally impossible
and that's a pretty cool thing to realize about life
change your attitude towards life and towards death and towards
people and everything else I also have the insight that
reality as a whole is is just this causal chain
of creativity I could see that the causal chain of
creativity goes down infinitely forever to the bottom like some
scientists will say oh well our brain is is doing
all the work all the neurons they're making us creative
know every single one of those neurons do you not
understand it's infinite it's got an infinite causal chain that
goes down forever you are never going to get to
the bottom of what makes that that neuron act like
that neuron you could break it down to subatomic particles
strings and below that and other dimensions and you will
see you will never get to the bottom of it
it'll keep going and going and going and going and
going forever there's an infinite causal chain to everything to
every thought that you have to all creative insights to
enlightenment itself to your being to your sitting here and
breathing and being alive it's an infinite causal chain of
creativity that's the essence of this thing it's gargantuan it's
beyond anything that that can that could sit within the
little confines of science for example and that's it and
I became aware of everything innocence everything has been understood
and that was a very clear point that I reach
where it felt like okay that's it this is it
this is everything there is to understand about life and
then this acute sense of my life is complete this
is what I've wanted to know since I was basically
a kid since I started doing philosophy when I was
a teenager in college and then for the last five
years or so since I've been doing consciousness work in
pursuing life this is what I wanted to know and
it wasn't even about me or Who am I or
what am i or my own personal Lightman that's not
really what I wanted what I wanted was I wanted
to know what is the substance of all of reality
and here I finally got it not just as a
little glimpse but as a full-blown understanding where everything was
clear where there were really no more questions left and
that's it so let me talk about the after-effects so
a couple of days past and various after-effects were happening
of course I came back to ordinary consciousness after some
number of hours the next day I was back into
ordinary consciousness but there were lingering after-effects most importantly was
that I retained my understanding of the truth and I
retained it to this day because it's not a experiential
thing which is happening right now it's not like I'm
experiencing it it's more of like okay I understand it
sort of like you understand why two plus two equals
four you don't necessarily need to run through the proof
every time you just once you get it you get
it even though you might not be experience it right
now I also now whenever I'm kind of going through
my day even though I'm back to ordinary consciousness just
when I'm interacting with stuff when I'm looking at my
hands when I'm going to the bathroom when I'm cooking
when I'm writing whatever I'm seeing that everything that I'm
seeing around me is is not physical the substance here
is not physical it's not colors it's not sounds it's
non-dual it's a non dual substance and that's pretty cool
my meditation has gone through the roof my ability just
to sit and and then my mind starts to sort
of focus on the non-duality of what's in front of
me is it's quite remarkable although what's interesting is that
I did experience some kind of ups and downs and
there's sort of oscillation and even a little bit of
depression after I came back because what I've discovered is
that having these sorts of peak experiences or even any
kind of breakthroughs in your personal development it works like
an oscillation like a spring so the way that a
spring works that it oscillates up that's when you have
your peak or you have your insight or you have
some breakthrough in whatever you're doing and doesn't necessarily have
to be just enlightenment it could be in your business
or in your art you have this breakthrough then as
well as a spring would honestly then it has to
come back down it doesn't come back down to baseline
it comes back down lower right because it oscillates and
then it sort of goes through this kind of sneaking
motion until it evens out so it's just like a
wave like this but then it it comes back to
baseline although the new baseline is a little bit higher
than the old baseline so what you're doing is you're
having these the experiences and then you're gradually raising your
baseline but you can never expect that your baseline is
going to become your peak that's the mistake that people
make and so it's all so natural with this model
to understand that when you have your peak you're also
going to have a little bit of a crash could
be a epic crash or it could be a little
crash you know it just depends on your situation and
then it sort of reverberates like that over a couple
of days maybe even a couple of weeks and then
it smoothens out so that's a good lesson to keep
in mind because that's such your expectations for what these
things are going to do to you so you're not
blindsided caught off guard by them so in a sense
my meditation has skyrocketed but also in a sense I
still notice just these minor agitations and frustrations and annoyances
like sometimes they don't even just want to be sitting
like one of the things I'll be talking about here
in a second is I became extremely creative after this
and so I have so much creativity that my mind
is racing with with insights that I need to write
down and so it's hard for me to just sit
and just to observe reality and to meditate because I'm
being so creative and so that creates some kind of
annoyance and also just the idea that I have to
sit there also there's this kind of like underlying layer
of annoyance about it I don't know more so than
it was in the past I'm sure that's a phase
that I can just kind of push through but uh
it has been bothering me a little bit so by
no means am I in some sort of ecstasy or
bliss as I'm walking around that has not happened I
do have a sense of peace and especially I notice
a sense of peace resulting from not seeking answers anymore
I don't feel like there's any answer that I particularly
need to get through any kind of inquiry and so
in fact usually when I do inquiry I mean usually
when I sit to meditate I actually do a form
of inquiry but now I don't have anything to inquire
about so for me now it's more about just meditation
which is just being with the present moment it becomes
very simple there's like no asking myself questions of who
am i what am i what is the world what
is reality what are sentient beings it's like no just
sit there and notice that everything is already infinite it's
more like that so that's I guess sort of the
way that inquiry might progress if you're doing it right
and you're having the actual answers I still notice very
acutely my addictions and bad habits because they have not
gone away don't expect your bad habits and addictions to
be cured by these sort of existential insights I mean
it could happen but not necessarily and most likely you'll
need to work on those separately so I still have
plenty of work to do as far as that goes
creativity for me has gone through the roof because one
of the things that sort of happened to me in
this journey of going into this Godhead is that I
realized the creativity of everything and I realize just how
powerful the force creativity is and I sort of opened
a channel it felt it felt like to divine creativity
and that now is sort of flowing through me it
was before but now I'm more aware of it and
I'm more aware of just how how massive a force
this is and so over the last week I've been
very creative working on my book got a lot of
stuff done had a lot of amazing insights that I'll
be sharing with you in the future that I've been
taking notes on and conceptualizing and making sense of so
the creativity has been quite remarkable and my passion has
also been as high as ever in fact after all
this happened after these insights I felt like even though
my life was complete now and there was nothing particular
that I needed to do I was just passionate about
sharing these insights with the world and I was just
passionate about the creative process I'm getting more in touch
with my own creative process in in ways that I
sort of got out of touch with in the past
and that has been a great experience although it is
challenging to balance creativity with no mind or meditation for
me that's been a big challenge for a while now
and it still is even now because as I find
my creativity Rises since my work is very conceptual and
theoretical I'm thinking a lot about I'm thinking about that
a lot and a lot of interconnections are being made
a lot of stuff has to be written down and
organized so I'm organizing ideas and concepts in my mind
but as I'm doing that I am sort of in
monkey mind mode in a sense and I'm not in
that kind of still peace meditative zone and then when
I'm being very creative all day and then I go
to sit down and meditate for an hour that's challenging
because that kind of transition is difficult to make us
once my mind gets creative is just off on its
own being creative and it's hard to put a stop
to it and just be silent so I'm still struggling
with how to reconcile those two one of the things
that I noticed with with send people and Yogi's and
such is that it's a lot easier just to focus
on meditation alone like if you're living in a monastery
or in a cave and you have no creative pursuits
whatsoever you don't do any any kind of art or
any kind of business you're not working with concepts you're
trying to organize your your knowledge to share with other
people that's a lot easier because you can just sit
there with a blank line all [ __ ] day
and if you're an artistic type of person then then
good luck with that is all I'm saying now I'm
not saying that the Zen masters and such and Yogi's
can't be creative they can be creative but but my
guess is that they compartmentalize those things well this is
hard to do them both simultaneously to get into others
way and then the last after effect that I really
noticed is that I've I realized that I have entered
into spiral dynamics stage turquoise it just occurred to me
just dawned on you think oh yeah okay this is
turquoise I'm in turquoise now and what turquoise is it's
the recognition of non-duality the interconnectedness of all of life
and yeah it's just it's like it's beyond systems thinking
so systems thinking is still happening stage yellow is that
a-- is at this level of where you're thinking about
the world in a sort of analytical fashion or as
stage turquoise is it's more at the level of being
your being it you're feeling it you're more connected to
it on an energetic level it's beyond just breaking things
down into analytical systems the way that a academic or
a scientist might do and it's it's it's seeing them
the irreducibly mystical nature of all of reality so that's
stage turquoise and I think stage turquoise is also tapping
into the creativity that creative power of reality you know
in a more direct sense in a much more conscious
sense knowing where that power comes from opening those sort
of channels and so yeah I was quite thrilled to
enter that stage I hadn't really thought about stages in
the past usually I would think of myself as a
stage yellow kind of guy because I'm always thinking about
systems and analyzing stuff for multiple perspectives but here it's
kind of like feels like going to the next level
now that doesn't mean that I'm in stage trick boys
fully I still have remnants I think of the old
stages within me that I need to work through there's
still some orange in there there's still some green stuff
to work through I'm still very much passionate about stage
yellow but then say turquoise is really where it's at
that's where you ultimately want to get to and the
only way you're going to get there is through direct
mystical experiences and having insights about the absolute nature of
existence that's how you do it that's why stage turquoise
people are so rare is because I think as far
as you can go just using your logical conceptual mind
is stage yellow and then to go beyond yellow you
need to have these experiences for yourself so the question
arises am i enlightened and the answer is no I
don't want to say that I'm enlightened I don't feel
like I qualify for for that classification because I think
that what's missing is that even though I have the
insight and the knowledge and the understanding I think that
there's a further step that needs to happen which is
that I'm missing the abiding non-dual awareness that I know
is possible so I think that the the ultimate step
would be to to be able to actually stand here
before you and - I guess it's almost like to
be permanently high to be permanently tripping so that you're
actually seeing the non duality you're not just knowing it
but you're actually it's like right here it's very powerful
you're almost in a sort of ecstatic state I'm definitely
not there I think that for that to happen I
would need to do a lot more meditating and just
being present with the moment not that I particularly any
kind of insights but just to be present I already
feel like I'm not like the human body I'm a
little bit detached from it but I think like not
totally so more work needs to be done there which
leads us to the question of what's next well I
think what's next for me is exploring stage turquoise more
exploring creativity figuring out how to reconcile creativity and meditation
I think what's next is a lot more meditating mm
just sitting and doing nothing and just being with the
present moment I really need thousands of hours of that
is what I feel like but that's challenging because I'm
working I got business responsibilities I'm writing a book I
have a product that I want to release so there's
like a lot of stuff that I want to accomplish
so it's all about choosing priorities and and it's hard
for me to justify sitting for ten hours a day
just in pure meditation although I'm sure that would get
very pleasant very quickly if I did that what's also
next for me is organizing a lot of insights and
knowledge that I have a backlog of for the world
and then sharing that that's also what stage turquoise is
all about is it's really about connecting with your life
purpose and and making your life purpose sort of divine
your deivanai viven izing your life purpose whereas before it
was sort of just like okay yeah I'm helping the
world maybe or I'm doing some good for my career
and here it's like no it's like I am a
force of God doing God's work with my life purpose
it's sort of like that and by the way if
you're wondering like oh how do i reconcile a life
purpose with enlightenment work there's nothing to reconcile the two
are two sides of the same coin your life purpose
and your enlightenment will fit together perfectly if you get
them right and the one will fuel the other and
it doesn't matter if your life purpose is teaching people
or making art or making music or running a business
or whatever it is it doesn't have to be teaching
people your enlightenment will still dovetail with your life purpose
what else is next for me is more research and
more learning I still feel like there's a lot of
stuff that I want to learn and to research for
the purposes of teaching it and also these are more
minor relative insights so these are not absolute things that
I'm researching these are just relative insights there's a lot
of stuff within the mystical and spiritual domain and within
science and philosophy and history in other places that when
a research and kind of cobble together as I'm doing
my work for the purpose of my life purpose but
also just because I'm naturally curious about them what's more
is more tripping I found that al add is the
most effective tool for contemplation even more so than five
Meo DMT because five M to meö is just it's
extremely powerful it's all it's overkill really and it's it's
too short to contemplate anything serious you're just getting a
little taste of the honey you're not able to eat
the whole jar I mean unless you do it constantly
I guess but the AL ad is more gentle and
I love it because I get to sit there for
four hours and just contemplate the hell out of everything
that I want to and it's very very very productive
for me so that's my go-to tool these days not
to say that I'll never do five M you know
but I like the sort of gentleness of al-lat and
I can still go just as deep what else is
next for me is more personal development there's still a
ton of stuff that I want to work on in
myself that is sub-optimal like I said bad habits addictions
annoyances emotional disturbances of all that stuff is still there
and you better believe that it will be there for
you even after enlightenment all that [ __ ] will
still be there you're going to have to work on
it so don't be thinking that enlightenment somehow makes personal
development obsolete or that you if you're pursuing enlightenment then
you shouldn't be doing personal development no you need to
be doing both because they're both going to be necessary
you can't avoid doing just regular old fashioned personal Network
so what are the lessons quickly for you firstly it's
that the most important question you really want to be
asking if you're an existential thinker like I am is
what is the substance of reality that's even more important
than who are you what are you what is the
substance of everything this stuff here what's it all made
out of you should be wondering about that every spare
minute of your day another lesson for you is that
conceptual understanding is very helpful when you're trippin so sometimes
we talk about concepts in this work as a bad
thing like all concepts concepts are terrible they keep us
from the truth yes and also no because people who
don't have the right conceptual foundations are not able to
make sense of it of the truth and they're not
able to make sense of their trips and so for
me the more I understand conceptually the better I organize
my own knowledge through note-taking and thinking about it in
a sort of ordinary fashion then when I do experience
these deep things then I can make sense of them
and then also I can talk about them so I
think one of the most important things you can do
if you're having enlightenment experiences mystical experiences in your meditation
practice whatever is right about it journal about it talk
about to somebody because as you're trying to articulate it
to yourself or to somebody else you're also clarifying it
in your own mind what it is and that helps
it to stick and then that helps to lay the
foundation for the next experience you're going to have and
the next one in the next one so you're sort
of gradually layering this stuff like almost like layers of
cement right you need to gradually layer the cement it
has hardened then you put another layer on another layer
and that way you can develop yourself very high another
lesson for you is think through what the grounding for
anything is this is related to this issue of the
substance of reality so how any substance ground any substance
because what you need to ultimately realize that it's all
circulars the vicious circle is a strange loop it's a
cat unraveling a yarn that unravels the cat there is
no substance there can be no grounding that is the
essence of reality is that is a thing which can
have no ground because it is itself and there's nothing
outside of itself to ground it that's the key insight
but you've got to grasp it very deeply with your
whole being not just with your intellect so spend some
time thinking through that on paper like ask yourself the
question what grounds the difference between existence and non-existence because
if you're like an ordinary person you think that there's
existence and there's non-existence but why do you think that
does the difference between existence and non-existence actually exists or
does it not exist or neither think through that just
using your ordinary logic to see that your logic starts
to break down and then that will set you up
for having the right kind of insight future another lesson
for you is make sure that you hone your desire
to know the truth this is one of your key
weapons in this work is to have a genuine a
very genuine authentic desire for the ultimate truth you have
to want to know not to improve your life but
for it sounds like you want to know because you
want to know because you want to know because consciousness
wants to know itself and your consciousness and you just
want to know don't underestimate how powerful just that desire
is purify it let it guide your life let it
set your priorities let it tell you what to do
let it tell you when to trip let it tell
you when to meditate to contemplate that can do a
lot for you cut through a lot of [ __
] another lesson for you is that creativity and enlightenment
fit together perfectly now I just said that meditation creativity
can be at odds with each other that's true but
creativity and enlightenment can fit together perfectly in the sense
that once you have these deep mystical experiences then it
really frees you up to be creative in a non
detached way and it opens up these channels for you
so if you're an artistic type of person if you
enjoy being creative if you want to have a big
impact on people with your creativity and you want your
creativity to be more effortless and not so neurotic and
strained and filled with ego and all that then enlightenment
is like the perfect thing for you watch what happens
with your creativity when you start having these experiences it's
going to be amazing it's going to be levels of
creativity it's going to be so much creativity you're going
to be at a loss of words and you're not
going to know how to get it all down on
paper so much creativity infinite divine creativity it's remarkable you're
going to feel like a vehicle of God doing God's
work with your art or with whatever and the final
lesson for you is that if you still have any
doubts there's nothing more worthwhile than this work there's nothing
more worthwhile than the truth it is by far hands
down the most powerful and the most significant thing that
can happen to your life it'll transform your entire life
and it will take you to levels of development that
you never imagined possible that you don't see other people
around you generally having in society it'll put you sort
of into a category of your own and while that
might feel a little lonely sometimes or whatever in the
end it's totally worth it so if you're sitting there
and you're struggling to self inquired to contemplate and you
don't know why you're not getting the results well just
keep in mind that you're after a very big thing
here this is a very big thing very big prize
so you're not going to get it cheaply or easily
might take you some years of struggle to get there
in the meantime just keep telling yourself that it's going
to be worth it have that sort of faith and
doesn't have to be blind faith but it just has
to be a lil you guy mean you can use
a little logic here as well I mean I'm not
just standing here bullshitting you this stuff is life transforming
and I wish that I could communicate the full emotional
power of this stuff better but it's just not possible
because this is something you have to experience for yourself
