            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Procrastination</b>: Procrastination is essentially a resistance to tasks or activities. This resistance is created when we label an activity as a "must", "should" or "need". This perspective creates an unwelcome burden in our minds which leads to avoidance or procrastination.
</li><li><b>Addressing Resistance and Procrastination</b>: Instead of seeing tasks as obligations, one can exercise free choice and acknowledge the consequences of actions. By shifting from a "should do" to a "could do" mindset, we can relieve some of the burden that leads to procrastination. 
</li><li><b>Feeling the Resistance</b>: Allow yourself to feel the resistance without running from it. This approach often reveals that the resistance is not as daunting as it appears in our minds. Understanding that our perception of the resistance is usually worse than the actual action can help alleviate procrastination. 
</li><li><b>The Sedona Method</b>: The Sedona Method is a technique to release negative emotions and break resistance to tasks. The process begins by allowing ourselves to feel the resistance, asking if we can let it go, deciding if we would let it go, and finally deciding when to let it go. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming Procrastination</b>: Rather than fighting procrastination directly, consider shifting your mindset and feeling the resistance. Understand that actions are choices, and while there may be consequences for not acting, you are not obligated to act. Use techniques such as the Sedona Method for releasing resistance and negative feelings. Recognize that these feelings of resistance are often inflated in our minds compared to reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Resistances</b>: People often feel extreme resistance towards doing certain tasks or activities. Leo explains the ability to overcome them by questioning whether one could, would, and when will they let it go. Regular practice of this helps in dissolving the resistance.
</li><li><b>Use of Sedona Method</b>: Leo advises using the Sedona Method multiple times, about three to four times for minor resistances and up to ten times for major ones. This method aids in the dissipation of negative emotions and resistances, freeing up space for positive emotions.
</li><li><b>Positive Sedona Method</b>: Instead of letting go of negative emotions, one asks if they could allow themselves to get excited about the activity. This involves finding a small aspect to get excited about and feeling that excitement, which in turn dissolves the resistance against the activity.
</li><li><b>Visualization Technique</b>: Visualization is another tool suggested to overcome resistance. This involves sitting in a quiet place and visualizing oneself doing the activity from the start to the end. By visualizing the initial stages in detail, one can work past the resistance against starting.
</li><li><b>Observing Procrastination</b>: Leo advises becoming an observer of one's procrastination without trying to change it. This involves allowing oneself to procrastinate while observing their behavior. The newfound consciousness towards procrastination often leads to a natural initiative towards completing the task.
</li><li><b>Baby Stepping Towards Goals</b>: Starting small with tasks is another strategy suggested. By breaking down large tasks into smaller ones and starting with small steps of work, one can gradually overcome the resistance and complete the work. 
</li><li><b>Resources for Procrastination</b>: Leo Gura's website Actualized.org provides more resources, tools, and techniques to overcome procrastination and improve one's life. It includes a free newsletter offering advanced personal videos on topics such as self-improvement and emotional self-mastery.
