</li><li><b>Applications of the commonplace book</b>: Leo gives examples of how he makes use of this system. He utilizes a 'journal' tab whenever he encounters an idea that isn't easily categorizable, offering a catch-all location for miscellaneous notes and thoughts. The 'goal' tab allows him to keep track of personal and professional objectives. The 'ideas' tab and 'book notes' tab assist in jotting down business ideas and insights from books respectively.
