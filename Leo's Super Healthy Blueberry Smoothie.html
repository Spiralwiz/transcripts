hey this is Leo for actualised org and welcome to
my kitchen today we're doing some a little bit different
I'm going to show you a very practical recipe for
my super healthy blueberry spinach smoothie this is what I
try to eat every single morning to get my day
started this is what you should be eating if you're
trying to do any kind of serious consciousness work you
need to be cleaning up your diet and cleaning up
what you're feeding your mind it's very important that you
get the right diet to get the clean kind of
mind that you're shooting for to be able to do
your meditation your contemplation your self inquiry and so forth
so without further ado let's get started let me introduce
to you all the stuff we're going to be working
with and then I'm going to mix it all for
you together here and it's it only takes about five
minutes to make this thing so what we first start
with is you need a high-quality blender I'm using a
professional-grade Ninja Blender it's a thousand watt blender this is
the base this is the attachment part I've got a
pretty serious industrial grade blade attachments very sharp and it
can fit a lot of stuff in here I recommend
it you do invest a hundred to two hundred bucks
in a high-quality blender like this because if you buy
the cheap ones they're not going to last you very
long they're not going to properly blend your food I
find that this thing here works way better than any
kind of cheap blenders so we've got that what else
we got is we've got some frozen blueberries which is
one of the key components here organic frozen blueberries these
are nice and that you can store them in your
freezer for a very long time you can buy them
ahead of time that means you're you always have all
the ingredients you need in stock I also have one
ripe banana which is going to give us the good
consistency the texture that creaminess and also it gives you
the sweetness because that's the only source of sugar aside
from the blueberries in this entire recipe what else we
have is we have almond milk and this particular brand
it's got a flavor of coconut in it as well
so it's basically almond milk with a little bit of
coconut cream and then some some trace elements and stuff
some salt and and whatnot but other than that it
has no sugar or anything else in here that junks
it up so this is a high quality almond milk
then of course we've got baby spinach leaves these are
organic they're already pre-washed we're going to put those in
there and those are the main ingredients and then what
I have is some additional supplement type things which I
like to put in there so I use a matcha
green tea as a supplement for antioxidants also a freeze-dried
beet juice powder it's just a powder and I'll show
you this what I'm assembling I'll show you the powders
what they look like this is also healthy I've got
some fresh ground vanilla bean here which gives it a
little vanilla flavor and then I use some raw organic
cocoa powder just a little bit also for the antioxidants
so let's go ahead and start to assemble all these
things together so first what am i measuring with here
I have a 1/2 of a cup scoop and this
is what I use to make all my measurements so
I'm going to start with the blueberries and I'm going
to take 1/2 a cup and then half of a
half of a cup so this ends up being in
total 3/4 of a cup of frozen blueberries then I
will measure out my almond milk let me get this
a little closer here the almond milk I do the
same amount is the blueberries so it's going to be
that's half a cup right there and then another half
so that's 3/4 of a cup total of almond milk
and then we're going to do the banana I find
that if you have one very large ripe banana that
ends up being the perfect quantity and consistency and sweetness
level at least for me you can of course experiment
and find your own proportions of all these ingredients it's
pretty flexible here the more banana you do the sweeter
is going to be and the smoother and creamier it's
going to have that texture so we have that then
what I do is I add all the supplement stuff
so I have one half of a teaspoon here that's
what I measure my beet juice it's just like a
dark red powder I put one and a half scoops
in [Applause] then the matcha green tea this is also
a powder it's just a dark green powder like this
so I put about one and a half scoops of
that the ground vanilla you only need a little bit
this is just kind of like for flavor almost like
you're just peppering or salting your food just a little
bit of that in there to give it a nice
flavor and then the cocoa powder raw cocoa powder can
be rather bitter so I don't put much in there
this is what it looks like okay and we're almost
ready the only thing we need that's left in the
spinach if our spinach goes I like to put in
about two handfuls so I would consider like that's like
one handful two handfuls maybe a little bit more so
the more spinach you put in there the healthier it's
going to be but the less sweet is going to
taste and also the texture is going to be kind
of chunky so you want to find what what level
of healthiness you are willing to tolerate at first you're
going to probably want to go light on the spinach
and then you'll want to increase more spinach as you
accustom yourself to this to this kind of health food
so we've got that let me get the lid to
close it up alright and now we're ready to blend
all right here we go [Music] [Music] okay and there
it is that's done let me now pour it into
a cup for in so this makes a little bit
more than a cup there's still some left in there
but it makes basically one tall glass bowl and it
looks kind of purplish because of the blueberries and the
beet juice powder it gives it that color and there
you have it because of the banana and because it
was fairly ripe it tastes pretty sweet so this is
definitely not how most people start their morning most people
start their morning with cereal bagels a heavy breakfast or
just like sugar candy bars protein bars all this sort
of nasty stuff so what you've got here is you've
got a completely raw fresh alive drink this thing here
will give you at least a couple of hours of
no hunger in the morning so you can start this
drink this on your way to work if you're sitting
at the computer and you're just checking your emails it's
perfect for chugging down while you're doing that it only
takes about five minutes to make this a very practical
recipe so what the point of all this is is
that you actually need to not just have more recipes
more healthy recipes in your life of course but you
want recipes that you can use almost every single day
so that you're automating your healthy diet so that it
just becomes automatic effortless and you're just doing it every
single day without any problem now here's the trade-off the
trade-off is that you're not going to get as much
variety in your diet and hey I'm like the average
person I like to have a lot of variety in
my diet but what I've also discovered is that what
are my highest priorities if my highest priorities are self-actualization
growth raising the quality of my consciousness and maintaining it
throughout the day getting the results that I want with
my meditation practice with my self inquiry with my contemplation
and so forth if I want to live a philosophical
kind of lifestyle the sagely kind of lifestyle I need
to make sure that my diet is proper it's very
difficult to do that on your standard American diet so
over the last decade I've been cleaning up my diet
a lot compared to the average person my diet is
extremely healthy but it could still be a lot healthier
so over the next year I'm committing to to finding
more practical healthy recipes that I can just put in
place and make my meals very routine so I take
a sacrifice in terms of variety of flavor because if
I'm drinking this every morning it might seem kind of
boring to you like oh well Leo I have to
drink that every single morning now yeah it's boring compared
to eating all the different junk food that you eat
but it doesn't taste that bad and the performance results
that you get outweigh any short-term cost so you have
to have the vision of what you're shooting for if
you have nothing that you're really working on in your
life you don't have a life purpose you don't have
a meditation practice you're not really raising the quality of
your consciousness then you've gotten you've got no reason to
be eating healthy you see but if you do then
these sorts of recipes are very important and what I
find is that I need recipes that are fast to
make that are very practical ingredients that I can go
by quickly ideally ingredients that I can stock up for
a long time so they don't have to be going
to the store every single other day stocking up on
these ingredients so this smoothie qualifies for most of those
on most of those points it's pretty easy to make
it's fairly inexpensive one of these smoothies cost is just
a couple of dollars to make and that's if you're
using organic ingredients if it's non organic ingredients it'll be
less than a buck to make this thing give this
a shot try it out for the next week try
it out for the next month one smoothie every single
morning replace your breakfast with it whatever your standard breakfast
was and just take a look at the performance benefits
that you get and then at the end of that
trial period ask yourself is that worth it to you
and if you're really into self-actualization I think you'll find
that it is so in the future I want to
share some more practical recipes that I've been putting into
place in my life just stuck that's very healthy very
easy to make I can make large batches of it
and then just store it and keep it for a
long time and it makes my meals very easy and
then it allows me to free up the time and
the mental and physical energy so that I can do
the self-actualization work that I need to be doing every
single day so try it out let me know in
the comments below what you think and what it tastes
like if you are actually experimenting with this and I'll
have some more healthy recipes for you in the future
so stay tuned you
