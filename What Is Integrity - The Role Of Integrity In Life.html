[Music] welcome to this two-part series on integrity we're going
to talk about in part one what is integrity the
nature of integrity and its importance and then and we're
gonna get pretty deep metaphysically on that point but also
we're gonna cover practical aspects and then in part two
we're gonna talk about how to actually develop integrity within
yourself so let's get started i'm actually really excited about
this series because first of all it's it's extremely foundational
this is sort of the core of personal development work
here so you got to understand this idea in order
to really make something of yourself in your life and
uh also because i've been wanting to actually cover this
topic for years now has been on my to-do list
and i just haven't been getting around to it i've
been procrastinating with other topics so now it's time to
get in all right so integrity is extremely important it's
probably way more important than you think it is it's
more important than most people think it is and it
took me a while myself to start to understand the
significance of what integrity really is for human life for
living a good life and the problem i had with
it is this is that when i was growing up
i basically sort of skipped over a lot of the
religious indoctrination where a lot of our moral systems come
from like stuff like family values and morality this sort
of like to me this was nonsense i could clearly
see the problems with an absolutist judeo-christian moral ethic or
whatever culture it's coming from so i was sort of
intellectually cognitively beyond that but uh that sort of lays
a little trap for us here if we're gonna be
very scientific and atheistic and skeptical the way that i
was when i was younger is that you tend to
poo poo everything that has to do with any sort
of system of morality or anything that smacks or even
whiffs of religion or the kind of moral systems that
religion promotes and so i was just instinctively averse to
that and because that i sort of dismissed this whole
field and then it took me it took me years
and decades to come back around to it so if
you're a scientifically minded person if you're an atheist if
you're a skeptic if you're a cynic you might also
think like well integrity that sounds like some sort of
uh thing that maybe some like mike pence christian would
say and then we know they're all hypocrites and all
this and we know that morality is actually relativistic and
blah blah blah and so um what value does integrity
integrity truly have what does it even mean to say
that someone has integrity or doesn't uh after all isn't
just a matter of opinion personal opinion i mean it's
not like a scientific fact right well keep your mind
open because there's something deeper to integrity and to this
whole idea of religious values and morals then it first
seems when you especially when you hear it from religious
people or in church or something like that so i'm
not going to be filling your mind here with dogma
or ideology but we're just going to be taking a
real good hard look at this concept of integrity and
you'll see how powerful and important it is all right
so integrity is paramount for living a good life if
you're interested in that success psychological health and ego development
which we've talked a lot about in the past in
my series on spiral dynamics or on the susan cook
reuter ego development model so those different stages of development
that one goes through as one self actualizes and matures
integrity is crucial for that and the higher you go
the the more integrity is required it's extremely important and
paramount for spiritual work which of course i'm always talking
about here and for discovering truth and because truth of
course is love as we've talked about in the past
these two are identical uh you can't have love without
integrity so these are all pretty important things don't you
think the good life success psychological health and development and
truth and love i mean what what more is there
in life but these things you gotta want at least
one of these things right hopefully all of them all
right so the self-actualizing and spiritual person really without integrity
is rather pathetic and broken and there are plenty of
these people around and believe me i'm not speaking from
a position where i'm trying to say that i have
the highest integrity i i struggle with integrity myself in
part two of this series i will share with you
some of my own struggles with developing integrity and and
areas in which i'm still working on myself so by
no means am i saying that um i'm above it
in fact i'm very cognizant as i grow myself as
a teacher of this stuff of of how much of
a responsibility puts upon me to really walk my talk
because it's very easy to sit up here to just
blab her mouth and in fact that's what most youtubers
are doing they're just blabbermouthing stuff it's it's like the
easiest job really it's the easiest job in the world
just to talk and talk and talk um but then
does your talk actually get embodied in your life that's
that's the really difficult part and there's a lot of
spiritual teachers and even non-spiritual teachers just personal development teachers
and business gurus and and so forth um pick up
coaches psychotherapists even who will you know tell you how
to live your life but then when you look at
their life are they really in integrity a lot of
them are very pathetic and broken that's because they don't
have the integrity of the things they speak about and
i've certainly been guilty of that and i still am
guilty of that in certain respects but anyways enough of
that so the question is why is integrity so paramount
that's something i want you to start to contemplate if
you start to agree with me that integrity is so
important why is it so important that's a homework assignment
for you right there so i'm going to try to
guide you towards an understanding of that a deeper understanding
all right so think of a person in your life
who you've personally known who's had a significant influence on
you not just a a celebrity or something on tv
or some youtuber but someone you know close to you
maybe a parent a friend a teacher a professor a
family member who had low integrity surely you've run into
a person like this in your life face to face
not just virtually so bring up an example like that
of somebody with low integrity how do you feel about
that person what impact did that person have on you
if you know about that person's life intimately how well
does their life run how smooth is their life how
happy is this person what kind of results does this
person get in their life are they a highly successful
person are they very spiritually developed are they a very
loving person and now to contrast that think of a
person who you've personally known in your life face to
face who you would say had high integrity surely you
must have encountered at least one such person in your
life a teacher a friend an intimate partner maybe one
of your parents maybe a sibling of yours a co-worker
a boss now bring to mind how that person makes
you feel when you think about him or her what
kind of impact did this person have on your life
and if you know anything about this person's personal life
how did their life run was it smooth was this
person happy successful had a lot of friends loving trustworthy
so this starts to get your mind thinking along the
right track so what is integrity really well it's helpful
to turn to the dictionary and the dictionary merriam-webster specifically
gives us a couple of nice definitions to get us
going here in our inquiry the first definition is quote
firm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic
values secondly quote a refusal to lie steal or deceive
in any way thirdly quote incorruptability and then the oxford
dictionary has a nice one which is a little bit
more abstract i really fell in love with this definition
when i read it because the ordinary definitions are what
i just kind of gave you and then this one
really makes it spiritual and metaphysical here and and we're
going to get real deep on this one in a
little bit later in this episode but it's this quote
the state of being whole or undivided um that should
ring some bells for you shouldn't it if you've seen
my uh holism and holistic thinking episodes then you should
start your mind to start to connect some dots here
whole and undivided what does being whole and undivided have
to do with integrity and with living a good life
why would these things be connected good things to think
about so integrity basically means honesty character morality uprightness virtue
goodness wholeness trustworthiness walking your talk keeping your word and
it's important to understand that integrity is not just something
you're doing externally for others it's not a facade of
being a righteous person that you are erecting for social
purposes to gain some social advantage or to fit in
or to be religious in fact we might say that
that's the opposite of integrity if you're doing it for
those reasons integrity is really who you are when you're
not trying to impress somebody or manipulate somebody or put
on some sort of facade because if you only have
integrity externally but not internally you really don't have integrity
that itself is already a split do you see because
there's now sort of the outer face you show to
others then there's the inner world that you live in
yourself and this creates a sort of schizophrenic uh reality
that you live in and many of us are dealing
with this kind of situation it's how we survive is
when we're living in in difficult environments where it's difficult
to survive we have to sort of create a false
facade that we put out there for others this is
part of the social game that we play our social
survival and this of course creates all sorts of challenges
we'll we'll get into that a bit later here uh
now let's uh mention what is the opposite of integrity
i think you know one word the best way to
sum it up is opportunism but there's a lot of
other great synonyms corruption devilry evil sin villainy wickedness badness
hypocrisy [ __ ] the willingness to lie cheat steal
exploit deceive mislead manipulate cut corners untrustworthiness in a sense
opportunism or of course ego right ego all of these
are characteristics of what a very dense fearful insecure ego
that is trying to survive by any means possible see
the logic here becomes very crystal clear and simple once
you think it through a little bit and clarify this
stuff in your mind so really our objective here is
to help you to develop integrity but before we can
get into that proper which we'll do in part two
the first step towards developing integrity is really just to
start to understand what it is and why it's important
and how it interconnects with all these other aspects of
life so that you see that when you're acting without
integrity this produces suffering and negative consequences in your life
a lot of them which are longer term which don't
come to fruition for sometimes for months for years for
decades and then your mind doesn't connect the dots and
doesn't see how your lack of integrity is contributing to
the problems that you have in your life because this
idea of integrity is like sort of an abstraction right
but then in your everyday life you face very tangible
concrete mundane problems like you argue with your spouse your
friend is angry with you you um you have trouble
in business you're not able to earn the money you
want to earn clients are buying from you for some
reason you have problems with your children your your children
aren't listening to you they're not following your instructions they're
not disciplined they're unruly they're getting bad grades and you're
not able to discipline yourself you have difficulty meditating and
you have difficulty staying on a diet and you have
difficulty motivating yourself to follow your life purpose and so
you have these tangible problems and it's not clear to
you immediately unless you contemplate it and do this inquiry
that integrity might be sort of uh sourcing many of
these problems so as you contemplate you should make those
connections let me ask you this do you want to
for example buy a product from somebody who has low
integrity or high integrity do you want a business partner
who has low integrity or high integrity do you want
to give your email address to a company of low
integrity or high integrity do you want to play golf
with someone of low integrity or high integrity do you
want to eat a supplement from a company with low
integrity or with high integrity do you want to have
sex with someone with low integrity or with high integrity
do you want to be married to a spouse of
low integrity or high integrity do you want to be
ruled by a politician of low integrity or high integrity
do you want to work for a boss of low
integrity or high integrity if you were following someone into
battle would you want him or her to be of
low integrity or high integrity if your life depended on
them following through if you're going to debate if you
were going to debate an intellectual would you want him
to be of low integrity or high integrity if you
were going to go to a doctor to a surgeon
to a lawyer to an accountant would you want one
of low integrity or high integrity if you had a
friend would you want a low integrity friend or a
high integrity friend if you were getting your news your
evening news from some journalist or news anchor would you
want this person to be of low integrity or high
integrity and if you had a spiritual guru or a
mentor or a teacher who you relied upon to guide
you in life would you want him or her to
be of low or high integrity see integrity is important
in many crucial domains of life in business in career
in life purpose in art in creative work in education
academia science medicine in family in relationships and friendships in
marriage with raising children with charity or nonprofit work in
advertising and marketing in philosophy spirituality and truth seeking in
politics in governance in community building if you're part of
a community do you want to be part of a
low integrity community or high integrity community it's important in
leadership you should notice historically if you're a student of
history that low integrity leaders almost always crash and burn
in the end they don't make it for very long
why is that why is it that people don't want
to follow low integrity leaders and that some of the
world's greatest leaders who amassed the greatest followings were actually
some of the most integres human beings who ever lived
think of maybe jesus the buddha mahavira um gandhi mlk
now i hear you saying oh leo i can i
can point out problems with gandhi and i can point
out problems with mlk he was he didn't have that
high of integrity fair point some of these leaders didn't
have perfect integrity but i'm not talking about perfect integrity
i'm just talking about a fairly high degree of integrity
it's very hard to to find a human being with
perfect integrity so be careful with this sort of perfectionistic
cynicism so what you notice is that actually people don't
want to follow a devil long term such leaders aren't
sustainable now you might say but leah what about hitler
and what about trump and what about other devilish leaders
who have amassed big followings and deceived many people and
have very low integrity and you know their philanderers and
their cheats and they don't pay their taxes and they
are racists and whatever else uh yeah there are also
very many low integrity leaders out there and they can
paradoxically become very successful but also what you should notice
is that their success is usually short-lived and again like
i say they crash and burn so before they crash
and burn they can have enormous success shocking levels of
success and wealth and sex and fame and all of
these things but usually it's not sustainable usually there's a
price to be paid for it see integrity is not
a short-term value it's more of a long-term value it
tends to pay the greatest dividends over the long term
and so if you're not thinking long-term then you probably
don't see the value of integrity and you can find
many many examples of successful business people wall street types
and so forth who have achieved a lot of success
you know material success with very low integrity in fact
because of their low integrity so uh i'm not painting
a a simplistic uh overly idealized romanticized notion here that
good people prosper in the world and that the devils
and the wicked uh you know they all they all
crash and burn no not necessarily a lot of devils
in the wicked they skate by in life and they
get away with a lot of stuff trump comes to
mind of course um it's amazing all the stuff he's
been able to get away with in his life all
the criminality all the uh you know the affairs and
the the schemes and the manipulations and the lies and
all of this it's it's amazing um how good he's
able to get away with him but also um there
are consequences there are consequences for his actions and you
know by the end of his life maybe he won't
be able to get away with all of it like
something so also where integrity is important besides leadership is
with health with nutrition with fitness with sports with games
even with video games do you want to play against
someone in an fps match who's a cheater online games
have a huge cheating problem these days these giant companies
like blizzard and activision and so forth like they have
entire teams devoted just to preventing gamers from cheating in
these competitive online games it's like it's a huge there's
a whole industry it's like a billion dollar industry just
preventing cheating using third-party software and bots and god knows
what other things they use macros and things see so
think of all of these different fields that i've mentioned
and i want to specifically stress here um your creative
work this is one of those things a lot of
people overlook it's not really talked about anywhere i don't
see it talked about very often in society but usually
when when we talk about business or career or work
you know obviously if you're cheating at your work or
you're cutting corners it's kind of obvious to see the
problems and the lack of integrity that that creates um
but there's there's a sort of even deeper lack of
integrity that i see all around business in the business
world in the corporate world it's that people are just
opportunistically doing the work that earns them the most money
or material rewards and not really following their passion or
their life purpose or their true creative calling their art
their work is not their art and the reason that
is is it's not because they're not artists right you
when i say art i mean in a very broad
abstract sense it applies to you even if you're an
accountant or a doctor or a scientist or a or
a manager or a ceo or some financial type of
person who normally you would think well that's not an
artistic person but that can be your art if you
make it your art but to make for it to
be your art it has to be more than something
about the material gain has to be more than just
opportunism there has to be some spiritual component to the
work that you're doing your creative work and so a
lot of what i'm trying to have you guys embody
is a life purpose and some kind of creative contribution
that you make to mankind to me this is this
is core to building a good life if you're not
really doing creative work first of all you're missing out
on such a huge and beautiful and delicious and rewarding
aspect of life like at least half of the meaning
of life is lost if you don't have some kind
of art form that you're working on whatever it happens
to be um but also you're spiritually disconnected with your
work you're not going to be at the top of
your game at your work if you don't have this
and uh and and the reason many people don't have
it is because it's difficult it's really difficult to be
an artist because art requires integrity when you're doing art
you're doing something beyond mere opportunism or personal gain it's
a quasi-spiritual experience depending on how far you take it
and if you take it really far it becomes a
full-blown spiritual experience if you really know what you're doing
and you integrate all of these various ideas that i
share with you through actualize.org so your work work can
happen at many different levels from the very lowest work
where you're working at starbucks at a job you hate
and you just resent it every single day to something
a little bit higher than that where you actually have
a decent career with some you know decent salary and
some prospects for growth and some creative freedom and so
forth but i mean that's a lot better um but
then there's really high levels of doing your your work
where it becomes your life's work where it becomes an
art form and that's something that i teach in my
course the life purpose course if you are interested in
that check that out it's like 25 hours explaining how
to set up your life in that in that way
and how to find your life purpose so um yeah
we just zoomed in onto this one particular domain because
i found it uh relevant and i mean um i
guess there's still some something more i wanted to say
it's it's this is that see nobody in our society
like when we're growing up we're going to school our
parents and so forth nobody really instills in us the
importance of artistic integrity and in fact we can be
mocked for that if you have any kind of sense
of artistic integrity just naturally intuitively the way you grew
up maybe you have an artistic mind or artistic sort
of spirit and you you know what i'm talking about
the importance of artistic integrity but it's so difficult to
maintain that especially amidst all your friends family and colleagues
and even fellow artists who are cutting corners and are
low integrity they don't have any principles by which they're
living their life they don't have any principles by which
they're doing their work their principle is just hate whatever
works whatever is the path of least resistance but this
is not how you build a great life this is
how you get the kind of mediocre results that everybody
else around you is getting so integrity is about having
kind of values and principles above and beyond just bear
survival or what happens to work and then the difficulty
is staying true to those principles and values when things
get difficult there's a cost to integrity it's more difficult
than just opportunistically doing what works you have to put
more consciousness and thought into your relationships your marriage your
education the way you advertise and market the way you
do business in order to do it with integrity a
business with high integrity is actually a pretty rare thing
because most business people just want to make money and
so they're willing to to take the path of least
resistance to doing that and they don't want to exert
any work beyond that their business is not turned into
a sort of an art form or just into a
into it has no spiritual connection and yeah businesses should
have a spiritual connection i recommend if you do business
then you do it in a spiritual way your business
should have a soul that means it's more than just
about earning money and see so nobody really talks very
much about how important this integrity is or if they
do they talk about it from a spiral dynamic stage
blue perspective where they just give you dogma and ideology
about which morals and values you're supposed to follow that's
not what i'm doing here integrity is not something that
can be turned into an algorithm integrity requires consciousness that
in fact it requires an open mind it requires letting
go of dogmas and following rules but it does require
some principles and some values that you should be clear
about with yourself that means you gotta get clear about
what you really want out of life what's important to
you what's meaningful to you and then you gotta be
willing to pay the cost to enforce that so if
you're running a business most of your employees are not
going to be interested in integrity or your values or
ideals or the artistry of your business they're just going
to be interested in just doing a bare minimum sort
of job to please you as the boss to get
their paycheck you got to lead them and inspire them
to also get interested in your ideals and values and
you got to communicate them and then of course in
order to um to really get these values if you
really value something it's not enough for you to just
value it in your mind you gotta also you you
want to see it realized actualized in the world right
it's no good to to to have this ideal of
a business but then in reality your business is is
doing some shady stuff like if you really want your
business to be an art and a to have soul
then you're gonna have to like work extra hard to
find the kind of employees who also care about those
things you got to pay them more because those people
are rarer and they're going to have more they're going
to need to be more skillful you've got to pay
them more that means you're going to have to earn
more you're gonna have to be more creative with your
budget and so forth to make that work and then
you're gonna be competing against other businesses who are not
doing that who are you know hiring employees for cheap
offshore and so forth uh don't care about integrity who
are scamming their customers and so forth and they might
even be outselling you by doing that because they have
shady low integrity advertising and marketing strategies and you don't
wanna you could use those marketing strategies but you don't
want to you could do clickbait titles you could do
scammy sorts of sales pages you could do spam email
lists and you know there's a lot of shady marketing
stuff you could do but if your business is about
something higher than than just the quantity of your sales
then you may not want to do those those tactics
in fact you might be conscious of how those tactics
are actually corrupting the entire epistemic ecosystem of our society
and our culture and the kind of toxic in impact
this has on the health of of our culture and
our society is he that makes your business and marketing
harder now you gotta find more conscious ways of doing
advertising and marketing how do you do that well how
many people are teaching conscious advertising and marketing strategies almost
zero compared to all the gurus who are teaching you
the most low consciousness advertising and marketing strategies by the
way if you want a a really deep profound discussion
of marketing and advertising go check out my older episode
called the deep problem of marketing it's it's one of
my most underrated but most important episodes there's some very
profound insights there about that so my point is is
that really if you're gonna be integris the only way
you're going to do it is by wanting to do
it yourself no one's going to push you into it
you have to adopt that idea yourself and in fact
you're going to be fighting the whole world because the
whole world is going to be trying to lure you
in with shortcuts and traps trying to get you to
back down from your artistic values right like if you're
an artist most employers you go to work for they
don't give a [ __ ] about your artistic values
and principles they just want you to do their work
for them and then that's probably going to involve even
sacrificing some of those and then the question is are
you gonna take that job or are you gonna reject
it and if you reject it then how are you
gonna feed yourself you see so of course it's all
wrapped up with survival there's a good reason why integrity
is a rare thing and when you find a friend
or a teacher or a mentor or a guru or
a scientist or a doctor who has high integrity or
a spouse or friend who has high integrity you really
value that person there's something special about that or or
a business think of right now some business or company
that you've done business with in your life that was
like really high integrity and it impressed you and you're
you're happy to go back to them years later and
to pay them even extra because of the integrity with
which that company is run and then of course think
of the opposite which is much easier because there's more
examples of it think of a think of a company
that was that had no integrity at all how do
you feel about that and if you want to be
a leader what kind of leader do you want to
be high integrity leader or low integrity leader consider how
they crash and burn the low integrity ones and then
being a high integrity leader that's one of the most
difficult things you can undertake in your life because that
means you really got to walk your talk and you
can really only lead people up to the level of
where you are at developmentally and consciously so any bottlenecks
within your own consciousness and ego development are going to
that's going to be as high as your leaders can
i mean as your followers can follow you you can't
really lead them beyond that and so then it becomes
a matter of what do i got to change about
myself to make myself more integrated integris so that i
can lead people to higher levels of integrity and the
higher levels of integrity you want to lead people to
the more challenging it's going to be and the more
burden and responsibility will be placed upon you to be
impeccable with your own integrity but then again that's what
mankind needs the most what we need the most right
now to lead us out of all of our problems
including the climate change problem the pollution problems the economic
problems we have and many many others is we need
high integrity leaders and look how rare those are and
even of course when they do come think of one
think of one right now think of a modern not
someone who died years ago but something of a modern
high integrity leader that you've seen or heard chances are
they're not the most popular person because of course as
your integrity gets really really high and you're leading people
towards such a high ideal it becomes harder and harder
for people to follow because they would have to completely
change their own psychological makeup in order to follow you
there and integrity is is an honest signal you can't
really fake integrity you can try to erect a facade
of integrity but it's gonna break down and you yourself
are gonna know it's fake deep down if not consciously
then at least subconsciously the ego is gonna know it's
gonna be playing these games and so it's going to
come through pretty clearly and people with high integrity clearly
see people with low integrity but people with low integrity
have a difficult time seeing people with high integrity and
or low integrity and making that distinction you see this
is one of the core things of the of the
sort of trump phenomenon that happened is that to anyone
with hot with us with any moderate degree of integrity
or high integrity it's just utterly obvious that trump is
a con artist and has no integrity whatsoever he's like
the least integral human that i've seen in a long
time publicly right but a lot of his followers the
maggot people can't see this because surprise surprise birds of
a feather flock together they also don't have high integrity
they don't know what integrity is they've never contemplated it
they've never developed it they've never faced the the real
challenges that come with developing it and a lot of
the people who follow them are just stage spiral dynamic
stage blue religious dogmatic people and and for them they
might think they have integrity but they don't really have
integrity and we'll cover this a little bit later in
the episode they don't have true integrity what they have
is they have an aping of integrity which is that
they have the moral facade that they've erected through religion
but that does not mean one actually has integrity in
fact oftentimes it means the opposite of that yeah so
um so it's easy for a con man to fool
other people with low integrity see our con man can't
fool someone with high integrity because the high integrity purses
just you can smell it if you have high integrity
you can just look at trump for 30 seconds giving
a speech or talking about something answering a question and
you can just smell the [ __ ] coming out
of his pores you can just see the ego pouring
out and you would never follow that person but more
naive people who are at lower levels of spiral and
ego development and moral development spiritual development who haven't done
a lot of you know self-actualization work or spiritual work
they they can't see it and in fact they admire
what they see because it reflects themselves back to who
they just see themselves in it and then of course
the ego just assumes that hey i'm great so anything
that's like me is also great but it's a very
dangerous assumption the assumption there is that i'm great well
maybe you're not so great so anyways my question for
you is how grounded is your life in integrity how
about the projects that you work on whatever project you're
working on right now is it grounded integrity how much
rate it on a scale of one to ten or
are you just being opportunistic and are you just doing
whatever works and you're just following the path of least
resistance with with your project whatever that is your project
could be your marriage your project could be raising your
children your project could be teaching children in school maybe
you're a teacher educator something like that your project could
be doing science or medicine or healing people or art
music whatever kind of media you're working in see people
with low integrity are very predictable you can predict and
you can bank on the fact that they will lie
cheat steal deceive and exploit at any chance they get
it's like a law of physics that's how predictable it
is right it's completely predictable that the trump administration would
be filled with people who are very much like trump
and that's exactly what we saw over the four years
of the trump administration it's not that that was that
trump himself had no integrity and that's it and then
he hired other you know people who were good and
so forth no because the only people who would want
to follow trump are other low integrity people which is
why we saw in the trump administration so many scandals
with all of his administration members and we saw sex
scandals and racism and wife abuse and alcoholism and this
and that like because these are the kinds of people
who would follow trump and of course most of them
were grifters they were doing it for the publicity for
the book that they were going to write for the
fox news gig that they were going to get for
the lobbying donations or jobs or opportunities that they would
get after the fact and and then they were all
backstabbing each other too in the administration they couldn't even
trust each other of course that's the whole problem when
you're dealing with low integrity people is that it comes
back to bite you in the ass and it came
back to bite trump in the ass many times uh
if you follow the news cycles you know a lot
of people were leaking on him backs having his own
people like his own closest aides would would leak would
backstab each other would you know gossip about him and
yeah that's what you get when you have a community
of low integrity and you have that kind of culture
and integrity is not just something we have individually but
then also institutions have it collectively or don't have it
it's a culture thing and so all this was very
predictable to you now people blame me for saying oh
leo why are you so biased against trump why do
you keep making everything so political it's not about the
politics i don't care about the politics of it i'm
just bringing up these examples because they're so poignant and
they're so illustrative and in this way like i use
trump trump has been a gift to me because over
the last four years in the sense that like for
me as a self-actualization teacher as someone who tries to
teach people how to become more conscious and more spiritual
and more loving all i got to say is do
everything the opposite of what trump does and then you
got the gist of what i'm trying to teach you
so in that sense it's not political it's just there's
there's deeper dynamics here than politics it's not partisan it's
not about democrats or republicans it's it's really about what
what the psyche is to how the psyche behaves and
the fragmentation of the psyche you see so really now
we're starting to get a little bit more metaphysical here
is that this the mind the psyche it can have
different degrees of holism or integration or fragmentation if it
has extreme levels of fragmentation it gets so bad that
you can literally have a split personality disorder you might
have seen some movies about this or some documentaries you
can find them on youtube i'm sure or you know
extreme examples of psychosis and schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder
where you literally are like talking to yourself different voices
in your head like really schizo and uh how how
are you going to live a healthy life that way
but see even if you integrate your own mind and
you don't have multiple voices and things like that even
if you do that still you're fragmented from the rest
of mankind from animals you know depending on how much
spiritual work you've done the more spiritual work you do
the more your your sense of identity expands and includes
animals plants the earth man other races and aliens whatever
is out there right um you start to care about
all of it more and more you become more holistic
and as as you do that you you start to
approach god consciousness more i won't go too deep into
that here because i covered it in much depth see
my episodes about holism and holistic thinking part one and
part two or go real deep on that but see
the problem is that a person with low integrity is
corrupt and has a fragmented psyche and this kind of
fragmented psyche is going to have serious consequences a lot
of suffering both to oneself but also a lot of
collateral damage done to others as this psyche bubbles through
life cassie a sick fragmented psyche what is it really
looking for it thinks it might be looking for money
or for sex or for pleasure or for drugs or
for fame or for status this is sort of like
what the trump psyche thinks it needs and this is
what it's mostly pursuing but what it doesn't understand is
that really what it's seeking is not those things it's
seeking wholeness it's seeking completion it's seeking a transcendence of
itself it's seeking integration and it's ultimately seeking love that's
what's really being sought but it's being sought in these
limited partial twisted ways which never fully satisfy and lead
to more cravings and more so it's an endless chasing
of your tail chasing various sorts of cravings and ways
of trying to heal yourself but the the way that
a very broken psyche tries to heal itself is itself
broken so it's applying brokenness on top of brokenness which
is sort of like trump's whole life um um and
it never really integrates and it never really heals because
to truly heal requires consciousness and a willingness to accept
and to face the costs of integration so the problem
with the trump psyche is that it does it's not
willing to face the costs and accept the costs and
the burdens of true integration and so it's at war
with itself and it's at war with the world and
it's creating polarity and it creates war between factions and
society and it fragments society and so we've discussed this
this before in my holism episodes we've also discussed this
in my episode about corruption see my episode called how
corruption works because corruption is deeply connected with this issue
of wholeness or lack thereof and with integrity or lack
thereof and ultimately the the biggest problem with with your
lack of in integrity is that it simply leads to
an inability to love because love is god love is
another word for god and uh love has many degrees
to it the more integrated you become the more god
like your consciousness becomes the the higher ability to love
becomes and the more satisfied you are with yourself because
you're you your consciousness cannot be satisfied with it with
itself if it's not able to love very deeply that's
really what you're after in life even if you think
you're after success or money or fame or sex you're
really after love that's just a particular limited narrow manifestation
you're not you haven't connected the dots yet enough to
understand that you don't really know what love is yet
you haven't become conscious of it yet you think love
is some sort of hokey new agey spiritual idea from
hippies or something um and then it's not tangible or
scientific or material but you're wrong and if you want
to know more about love then check out my episodes
what is love part one part two and other areas
where i've discussed love i've discussed it quite a bit
by now um so uh yeah so this inability to
love is really a problem because from that stems all
the devilry the reason you need the devilry and all
the manipulation the lying and the cheating and the stealing
and and the exploiting is because you don't know how
to find love those are substitutes poor poor substitutes for
it see and finding love is difficult because to find
love you got to really change yourself grow yourself love
is also sort of an honest signal you can't really
fake love and you see this with trump as well
see uh it's quite clear that trump is incapable of
love true love even with his family and his children
you see that his form of love for his children
i mean he has some very narrow twisted version of
it but it's so distorted and really when you get
into the the gritty details of it it's it's it's
quite ugly and perverse it doesn't really inspire you you
wouldn't want to be his child see this this is
really this is this is the ultimate sort of litmus
test of uh of how conscious you are is if
i ask you the question would you want to be
trump's child and if you say yes that just that
that shows you that you don't see you don't see
any of the stuff that i'm talking about you have
a lot of growing to do and if you say
[ __ ] no leo i'd rather be dead than
be trump's child um because i would grow up to
be so um so psychologically damaged and wounded if he
was my father now then you you understand some things
you feel moral conscious um so yeah so love is
just basically your connection to god the less you're able
to love the more disconnect from god you are and
the and the worse your life goes uh and then
of course much of psychotherapy is about what bringing your
psyche into wholeness and integration we've talked about this as
well before we lie to ourselves constantly even if you're
not as bad as trump if your psyche is not
as twisted as his and wounded his uh you still
got wounds and twists in there and you still lie
to yourself plenty you're still dishonest with yourself and you're
still at war with yourself within your own mind and
so we gotta heal that within you by raising your
integrity now see here's something you got to understand sort
of metaphysical about the ego because there's um there's a
deep relationship between love truth integrity wholeness and ego so
let's explain these relationships so you see really when we
get down to it what we have is we have
truth we have absolute truth which is everything that exists
as it is that's absolute truth this this everything you
see and hear and touch and feel is absolute truth
that's what is that's what absolutely is that's what's absolutely
true in the universe this state that's happening right now
is what's absolutely true about the universe otherwise it wouldn't
be happening now that's a very deep issue i won't
go into here i have separate episodes about what is
truth go check those out if you really want to
get deep into it but to summarize here truth is
everything that is it's how things actually are that's truth
and then falsehood and deception is you pretending and playing
games about how things are it's a false perception of
how things are so truth is integrity truth itself must
be integris why because truth is whole truth is what
it is and it can't be anything else truth has
no room for non-truth within it it's so absolute it's
so all-encompassing what is is for example like this my
finger is here right now you're looking at it if
you're watching this or you're hearing my voice if you're
listening to this as a podcast so this is truth
it's here right now it is what it is now
to call it something else to call it a wing
or a tentacle or a flipper or whatever a tree
that would be falsehood that would be out of integrity
with what is true in this particular case all right
so truth must by definition and tautologically must be integris
with itself so truth literally is integrity that's the pinnacle
of integrity it's just absolute truth and then any kind
of stories you make up about it and tell yourself
and lies you make and this sort of stuff that's
you're you're getting further and further away from what is
and us humans we live in our fantasies mostly we
don't really care about the truth very much mostly we
live in our fantasies and we care about spinning narratives
and fictions within our minds about how things are how
we believe reality is but our beliefs and our ideas
and our models of reality are not the truth itself
they are facsimiles at best and gross distortions and pure
falsehoods at worst so the pinnacle of integrity is just
absolute truth itself which in other words you can call
that god of course it's the same as love i've
explained before that truth and love are identical why is
it love because truth is itself and in a sort
of a almost it's almost too obvious but you see
the truth must love itself it's kind of weird to
say that because usually we don't think of truth as
truth as an abstract concept we think and then we
think that well truth is an abstract concept so how
and love is an abstract concept so why would truth
need to love itself doesn't make much sense love is
something humans do biological creatures do love no wrong consciousness
does love consciousness does love consciousness does the universe consciousness
does humans humans don't do consciousness consciousness does humans so
love is something consciousness does consciousness either accepts itself or
it rejects itself to various degrees there's infinite degrees of
self rejection or acceptance so if consciousness is accepting itself
accepting the ac accepting the present experience for example if
if you're having sex you're you it probably feels good
for you under normal circumstances and you ex you love
it you accept it in other words you you don't
just accept it a little bit you accept it a
lot like you accept it so deeply you fall in
love with the experience of it in fact we call
it love making love right so you're you're really accepting
that experience but the problem is that the ego mind
is fragmented and impartial in which experiences it's willing to
accept and which it isn't so if you're experiencing like
a toothache that you don't like you don't like the
toothache you don't want to accept it consciousness is rejecting
the toothache why is it rejecting it because it wants
to manipulate circumstances to eliminate the two things so for
example you you want you reject the toothache so you
go to a dentist he drills it he fills it
and now you're happy again so this is what your
mind this is this is the entire mechanism of your
entire life i'm describing here it's not just two things
everything so um so see in that case consciousness is
literally rejecting the toothache now you might say well leo
is that wrong no it's not wrong per se but
it just means you're always going to be running around
your life you know accepting and rejecting stuff in this
partial fashion and that's survival uh the only problem with
is that there's no satisfaction in it you can do
that your whole life and you will and you're never
gonna be satisfied i mean you'll have brief moments of
satisfaction when you get everything you want but most of
the time you won't be getting what you want and
then you're gonna be depressed and miserable and suffering but
the point is um that's not the point what i
was talking about here metaphysically speaking is that consciousness is
truth because conscious is all there is and consciousness is
what is happening at this present moment anything that's happening
anything that's true is held within consciousness and if consciousness
was completely unbiased and impartial and completely holistic it would
completely embrace and accept all of itself what would it
reject why would it reject it you might think of
it as like this a human being doesn't enjoy the
sensation of a toothache but the universe doesn't care and
really we're talking about the universe's perspective here now metaphysically
the highest perspective possible the most holistic perspective is the
perspective of the whole universe the whole universe is conscious
it's conscious of you right now you in fact are
the universe conscious of yourself as a human and maybe
you have a toothache maybe a backache maybe whatever is
bothering an itch on your nose you want to scratch
and uh and uh and so you're either accepting or
rejecting these experiences and but from the universe's point of
view it's so impartial so holistic that it so integrates
that it just integrates absolutely everything and that's called love
that's absolute love that's god's love that's the universal love
so truth equals love equals wholeness equals a lack of
deception and lies because the universe doesn't need to lie
to itself can you see that only humans and egos
need to lie to themselves to gain an advantage the
universe has no advantage to gain because it's the entire
thing what advantage would the universe gain over itself it
is itself it loves itself it accepts itself what more
does it need it needs nothing it's complete it's infinite
it's unlimited it is exactly what it wants to be
but a human wants to be something more than he
or she currently thinks it is because it's a part
a human deep down understands that it's a part of
something larger the human wants to expand into being something
larger whether that expansion is via money sex you know
expanding your family expanding your society expanding your business and
expanding your fame all of that is a form of
expansion into something larger then eventually that leads to the
ultimate expansion into everything so that is that but you
see the problem is that since the ego is a
fragment of the entire universe it's a fragmented consciousness literally
the ego survival depends upon a lack of integrity that's
why integrity is so rare amongst humans and if you're
a high integrity person you might be shocked at like
why is everybody else so low integrity well because they
got egos and they're surviving and survival really requires a
lack of integrity because fundamentally metaphysically to survive as a
little part of the whole universe you have to be
committed to maintaining that little boundary of who you think
you are your identity your limited identity you have to
be committed to maintaining that at any cost no matter
what it does to the rest of the system and
therefore you're committed to unholism and holism and integrity is
one of the most threatening things to a condensed ego
because it threatens that boundary right because your loyalty if
you're a deep rigid ego your loyalty is to maintaining
the boundary of you at any cost and then to
let that go to surrender that to become more spiritual
and more developed you're surrounding that boundary um and as
you do that it's threatening it's very threatening to your
survival you can't survive in the old ways that you
used to be able to you can't cheat steal lie
uh exploit seduce and manipulate people the way that you
were able to before this in a sense this makes
success more difficult in a world where the majority of
people achieve success via these means it's difficult to win
a political election without in some way cheating manipulating exploiting
or lying which is why they say politicians are liars
lawyers are liars well yeah it's difficult to win a
it's difficult to be a lawyer without lying on behalf
of your clients that's in a sense what lawyers are
paid to do is to make up the best case
lawyers are not paid to tell the truth in the
courtroom they're paid to only tell a part of the
truth the part that serves their client that's like their
literal professional obligation is to do that a lawyer's professional
obligation is to not tell the truth now that doesn't
mean they go out there and lie deliberately explicitly because
they can get you know caught in that line and
the judge will reprimand them maybe even disbar them so
a lawyer might not be able to lie explicitly but
they can lie in subtle ways through manipulation through omission
through the way they frame a situation for the jury
and the judge the stuff they omit and leave out
and don't say or the way that they emphasize a
particular point in a way that it shouldn't be emphasized
they overemphasize certain aspects so see the lawyer is not
really interested in the truth and most professions are like
this that's survival so as long as you're committed to
survival of your little identity there's going to be some
degree of lack of integrity within you and it's going
to be a question of how committed are you like
if you're really committed to the christian identity or the
muslim identity or the atheist identity that commitment in and
of itself you might think what's wrong with that well
what you don't see what's wrong with that is that
that commitment in and of itself to something so narrow
and so limited by definition comes with a lack of
integrity because it's not the whole you're not integrating the
whole universe if you only think you're a christian or
you identify purely as an atheist you're not integrating everything
there is to integrate therefore you're less than the full
absolute truth and therefore whenever your mind or ego or
psyche comes into contact with something larger than yourself it's
going to have to invent defense mechanisms and it's going
to have to get sneaky it's going to have to
uh in order to enforce the the the the smallness
of your worldview you see and the reason you're doing
that is because to admit of something larger than your
worldview that that's admitting you're wrong ego doesn't like to
admit that it's wrong to admit that you're wrong you
have to admit that your view of reality is wrong
that has a cost that has an emotional cost that's
painful to do for a scientist or an atheist to
admit that they're wrong about the fundamental metaphysics of reality
is deeply emotionally disturbing and painful it's so painful that
they would even deny if they're listening to you now
you're going to even deny that what i'm saying here
has any validity whatsoever but also the christian and the
the the muslim and the democrat and the republican and
the marxist and the fascists the problem is that all
of these views are just too small and they commit
you to a life of not being in integrity the
core of integrity is intellectual and epistemic integrity and this
also is not emphasized enough especially within the spiral dynamic
stage blue religious schools and teachings because most people learn
about integrity and morals from religion or they don't learn
about them at all in many cases uh they're not
but but religion doesn't teach you about epistemic integrity because
religion wants to lock you into one paradigm one little
reality bubble so it doesn't bother to teach you the
epistemic tools that we've been talking about on this channel
that you should be well familiar with by now so
um why why is intellectual and epistemic integrity so important
because your epistemology is how you know anything at all
that's what that word means how do you know anything
how do you know you're not fooling yourself about absolutely
everything how do you know any of your beliefs are
valid well that's a very deep and tricky problem philosophers
have been wrestling for this with this question for thousands
of years and many of them have not figured out
good answers although there are good answers that i've shared
with you in the past um and so uh so
so yeah so see the problem is that it all
boils down to epistemology and intellectual integrity because in a
sense in order to have integrity within business or within
art or within your family or within your relationships your
marriage and elsewhere first and foremost you have to have
a clear perception and knowing of reality you have to
you have to know where you're fooling yourself intellectually you
have to know where you're deceiving yourself because if you
can't sort that out you're going to be fooling yourself
within business you might be a tobacco ceo who genuinely
believes that tobacco doesn't cause cancer because epistemically you you
haven't really done any deep epistemic work so you're not
seeing how your own mind is fooling you into believing
that because it's simply convenient of course for you to
believe that because you're earning millions of dollars from being
the ceo of this company and selling this product and
you know you couldn't sleep at night unless you believed
that so and you know in your marriage similar things
are going on um and with your art and so
forth right so epistemic integrity is is crucial which is
why i teach it and stress it so much and
what that means is basically holding holding your lying mind's
feet to the fire of reality and truth because what
you discover after you get into your 20s or 30s
and you start to really peek under the carpet of
epistemology you know you you pull up you pull the
carpet back and you look underneath what's in there and
there's some ugly stuff in there you look inside your
own psyche and you discover that there's so much [
__ ] lies and deceptions and things you were taught
in school and elsewhere by your family and religion and
science and so forth that is just false wrong misguided
partial and uh that's painful and difficult to to to
see to see all those deceptions and lies and why
are those lies there well because that's how you survived
the first 20 years of your life you were busy
surviving surviving surviving using all these lies and they were
convenient but you didn't even you weren't even conscious that
they were lies so sometimes you know you're innocent in
that matter you didn't necessarily construct them but they were
just programmed into you from birth by parents in school
and teachers and religion and science um and so now
your mind has been thoroughly self-deceived and so to correct
that that's a multi-decades-long process to clear all the junk
out from under under that epistemic carpet and really by
doing that you're you're aligning yourself closer to truth and
to even care to do that already requires enormous intellectual
integrity you cannot achieve this this unwinding of self-deception or
jail breaking the mind as i've referred to in the
past you cannot jailbreak your mind without intellectual integrity and
there's many degrees of intellectual integrity and it's really difficult
to do intellectual integrity well very few people have have
have it very few people even scientists and rationalists and
some of these people professors and academics who are supposed
to be like have high intellectual integrity they really don't
because it's not enough just to to want high intellectual
integrity you actually have to do the epistemic work to
achieve intellectual integrity that means you have to study self-deception
very thoroughly now here i'm referring you to my three-part
series on self-deception which is foundational to to this work
uh self-deception part one two three check that out but
basically i list i give you a list of all
the different self-deception mechanisms of the ego mind these are
the double standards you have the rationalizations the justifications the
self-biases the defense mechanisms uh that are all their projection
and denial and the scapegoating and judging and i mean
it's a laundry list of stuff go go go study
that for a few years if you're not aware of
all those then you're never going to be able to
reach high levels of integrity because you're just going to
be fooling yourself it's pointless to debate or to even
have an intellectual discussion with someone who doesn't have a
very high level of intellectual integrity because their mind is
going to be like an eel it's just going to
squirm its way out into rationalizing and justifying whatever position
it wants this is what you see when you see
a political debate or religious debate any kind of typical
youtube debate atheist theist whatever neither side has sufficient intellectual
integrity to really have a genuine inquiry into the truth
it actually is possible for two human beings two minds
to sit together and to do a genuine inquiry into
the truth and to make some progress but this is
not done virtually anywhere on youtube or on tv or
in the media uh it's so rare because it requires
such extraordinary levels of intellectual integrity and epistemic experience dealing
with one's own self-deceptions but it can be done if
you really want but there is a price to pay
for it how much ego are you willing to give
up how many of your pet ideas and beliefs and
positions and intellectual attachments are you willing to give up
maybe even you'll have to give up your job or
your family depending on what foundation your job see the
thing is is that it's people don't understand this but
a lot of times it's easy to to construct a
facade of success by creating success on a on a
on a rotten foundation and that's mostly what people do
when people create success mostly the way they do it
is on a rotten foundation the problem with doing well
there's there's an upside down side of that the upside
to that is that you can get quick success that
way and hey you know i'm not i'm not saying
i'm bothered i've done this in my life so i'm
speaking from experience i've done it both ways i've created
success on rotten foundations and on solid ones and so
i have a good appreciation of both in the pros
and cons so the pros you can do it quickly
and you can get good money and fame and so
forth from from doing that but the con excuse me
i got something stuck in my throat the con is
that it's fragile and you're insecure about it it's a
house of cards that could easily collapse with a little
gust of wind and that little gust of wind comes
by way of of ideas you see there are certain
ideas that i can utter to you that would collapse
the foundation of your business or your money-making strategy or
your career or your pursuit of science or your religion
or your political position or whatever and so of course
your ego has to be very defensive and insecure about
that the more solid your foundation is the more secure
you are the less dogmatic you have to be the
more open-minded you can be the more you can explore
reality and the more you can handle the truth but
people with very rotten flimsy foundations in all the different
aspects of their life and especially with relationships with their
family and so forth like most people have very broadened
foundations like their life is held together with with with
a little bit of you know masking tape and some
snot that's mostly how most people's lives are held together
it's extremely fragile and so they're extremely sensitive and insecure
they get easily offended they get defensive they become trolls
they lash out they attack they project all of this
stuff why is that happening because actually their their life
is not grounded on something true that's one of the
most amazing and powerful things about absolute truth is that
when you are conscious of absolute truth when you are
conscious of absolute love it's so empowering because it's unshakable
it's abso-fucking-lutely unshakable you're unshakable nothing can touch you you
feel immortal you feel eternal you feel you feel complete
you feel integrated that's the power of truth is that
truth needs no defense if somebody is defending the truth
they don't got the truth truth needs no defense truth
has no insecurity to it because it's absolutely true it's
exactly what is it can't be anything else and you're
totally conscious of it and so you're completely certain of
it not an egotistical narcissistic way but you're just completely
certain of it by the way i don't know if
i've mentioned but you should also check out my episode
called what is the devil where i also talk about
corruption and many of these dynamics because what we're really
talking about here when we're talking about lack of integrity
we're talking about what i facetiously refer to as devilry
i sort of say that tongue-in-cheek um but it's a
powerful concept don't don't dismiss the power of this concept
of devilry you see it all around you and you
see it inside of you so go check out that
episode too it's one of my one of my best
um okay so we've covered the core intellect integrity what
else do we have here um so of course living
a good life is founded upon honesty with oneself if
you can't be honest with yourself then how can you
possibly have a good life and a person who doesn't
value integrity cannot be honest with himself first and foremost
and it's difficult to be honest with oneself if you've
tried in fact many of you listening here will say
well leo what's the big deal i'm honest with myself
that's already a lie you're not honest with yourself if
you if it was revealed to you right now how
dishonest you are with yourself you would you would be
so sick to your stomach you'd run to the toilet
to vomit you'd be disgusted with yourself you'd be depressed
you'd hate yourself that's how dishonest you are all of
us and that dishonest that self-dishonesty prevents you from achieving
higher states of consciousness because why what's the connection between
dishonesty and consciousness because consciousness is absolute [ __ ]
truth and and your self-deceptions and lies these are falsehoods
these are stories pleasant stories you tell yourself within your
relationships within business about money about relationships about um your
children about other people about evil and good and about
politicians and economies and race and sex and whatever else
lies lies and fictions and stories that you've invented to
suit yourself to make it easier for you to survive
just to hold your life together because to construct a
life solidly on a solid foundation that's so much more
difficult so you might wonder william why should i do
it let me take the easy route well the problem
is with the shortcuts with the shortcuts those also have
a cost see everything has a cost you're damned if
you're doing damn if you don't so it's a matter
of choosing what kind of cost you want to pay
and uh sometimes ironically paradoxically the costs of doing it
the easy way end up being greater of course of
course you would know that if you had a little
bit of wisdom so it all revolves around truth why
does everything in life revolve around truth because truth is
the only [ __ ] thing there is by definition
there's nothing but truth you say what about the falsehoods
the falsehoods by definition aren't true so they aren't a
falsehood is something that seems like it is but isn't
so fundamentally epistemically and ultimately metaphysically the more your life
is aligned with things that don't exist aren't true the
worse your life gets the more manipulations you have to
do to sustain that [ __ ] illusion and eventually
your illusion collapses because you can't keep it up forever
and then you suffer from that and from this come
most of the collective evils of mankind so wouldn't it
be better to just to to realize right here and
now that that that path won't work forget that path
and devote yourself to the path of truth which is
the same as to say the path of integrity become
more truthful become more honest with yourself even when it
burns you that burning sticking your feet on the fire
of truth as i call it that is a true
signal and on a signal of the fact that you're
growing it's painful but it's a good kind of pain
see this other direction where you're you're going down the
road of untruth that also brings you pain but that's
not the good kind of pain that's the bad kind
of pain because that pain won't grow you the way
that this pain will this is a pain of purification
this is the suffering of purifying your soul and spirit
and this here is just the the karmic consequences of
devilry which just leads to more devilry now of course
sometimes you can go down this road long enough and
then you wake up and then you you switch directions
that's also valid it's valid being a devil is valid
nothing wrong per se with being a devil as long
as as long as you're okay with it the problem
is that you won't be okay with it you think
you'll be okay with it but you won't it's very
painful being a devil and also you don't understand the
beauty you're missing out on here and truth is a
beautiful thing love is a beautiful thing really what your
ego wants is your ego wants all of the benefits
of this path while staying on this path and not
changing anything about itself that's what you really want that's
the kind of videos if i put those videos out
there you would be paying me millions of dollars and
millions of clicks for how to do that but i
hate to break it to you that it can't happen
you can't get the benefits of truth and beauty and
love and god while being a devil there's costs there's
trade-offs so if you care about truth you must care
about integrity why because without integrity you're going to be
opportunistically tempted into falsehood because the falsehood is always shorter
more convenient easier more comfortable how can you ever reach
truth when you're always doing what's most opportunistic you see
if you're wondering what is this truth leo that you
keep alluding to so vaguely it sounds like mumbo jumbo
it's not mumbo jumbo it's a very tangible thing i
assure you go check out my episode called what is
truth and then the second episode called how to discover
what is true or actually guide you through sort of
a process of how to find the truth because you
might be wondering that leo how do i find this
magical truth you're talking about well go check that out
how to discover what is true search for it it's
a good good episode so the problem is that when
you have low integrity you can't trust yourself and then
this leads to low self-esteem and insecurity because deep down
you know that your life is built on a house
of cards and you start taking shortcuts and then these
shortcuts lead to problems and then that pushes you to
take even more shortcuts to deal with the consequences and
then it just turns into this endless cycle and then
if you lie to others you also have to lie
to yourself you can't effectively lie to others without lying
to yourself and when you lie to yourself you're disconnected
from the only thing you have see you are the
only thing that there is in life there's nothing but
you this whole thing is you life is you when
we're talking about life we're talking about you so the
more disconnected you are from yourself the more you lie
and try to hide from yourself you're just playing a
game of hide and seek with yourself and that's ultimately
what life is it's a god playing hide and seek
with itself um dividing and united reuniting with itself disintegrating
and reintegrating itself but all the lies and the dishonesty
it corrupts your mind and you got to ask yourself
why are you doing it why do you tell a
lie why why is lying so common why do people
lie because it's very effective for survival that's the only
reason because you fear the emotional labor that would be
entailed by not lying by telling the truth like if
you cheat on your spouse or on your taxes see
and someone asked you about it did you cheat you're
gonna say no you're gonna lie why are you lying
because if you said yes that first of all that
would be painful for you to admit to yourself and
to others it would ruin your reputation how others perceive
you all those things you got to maintain but also
there would be legal consequences perhaps or you would lead
to a breakup of your relationship uh you'd have to
work extra you'd have to pay somebody some money maybe
you'd have to go to jail for a month or
a year whatever um you'd have to deal with all
the fallout from that and so to avoid that you
lie i mean perfectly understandable why someone would do that
but then of course if you had high integrity to
begin with you wouldn't have cheated to begin with and
then you wouldn't have to deal with all this fallout
so the solution is to have high integrity to begin
with and then the question becomes well how do i
raise my integrity if i was coming from an environment
with low integrity and see i totally get you there
um and in fact maybe i'll talk about this in
part two a little bit more get a little more
personal but i actually came from an environment i was
raised in a family where one of my parents was
very low integrity and this had huge huge ramifications on
my life the trajectory of my life why i even
got into personal development um and my own deficiencies in
integrity a lot of those were sort of inherited from
my family situation growing up uh and so i mean
people who grew up in environments and societies and like
poor countries third world countries war-torn countries corrupt countries it's
going to be much more difficult for them to have
high integrity than those who grew up in in nicer
areas simply because if you were born in a nice
suburb or something like that and your parents were wealthy
you have not you don't have much reason to lie
to manipulate to cheat to steal but you grew up
in some war-torn you know iraq where you're you know
your house was getting bombed and all this sort of
stuff and you know terrorists were knocking on your door
and you know they were going to kill you if
you didn't say the right things to them if you
didn't lie to them then you were forced to lie
you were forced to manipulate you were forced to exploit
you were forced to be corrupt otherwise you couldn't survive
corruption ultimately just survival so it is a real challenge
to raise yourself from a environment of low integrity to
high integrity you were very lucky most people don't appreciate
if you had two parents who were high integrity or
even moderate integrity if you didn't have a low integrity
parent mother or father you were extremely lucky you don't
know the kind of impact that would have had on
you if one of your parents was low integrity and
if you had two low integrity parents man you're probably
psychologically [ __ ] for a long time and you're
going to have to spend decades correcting that now don't
uh don't don't get depressed you can correct that i'm
not saying you're [ __ ] for life i'm just
saying you got issues and that's going to require some
serious work and i can empathize because i did have
one parent who was very low integrity in in many
ways and um i have a very intimate knowledge of
all the problems that come with a low integrity life
and it's difficult to unwire those habits because you pick
those habits up as you're being raised for example in
my family lying was very common it was not something
that like was i mean it was just like a
way of survival so of course i became a very
good liar and to this day i'm a very good
liar and sometimes i'm tempted to lie a lot um
but then i have to hold myself back and say
you know i could use that tool in this situation
and i could gain an advantage but it's going to
cost me down the road and i don't want to
go down that road it's just like with doing you
know heroin it's going to give you a great boost
for now but it's going to cost you later the
other problem with with low integrity is that it becomes
difficult even for you to become successful sometimes sometimes it's
possible to get very successful through low integrity activities like
trump has i mean cheating on taxes and screwing people
out of business deals that's possible but a lot of
times i mean in some ways it's amazing what trump
has done is how far he's come with such low
integrity but for many people for many ordinary people like
you it'll actually be difficult for you to even earn
a million dollars without some integrity without raising your integrity
because look to earn a million dollars realistically you got
to work pretty hard you got to be disciplined you
got to get up and do even if you're doing
something shady and scammy even if you're going to be
a car artist you got to work pretty hard at
being the con artist even if you're on wall street
you got to work pretty hard wake up early you
know put in 12 hour days 80 hour weeks to
to you know scam your money um the way that
you do uh but but even to do that you
got to be pretty disciplined and you got to be
able to trust yourself like people who have such low
integrity they can't even um trust their own words for
example when you tell yourself you're gonna do something do
you do it or do you fail and quit the
next day like you tell yourself you're going on a
diet and then you quit you don't have enough integrity
just even go on a diet most people don't when
you tell yourself okay i'm gonna work on this project
and then you quit the next week because it gets
tough well that's a lack of integrity see you keep
telling yourself you're going to do all this stuff you're
going to self-actualize you're going to meditate you're going to
do a retreat you're going to do some psychedelics you're
going to do some ayahuasca you're going to do this
you're going to do that you're going to you know
communicate better in your relationship you're going to be nicer
to your children you're going to judge less you keep
telling yourself all these things but then you go right
[ __ ] back to what you were doing that's
the lack of integrity and the more you fail to
follow up on your own values and goals and ambitions
and principles the lower your self-esteem drops your sense of
self-efficacy you you start to feel like a victim in
the world because you feel like every time you want
to do something your life experience that well i want
to do this thing i want to i want to
be an artist i want to be a musician i
want to be a movie director i want to be
a video game designer i want to be i want
to have a website i want to have a youtube
channel i want to have kids i want to have
a marriage i want to have great sex i want
to go do pick up i want to learn how
to flirt with girls i want to be funny i
want to learn all these things i wanna meditate i
wanna but then you you do all these things you
keep failing and failing and failing because you're not persevering
enough you're not disciplined enough and then after you've failed
enough of these times you become a victim it's called
learned helplessness learned helplessness and then you really believe like
life sucks and you can't you can't really be successful
in all this stuff leo you're talking about this is
impossible or it's just fantasies you know my life doesn't
work this way well this because you've fallen into this
downward cycle of of negative self-efficacy to the point where
you feel like you don't have much control over over
life anymore because you failed so many times and part
of that has to do with how you reframe failures
i mean i failed so much failure is crucial failure's
not a bad thing failure is is the greatest thing
ever but what you have to do is you have
to persevere and not get discouraged by the failure and
keep going even harder after you fail so once you
start adopting sort of cheating attitude towards life then you
start to cheat everywhere uh but then cheating of course
becomes counterproductive and it boomerangs like all selfish activity does
all selfishness boomerangs that's karma in other words so paradoxically
leading a life of high honesty and high integrity it
might seem like leo you're saying it's so difficult i
have to surrender the ego yeah but it's only difficult
if you're really attached to the ego actually you could
joyously sort of surrender the ego i mean it's still
going to be difficult but it's a good sort of
challenge it's like the challenge of you know lifting weights
at the gym it's challenging it's a little stressful it's
a little painful but it's good for you whereas when
you're sitting on the couch watching reruns of lost or
something and you're eating buckets of ice cream and you're
getting fatter and fatter and fatter and lazer and laser
laser have you ever done that and then you actually
feel so bad you feel worse there's more suffering and
pain from doing that than if you would have just
gone to the gym that's what it's like be careful
trying to live life the easiest way because usually people
who are chasing life to be the easiest they end
up having life the hardest so develop integrity i hope
you can see is the core of self-actualization it's the
core of spiral and ego development as we've talked about
in the spiral models and the susan k greuter models
it's the core of spirituality because spirituality is connection to
god and god is truth love and wholeness therefore requiring
infinite integrity and that's why a lot of times saints
are revered and you know people often say well i'm
not a saint so don't expect me to be perfect
what they're really doing there is is they're they're creating
an excuse for their own lack of integrity and why
do we revere these saints because supposedly and of course
a lot of this is just [ __ ] and
stories and myths but supposedly at least some of these
saints had exceptional levels of integrity and a human with
exceptionally high levels of integrity is is a natural leader
people look up to that they admire that why is
that the case well there's actually a very deep deep
reason for that and uh and we'll get to this
to that to the answer to that here in a
little bit of a roundabout boy but basically here's how
i explain it so here's something you should notice is
that when you encounter or see acts of high integrity
they will actually make you cry tear up with tears
of of joy and appreciation you probably experienced this watching
some movie if you tear up during a movie braveheart
or 300 band of brothers or you know some saving
private ryan i don't know whatever movies to tear you
up i don't know um uh what's going on there
something actually very profound is happening that most people don't
understand or for example you know people get inspired to
tears uh christ's sacrifice on the cross of course that's
the that's sort of the ultimate example of high integrity
or um yeah i remember that that scene from braveheart
at the very end it's probably going to make me
tear up uh at the very like the very end
of braveheart um you know already started when when they
put mel gibson on the on the table and they're
gonna like they capture him like the whole movie was
about you know it was the british who were trying
to capture the english or whatever they were trying to
capture mel gibson finally they captured him they and then
they're gonna torture him and then they they flame out
on this on this table in public the whole crowd
is watching and the king is there you know the
king has been his enemy this whole movie and uh
and and the king is on his deathbed he's about
to die he's so old but like the king's last
thing the last thing the king wants is just for
mel gibson to like admit his his uh you know
his rebellious that his rebellion was you know wrong or
whatever and uh and then he can die in peace
and so they time they'll give some to this torture
table and they have this like torture guy with like
all his torture implements and he's like starting to gut
mel gibson and all he has to do they tell
him they're explicit like all mel gibson has to do
is just um is just admit that he's like wrong
and apologize for leading this rebellion and and of course
he just yells freedom freedom right that's what he yells
and then they kill him integrity it's a movie about
integrity so there are many movies like this why do
these movies make us cry why do they make us
emotional here's the magic here's the deep spiritual explanation because
what's really happening with this occurs is that your mind
and psyche which is really connected to a universal spirit
which is god but it's clouded through layers of ego
and survival and defense mechanism all this [ __ ]
something pierces through this scene you're watching of mel gibson
or jesus on the cross or whatever something pierces through
all the veils of all that ego [ __ ]
all the human nonsense and all the lies and manipulations
cuts right through it and connects you to truth to
love and to god what's really happening is that the
thing that is animating the entire universe which is love
has been fragmented and polarized through various limited consciousnesses and
egos which are partial not infinite sort of like white
light being polarized through a through a prism into the
rainbow colors right so as a human you're one of
those rainbow colors like you're yellow or you're red or
whatever but then as the universe has god consciousness you're
white pure white all of them integrated together and so
what's really happening is that the god in you is
recognizing your spirit is recognizing intuitively in a way that's
much deeper than your conscious logical understanding it's it's intuiting
that the highest good in the universe is love and
your spirit recognizes selflessness and so when you see selfless
actions or integris actions loving actions self-sacrificing actions when you
see this depicted on the screen or you see it
in real life it brings tears to your eyes because
it shows you who you really are or who you
could be if you did this work and cleared up
all of your [ __ ] and you fully both
actualized and transcended yourself and became god so the god
in you recognizes the god in others and recognizes that
connection and recognizes the good the good with a capital
g if you want to know more about that check
out my series or not series but episode uh what
is goodness where i explain what goodness is so you
are implicitly recognizing the beauty and majesty of reality at
a metaphysical spiritual level when this happens and when that
happens you're in touch you're you're in your highest self
you're in touch you feel that love for a little
bit but then usually you forget about it you fall
out of it very quickly so really the whole point
of spiritual work and the whole point of integrity is
imagine imagine from now on you lived your life with
that kind of integrity that the mel gibson character exhibited
in braveheart if you just start thinking about that it'll
bring tears to your eyes of who you could be
if you did that start thinking about how you could
impact people how you could lead people how you could
move people how could you could connect and unite people
this is how you develop the most powerful vision and
sense of life purpose for your life and the deepest
meaning this is what life is really about and there's
not one way to do it you don't just do
it through meditation there's a million ways to do it
and it all of course hinges on truth and integrity
how do you make yourself more integris but but yeah
see it's difficult it's going to be difficult it's rare
for a reason because it's difficult for a finite human
to embody the attributes of the infinite that's really what
we're talking about how do you turn the in the
finite into the infinite and really you can't you gotta
you gotta die the finite has to die to the
infinite so really we're talking about the ultimate self-sacrifice to
achieve this which of course is the greatest fear you
have which is of course why it's so rarely achieved
by people and when it is achieved it is deified
literally deified as in the case of christ or the
buddha there's a great quote that i found from thomas
leonard which says it quote integrity reveals beauty end quote
integrity reveals beauty and it does very high levels of
integrity are beautiful why are they beautiful because what is
beauty beauty with a capital b is truth and love
and wholeness the most beautiful form of light we might
say by analogy is white light pure white light because
it contains all the other light within it integrated that's
the highest beauty and on all the other colors they're
also beautiful but not absolutely beautiful because they're partial and
they leave something out if you got blue you're missing
red if you got red you're missing yellow if you've
got yellow you're missing green but if you got white
you got them all integrity has a power of its
own truth has a power of its own truth is
powerful and i could cut through illusion that's the power
of truth and that's why throughout history mankind rulers and
politicians have always tried to control those who had high
integrity tried to kill them tried to excommunicate them or
imprison them why because people with high integrity are aligned
with the truth and the truth is the most dangerous
thing to a devil or to an ego it it
it erases the illusions that many powerful rulers and business
people and so forth devils and egos the illusions house
of cards is that that they can construct in order
to maintain their power like the illusion of a monarchy
right a monarchy is pure fantasy pure illusion built on
complete [ __ ] and lies that's what a monarchy
is built on and it needs those lies in order
to maintain itself so someone who comes along and starts
to question the monarchy with truth you know asking questions
and so forth he gets his head chopped off that's
how it works we see this happening right now in
russia with navalny versus putin you know navalny is a
pretty remarkable high integrity um political leader and he's he's
taken a real beating for it he might even get
killed for it which is actually quite likely pretty amazing
huge requires huge bravery fearlessness now i want to clarify
a few things here about spider-dynamic stage blue so why
do religious people stress stage blue values such as integrity
character discipline family values morality righteousness honesty virtue decency goodness
hard work honor loyalty responsibility surely you've heard religious people
stress the importance of these and oftentimes they do it
in a very sort of puritanical way they're very puritanical
about it because and in fact they do it so
they do it so puritanically and so dogmatically that it
ends up backfiring such that reasonable scientific people and skeptical
people who are not subscribing to that dogma they like
i said earlier like what happened to me is they
get a bad taste in their mouth just from these
words like when i hear family values i want to
throw up when some you know conservative on tv is
saying them why is that because we we know the
hypocrisy of it right we know the evangelical preachers who
preach you know about virtue and righteousness and honesty and
all this and then they're actually cheating on their wife
with some you know gay gay friend in a parking
lot and they get caught and they're lying about it
so you know we've seen enough of these cases that
we know the hypocrisy of it um and so we
see enough of that hypocrisy and we start to think
like oh well all that stuff is just [ __
] well that's a mistake you got to be careful
not to throw the baby out with the bath water
the the reality is that these characteristics are extremely important
to living a a good life the problem is that
these characteristics are easily faked and getting the genuine article
is very difficult requires a lot of consciousness and work
and it cannot be done ideologically or dogmatically or robotically
or algorithmically you cannot follow the ten commandments to get
integrity character and all some of these other values so
a lot of what's happening is that spiral dynamic stage
blue people they don't have a very sophisticated understanding of
human psychology and epistemology and all these topics that we
spent you know years talking about here in actual work
they don't have this information uh it took mankind many
thousands of years to get to this point to have
this kind of information accessible as it is now easily
for free and so forth through the internet you know
before that you know a thousand years ago how did
mankind tell itself how to live life well through these
principles and they taught them very religiously robotically dogmatically and
of course the majority of people who follow these principles
their lives did improve but also not to the highest
levels so really what was happening is that all these
characteristics and virtues and values they were really pulled from
the deepest most integres sages and mystics back dating back
thousands of years who discovered these through god consciousness they
discovered truth and love through god consciousness and profound mystical
states and psychedelics and meditation techniques and yoga and so
forth and then they tried to share this wisdom with
the rest of mankind but of course the rest of
mankind did not have enough integrity or consciousness to even
understand what they were talking about and they just turned
it into rigid rules to follow thou shall not kill
thou should not steal thou shalt not cheat and judge
and other things like this so the problem with stage
blue is not that they have these values and that
these values are wrong somehow these values are amazing these
values are important the problem is that they don't really
give you the tools and understanding necessary the depth of
understanding necessary to really understand how to genuinely develop these
values and virtues they just tell you to follow some
script but a script is not consciousness and what they
don't tell you is that consciousness is the key to
everything because everything is consciousness truth and love is consciousness
so without consciousness you can't you can't get these qualities
genuinely so most religious people what they end up doing
their whole life is because they've been brainwashed to believe
that they have to be moral and value family and
value honesty and decency and hard work and so they
do these things into a certain degree and in certain
sense it helps them uh but they don't really master
them and they don't really understand what generates them or
why they're important and so a lot of what they
do is they just fake them even a lot of
preachers and rabbis and imams fake these qualities they don't
really have it because you can't have it because to
have it you have to break down the ego to
break down the ego you'd have to also break down
christianity islam buddhism you have to break down all these
ideologies too which of course they're attached to and they
don't want to break them down you have to deconstruct
everything to truly have integrity character righteousness and honesty and
morality morality cannot be a formula and so the problem
we have is that we have a lot of these
uh you know stage blue versions of morality and uh
people have grown gone grown sour on them and disenchanted
with them rightly so but you have to be careful
not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and
basically what we need is we need a version of
spiral dynamic stage blue but which is totally open-minded totally
non-ideological non-dogmatic inclusive holistic relativistic and meta epistemic metaphysical grounded
and mysticism and consciousness and not partial to any any
partisan or sectarian human invention or construction or organization and
of course that's otherwise known as stage turquoise spiral dynamic
stage turquoise so it's not that the religious fundamentalists are
wrong per se it's just that they're very very partial
and uh very limited in their way of going about
aping genuine consciousness and love and holism they don't know
any better they need better tools better methods but the
problem is that their minds are so closed that they're
resistant to to learning those tools and methods the problem
with stage orange which comes after blue is that say
george tends to overly dismiss and poo poo integrity and
morality as quaint religious fantasies and wishful thinking enforced by
some external god but see integrity is not enforced by
an external god uh you are god and if you
want to realize your god you're going to have to
fully come into integrity otherwise you won't realize that you're
god you don't have to nothing bad will happen to
you other than the consequence of your own karma and
suffering which is pretty bad it's punishment enough you see
so there's a lot of truth in religion um but
there's also a lot of [ __ ] and that's
the difficulty of it is that it's so the the
the truth and the [ __ ] in religion and
even in spirituality and in new age teachings is so
muddled together that for many stage orange sort of scientific
rational people they don't even they're so disgusted by the
whole thing that they don't even want to spend time
disaggregating the truth from the [ __ ] and so
they just throw everything out maybe with the bathwater and
then that leads to the sort of lack of ethics
and lack of morality of sage orange which we see
on wall street in business in the business world with
capitalism run rampant and amok and all this sorts of
stuff so the fact that these stage blue people are
often hypocrites that's not a that's that's not a refutation
of the things that i'm talking about here or the
importance of stage blue integrating stage blue it's very important
to integrate stage blue it's just that they're aping you
have to understand that they're they're they're doing the best
it's like an ape seeing a human do something and
then you know he's not he he doesn't have enough
facility to to do what the human is doing at
the same level quality so the the ape will just
ape what the human is doing then it looks funny
to us well that's what the religious people are mostly
doing these christians and muslims and so forth and yeah
it looks funny it looks sometimes it's evil at least
to devilry it backfires the boomerangs yes of course and
they're huge hypocrites um but you know this problem of
hypocrisy goes so deep it's so difficult to not be
a hypocrite even calling other hypocrites is already hypocritical because
you yourself are a hypocrite all of us are to
various degrees the problem with integrity is that we demand
it from others but we make excuses for ourselves because
of course that's just our selfishness and our self bias
check out my episode by the way about self bias
for more about that check out my episodes about survival
part one part two very important episodes about how survival
works so there are a few traps i want to
point out here as we wrap up with developing integrity
uh you see another point about the religious stuff stage
blue is that um well see now you're probably wondering
well leo so it seems so difficult how do i
develop integrity well we're gonna talk about that in part
two but part of the challenge is that it's just
it's difficult to explain there's not a formula for how
to do it so i can't just tell you some
step step-by-step thing you follow and then you develop integrity
magically easily no it's going to be a hairy messy
process and there's a lot of traps a lot of
self-deception involved which is precisely why the religions have a
sort of a formula they give you they give you
a rigid dogmatic formula because otherwise it's too difficult for
most people to grasp at least with the formula you
can kind of follow it and you'll get mediocre results
but at least you'll get a little bit of something
you won't be you know a rapist or a murderer
hopefully if you follow the formula and you know they
they try to instill it to you with fear like
if you if you rape somebody you're going to hell
and that's why you shouldn't rape somebody and then someone
finds out that wait a minute leo you're saying that
the all these morals and rules are relativistic and they're
just constructions and that really i could rape somebody and
god won't send me to hell you're saying god is
all loving so why wouldn't i rape people if god
still loves me and i won't go to hell even
even for rape leo that seems wrong well no it's
not wrong it's just that the idea is that your
god and you're supposed to realize that raping somebody is
not in the highest integrity and aligned with truth and
with love see you're supposed to recognize that using your
own consciousness it's not that some god sitting up above
you is gonna send you to hell and torture you
for not recognizing that if you don't recognize it you'll
be a rapist and that's it and that that's that's
that there won't be any further punishment for your raping
other than you being a rapist and whatever you know
however humans choose to punish you for that god is
not going to punish you for that but you see
under it's a lot it's a lot more uh nebulous
and fluid it's difficult how how is the ordinary simple
person supposed to work with that and actually use that
to build integrity it's easier to build integrity by just
telling someone if you rape somebody you're going hell and
that's it so the person in their mind they supposedly
just say okay well okay i guess i can't rip
anybody okay i won't do it. and then many people
just don't do it out of fear but that's an
illusion that's a fantasy that's a fantasy that was constructed
to help those are like training wheels to help you
to not be a total monster and that was necessary
for society because you know we don't want people running
around raping and murdering people uh willy-nilly uh we want
them to have some fear about that that's probably good
creates a better society a little bit more order uh
that's what stage blues about is all about creating order
but they create a lot of fantasies and dogmas to
create that order so that's the cost and then that
locks down the mind the mind literally has to be
straightjacketed to create that order for society and then higher
stages of development releases that straitjacket the problem is that
when we release the straightjacket completely how do you not
become a [ __ ] monster and that's sometimes what
baffles people about this work is you know i tell
people i've said in the past it's on my um
some of my episodes i've said stuff like you know
um i've experienced levels of self-love so deep as i
my consciousness became infinite that for example if um if
i raped somebody or if i pushed a nuclear code
you know button to launch nukes and to kill millions
of people uh you know most people would judge me
as a monster for doing that right you probably would
judge me as a monster and never watch my stuff
again but the levels of love i've experienced the conscious
experience is so deep that i would i would not
i would completely forgive myself for doing that and i
would completely love myself after the fact even after i
did that and for most people that doesn't compute in
their mind because their mind is not flexible or open
enough to to grasp this sort of thing um because
they really believe that no that that's so evil how
could you do and then you forgive yourself no you're
supposed to feel guilty because guilt is something you've been
taught as a mechanism to constrain your mind to get
you to [ __ ] behave like a [ __
] dog you see you were trained like a dog
when you were growing up and when you took a
[ __ ] in the corner they beat you for
it metaphorically or sometimes literally and then you learned the
lesson and now you're acting out of fear but what
i'm talking about is not acting out of fear anymore
but when you fully become conscious there's no more fear
there's only love and there's truth so let me point
out a few of these traps that exist with developing
integrity here's a huge one be very wary of this
beware the trap of the super ego judgment and moralization
so what happens is that at first you start out
you don't give a [ __ ] about integrity morality
you poo poo the whole thing then maybe you listen
to me talking about you and then you contemplate and
you realize like oh wait a minute i was wrong
leo was talking about some important stuff here it is
important so let me start to become more moral myself
let me work on my integrity so you start to
develop integrity but then the ego latches on to integrity
and says ah look i spent the last five years
10 years 20 years developing my integrity look how integris
i am and then you want to show it off
and then when you see somebody in the news you
see trump on the news whatever and then you ah
look at that devil look how evil he is look
how little integrity he has and you criticize and you
debate and you judge and you yell and you whine
you do all this and of course as you're doing
this you're falling really truly out of integrity because judgment
brings you right out of integrity judgment is a low
activity a low integrity activity so beware the trap of
judging people with low integrity as your own integrity increases
because the ego is going to want to play this
game like i'm the good guy and those are the
evil guys i'm the self-actualized one i'm the awakened one
i'm god over here but those are devils over there
and they're not doing spiritual work and they're not doing
the things i want them to do and i'm the
righteous one and they are the wicked ones and we
got to fight those people over there and destroy them
right this is the the basis for all holy war
and not just holy war but a lot of you
know outrage politics and all this sorts of stuff so
be very careful about this genuine integrity doesn't judge others
it recognizes how difficult it is to develop integrity will
you truly develop your integrity by the time you reach
the highest levels of integrity you're going to go through
such a [ __ ] grind to get there and
so much suffering and you're going to surrender so much
of your ego that you're going to actually become compassionate
toward those who don't have integrity because you understand how
difficult it is for you how difficult it was for
you to achieve your integrity the cost was staggering and
so you understand of course that most people aren't going
to pay that cost and of course many people didn't
have the benefits you had they didn't have access to
these videos they didn't have access to psychedelics they didn't
have access to a good family or whatever that helped
you to develop this high integrity so compassion for those
with low integrity is very important this is also the
mistake that many stage blue fundamentals preachers and religious people
make is that they they they adopt this righteous ego
of condemning all the wicked people down there who are
not buying into their you know high ideals but they're
just ideals they're just ideas their beliefs they're not embodied
they're not at the level of consciousness they're just like
scripts that these preachers have realized and then of course
they're not able to follow these scripts even themselves also
beware the trap of getting jealous and envious it's easy
once you start to work hard on your raising your
integrity to get jealous or envious of those people who
don't give a [ __ ] about integrity at all
and just running a muck out there and earning lots
of money millions and billions of dollars donald trump style
and then you start thinking yourself well why the [
__ ] am i working so hard on my integrity
well well this [ __ ] out there is earning
millions of dollars and having a bunch of sex you
get envious and jealous of that so beware of that
trap beware of the stage blue trap of morality and
integrity which is a rigid following of some sort of
rules trying to turn integrity into an algorithm where you
don't have to be conscious you just have to follow
rules that's not genuine integrity it's not genuine consciousness that's
not going to work it's very crude it could have
some it'll it could help you i'm not saying it
doesn't work at all it does work it prevents like
the worst of the worst scumbags the stage read from
doing what they do uh you know it prevents some
criminality and creates order for society but it can only
get you so far it doesn't get you very far
you got to go beyond that beware of course also
the trap of guilt so you might start to think
that feeling guilty is a good way of developing integrity
and you'll probably start to feel guilty as you start
to first develop your integrity uh but of course the
problem is that guilt is also low consciousness and it's
also going to backfire on you and you're not going
to be able to reach the highest levels of integrity
through guilt which is why i say that if if
i ever do something really bad in my life um
i'm at the stage where i i it's it's almost
a little bit dangerous to say this where i won't
even feel guilty about it now that doesn't mean i
never feel guilt sometimes i still feel guilt but i'm
also at the point where i've experienced such deep levels
of self-forgiveness and self-acceptance and self-love that i could truly
do something horrendous socially horrendous or monstrous and not feel
guilt about it because i will forgive myself and for
many people that's scary it's scary to those people who
don't know how to control themselves consciously without the use
of guilt right that's something that has to be developed
that's pretty advanced a pretty advanced thing to develop is
how do you how do you act like a loving
caring decent person in the world without guilting yourself constantly
most people are only able to do it through guilt
and a lot of these stage blue people are so
guilt-ridden and it just it ruins their whole ability to
enjoy life because they're following all these rules it's not
coming from a genuine intrinsic motivation it's an extrinsically enforced
set of rules and then they feel guilty when they
break something and they're living the whole life this way
and they think that that's the only way to do
it it's not the only way to do it in
fact it's a trap you gotta transcend that but of
course they're scared they start thinking oh leo if if
i don't feel guilty for raping somebody then what's going
to stop me from raping them well consciousness and love
and selflessness and the transcendence of all of your egoic
cravings that's what will not your guilt you don't need
the guilt when you're truly loving and conscious you don't
need guilt to prevent you from raping somebody you also
don't need a prison sentence or some other kind of
extrinsic you know punishment or the the the the notion
of hell burning in hell you don't need this idea
once you're truly conscious and awake not to rape somebody
i know that's that's a that's a shocking i know
that's a it's a crazy idea for some of you
but yeah it's possible it's possible to be to not
be a rapist and not live in fear or guilt
about it and to not have a craving to do
it that's possible but it might require some work so
anyways to wrap up here it's very easy to preach
integrity in fact it's very easy for me to talk
about all this stuff the real hard part is after
i shut off this video i gotta go back to
my life and i gotta actually practice some of these
things that i've said otherwise i'm gonna look like a
huge hypocrite and then um i will be out of
integrity and then that will make me feel bad and
i'll be out of alignment with myself and with the
truth and with love so you see that's that's the
problem here is it's hard to practice this stuff but
easy to talk about and there are serious sacrifices that
need to be made really this is what the spiritual
journey is all about so that's it for part one
as your homework assignment i want you to contemplate the
importance of integrity in your life think about areas where
you lack it where you have it and what consequences
it has and how everything interconnects all the stuff we've
talked about all the different areas of your life business
relationships family marriages sex all this how does integrity fit
into all that and then do you want to get
on the path of developing integrity and if you do
stick around for part two next week where i will
talk about how to do that i'll give some examples
and talk about some of my own personal struggles and
challenges for how to do it all right that's it
i'm done here thanks for watching please click that like
button for me and come check out actualize.org that's my
website right there you will find some exclusive content there
you'll find my book list pretty important the life purpose
course i've already plugged that pretty important check that out
you won't regret taking it what else the blog exclusive
content on the blog the forum come chat on the
forum if you want to support me on patreon patreon.com
actualized and actually something new is coming i'm gonna be
launching a new channel second channel called actualized clips which
will be these long ass [ __ ] videos that
i do cut up into little five ten minute sections
i hired a an editor he seems like a good
editor who's going to be doing that managing the channel
posting those up there so for those of you who
are complaining about the length of my videos and you
want something shorter and uh punchier more to the point
without with less rambling and repeating myself and less examples
i like to give a lot of examples then you
will probably like that clips channel i will post an
announcement when it's launched we're working on that now it
should come out probably in the next few weeks month
at the most all right and the last thing that
i'll say is this so you might be wondering well
leo you made a pretty strong case here for stage
blue values and conservative values and you know aren't you
like a very liberal social type of socialist type of
person like progressive type of person and yet here you
are acknowledging the validity of conservative values isn't this a
contradiction no it's not a contradiction at all if you've
actually deeply watched and studied my spiral dynamics series you
understand that spiral stages build on top of each other
and it's not about being orange to the exclusion of
blue or green to the exclusion of orange but it's
about integrating them all and building on top of each
other so stage blue is actually a very important stage
and in fact for many of you that's where your
personal development needs to begin stage blue develops things like
basic discipline and work ethic which many of you don't
have how can you be successful in life how can
you earn a lot of money how can you meditate
how can you self-actualize when you don't even have the
ability to discipline yourself to eat a proper diet or
to work to have a strong work ethic to follow
up on your life purpose or to meditate every day
you can't so even though a lot of times i
rag on conservatives or conservative values it might seem like
or i speak down to stage blue well it is
because i'm speaking down to it but i'm speaking down
to it not because i reject stage blue it's because
i mean i've integrated a lot of stage blue the
beginning a lot of the beginning of my life in
my teenage years all through my 20s you know i
was i i worked a lot on developing a strong
work ethic discipline how do you think i got here
i don't get here by rejecting stage blue values i
could of course do more to integrate stage blue values
even deeper and i should and i i will do
that in the future i could always use more discipline
i could always you know polish up my my work
ethic and so forth there's a lot of good stuff
within stage blue the problem is that stage blue also
and especially now in pop culture with right wing media
has gone so far you know swung the pendulum so
far towards the crazy toxic end of stage blue there
is a healthy version of stage blue which is underrepresented
in the media and especially in right wing media and
it is important and um make sure you watch my
spiral dynamic stage blue episode and you really develop stage
blue don't skip it over that's gonna that's gonna really
[ __ ] your self-actualization in your spiritual work you
need to do very healthy stage blue while avoiding all
of that toxic um culture war ideological dogmatic closed-minded [
__ ] that you see in right-wing media that is
a part of stage blue but it you don't need
to go down that extreme side of stage blue you
can be on the healthy side of stage blue where
you develop work ethic and family values and honesty and
discipline and character and decency and hard work and honor
and loyalty and responsibility these are these are very very
good things you just have to distinguish between doing it
in a healthy way and doing it in a limited
rigid partial dogmatic way and then getting stuck in that
for the rest of your life that's the real problem
so there's no contradiction here and i don't spend that
much time teaching stage blue i mean this episode is
is unique in that respect but most of my time
is spent teaching other stuff because a lot of the
stage blue values and things are so basic really you
should have learned this in the first 20 years of
your life but of course i know that many of
you haven't i have some deficiencies as well so we
do have to remind ourselves to go back sometimes and
work on the lower stages of the spiral it's not
about about turquoise and yellow a lot of times you
can't get to turquoise yellow until you spend a few
years or even a decade really mastering blue uh orange
and green and if you have no idea what these
colors mean then you got to go watch my spiral
dynamics series is a life-changing a life-changing series that will
change how you see all of mankind and your relationship
to it and where you will go in your development
it's basically a map for human psychic development very powerful
stuff all right that's it stay tuned next week for
part two you
