            <ul>
    <li><b>Quantity vs Quality of Friends</b>: Leo addresses the common issue many people face: focusing on the quantity instead of the quality of friends they have. This often leads to superficial friendships based on numbers and not meaningful connections. He emphasizes that it's more valuable to have fewer, high-quality friendships with people who genuinely care about you.
</li><li><b>Investing Time and Energy Into Friendships</b>: Friendships demand effort and time. Leo advises viewers to consider how much time and energy they are willing to put into each friendship. Those looking for deeper relationships should be prepared to put in more. This could mean having fewer friends, but the connections would be more fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Problem of Not Socializing</b>: One key issue people face when trying to make friends is neglecting to socialize. Being physically present and interacting with people is crucial for forming friendships. People who lack friends often struggle because they spend too much time at home or work and aren't actively seeking social interactions.
</li><li><b>Having Time and Energy For Friends</b>: To develop and maintain friendships, time and energy are essential. People who work long hours or focus heavily on their careers may struggle to find the time for friendships. If you want the benefits that friendships offer, you need to invest time and energy into these relationships. If your current commitments limit this, consider reprioritizing your schedule.
</li><li><b>Wasting time on useless activities</b>: Spending time on unnecessary activities can prevent one from nurturing meaningful friendships. The time saved by cutting down on these activities can be used to spend with friends.
</li><li><b>Being judgmental and ruining relationships</b>: Sometimes, being overly judgmental can ruin opportunities for creating lasting bonds with friends. It's crucial to be open-minded and willing to learn from others.
</li><li><b>Unwillingness to explore different kinds of friendships</b>: There's a need to be open to having different kinds of friends with diverse beliefs, ideas and backgrounds. This helps to create a more open-minded perspective and expose oneself to new information.
</li><li><b>Feeling shy and unconfident in social situations</b>: Feeling shy and not being confident enough to introduce oneself or speak on topics of interest can prevent from making friends. It's important to overcome this and take the initiative when trying to build a friendship.
</li><li><b>Being fake in conversations</b>: If one's demeanor is not genuine or if one holds back on sharing personal interests and ideas during conversations, it can hinder the possibility of building a lasting friendship. Authenticity is attractive and helps in establishing meaningful connections.
</li><li><b>Not frequenting social environments</b>: If one is having trouble in making friends, it's likely due to not putting oneself out in social scenarios often. Joining groups, clubs, organizations or participating in social events can help meet new people.
</li><li><b>Judging people harshly</b>: Being judgmental can often be associated with keeping oneself isolated. Surrounding oneself with diverse and many people can help alter such attitudes.
</li><li><b>Getting diverse friends can bring profound changes</b>: Friends have the potential of introducing one to new ideas and experiences which can have a profound and transformative impact on one's life, making it all the more important to have a variety of friends instead of limiting oneself to people very similar to us.
