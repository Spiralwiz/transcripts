Hey, what's up, this is Leo for actualised.org. And today
I want to cover the topic of mastery. I think
this is one of the most important topics in self
development. Because it applies to really life in general, and
everything that you do in life, anything that you want
to get good at in life, which ultimately brings you
all the success that you want. So whether it's being
good in relationships, or being good in business, or being
good in your career, being good at sports, being good
at crafts, hobbies, cooking, I mean, pretty much you name
it, anything under the sun mastery is going to be
important for and this is such a such a powerful
concept that I cannot stress how important it is to
understand this, and it's not going to happen in one
go. So listen through this video, read the article below,
go through it a few times and see how you
can apply in your life. So what is mastery? Well,
mastery is this idea. Coming from a book, by the
way called Mastery by George Leonard, brilliant little book, I
really encourage you to read it, you'll find links to
it in the article below is the idea that human
beings develop proficiency at things. So there's a certain natural
process to getting good at anything. And there are few
other books like The Talent Code and talent is overrated,
which also mesh very well with this mastery idea, which
talks about the fact that there's this notion floating around
in, in culture that some people are more talented than
other people. And that if you're not talented at something,
then that's Oh, well, that's just the way it's supposed
to be. And nothing can be done about that. Mastery
on the on the other hand, tells you that you
can get good at things, and that there's a very
scientific way actually to go about it. And that there's
a natural process to getting good at something, whether it's
being good at your tennis backhand, or being good at
golf, or being an awesome chef, or just kidding as
to your career, whatever those cases may be, to get
good at it, there's a certain process that goes into
the that goes into it. There are also certain mindsets
that you want to bring into it, that are going
to ensure that you become a master. And this is
important, because most people are not masters. In fact, 99%
of people are dabblers, and they just try stuff out.
And then they go on to something else. So they
tried to get good at golf, and they fail, they
try to get good at doing their job, and they're
mediocre at it. And they jump around from one job
to the other, they never really become excellent. So what
we're talking about here is becoming very excellent at what
you do in whatever it is you choose to do.
So what you choose to do is not so important
as the fact that you just want to be excellent
at it. And the reason, this whole notion and understanding
of mastery is important is because it just normalizes what
you're doing. The biggest problem that I found with mastery
is that if you don't understand how the process is
supposed to go, you tend to have naive notions about
how it should go. And those naive notions ultimately lead
you to failure. There are a couple of mindsets that
are very counterproductive to mastery. So those are the ones
that I want to cover. And I also want to
cover, you know what kind of mindsets you do need
to become good mastery. So let's go into this and
talk about the real and the imaginary mastery curve. Now
I have images of these two curves down on in
the article. But basically, what we're talking about here is
that when people want to get good at something, so
let's say you want to get good at what do
you want to be good at? Let's say you want
to get good at tennis, right? This is a classic
example that that George Leonard uses in the book, you
want to get good at tennis? Well, you can come
in there, most people come in there with the imaginary
curve, learning curve expectation. So the imaginal, the imaginary learning
curve, what does that look like? Well, that looks like
this. It looks like if you have a graph, you're
gonna have the x axis, which has the amount of
effort that you're putting in, then you're gonna have the
y axis, which is how much gain you're getting for
the for the amount of effort you're putting in. So
people assume that, the more the more effort they put
in, the more gain they're gonna get, so that they
assume it's like a one to one relationship. Right? So
if I go and I practice tennis, I'm just gonna
get a little bit better each day. If I do
it for a month, I'll be so good. If I
do it for a few years, I'll be really good.
If I do it for 10 years, I'll probably be
ready to compete professionally. Right, and it's just going to
go smoothly for you. That's what I call the imaginary
curve. Then there's the real curve. Now the real curve
is totally different. And this is where a lot of
people screw up. It's To the real curve, it is
like a staircase. So basically what you've got is you've
got putting in a little bit of effort, and then
getting a little bit of return. In in terms of
your improvement, you put in a lot more effort, you
get another gradual return on, on improvement, you get another
improvement. And then you put in a little bit more
and you a little bit more. But notice that it's
a stair step, kind of curve. And the stair step
nature of it tells you that there are these things
called plateaus, and they tend to be pretty long. And
so what is a plateau plateau is a period where
you're putting in effort, but you're not seeing any improvement.
Now, this is the thing that throws most people off
and why mat understanding mastery is so important and keep
it in your in the forefront of your mind is
very important whenever you're undertaking something new. Because if you
expect that you're always going to be getting upward growth
and progress over time, without any plateaus, then you're really
living in Fantasyland. And you're setting a sort of setting
yourself up for failure because you're setting expectations that no
one can meet. And it's not just average, people can't
meet them, nobody can meet them, no matter how talented
you are, you're never just going to experience a steady
smooth progression in your skills, you have to work towards
it, you have to cultivate it, you have to practice
it. And as you do that, you'll get some improvements.
And you might get a lot of improvement. But that
improvement is not going to come linearly, it's going to
come erratically and there are going to be plateaus. So
how do you really deal with the plateau? Well, there
are a couple of ways that I kind of sussed
out here. So one is to really this idea of
bracing yourself. So let's say you're gonna go and decide
to become good at tennis, and you've never played tennis
before. Well, if you're naive, and you want a high
degree of failure, in that whole endeavor, then you just
go and start swinging, swinging a tennis racket and expecting
that you're gonna become great. That's the naive way to
do it. The more enlightened way to do it, if
you understand mastery, is to come in there and kind
of brace yourself and tell yourself, you know what, this
is going to be a challenge. And I have to
expect that I'm gonna there gonna be periods here where
I'm going to be putting in effort, and I'm not
going to be seeing any result. And that's okay, because
I know that that's how life works. I know, that's
how skills are learned. And I'm not going to just
expect smooth sailing, there gonna be bumps, there may be
even periods where I lose a little bit of skills.
And there's certainly going to be periods where I feel
like I'm putting in a lot of work, and I'm
not gaining anything. So bracing yourself with that sets up
some realistic expectations, which means that in the future, when
that reality hits you, it's not blindsiding you, you're kind
of prepared for it. And really, the other aspect of
that, that was for the case of when you're undertaking
something new, maybe it's a new job, maybe it's a
new diets, workout regimen, whatever. The second case is where
you're already in the middle of it. So maybe you're
already in the middle of up some project, let's say
you're in the middle of writing a book. Well, if
you're in the middle of writing a book, you're gonna
have periods where if you're doing something ambitious, something long
term, something that takes days, weeks, months to do something
that adds together and cumulative steps, then you're gonna have
periods where you're gonna get disheartened. And in the case
of writing a book, you know, maybe you've written a
couple of chapters, you're a few months into it, but
you still have most of it to go. And you're
starting to doubt yourself. And you're starting to tell yourself,
well, you know, my writing is not as great as
I thought it was, I thought I would be so
much. I thought my writing would have improved as I
was writing the first few chapters, but it hasn't. So
you're really getting down on yourself. And how mastery helps
you there is to really tell yourself that, no, you're
doing fine. You're just on a plateau. Right? If you're
putting in deliberate effort, if you're practicing, if you're sitting
at the computer every day and typing, you're doing what
you should be doing, right? I mean, there's a difference
between doing that and not doing anything. So if you're
slacking off watching TV, obviously, then there's something else wrong
there. And we're not going to go into that. But
if you're sitting there and you're typing and you're just
unsatisfied with the results you're getting, well, there might be
some tweaks you could make. I'm not saying that you're
perfect, or that you're doing it even the right way.
Maybe there's a totally better way to write but the
fact is that you're taking action, and chances are you're
moving well along that mastery curve. You're going to become
a master writer. It'll just take you years to do
it. And it's not just going to be smooth sailing,
it's not going to be just, you know, an escalator
right up, you're gonna have to take the steps and
you're gonna spend a lot of time on those plateaus
where you're typing stuff you're researching, you're, you're, you're learning
grammar, and this and that, and you're perfecting your, your
prose, and your writing style. And eventually, you're doing all
that. But in the midst of it for a certain
period of time, you might not see really any benefit.
And then all of a sudden, you'll see a boost.
And then again, you'll see nothing, and then you'll see
another boost, and then you'll see nothing. So this is
a natural process. So really, what what happens here is
we're normalizing your expectations, both when you start a project,
and when you're already in the middle of a project,
and you're kind of ready to give up or you're
feeling down on yourself. And then, of course, the other
way to really deal with plateaus, besides just recognizing that
they're there. And you'd be surprised, as simple as that
sounds, how how easy it is to forget when you
really need even a project that there are plateaus, constantly
reminding yourself. And second point is really to be present,
be more present in what you're doing. So this really
goes to a much deeper understanding of mastery, as not
just a couple of principles, or a couple of quick
fix how to techniques. Mastery is really a mindset. Great
example of this is, it's kind of the difference between
the stereotypical difference between eastern and western culture. I remember,
I was watching something on the Discovery Channel a while
a long time ago, where they talked about the kind
of artistry and mastery that goes into becoming a sushi
chef in Japan. Now in Japan, being a sushi chef
is like a revered culturally revered occupation, not like here
or it's just like there's some code right? There. It's
something that you really become a master at almost like
becoming a samurai warrior, or a kung fu master or,
or a monk, you know, that kind of stuff, things
that you really put love and effort into. And so
what they talked about with the sushi chefs in Japan,
is that for the first, for the first two years
of their training, all they do is they're taught to
properly prepare rice, sushi rice, right? That's all they do
for two years. Could you imagine that? If that's the
kind of training you had to go through to become
a sushi chef, could you have the stomach for it?
Would you have the patience for that kind of like
kind of meticulous attention to detail and to to your
craft to mastery. So really what's happening there is those
first few years there, the chefs are just learning to
rinse the rice to prepare the rice to the perfect
consistency, the perfect temperature level of doneness, make sure everything
the taste is spot on, and how to choose the
rice. So all these elements. And Now contrast that with
the Western mindset or the kind of the Western way
of thinking about getting good at something or getting even
success. So in the east, we'll say that you have
the sushi chef who spends a decade learning how to
cut fish and prepare rice. And then in the West,
you kind of have the polar opposite of that idea,
which is just like, well, what would be a good
example? Well, probably the best example is like shortcuts, like
win the lottery get rich quick, some sort of get
rich quick scheme that you see on a late night
infomercial, about how you can start internet, your own internet
business work from home earn over $100,000 a year with
no efforts super easy, you don't need you don't need
any capital. You don't need any knowledge. You don't need
any skills anymore on conduits started in started in your
basement. So all these kind of marketing all this market
bullshit marketing lingo that is appealing to that. Western, maybe
maybe it's more fair to call it like that American
notion of like, give me give me what I want
right now. Give it to me without any effort on
my part. And make sure that it's just the way
I like it. It's perfect. And and then let me
move on to something else. So it's that kind of
shortcut mentality where you're not putting it. Like you're not
putting the love into it. You're not learning anything. It's
that it's totally different from the mindset that you have
with the Eastern Eastern stereotype. Where it's like you have
that kung fu master that goes out in the early
morning at the at the crack of dawn and stands
there and practices meditation and his and his his standing
positions in his routines. And he does that for 12
hours straight. And then he goes and he he writes
in his little journal and he dissects every every little
move every every fight that he's been in, and he
dissects all the moves. And he masters that art. And
he does that consistently for years. Even when I'm talking
about it almost seems like because I grew up in
this American culture of do stuff fast. Get me all
the get me all the excitement without all the boredom.
Without all the mundane, nitty gritty details, you know, I've
kind of grown up in that. So it's really hard
to pry yourself out of that, and put yourself more
into that Eastern mindset. Here's the thing. And you might
ask, Well, why did why should I want that Eastern
mindset? Why? Why wouldn't I want the Western mindset? Isn't
it better to just win the lottery? And then go
do whatever the hell you want to do? Isn't it
better to just, like, be super successful? Like, isn't it
awesome to climb the corporate ladder within a few years,
and be the head honcho, we'll get to know. I
mean, if you're able to do that, and sustain it
over the long haul, and you enjoy the process of
all that, then great. The problem has to be is
that that kind of thinking leads to a lot of
failure leads to a lot of mediocrity. So you start
something new, this is the classic, one of the classic
examples that you start something new, like maybe a sport
or a hobby or a job. And then you see
just how much effort is involved with, with being successful
at it with being good at it. And then as
soon as you see that, you quit, and you start
something new. And then that doesn't work for you. Because
that also requires effort. Sure enough, and so you have
to go and do something else. And that requires effort,
too. And so what you find yourself doing is you
find yourself bouncing from one thing to the next thing
to the next, without really getting any, any true mastery
built. And when you do that, well, first of all,
you're really limiting your success. Because in the West, even
though they get rich, quick mindset is enforced in the
marketing. And like in the culture, that's what the culture
values, but what does the culture actually reward? How do
you actually get rich? How do you actually get a
good reputation? How do you get all the all the
kinds of rewards that you want in life, even in
Western culture, it's actually through hard work. For some people,
it doesn't come through hard work, they just get lucky.
But unless you're that fortunate person, you're gonna have to
rely on hard work. And most of the people out
there that are very successful, that are rich, that are
doing good, that have started businesses that are fit, that
are healthy, they have great relationships, they've worked on all
that stuff, that stuff did not come naturally to them,
all that stuff required going through this stair step process
that we talked about, right. Whereas most people assume that
it's going to come easy. I mean, relationships are a
great example, how people assume that relationships should just be
natural, effortless, you're just in it, it feels great. There's
no effort involved. Well, if you take that approach, it's
a little bit hard to be successful in a relationship,
you're gonna find that you actually have to work at
it, you're gonna maybe have to read some books, you're
gonna maybe have some conversations with people that you want
to have conversations with, maybe you're gonna have to admit
that you're doing certain things wrong and work on yourself.
And that's a process that can be difficult. It can
be painful at times. And it also goes in that
stair step in that stair step fashion. So there's really
this problem, if you grew up in America, that you're
probably very much influenced by this western mindset that we
talked about. And if you want to get very successful,
and maybe right now, if you're thinking, Well, you know,
like, I'm moderately successful, but I'm not as successful as
I want to be like, I have so much more
potential that I've been able to actualize so far. And
you're kind of scratching your head, you're like, Huh, why
is that? Why can I Why can't accomplish more? Well,
I can guarantee you this probably because you don't have
some element of this mastery mindset working for you. You're
not applying mastery to your job. You're not applying mastery
to your health, you're not applying it to your relationships,
or any other thing that you need to feel accomplished
and to feel like you're achieving all your potential. So
starting to get this mindset into place is super, super
important. Now, in the book, George Leonard talks about three
attitudes, three common attitudes that are anti mastery. So these
will will kill your success and will lead to failure
in one way or another. And he gives them names.
And he calls them the first one, the dabbler mindset.
The second one is the obsessive mindset. And the third
one is the hacker mindset. And then of course, the
fourth one is the mastery mindset. So this is what
we've been talking about all along. So let me just
quickly go through these because I think you're gonna be
able to really identify with a couple if not all
three, or maybe just one. So the first one is
the dabbler. What is the dabbler we already kind of
mentioned this The dabbler is the person that is always
seeking thrills. The dabbler is the one that always craves
novelty. So he goes and he joins. He goes, he
goes, and he joins the gym. And he goes, and
he gets a new job. And he goes, and he
starts playing tennis, and picks up another hobby. And he
does great at it for a week, maybe two weeks.
And then soon enough, he realizes, you know what, this
thing? This thing is much harder than I thought it
was. This is not so what I what I really
thought it was going to be. That's not what I
bargained for. And he always sees the grass greener on
the other side. So he's like, Well, you know what,
instead, why don't I? Instead of going to the gym,
why don't I just why don't I do something else
instead of that? The gym is isn't really my thing.
It's not for me, I wasn't, I'm not really talented
at the gym. I'm just, I'm just naturally not very
athletic. And then you know, tennis? Well, tennis isn't really
good. I'm not really good at hand eye coordination. Why
don't I go do some other sport instead? Why don't
I go do bicycling and fighting bicycle will be better
nine, and then he goes into bicycle bicycling. And it's
like, you know what, I'm not really good at being
outdoors. I don't really like being outdoors, maybe I should
go do something indoors. And then he'll go do that.
And then oh, you know what the indoor thing. Also
not really my style, maybe I really rather prefer to
do something else. Maybe I'd rather do scuba diving, and
we'll go do that. And then they'll do something else.
So he's always bouncing from one thing to the next
without ever putting the time in to get good at
it. And that's because he's always looking for novelty. He's
grown up on that. That kind of a jolt that
you get from starting new things. Whenever you start something
is kind of exciting. It's new, and then it wanes.
And if you don't have discipline, and you don't have
the right expectations and that mastery mindset in place, well,
you're gonna give up on it. So if you are
someone who's a dabbler, chances are your relationships are pretty
short. chances are you'd like to start new hobbies without
finishing them. Chances are you have a long resume, and
all those jobs on your resume can be pretty short.
Because you don't like to stick around in one spot
too long, you get bored with it and move on.
So there it's like boredom with the ordinary, you always
need thrills. That's the dabbler. The second anti mastery mindset
is the obsessive now what the obsessive does is he
is really gung ho, and he jumps in whatever he's
doing. So he goes to play tennis, he's gonna go
all at it, he's going to put in extra time,
he's going to invest extra money, he's gonna get the
best rackets, the best equipment, he's going to spend an
extra half an hour after class to learn all the
points from the instructor. And he's going to go practice
on weekends, and on weekdays, and he's going to read
about it online, he's gonna buy books, and he's gonna
get all his energy is going to get thrown into
this one activity. And he's gonna do it with a
lot of fervor and a lot of commotion. But eventually,
what happens is that that pace that he has, it's
ultimately unsustainable. So for a few weeks, he's doing great.
But then eventually what happens is, and he because he
gets those initial gains, from the initial effort that he
puts in, he gets some of the gains. And he's
happy about it. But what happens later is that he
hits that first plateau, right? And he's not ready for
it. He doesn't expect it. Because his thinking is like,
well, if I put in so much effort, I should
be getting more results than everybody else. And I shouldn't
have to endure moments where I'm not improving. And so
he gets that first plateau, he gets very frustrated. And
then maybe he plows through it. And then he gets
that second plateau. And he basically self destructs it's like
a crash and burn. So the obsessive because he's putting
he's really overextending himself, he tends to lead to catastrophic
failure. And again, this this leads to starting stuff and
never finishing it and never developing a mastery mindset. Because
mastery is, is even keeled. Mastery is solid mastery is
consistent. It's not spiky, right? It's not dramatic. It's not
emotional. It's not always climactic. So the obsessive what are
some, some kind of features of the obsessive well the
obsessive tends to have rollercoaster relationships. The obsessive tends to
have a lot of relationships that hurt other people. The
obsessive tends to be very kind of chaotic and unstable
with a lot of highs and lows, very high highs
and very low lows. And they just tend not to
be very consistent type of people. Maybe you know someone
like this, maybe you know Have someone like this intimately?
Hopefully not. So what's the third, the third is the
hacker. Now the hacker is the kind of person who,
who is pretty even keeled. And almost maybe even seems
like he's kind of got that mastery mindset. But the
problem with the hacker is, is that once he reaches
a certain level of achievement or progress along that mastery
curve, maybe halfway, he stops, he basically doesn't have a
lot of ambition. So he gets, he gets comfortable somewhere
on one of those plateaus along the way. And because
mastery requires effort requires diligent practice. It requires learning, it
requires expanding your comfort zone and your horizons. If the
hacker is uncomfortable with that, if the hacker loves being
safe, and loves being comfortable and doesn't like taking risks,
then chances are he's not really going to advance to
those top tiers of performance, that someone with a mastery
mindset would. And so the hacker tends to be the
kind of person that just does decent, but doesn't accomplish
anything great. And that's not what we're what we're about
here to actualize.org. So we're looking about ways, we're talking
about ways to actualize you to get you to your
full potential, right. And so if you're stuck on one
of those rungs, then you're probably lacking a little bit
of ambition. And that is the hacker, the hacker tends
to have very stable and boring relationships, their life tends
to be all the same, they tend to live in
the same city for the rest of their life, they
tend to be at the same job all the time,
for the rest of their lives, because they're just in
a very comfortable groove. And they also don't tend to
grow, and they don't tend to accomplish great things. So
those are three mindsets you really want to watch out
for. And the alternative to all that, again, is mastery,
the mastery mindset. So what is the mastery mindset? Well,
we've talked a lot about a lot of the different
facets of it already. But I think one of the
key elements is that it's about being process oriented versus
results oriented. And this is what I mean about being
in the process, being in flow, and being present when
you're in the mastery mindset. So it's teaching yourself that
you're not after results, you're after about your after doing
the process well, and enjoying the process. Because if you
think about it, you know, if it takes you 10
years to become good at something, like if it takes
you 10 years to become awesome at tennis or if
it takes you 10 years to advance at your job,
there's there's almost no way you're going to do that
on on a short burst on a short, spiky burst
of emotion, that's something that's going to have to come
through discipline. And it also is not going to come
through this kind of pressuring, and hard grinding discipline where
you're grinding through, no one's going to be able to
last for 10 years of grind, you might be able
to last out a year of grind, maybe two, but
not 10. And so you're never gonna become great, you're
also gonna become resentful. So what you want to do
is you want to instead of keeping your eye on
the results, you want to keep your eye on the
process of getting the results. Huge, huge, huge distinction, it's
going to take some time to really condition that into
you. And it's just you hearing it once it just
doesn't do the concept justice. Here's the difference. And maybe
you pride yourself actually on being a results oriented person.
Like you pride yourself on getting results at job, you
pride yourself at raising awesome kids, you pride yourself at
being great at the hobbies that you're doing. You're pride
yourself on being great friend, you pride yourself on all
these things that you do so well. And all the
results that you get. You know, that's well and good.
And you should keep an eye on your results periodically.
But not always. And you don't want to be running
and chasing after results to get thirsty, blood hungry dog,
right? That's not That's not what you want. You want
something a little bit more sustainable, more consistent. And that
is process oriented. That means developing a curiosity about the
process and making sure that it's fun for you. So
how would you do that? Well, this is going to
be different for every activity that you're engaged in, but
making sure that whatever it is that you're doing, first
of all, it's at a sustainable pace. And by sustainable,
I mean you could do it for the rest of
your life. And it wouldn't cause you energy problems, it
wouldn't cause you any sort of money problems, whatever. So
making sure that you're at, you're going at a sustainable
pace is always good. Another one is to really find
ways to make it fun. So instead of worrying so
much about being productive, think a little bit more about
being fun, in whatever it is that you're doing. You're
probably going to encounter points in your career or whatever
you're trying to master is where you could either do
one, do one scenario and be extra productive, or do
another scenario have a little bit more fun, but less
productivity. And if you're driving yourself hard, if you're high
achiever, and you are focused on the result, you're going
to be tricked into going for that highest productivity option,
we're, in fact, maybe the better alternative is the one
that's more fun, even though it produces less productivity in
the short run. And the reason that is the reason
you want to choose this latter option is because it's
more sustainable again. And if it's more sustainable, you're gonna
do it over a long period of time. And in
the end, the volume of time that you put in
is critical. So if I able to put in one
year doing it this way, where it's high productivity, and
I'm able to put in 10 years doing it this
way, where it's slightly lower productivity, but more fun. Well,
this 10 years is going to generate a lot more
success for me in my life, most likely than this.
The trick is to think longer term about it. Right?
And to develop patience. And how do you do this?
I mean, there's, there's more, there's many ways that I
talked about more in depth in the article, if you
read down below, but one of them is just developing
a love for the minutiae of what you're doing. So
even when you're repeating, and you're doing mundane things, that
seem like little details that could be just easily glossed
over. Well, the difference between the master and everybody else
is at the master develops subtle distinctions. And he learns
from constantly repeating the same things over and over again,
that's what makes him the master eventually, because he's got
the patience for it. In fact, he enjoys doing that.
So it's not a challenge for him, it's a grind,
it's a pleasure. It's not a grind. And everybody else,
well, they're so eager, and so focused, so, so blood
thirsty for results, that they, they pass up all the
fun stuff, they pass up all the interesting stuff, all
the mundane stuff, and that they just tend to jump
on the result. And sometimes that will get you the
result. But that's not going to be a consistent result.
And it's almost like you're getting that without building yourself
up, as well. So you can get results. But it
doesn't mean that you've kind of built yourself up to
deserve those results. And I don't mean in some moral
sense. But I mean, in the sense that if you
lost all those results, would you be able to easily
go back and recreate them? Or would they be gone
forever. And you would be fearful that you were just
lucky that first time and that you would never be
able to replicate that success. Again, with the Master, there
is no worry about that because the master has grounded
success in himself. Whereas the dabbler or anybody else has
kind of stumbled their way to success. And they're living
in fear because they never know when that success will
be taken away from them. Many times it could be
just through fluke, and they never know whether they can
make it back or not. So just that the it's
not the same in terms of consistency, the results are
different. Also, it's about how you feel internally, the master
is much more calm, because he enjoys what he's doing.
Whereas the dabbler is almost attention deficit disorder. It's like
borderline Attention Deficit Disorder, it's like you're jumping between one
thing to the next thing to the next thing without
ever sinking your teeth into something. And there's a certain
richness, emotional richness that you get when there's something throughout
your day that you can do that you really love.
One of the best things about being on the mat
on getting yourself on the mastery path and staying on
it is that you're going to have these, these core
skills that are going to be part of you forever.
And that you're always going to keep adding to it
adding to and that feels good, that process of adding
on to something that you've already had. It's amazing. I
love that feeling. It's like that's why I love personal
development because I see every little bit that I assimilate
from my environment. So every book I read is a
little bit of extra information I added my brain makes
me a little bit smarter, a little bit better able
to deal with the stuff around me in the world.
And you know, every every person I talk to a
little I learn a little bit more from them. And
every business I go into a little learn a little
bit from that. And so over time, like I'm amassing,
I'm amassing this, this power in myself through self development.
And it's very gradual. Each, you know, each little piece
is only a tiny fraction of the whole but if
you do that for 1020 years, it adds up to
a lot it adds up to amazing stuff in fact,
it it makes people seem magical when you see somebody
when you see a top performing athlete when you see
a top, you know an amazing actor anybody really who's
at that world class level, an amazing entrepreneur, it's usually
because they've accreted through a process of accretion, they've really,
they've come to mastery through this gradual process of adding
a little piece by piece by piece, not by going
out and finding one thing that gives it all to
them. It wasn't a get rich, quick scheme, it wasn't
a lottery, it wasn't. It wasn't something that just fell
in their lap, they had to really work for it.
And that's where, again, diligence and hard works, comes into
play. So, you know, staying on the mastery path is
challenging. And starting the mastery path is also challenging. So
there are two challenges here. The reason starting the mastery
path is challenging is because of this concept of homeostasis.
So homeostasis is the tendency of your body to keep
its to keep itself in its present state of, of
being. So biologically, like your body is good at regulating
his temperature, it tends to keep his temperature constant, regardless
of whether you're out in the sun or you're you're
in the cold. So that's kind of like biological homeostasis.
We also have like a homey, homeostasis, a psychological homeostasis,
which is your mind's tendency to keep itself in its
own state of being. And so it really refuses to
do new stuff, unless you push it out of the
comfort zone to reset that thermostat, so you can think
of your mind as a thermostat that has been set
by by past experiences to a certain level where it's
at right now. Now, if you want to shift it,
let's say you want to start a new job, a
new career. If you want to do your relationships in
a totally different way, from the way you've done them
before, if you want to maybe pick up a new
hobby or new sport or improve your diet, well, that's
gonna require shifting of the thermostat. And that is something
that your body's going to naturally resist. So again, part
of this whole idea of communicating mastery to you is
just setting up the proper expectations. So one of the
best antidotes against homeostasis, succumbing to the kind of the
drag of homeostasis is just to expect that it's going
to be there and to brace yourself, prepare yourself for
it beforehand. So that if you're going to go to
the gym, realize that the first few weeks are going
to be tough. Realize that maybe if you're going to
start going to the gym for the first time in
your life, realize that maybe it's probably not a smart
idea to at that point in time also start something
else new Slyke, maybe you also want to go learn
tennis, doing both of those simultaneously, probably not smart, because
you're gonna be so worn out from the gym, you're
not gonna be able to do the tennis or you're
going to be so engaged with a tennis, you're not
gonna have time for the gym, your body is going
to react against those 212 changes in your life violently.
And what's going to happen is it's going to send
you reeling back to your comfort zone, and your thermostat
is going to if it was here, it's going to
bump up, and then it's going to bump and then
your body will naturally but you're going to bump it
up your higher self will bump it up and then
your body will naturally bump it down. And see that
back and forth that back in. It's like one step
forward, one step back, you don't get anywhere you don't
get progress. And eventually you get frustrated. And you just
feel bad, you feel guilty, and you don't feel like
you're as accomplished as you want to be. So instead,
kind of realize that if you're going to shift your
thermostat, if you're taking something new on in your life,
first of all, recognize that it's a status thermostat shift.
And if it is a thermostat shift, then recognize that,
okay, this is something I actually have to plan for.
I probably don't want to just wing this. So I'll
try to set up my schedule so that I have
time to be able to follow through on this Jim
thing, I'll make sure that I have a little bit
of extra time to do it, maybe I'll even take
a little bit of time off of work to make
sure that I follow through very consistently. So that's the
kind of diligence that you need to put into it
to be successful. Whereas if you're just gung ho about
it, you just jump in there, like you people tend
to do on a New Year's resolution after they stop
themselves full of Turkey and taken and all that junk,
then come January 1, they tend to jump on on
the gym, and it doesn't stick, right. So mastery is
critical to making stuff stick to making you successful in
the long run towards generating the kind of value that
you want to generate. The way I tend to think
about value is that if I want to have an
awesome life, if I want to travel if I want
to have money, if I want to have good relationships,
if I want to enjoy my day to day existence
while I'm while I'm working at my job, so you
know if I'm typing with a keyboard or whatever I'm
doing if I want to really enjoy that, all those
things have to be bought with effort in some way.
And I tend I think that those have to be
bought with mastery points basically. So you earn mastery points
by, by, by diligent practice by diligently practicing whatever it
is that you want to get good at. And eventually,
over time, over months and years, you're going to get
good at it. But if you expect to be good
at it right off the bat, chances are you're setting
yourself up for failure. And if you keep insisting on
your stubborn ways, and you refuse to adopt the the
mastery mindset, what's going to happen is that you're going
to spend, you're going to waste years of your life
frustrated, not making any progress doing that, that dance that
one step forward, one step back dance, and you're gonna
get fed up with it and eventually what might happen
is that you just might kind of get disenchanted with
that whole process of growth and you're gonna get you're
gonna settle for for something mediocre and that is not
what I want you to be doing. So that is
it for mastery. I think I've covered that concept pretty
well check out the article below there's a lot of
in depth stuff including some images a link to the
mastery book, and, and more in depth stuff that I
wasn't really able to cover here through video. All right,
for now, peace out
