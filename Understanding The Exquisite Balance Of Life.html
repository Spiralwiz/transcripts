[Music] thank you [Music] Exquisite and Sublime balance we're going
to be talking about balancing this episode from uh slightly
more elevated and profound perspective than I've talked about it
in the past I have an older episode called the
role of balance in personal development which talks about this
important topic of balance in a more practical way so
if you're looking for that that's out there now we're
going to take a more existential spiritual look at the
role of balance in all of life and the whole
universe so this word Exquisite or this word sublime comes
to mind for me when I think about balance nowadays
Sublime balance I'd like you to notice is a fundamental
feature of reality I'm going to be using these words
Exquisite and Sublime interchangeably you can think of reality as
a knife balanced on its point and the more spiritual
work you do the more conscious you become the more
you'll start to notice this the more aware you will
become of the genius of the balance that is struck
all throughout the Universe and it will leave you in
Wonder and in awe this Balancing Act it's a dynamic
Balancing Act of infinite intelligence which is a property of
Consciousness itself so Consciousness constantly doing this Balancing Act which
is resulting in reality as you see it all around
you now here's some definitions from the dictionary for the
word exquisite quote marked by Flawless craftsmanship or by beautiful
ingenious delicate or elaborate execution marked by nice discrimination deep
sensitivity or subtle understanding and pleasing through Beauty Fitness and
perfection end quote and here's a dictionary definition of the
word sublime remember this word sublime quote lofty Grand or
exalted in thought expression or manner and of outstanding spiritual
intellectual or moral worth and tending to inspire awe usually
because of elevated quality such as Beauty nobility or Grandeur
or Transcendent excellence end quote so that's what we mean
by Exquisite balance Sublime balance it's not just ordinary balance
you know like for example if you talk to a
molecular biologist or some scientists a physicist a astrophysicist you
know they might say that you know isn't it amazing
how fine-tuned nature is how fine-tune the cells that make
up your body are or how fine-tuned the constants of
physics are that enable this physical material material Universe to
exist and to function as it does in physics there's
this thing called uh the fine-tuning problem there's like five
or six physical constants you know like the gravitational constant
the speed of light and other ones that are less
well known and these constants you know the physicists tell
us that if these constants were off by even just
you know a fraction of a decimal point then life
in the universe would not be possible and so this
is one of the Mysteries of the universe that sort
of puzzles scientists it's like well is that an accident
is it uh how did this come about did it
evolve this way or is it just that there's like
a million other universes out there and all of them
are dead and lifeless and horrific and it's just we
just happen to be in the in this perfect one
this sort of Goldilocks universe that allows us to have
the kind of amazing intelligent life that we have and
all these other um you know harmonies that are found
in nature um and so scientists do have some appreciation
of the importance of balance in in nature in life
in biology and chemistry and physics but they don't understand
how profound this balance is and what it takes to
really strike this balance they think that this balance can
be struck by accident but this isn't just an accidental
balance or it's just it's a it's a consequence of
just some random mutations that's not what it is literally
Sublime balance and that's what this episode is going to
help you to start to recognize as you become more
conscious more mature more wise more developed more spiritual you
appreciate the balance more and more and you desire to
align yourself with this balance the balance of the universe
and to practice and to embody this Sublime balance you
want to mirror the sublime balance that you see all
around you and to become more conscious is to see
more and more of the intelligence of this balance the
Deep intelligence you as God become an instrument of balance
in the world you're not just admiring the balance of
God all around you you're participating in it as a
Creator the choices you're making contribute to either maintaining the
sublime balance of the universe or destabilizing it and that's
a function of your consciousness and your awareness of the
intelligence of the universe the refinement of your Consciousness will
become a Force for rebalancing the world think about that
that's powerful that also plays a lot of responsibility on
you can you handle that much responsibility see wisdom and
we've talked about this before the notion of wisdom wisdom
is knowing the proper balance of things in life and
in the world and really profound wisdom is to be
able to strike the kind of balance that God would
strike so you can take a look at the balance
of let's say a monkey jumping from Branch to branch
in the canopy of a rain forest and the incredible
balance that it takes to do that without missing a
branch without ever falling you can take a look at
that or you could take a look at the balance
of a hummingbird flapping its wings just right so that
it can hover just at the right place to stick
its nose into a flower and suck out the nectar
and then do it again and again and again with
laser-like precision you could take a look at the balance
of the flow of nutrients through your body and the
chemistry the molecular chemistry biochemistry within all the cells of
your body you know working together all the organs working
in harmony together making sure there's enough oxygen to every
organ there's enough sugar to every organ there's enough you
know taking out of of the the CO2 and the
other kinds of chemicals that you know the the waste
chemicals and making sure that all of that is functioning
perfectly you could take a look at that you could
be in awe of that balance see and from that
if you think of that as like the balance of
God's intelligence you know God's intelligence is balancing all the
cells in your body because you're not doing it consciously
your ego is not doing it its Universal intelligence that's
doing it but then in your personal life you are
making choices your ego is making choices you know who
do you want to sleep with what kind of food
do you want to eat what kind of job do
you want to have when you want to go to
sleep when do you want to wake up these are
the balancing choices you're making in your life you know
how much porn to watch how many video games to
play how much to meditate how many videos to listen
to and so forth all right so you have a
little bit of control over over some of this stuff
and most people screw this up most people's lives are
very very out of balance you should notice including your
own you struggle to balance your own life you struggle
to balance your bank account you struggle to balance your
love life your your porn addiction and all this other
kind of stuff right so for you to be really
wise what that means is to balance your own personal
life with the same kind of exquisite and Sublime balance
and intelligence that is balancing the cells in your body
and the motion of a hummingbird and um all the
other examples that you can find throughout nature so you
can ask the question how would God balance the situation
how would an infinite intelligence balance a situation whether it's
your bank account or our political system or your dating
life and so on how would a system be balanced
if it was balanced by a force that was omniscient
had infinite Consciousness infinite intelligence infinite selflessness infinite love Infinite
goodness and infinite lack of bias what kind of balance
would that kind of Consciousness or intelligence strike that's a
very powerful way to to think about balancing systems in
the world and in your own life you see the
fool which is the opposite of a sage or a
wise person the opposite of wisdom is foolishness the fool
is unbalanced not only is he on balanced but also
he lacks the vision to see the sublime balance all
around him so he takes the sublime balance of the
universe for granted he takes it as just accident and
he ends up veering too far into one extreme or
another and I've talked about the the difference between wisdom
and foolishness in my episode what is wisdom so this
dovetails with that part of what we said there is
wisdom is about having Keen discernment and also wisdom is
about knowing how to strike balance where does wisdom come
from wisdom comes from intelligence wisdom comes from Consciousness God
being infinite Consciousness and infant intelligence has the highest wisdom
and of course the highest wisdom is selflessness and love
so how would your life look how would the systems
you're interacting with look if you balance them with the
kind of intelligence that God would use to balance nature
so for example the kind of extremes that the fool
Will Veer into are the fool will want more money
more power more sex more food more pleasure more drugs
more Fame more cars more houses more boats and Yachts
more parties more sexual partners a bigger business more work
endless growth these are the kind of extremes that the
fool tends to fall into the fool doesn't know moderation
because the fool is driven by craving an attachment and
the fool doesn't see far enough ahead to see the
problems and limitations with these excess and extremes so the
fool turns into a cancer this kind of attitude of
more and more and more of everything becomes a Cancer
and and ends up leading to the destruction of the
fool because the fool doesn't know how to moderate himself
doesn't know when to stop when too much of a
good thing becomes too much of a good thing there's
something beautiful that is found within balance When You See
It acrobat balancing on a tightrope you know 100 feet
in the air there's a beauty to that when you
see a hummingbird balancing perfectly to suck on a flower
there's a beauty to that when you look at the
molecular biology that is responsible for all living organisms the
way that DNA is replicating itself the way that oxygen
and CO2 is permeating through various membranes in the cells
and how hormones are regulated there's a profound Beauty to
that kind of balance when it's working well it can
strike awe in you that's not an accident there is
a connection between balance and between Beauty and the more
conscious you become the more you see the sublime balance
of everything and also the more Beauty you recognize within
the universe now here's something to note though is that
when I say balance I don't mean that everything is
equal or perfectly symmetrical see balance is a much more
subtle notion than that because there's also Deep Beauty in
asymmetry and the real trick of balancing the universe is
that how do you balance asymmetries there are many asymmetries
in life and in the universe so you can't just
balance it simplistically by cutting everything down the middle some
of the most beautiful things found in nature are balanced
asymmetries for example the masculine and The Feminine they're asymmetrical
but they are balanced see it's easy to balance something
symmetrical like you can take a yardstick you know a
long yardstick and just bounce it on your finger you
just stick your finger right in the middle of it
that's easy but what happens when you have an object
that's not perfectly symmetrical and it's not easy to just
Define its Middle Point all the time and yet you
still need to be able to balance it somehow with
everything else in the universe because you see you can
think of it this way what God is is God
is the intelligence the highest most intelligence in the universe
that is looking out for how all the parts of
the universe are going to cohere together and function together
as a whole now you could take the position that
such an intelligence doesn't exist and the universe is just
you know made up of different parts and that are
randomly coming together and just somehow fitting together and somehow
they all end up working without destroying each other and
that it just you know just sort of happened by
accident that all these different parts and atoms and molecules
and things and planets and galaxies that they all just
somehow they all just fit together and they they all
just kind of cohere into a single thing we call
the universe or reality and somehow it just all just
works and this is just this is just by accident
that no intelligence went into designing this thing you could
hold that view that would be the materialist position or
you could wise up a little bit and have a
few Awakenings and realize that in order for all these
diverse and asymmetrical parts and components to work together seamlessly
without a hitch without the whole thing blowing up or
turning into some kind of monstrosity or some sort of
hellscape that um this this required quite a bit of
intelligence in fact not just a bit of intelligence it
was only possible through infinite intelligence and so you can
have that Awakening for yourself and then you just become
awed at how how intelligent this Consciousness was that it
was able to look at all the parts and balance
them perfectly even though the parts are so different you
know how do you balance just think about the planet
Earth how do you balance all the animals living on
this planet there's like hundreds of thousands of different species
there's trillions of ants and cockroaches and then there's millions
of birds and there's millions of reptiles and then there's
billions of humans on this planet how are they all
balanced together because you see like really think about this
from a sort of like a very nitty-gritty micro perspective
like you got to make sure that the like that
the oxygen that humans are inhaling and the CO2 that
they're exhaling that that balances out with the exchange of
gases between all the plants all the blades of grass
on this planet all the trees all the flowers all
the shrubs and bushes this has to be balanced out
because otherwise it couldn't be sustainable otherwise all the plants
would die because they wouldn't have enough of the gases
they need otherwise all the humans would die because they
don't have enough of the gases they need and then
of course you have to balance all that out with
all the nutrients like the plants need nutrients they can't
just grow just purely from sunlight they also need nutrients
but then the animals also need nutrients and the plants
end up giving the nutrients to the animals then the
animals when they die they become nutrients for the plants
right so it's the cycle of Life thing and this
has to be balanced across literally trillions and trillions of
iterations across the whole planet and that's just one planet
that needs to be balanced within our solar system now
our solar system contains like 10 or so major planets
but then each of these planets have moons we have
one Moon but like a big planet like Jupiter or
Saturn or Neptune they can have 20 or more moons
they'll have to be balanced in order to keep going
round and round and round right because if the planets
were not perfectly balanced with the gravitation of the Sun
and also their moons and all the other planets in
our solar system then they would quickly deorbit and they
would fly out of the solar system our whole solar
system would fly apart and yet here it's been our
solar system has been around for uh many billions of
years going strong the orbits are very consistent how do
you balance this I mean it's just it's [ __
] mind-boggling when you start to think about it um
and we haven't even gotten into the crazy balance that's
going on within even just a single organism just within
your body there are literally trillions of balancing chemical reactions
that are happening right now in your body that are
responsible for you just being able to decipher and decode
the words that are coming out of my mouth these
are just noises right noises within air you're deciphering all
this and it's all perfectly balanced incredible incredible the feat
of balance that is happening here that everybody is just
taking for granted including scientists and so far all we've
talked about is one single solar system one star you
know how many stars there are in our galaxy Milky
Way galaxy I think like over a hundred million or
even billion I'm not even sure there's so many you
start to get the M's and the B's confused and
then you know how many galaxies there are in the
universe there's like a hundred billion galaxies that we've so
far discovered and that's just the visible universe that we
know of there's there's probably way more beyond that that
will be discovered you know not too distant future so
this is what we're talking about here and notice that
all these are asymmetrical it's not like all the you
know all the animals are the same all humans are
the same all the chemical reactions in your body are
the same no there's like your body alone has asymmetrical
organs the heart is very asymmetrical relative to the kidneys
to the liver to the brain and so on how
do you balance all those very difficult thing to do
requires infinite intelligence a fool does not know how to
balance asymmetrical things this episode is not about telling you
how to balance your diet or your finances so much
this episode is about helping you to reach a point
in your Consciousness where you can look at a hummingbird
sucking on a flower and appreciate a Sublime balance and
intelligence in it to be able to zoom out and
to see the intelligent balance in human conflict and War
in human societies and ecosystems reality is a landscape in
which asymmetrical forces are constantly balancing themselves themselves out which
would not be possible without this profound intelligence and ultimately
the point of this episode is to reach a point
of Consciousness where you see the Perfection the absolute perfection
in the balance of the whole universe you can actually
have an Awakening to that to the Perfection of this
balance it's not just a pretty good balance it's not
just an amazing balance what will really blow your mind
is when you realize it's an absolute Perfection of balance
it's absolutely perfect and of course the only way this
Perfection can be struck is with infinite intelligence can you
see this most humans are blind to it because they're
too self-absorbed and they take it all for granted they're
just busy surviving they're not seeing the bigger picture of
what's Happening Here so from now on you're going to
train yourself to see this you're going to notice it
and you're going to label it you're going to see
that hummingbird flying past you sucking on a flower and
you're going to say oh my God that right there
is an example of sublime balance wow that's amazing look
at the intelligence at work in this hummingbird but of
course not just this hummingbird you're going to take this
kind of perspective on everything you see in nature but
also within mankind too and that's even more of a
challenge because you can kind of intuitively get it when
you're out in nature although most people still don't but
those of you who are a little bit more sensitive
can intuitively see the sublime balance found within nature within
hummingbirds and so on but then where you don't see
it is within the the realm of human Affairs within
politics within government within war and conflict that is going
on around you all the imperfection all the human [
__ ] this seems like a contradiction to the sublime
balance of the universe and yet it isn't but it
takes a really careful eye to be able to see
that part of the problem is that you're so close
to it you're so enmeshed in it that you don't
have enough objectivity to see The Balancing Act that is
going on and its perfection I have two older episodes
called holism and holistic thinking part one and part two
where we talk about holism and health and we connect
those two together very important series episodes make sure you
go watch that if you haven't yet but now I
want to draw your attention to the fact that health
and holism and balance are all deeply connected Health means
to balance between all the parts of a system that's
what health is when all the parts in your body
are balanced you have health and when something is out
of balance you have dysfunction you have sickness you have
disorder you have cancer you have death the same thing
in your car when all the parts in your car
are functioning as they were engineered and designed with intelligence
they aren't working against each other but with each other
in harmony then you have a well-functioning car that can
take you places but as soon as the parts start
working against each other now you have dysfunction now your
car breaks down now you need to go get it
fixed and get stuff realigned you see how this works
goodness Beauty and health is a certain kind of balance
between all the parts in a system whereas ugliness evil
disease and pathology is a certain imbalance where one part
tries to dominate or monopolize all the other parts where
it comes into friction with all the other parts and
we can say that the system is self-interfering it's interfering
with itself it's at odds with itself it's contradicting itself
that's profound you can think of evil as simply being
one finite part of infinity the universe trying to act
as though it were all of infinity trying to monopolize
it to dominate it to work at odds with all
the other parts in the universe what was the fundamental
problem with Hitler why is Nazism pathological why do people
call it evil in the sort of colloquial sense of
that term well fundamentally is because it was one country
that got so out of hand relative to all the
other you know countries around it all of its neighbors
that had tried to dominate it and it tried to
go at odds with the will and agenda of all
the other countries in such a manner that it became
completely pathological and it had to be destroyed either it
was going to destroy all the other countries or the
other countries were going to destroy it and so in
a sense you could look at all of World War
II as just a balancing out of various kinds of
geopolitical forces ideological forces economic forces on the continent of
Europe and then of course it spread to the rest
of the globe as well because you can't just confine
these kinds of things just to a single continent anymore
the world is becoming globalized so it's humanity is way
too globalized for these sorts of conflicts just to remain
local conflicts it Cascades the effects Cascade through through the
entire human Network to all the continents everybody was touched
by World War II even people living in remote places
in Africa were still touched in some way by World
War II because everything in the universe is connected to
everything else pretty profound huh so how is any of
this useful well here are some of the Practical takeaways
the action steps you can actually start doing to implement
this in your life so it's not just philosophy start
to actually look for balance and to appreciate balance everywhere
your living your life whatever you're doing whoever you're interacting
with the machines that you're using the computers you're using
the the animals around you start to appreciate the balance
start to appreciate the balance in your own body too
or lack of balance Maybe develop a Keen Eye for
balance and imbalance notice when things are in balance and
notice when things are out of balance surround yourself with
balanced people have you noticed one way to adjudicate between
different qualities of people is how balanced is the person
mentally physically emotionally spiritually financially and the people who give
you the most problems in your life what are these
people who they're imbalanced people mentally emotionally financially spiritually they
have all sorts of addictions they're prone to violence and
anger these are unbalanced people because they have unbalanced minds
they subscribe to all kinds of Twisted pathological ideologies that
corrupt their mind and then lead to unbalanced lives of
course practice becoming more balanced yourself that's ultimately what this
is about you're going to be seeing the balance out
there in the world but then also you're going to
be learning the lesson learning the lessons from nature and
elsewhere of great examples of balance and then you're going
to be adjusting your life and your body in your
mind and your emotions to also be in Harmony and
in balance and then you're going to be adjusting not
just to be in balance with your own self and
your values and so on but then you're going to
be adjusting to balance yourself and the organizations that you're
a part of to the larger Collective whole that you're
a part of which is the society your company your
country and ultimately the globe and start catching yourself when
you get out of balance so this is a distinction
you can make like you can ask yourself right now
am I in balance or am I out of balance
it's a very simplistic distinction of course balance is much
more than just a binary of yes or no are
you balanced are you unbalanced there's many degradations and degrees
of balance a lot of different distinctions you can make
there but just like to get you going just a
very simple one is like am I in Balance right
now or am I out of balance and if you
notice yourself being out of balance then maybe you set
some rules for yourself like don't make important decisions don't
make an important for phone calls don't post on social
media don't uh maybe don't don't talk to your spouse
when you're out of balance or if you do tell
that person you know right now I'm out of balance
so I'm not going to be having this important conversation
with you I'm not going to be communicating right now
I need some time to put myself Back in Balance
then from that place of balance then once my mind
is in Balance then we can have a conversation I
can post on social media and do other things like
that this will save you a lot of trouble in
the end what you want is you want to create
the most beautiful life possible Right what does that mean
that means a balanced life but of course when I
say Balanced Life that doesn't necessarily mean what you think
it means a balanced life can be balanced in a
very asymmetrical way that doesn't mean that you know a
balanced life means that you have to like wake up
on time every morning and go put in your eight
hours of work and then you know eat your bagel
every morning at the same time and have your cup
of coffee and then you know go spend time with
your children for a couple hours and then do it
all over again the next day they're like that's not
necessarily what a balanced life means uh there's a lot
of different ways that you can balance your life so
there's a couple of traps here when we're talking about
balance trap number one is balance does not mean that
you simplistically split everything down the middle track number two
is that balance does not mean that you follow the
status quo and conform to what everybody else is doing
just to try to be like normal right because there's
a lot of like what Society consider considers like a
stable balanced person which is really just a cog in
the machine that serves the The Matrix so to speak
uh and they would call this a sort of a
a decent balanced individual um you should distinguish that kind
of Conformity from True Balance balance doesn't mean just being
normal and fitting in because you know what a lot
of times the system you're fitting into is already itself
out of balance and is dysfunctional and it's sick and
it's cancerous so by you fitting into that system and
being a good well-willed clog in the cancer machine of
your corporation that might seem like that's balanced but that's
not actually balance you see that's just you fitting in
that's conformity so beware of that trap and beware the
following trap is that balance does not mean that you
are meek indecisive milk toast in different and neutral in
various kinds of situations right like for example on the
issue of Nazis taking over Europe to be balanced does
not mean that it's like well on the one hand
Nazis are bad and uh they should be stopped on
the other hand you know what's wrong with Nazis you
know maybe Nazis actually have some good points and then
you say well I'm just gonna be neutral about it
because Leo told me to be balanced and Leo said
that God is all about balance and you know in
this situation God would just sort of like split the
the the difference down the middle between uh anti-nazis and
pro-nazis in Europe but that's not that's not what God
would do and that's not what I'm telling you to
do uh we'll talk a little bit more about this
as we keep going um and then another note to
make here is that remember that balance is not a
static situation ballast is not something that you achieve and
then you're stuck on that and you just maintain that
that's not true balance true balance is dynamic the universe
is always evolving new things are always happening you might
think that well but but what about like the planets
they're they're in this sort of static static balance you
know they have the same orbits they just keep going
over and over and over again for for millions of
years that's actually not true the planets are not statically
balanced or dynamically balanced their orbits are always oscillating a
little bit and in fact at any moment the orbits
of the planets could break and the planet could fly
off into outer space or come crashing into the Sun
or into the earth that is technically possible not likely
but it is possible because the balance is dynamic things
are always changing and eventually all the orbits of the
planets they will all break down and collapse because eventually
you know the sun will turn into a red giant
that will change the gravitational fields that will probably alter
the various kinds of orbits eventually the sun will probably
explode or implode you know depending on its mass and
so forth and the particulars of all that eventually there
will be a black hole or there will be a
white dwarf or some other sorts of thing will happen
with the sun and as that happens the gravity of
the whole solar system will will shift around moons will
fly off crash into each other plants will fly off
planets will get absorbed into the sun all this sorts
of stuff would happen and eventually all of it will
will collapse but until that happens there's a dynamic balancing
act that is going on with these planets the same
thing is true of your body even though there's incredible
laser-like precision within the chemical molecular balancing act that your
body is doing every moment and it's going to be
doing that for about 80 years eventually corruption will creep
in there and the whole thing will break down and
something eventually will become so out of balance that you'll
die in fact that's what death is what humans call
death is really just something goes out of balance enough
in your body that it becomes um critical it becomes
lethal either your heart gives out your kidney gives out
your liver gives out your brain gives out usually one
of these major organs gives out and then you're done
so God is the intelligence that balances between all the
finite parts of itself because reality the universe has to
be a unity all these parts have to be working
together all these parts what unites them all is that
they all have to exist existence is the unifying force
of everything so how do you get all these asymmetrical
finite parts to coexist together in a way that is
not monstrous in a way that is beautiful that is
harmonious how do you do that well that's the only
job of God you might say is to sort out
that problem that's a very big problem requires a very
big intellect to solve that problem notice you have Parts
within your psyche that are out of balance with themselves
you have Parts in your business which are out of
balance with themselves notice you have Parts within your society
that are out of balance with themselves notice you have
people in your life that are out of balance with
your values and your goals and your life purpose that
you've set for yourself these are just a few examples
of the way that things get out of balance for
you personally and notice that all these situations when they're
out of balance they lead to Great suffering in you
great misery and dissatisfaction with life on the other hand
when all these things are in balance and in harmony
that's what you call happiness profound huh wisdom and intelligence
is a Keen Eye for when a thing is out
of balance and how to best put it back into
balance and this is a tricky thing because it's non-algorithmic
there is not a simple formula for how to balance
everything in the universe or even just your own psyche
or your circle of friends or your business or your
Society how do you balance these things that's the real
question there can be no rule book there can be
no simple Ten Commandments that can tell you how to
balance Society you can have principles and rules of thumb
but in the end the problem is so fine-grained it
goes down to all the way to the atomic level
you see The Balancing Act has to happen at all
orders and levels of the hierarchy of the actually better
to call it hierarchy we've talked about haul our keys
in my episode called what is a hold on go
check out that one so how do you balance all
the whole lawns in the infinite chain of being that
is the universe well you gotta like start at the
very subatomic level that [ __ ] has to be
balanced because if you don't balance it there you know
the Corruptions and imbalances will Cascade up the entire haul
our key so you got to balance it at the
atomic level subatomic level then the atomic level then the
molecular level then the biological level then at the sort
of macrobiological level at The evolutionary level at the species
level at the level of cities and societies and families
and countries right and then the entire planet and then
solar systems and galaxies and then the whole universe it
has to be simultaneously balanced at all scales do you
see how monstrous of a challenge this is what kind
of intelligence this requires you can barely balance your [
__ ] bank account it's hard for you you can
barely balance your diet you can barely balance your media
intake given your human level of intelligency the human brain
is the most intelligent thing that we know of on
this planet we think we're so intelligent and yet you
can't use these like hundreds of billions of calculations and
neuron neural connections that is happening in your just in
your head in one single human head that is not
enough to balance even the food you put in your
body you struggle with that every day think about the
kind of intelligence that is required to balance every single
scale and Order of the hall our key down to
infinity and up to Infinity and have it all perfectly
balanced so it doesn't fly apart it's insane it's an
insane level of intelligence now you might say but Leo
in the past you've said reality is perfect absolutely perfect
so if it's absolutely perfect isn't that a contradiction because
supposedly if reality was absolutely perfect then how can anything
be out of balance and why would there be anything
to balance in the first place and obviously Leo you
know in the human realm we have all sorts of
things that are out of balance we have people with
diseases with Cancers we have wars and we have genocide
and all these sorts of things which seem to be
like examples of stuff that's out of balance in the
universe these would be like imperfections which contradicts the idea
of perfection but this point is actually way more subtle
and tricky than you think from the absolute perspective the
way it works is is that reality is absolute perfection
is perfectly balanced however you have to realize that the
human distinction between balance and imbalance is itself a duality
and that eventually this itself must collapse and you must
incorporate imbalance into the overall meta balance of the whole
universe so all those imbalances you see within human Affairs
those are like micro level imbalances within the absolute meta
balance that is going to happen long term over the
Arc of the entire universe so it might seem that
the rise of Hitler this imbalance in Europe that this
is an example of the lack of perfection of the
universe actually it's not if you develop enough Consciousness and
vision and a long enough time Horizon you'll see that
it's not because in the end Hitler was just a
rebalancing of forces on the continent and of course after
his demise you know Germany experienced a long period of
of balance and still maintaining that balance to this point
um but you have to understand that what humans consider
imbalance that humans are looking at very short time scales
usually of a year or two or maybe a decade
or maybe at most 50 years that's the judgment that
human the kind of judgments that humans are making you
know 50 years at most sort of time Horizons and
so from this perspective you can see that a lot
of stuff is out of bounds but if you take
an infinitely long time Horizon you'll see that all those
imbalances actually add up to a larger meta balance and
that's part of what I'm trying to get you to
see with this episode remember also that you are part
of God it's not like you're just an observer sitting
outside the universe observing all this balance slash imbalance stuff
like uh impartial Observer no you're entangled with the Affairs
that are happening on this planet and with the whole
universe for that matter you're entangled with God at a
fundamental level so the decisions you're making or not making
the decisions you're stalling on go see my episode how
to become more decisive for more on that most people
are just stalling on making decisions but when you're not
making a decision you're still making a decision you're making
a decision not to act and so that is a
part of the entire meta balance that is happening in
the universe and also your mind's ability to recognize imbalance
is part of the meta process that God is using
to balance and create absolute perfection you see so for
example when you see the Holocaust happening in Europe your
mind sees that and you have various ways you can
react you could get horrified you could become moralistic about
it and condemn Hitler and all that you could go
fight a war over it or you could choose to
do nothing you could turn your eye to something else
you could say oh well that's not my responsibility you
see and when you're doing that you're participating in The
Balancing Act and you become a pawn for God so
to speak you become a pawn and a probe for
God to rebalance the universe your mind is the interface
that is allowing that so you may shirk your responsibility
for example in the case of the Holocaust you might
say well why should I act you know I don't
want to put my ass on the line I'm not
going to go to war I'm just going to I'm
going to retire on a tropical island in the Caribbean
and I'm gonna forget all about World War II and
the Holocaust you could take that attitude you see but
somebody else will act in your stead and go restore
the balance of the world and the universe now you
might say well Leo but if that's going to happen
if somebody else is going to go do it for
me instead then it's like what's the point of me
even going doing it myself if God is going to
balance the universe no matter what then why should I
even play a role why don't I just sit back
and let God do it all for me why should
I stress over it well you see the thing is
is that when God is balancing the whole universe it's
doing it out of complete selflessness and love it's not
doing it for any other reason but just because it
appreciates the beauty of the order and Harmony that it's
going to create now you as a selfish finite you
know creature on planet Earth you might say I don't
give a [ __ ] about that all I care
about is just like having sex on my tropical island
and you know um why should I care about the
order and the beauty of the whole you know universe
that doesn't interest me okay fine it doesn't interest you
but then that's a choice you've made you see and
then notice though something is that for you acting that
way and taking that attitude other people will counterbalance that
you know other people for example might denounce you they
might call you a devil they might even come and
kill you on your tropical island because let's say you
were a draft Dodger and so you didn't want to
go to World War II to fight Hitler and so
you just fled your tropical island and you might think
well all's well and good but see there's there's consequences
for shirking responsibility in the world of human affairs and
they're suffering that could come with that I mean you
could start to feel guilty about what you've done for
example um or what might happen is let's say you
don't go fight Hitler and because of that Hitler defeats
the allies conquers all of Europe and then eventually you
know he you know he's nuts he wants to dominate
the whole world eventually Hitler comes and you know conquers
the United States and then eventually he takes over your
Caribbean island too and then when he gets to you
he sends you to the gas chamber see and that
is a consequence of the decision you made now you
might say well Leo but but if God allows that
didn't God allow for some sort of like imperfection in
the whole scheme isn't now everything out of balance so
Leo the ultimate question I guess would be this like
if I just choose not to take any responsibility and
not to play this game God's game of balancing the
universe then doesn't that mean that the universe will ultimately
be out of balance because I refuse to balance it
and the answer is very interesting and paradoxical the answer
is no the universe will always be in perfect balance
but that doesn't mean that it's going to be in
Balance according to your little egos needs wants and expectations
so it is possible for example Hitler to take over
the whole world if nobody opposes him and everybody shirks
their responsibility for fighting him it is possible that he'll
take over the whole world and you know kill half
the population including you who was shirking your responsibility that
is possible and from your point of view it'll seem
like oh well Leo this is an injustice you know
God is being so unjust for allowing Hitler to to
take over the whole world and to kill all the
good guys well but you allowed that you see you
participated in that shrinking of responsibility um but even if
that happens and let's say he kills your family and
you and all that in the end what I'm telling
you is that eventually the imbalance of Hitler will be
balanced out by other means so if humans don't do
it it'll happen some other way he'll die of natural
causes or um you know the Nazi regime will just
crumble under its own incompetence and Corruption or eventually people
will just get sick you know after 100 Years of
Nazi Rule people just get sick of it and there
will be a revolution or a revolt uh uh or
eventually aliens will fly uh you know fly over Earth
and they will you know they will nuke the whole
planet because it's just like a toxic [ __ ]
hellhole of Nazism let's say right so there's nothing let's
say there's no more redeeming qualities about planet Earth so
they're just they'll just you know glass it from the
atmosphere and in that way they'll restore order and you
might say well Leo that kind of like that's kind
of far-fetched like how can you be so certain that
the universe will always balance itself out couldn't it be
the case that you know something can get so out
of hand that eventually the whole thing just like implodes
and gets sort of like catastrophically out of balance and
so um my answer to you is no that's not
possible and the reason that that's not possible is because
the universe is absolutely perfect and it's balanced by the
highest intelligence there cannot be a higher level of balance
than that which is governing this universe now that might
seem like that's just sort of like wishful thinking or
some sort of naivete on my part you could hold
this idea from a position of naivete like maybe you're
some sort of new Ager and you just say oh
well you know everything's going to work out just because
you know God is good that's not what I'm telling
you um what I'm telling you is you can become
so conscious of the intelligence governing this universe that you
will realize that this universe is absolutely perfectly balanced that's
not an opinion that's absolutely the case but again remember
you're in the very Nexus point of this balancing act
so it's not like the universe is balanced some sort
of static way it's like whatever actions you take are
going to be contributing to the Perfection and the balance
of the universe so whether you decide to go fight
Hitler or not that's going to contribute to the absolute
perfection of the universe either way it's going to be
absolutely perfect now you might say well Leo but if
it's going to be perfect no matter what then like
doesn't that mean that the Perfection is meaningless because if
the universe is perfect whether there's Hitler in it or
not then what is the what is the point of
even calling it perfect at that point or balanced it
seems like it's just kind of like a word game
you're just describing Perfection to anything at this point which
defeats the point of calling something perfect well here's the
trick though is that your notion of perfection is relative
Perfection Perfection with the lowercase p whereas the Perfection I'm
talking about is I'm talking about the Awakening to absolute
perfection Perfection with the uppercase P that literally means that
no matter what happens it's perfect nothing happens but absolute
perfection you could also talk about balance with a capital
B absolute balance that means no matter what happens that's
what absolute balance is this is not something you believe
this is something you awaken to this requires Awakening now
you might say well Leo if it's going to be
balanced out no matter what why should I even act
or take responsibility for anything because it seems like God
will handle it and the answer is this that goodness
and love which is really the source of all balance
in the universe goodness and love these have no reasons
behind them essentially you're asking me Leo why should I
be good if I can just be evil like it's
sort of like the same problem that happens when I
tell people that you know God will forgive you for
no matter what no matter what you do in life
God will forgive you no matter how you act God
will forgive you because God is all loving God will
love you no matter what you do and then you
know if you're a devil you can say like ah
okay well if God will love me whatever I do
then I'll become a rapist Leah why should I become
a rapist then and the answer is if you want
go be a rapist now there will be consequences to
that that you yourself will not enjoy but uh go
do it God's love for you will not be diminished
by you becoming a rapist it won't change God's love
at all it won't change the goodness or Perfection of
the universe at all not even one bit um and
you might say that this is a flaw in the
design of the universe no it's actually not a flaw
this is a feature not a bug because you see
goodness and love have to have no reason to them
you're asking me Leo why should I be good and
the answer is no reason at all you see that's
what Gooden says go see my episode what is goodness
where I explain this in more detail I'm just kind
of glossing over it here but um goodness has to
be done without reason without compulsion if you're compelled to
do reason uh to do good for some kind of
logical reason then you're actually doing it out of selfishness
which is not good that's evil goodness has to be
Selfless Love has to be selfless they're synonymous with each
other goodness love selflessness these are all synonymous so there's
absolutely no reason why you should seek to balance the
universe as God would try to balance it but in
not doing so you actually end up hurting yourself because
you're acting out of selfishness and the only reason to
balance the universe sublimely exquisitely is simply because you recognize
that your God and that you want to be good
that you want to be loved and that being selfless
is the ultimate Joy of existence and that you want
to align yourself with selflessness and if you align yourself
with selflessness the more you align yourself with selflessness the
more you will naturally want to act in a way
that balances out and harmonizes all the parts of the
universe so you're not doing this balancing act out of
a sense of selfish need you're doing it out of
no need whatsoever simply because you enjoy the beauty of
the harmony that your actions will create in the world
which is in other words to say that now you're
fully aligned with the motivation that God has behind balancing
the entire universe see you might ask Leo why is
God balancing all these things in the universe you know
why it seems like a lot of work why doesn't
God just relax and let the whole universe go to
hell and the reason is is because it doesn't cost
God anything because God is selfless God has no needs
so when you have when you're selfless you have no
needs and you're all loving and you're infinitely intelligent what
are you gonna do you're going to balance it out
for the benefit of everybody else so God is balancing
out the whole universe for the benefit of everybody in
the universe and that is God's love for you that
is God's gift to you now if you want to
be an ingrate you can take all that for granted
and you could behave like a devil and you could
trick your responsibility and be a selfish [ __ ]
you can totally do that and that's fine and it
won't affect God in the slightest it will affect you
though there will be consequences for you and for those
around you there will be consequences which probably you won't
find very pleasant um but you can do that or
you can choose to align yourself with love and goodness
and intelligence and wisdom and act responsibly as a instrument
of God within the universe to help balance it out
simply because you love the harmony that it creates these
are your choices you act as a vehicle to restore
balance in the universe not because you need to not
because someone is forcing you to not because the Bible
tells you to but because it simply pleases you to
do so and there's nothing more worthwhile for you to
do in the world got it but be careful because
there's a trap here here's the Trap this notion of
being a vehicle for the restoration of balance in the
world can be very dangerous in the wrong hands because
the you the ego can take hold of this idea
and then use it to justify all sorts of Crusades
and that's exactly what low Consciousness egotistical and quote-unquote evil
people do is for example you know Hitler Justified the
Holocaust as a restoration of balance in the world you
see how twisted this gets here we are talking about
Hitler as being an imbalance but Hitler saw himself as
being a restorer of balance in the world because he
thought that there are too many Jews and the Jews
were and imbalance in the universe so by killing them
he thought he was restoring balance you see how twisted
this is when Bin Laden orchestrated 911 and set you
know a dozen hijackers to crash Jets into the uh
World Trade Center you might say well we see that
as imbalance and a cancer on society terrorism is a
cancer on society but a terrorist sees terrorist actions as
a restoration of balance in the world do you see
that the 911 hijackers when they were crashing those Jets
into into the World Trade Center they were completely convinced
right up to the last second of their of their
lives that this was the greatest act of restoration of
balance in the world and in a certain sense they
weren't wrong that's what's so Twisted about this you see
because balance with the capital be absolute balance The Meta
balance of the entire universe includes this action of 9
11. it includes that it includes the Holocaust so this
this requires a lot of maturity to accept because most
people don't want to think of the Holocaust or 911
as a restoration of balance in the universe and yet
they are not of a local balance of a meta
infinite balance right because if you look at it from
a local perspective then the Holocaust in 911 these were
imbalances and again the notion of what is balanced or
imbalanced these are relativistic Notions right go see my episode
understanding relativity understanding relativism so this is a very relativistic
idea and when humans talk about balance and imbalance this
is a duality and this is a relativistic notion of
balance and imbalance right it's relative what's a balance to
me might be seem like an imbalance to you so
that's the the challenge here the trick but from God's
point of view which is the absolute point of view
there's no such thing as imbalance there's only balance what
that means is that everything a humans consider imbalanced actually
balance just seen from a higher perspective nevertheless the Trap
here is that it is possible for you to convince
yourself that you are creating balance in the world by
actually doing devilish things by killing people by raping people
by doing genocide by doing terrorism by stealing elections by
bombing abortion clinics it's very easy for the human mind
to convince itself that these are acts of balance and
they are from the absolute perspective but that's not how
the human mind is thinking of it right so when
Bin Laden or Hitler did their evil stuff in their
mind they convince themselves that they're restoring balance to the
universe but they weren't looking at it from the absolute
perspective they were looking at it from the relative perspective
and in the relative perspective they were wrong see so
if you're some incel who decides to go rape some
some girl thinking that you're restoring balance in the universe
you see that's a very dangerous thing at the relative
human level at the god level it doesn't matter at
the relative level though there's going to be serious consequences
for that there's going to be a lot of karma
for that and that can be very dysfunctional pathological and
unhealthy for you and for society so you have to
be careful with these kinds of justifications you know the
French Revolution the Communist revolutions that took place in the
last century um you know trumpism the whole Maga phenomena
that's happening right now in the U.S a lot of
these were Justified as the restoration of the Lost balance
of the universe people who think this way can get
very delusional and in fact they turn into the greatest
devils every devil thinks he is restoring balance to the
world when he's actually doing the opposite the fool thinks
he's restoring balance to the world when actually he's being
a selfish cancer so be careful about that this is
a huge trap I don't want you to use the
things I said here to justify whatever selfish Acts that
are going to hurt others but you're gonna justify it
to yourself anyways it's like well you know Leo said
it's all in the name of balance in the end
and God loves me anyway so I'll just do whatever
I want if you do that then you misunderstood this
teaching and you're being a devil but The Twist is
that even when you're being a devil at The Meta
level everything is still perfectly balanced see you can't escape
Perfection because perfection's absolute you can't escape goodness you can't
escape love these are all absolutes so you can't escape
them no matter what you do you can blow up
the whole world and you're not gonna shake the Perfection
of the universe that's the structure of the universe that's
how good the universe is it allows for that but
if you use that as a license to do it
then you're a devil but you're free to do that
so it's up to you see it's a very radical
freedom that God has given you and there's absolutely no
reason why you can't be a devil be a devil
if you want just realize there will be consequences for
you and the more of a devil you are the
more suffering you're gonna create for others but for yourself
too here's the thing you have to remember that you
know devil just means you're acting out of selfishness but
remember from the absolute perspective selfishness is self-balancing too because
selfishness is self-defeating the way God balanced devilry and selfishness
is by making it self-defeating the reason why you shouldn't
be selfish is simply because if you're gonna be very
selfish you're going to defeat your own self you yourself
will regret it it's going to be a contradiction within
you you yourself won't like yourself selfishness is its own
punishment and selflessness is its own reward by being selfish
you cut yourself off from the love of God not
because God is withholding love from you but because love
is selflessness it's tautological it's not that God is withholding
itself from you it's that by being selfish you are
cutting yourself off from God himself cannot help you when
you decide to be selfish because God is selflessness God's
help is selflessness itself it's not that God is going
to help you by giving you a bunch of money
that's not how God helps you God helps you by
making you selfless you think the help you need is
you need more sex and money that's not the help
you need the only help you need is selflessness notice
that cancer eventually balances itself out by killing itself that's
the genius of God's design that's the intelligence that really
infinite intelligence that where is that work here this structure
that I'm explaining to you is itself infinitely intelligent this
is the intelligence of the design just that nobody around
you understands this design I'm like one of the first
people ever who's articulated this design to you you could
think of it this way what is God God is
a perfectly self-balancing system it's absolutely self-balancing that means no
matter what in the infinite long run it's always going
to be perfectly balanced no matter how bad it gets
it will always balance itself out automatically that's what God
is ta-da how could such a system exist How could
a perfectly self-balancing system exist well that's the Miracle of
Life that's the miracle of existence it shouldn't exist and
yet here it is and the reason that is is
because God is just perfection you just gotta at some
point you gotta bite the bullet and just realize God
is perfection and everything is God therefore everything is perfection
this is not something to believe this is something to
become directly conscious of by Awakening to it so anyways
to make this level more practical for you start to
study and appreciate balance in the following areas of life
within nature and ecosystems within organisms animals biology and evolution
within the homeostasis of your body and your psyche within
markets economies and globalism within governance in policing and in
law in cooking in great art in great films in
great games with an exceptional human beings notice that exceptional
human beings have a certain balance to them and within
conflict and War I have an episode called understanding conflict
and War part one and there's gonna be a part
two coming in the future part of the point of
that episode is to show you how conflict is a
set of balancing forces that are happening in the universe
you have to start to see war and Conflict for
a much higher elevation perspective start to see it from
God's point of view rather than the little petty human
point of view the question of how to achieve balance
in your body and in your mind is one of
the highest Pursuits that man can undertake and the question
of how to achieve balance in society is the highest
Pursuit that mankind as a whole can undertake these are
enormous challenges both individually and collectively to figure this out
and it has to be figured out both at the
individual and the collective level simultaneously because the individual we
can't have balanced individuals when our society is very out
of balance and cancerous and we can't have a healthy
balanced Society what our individuals are out of balance and
mentally unhinged and cancerous subscribe to all sorts of cancerous
ideologies you see so it's a bi-directional flow it's a
cycle that goes both ways we got to fix this
problem at the same time at both levels we can
use fixes at one level to increase fixes at the
at the next level and vice versa by helping individuals
to balance themselves we can create a more balanced Society
by helping Society to balance itself at the policy level
we can help to create more balanced individuals we can
create either a vicious cycle here or a virtuous cycle
as they're called you are not just balancing yourself you're
also balancing yourself in relation to your environment and to
all the other actors in the world that are also
trying to balance themselves so this balancing problem is highly
recursive recursion is sort of an aspect of fractals and
chaos theory that I'm going to cover in a separate
episode at some point I want to shoot an episode
on fractals um but um since reality is an infinite
fractal God is an infinite fractal um you notice fractal-like
elements and you notice recursion you also notice strange loops
so this is the art of good living the art
of good living is balancing yourself out in relation to
your environment and then helping others to balance themselves out
together the whole thing balances out or it fails to
do so so you might wonder well you know how
do I develop balance here are some tips first by
removing biases from your own mind because an imbalanced mind
creates an imbalanced world pretty obvious that's why I stress
bias a lot this topic I've talked about it go
check out my episodes understanding bias go check out my
episode Self Bias where I've talked about that a lot
the next point is a commitment to truth into love
and start to experience Truth and Love awaken to what
is truth and what is love that's gonna help to
develop balance the next point is experimentation trial and error
and massive experience I've talked about this in my episode
exposing yourself to more experience go check that episode out
the more you fail and the the more intention you
put on learning the lessons from your failures and you
put yourself through a process of massive experience this allows
you to fall out of balance then find your balance
again fall out of balance bind your balance again it's
sort of like practicing surfing or practicing on a unicycle
how do you get good at surfing or unicycling by
practicing it a lot failing a lot and allowing yourself
to fall out of balance by falling out of balance
in a conscious way and observing it you learn how
to be in balance you learn the things that are
causing you to fall out of balance you learn how
to correct for them you learn how to anticipate them
and preempt them so that you don't have to actually
fall over to know that you're about to fall over
right like if you're on a unicycle you've if you're
good at it you've fallen over so many times that
you're so sensitive your mind is so sensitive your Consciousness
is so sensitive to any force that is pulling you
to fall over that you counteract that force and you
maintain balance that's literally what you're doing on a unicycle
or a surfboard or anything else that requires a similar
I mean you're doing the same thing when you're walking
even when you're standing that's what your subconscious mind is
doing when you're standing which a baby cannot do the
next point for developing one's balance is develop an eye
for beauty Harmony peace fairness health and holism really what
we're talking about here is Aesthetics balance has an aesthetic
quality to it it has the Ring of Harmony when
you're listening to a balanced perfectly balanced song It's a
Harmony it's very harmonious when you're looking at a beautiful
perfectly composed painting by some great master it's got a
Harmony to it it's got a certain aesthetic to it
you can hone your intuition you can hone your eye
for for these Aesthetics and you can use that to
create balance it's hard to kind of articulate exactly how
to not how to develop it but like what it
means to have an eye for beauty to have great
taste God has great taste if you want to become
more Godlike develop great taste in art learn to see
beauty recognize Beauty you can do that you can train
yourself artists do this I've been doing this my whole
life I've been doing graphic design other sorts of things
I've been I've been training my eye for for seeing
Beauty and having taste for a for for several decades
and as a result I have pretty good taste most
people have horrible taste now artists artists are sort of
connoisseurs of developing taste so any great artist has to
have great taste whether in music and film and art
or in nature or in even in people you know
what kind of women are you sleeping with friends they
sleep with some horrible looking women anyways uh next point
study and develop wisdom this is what philosophy is about
philosophy literally means the love of wisdom philosophia the love
of wisdom wisdom is what you need to be able
to balance you can make a study of wisdom you
can read wise sages that's what I did that's how
I basically started this whole journey is I just had
a an intuitive attraction towards wisdom so I read wisdom
books I read the classics I read Greek and Roman
philosophers I read Marcus Aurelius a lot of wisdom in
that book that book basically teaches you how to maintain
balance you know Marcus surrealist's meditation so I'm talking about
but basically this is this is the function of philosophy
and it's sort of highest level sense the the other
way to develop balance is to study imbalance study error
study blunder study catastrophe for example study the errors of
science study the errors of religion study the errors of
politics read history and look at all the imbalances throughout
history whether it was war or geopolitical conflicts or genocide
or the Spanish Inquisition The Witch Trials McCarthyism Nazism communism
we have a rich history to mine for imbalance there
have been so many minor imbalances without within history human
history that you can you can study from that and
learn those lessons so you don't have to make the
same mistakes the next way to develop balance is think
independently think through things by yourself rather than just following
groupthink a lot of the worst Horrors throughout human history
were imbalances that happened due to imbalances in culture and
the way that human beings fought in herds this leads
to Market crashes these lead this leads to speculative bubbles
this leads to toxic ideologies like communism and Nazism uh
this leads to all sorts of wrong Wars like the
Iraq War for example this is largely the consequence of
groupthink because people were not thinking independently for themselves human
collectives tend to be pretty bad at balancing themselves they
balance for a while but then they Veer off a
cliff that's what tends to happen you're like you have
some Corporation and the corporation is doing great and it's
balancing itself and it's creating new products and it's Innovative
and all this kind of stuff and then something happens
in the corporation it kind of ossifies it starts to
just go it kind of phones it in it kind
of just starts to go use an algorithm to do
its business and as soon as it starts using an
algorithm to do its business it can't innovate anymore it
can't retain its best clients and employees and eventually the
thing falls off a cliff and goes bankrupt for example
it dies and a lot of times that happens just
through groupthink because people are no longer thinking innovatively and
creatively for themselves the way that the founders of the
corporation did they start taking that for granted they think
they can just use an algorithm and they can stop
thinking if you stop thinking you die the next way
to develop balance is uh develop your intuition I have
an episode called how to harness your intuition go check
that out and I'll probably have some more episodes in
the future about developing intuition because it's such an important
topic um but basically you can hone your intuition you
can learn to trust your intuition to act from your
intuition intuition is actually a deep source of intelligence it's
a non-algorithmic implicit source of intelligence it is basically your
ability to tap into the intelligence of the universe and
to act from that uh in a sense this is
the secret of how God does it God does it
through a sort of an infinite intuition so when a
human is tapping into intuition you're getting a little bit
of a tip of the iceberg of God's infinite intuition
and you can expand your the bandwidth of your channel
and connection to that intuition the more you awake and
the more conscious you become the more intuitive you become
the greatest Masters and Geniuses were extremely intuitive very implicit
go check out my episode explicit versus implicit understanding this
connects with that the next Point here for becoming more
balanced is um handle your basic survival cravings and needs
it's hard to be balanced and wise when you are
lacking shelter food sex basic human intimacy and what other
things you feel like you you need you know basic
amount of money go check out my episode called burning
through Karma basically you want to burn through as much
Karma as quickly as possible by satisfying your cravings and
needs and then transcending them so you can go beyond
the survival needs into the being needs where you can
even start to care about things like balance and beauty
and creativity and intuition and intelligence and Awakening and Consciousness
in God and love you don't even care about these
things when you don't have your basic Cravings somewhat satisfied
so handle that don't get too obsessed with metaphysics and
spirituality if you can't pay your electric bill figure that
out first figure out your health problems if you've got
serious health problems fix those first before you go about
worrying about spirituality in God fix your diet fix your
drug addictions figure that out first there's a sort of
order of operations here which is called otherwise uh Maslow's
hierarchy of needs go check out my old old episode
called um something like how to develop yourself using Maslow's
hierarchies of needs where I talk about this point another
way to develop balance is through Awakenings have Awakenings experience
higher States Of Consciousness where you completely transcend survival and
you come into contact with infinite intelligence directly that's hugely
important for everything we're talking about in this episode without
without these Awakenings basically to you this is going to
sound like some new age philosophy here and nothing more
it's not going to be real for you accessing infant
intelligence is crucial and you can access it the other
way to develop balance is balancing your mind and your
emotions via meditation this is one of the core functions
of meditation is that it can help you to balance
out your mind okay and the storm of emotions that
usually is puppet mastering the majority of mankind you know
tame all those emotions become mindful of when you're have
experiencing cravings and when you're driven by your emotions that
you're not at the effect of them that's what meditation
will get you now imbalance leads to pathology dysfunction ugliness
suffering unsustainability and death unbalanced Things Fall Apart and self-destruct
just notice the as an example the imbalance is happening
in today's political system in America but also around much
of the world there's a lot of political imbalances what's
interesting is that the devil has a backwards view of
balance to a devil imbalance seems like balance and balance
seems like imbalance because see the devil is interested in
Balance the devil is interested in imbalance towards his own
agenda the devil wants to skew the political situation or
whatever the situation might be wants to skewed the situation
in his favor because he's selfish just to care about
balance already requires that you have a lot of selflessness
because if you're just maximally selfish why would you care
about balance you don't want fairness you just want goodies
for yourself that's selfishness 101. to even care about balance
requires a clear and unbiased mind it's like Leo why
should I even care about balance I want I want
sex and I want money and I want a big
house and I want my political party to win at
whatever cost that's going to create a much better life
for me than trying to balance some sort of abstract
you know global system that's how a selfish mind thinks
notice how bias creates imbalance so notice the Deep connection
between imbalance and bias which we've pointed to a lot
in the past to care about balance within a system
requires caring about more than just yourself this is like
systems thinking versus systems exploitation again a lot of people
get this wrong people like to claim for example sometimes
that Leo Trump is a very systems thinker because he's
good at exploiting the system look at how good he
is at manipulating the system and owning the libs this
makes him a systems thinker no it doesn't make him
a systems thinker it makes him a systems exploiter which
is not the same thing as a systems thinker go
watch my episode called intro to systems thinking for that
distinction Trump is too selfish to do systems thinking he's
thinking about how to exploit the system towards his own
benefit true systems thinking is about how to balance the
whole system regardless of what it costs me or what
it does to me or my agenda maybe balancing the
whole system will hurt my agenda and that's good because
my agenda should not be the thing that runs the
system or the universe selfishness is believing that your agenda
should govern the whole universe and if Trump was given
his way his ego will try to rule the whole
universe this is the definition of devilry so being a
high quality leader requires that you be able to set
your own agenda aside and to impartially ask the question
you know what kind of changes should we make to
the system that will benefit the system for the greatest
number of people or conscious agents not even just people
but really for Consciousness itself what is in the highest
interest of Consciousness that's the question God is asking that
is precisely not the question that Trump is asking again
people say Leah why do you mention Trump so many
times in all your videos simply because not because it's
not because I'm attacking him it's simply because it's such
a good Stark object lesson it's a case study of
selfishness again all of this work can be boiled down
to Simply becoming more selfless and all of that can
simply become uh be boiled down to do the exact
opposite of everything Trump does and you will become highly
actualized and Godlike you see if you are too selfish
and too biased your actions will create imbalance in the
universe as you try to gain Advantage for yourself at
the cost of others see that here are some examples
of the ugliness and the out of balance that can
happen commonly in your life all the times you'll see
this in your life with your diet for example with
the information ecology and with what's going on right now
with media with social media look at social media companies
chasing to try to maximize clicks and view time and
profits the sort of The Tick Tock the tick tock
effication of the internet YouTube right now is in a
process of getting Tick Tock if I'd Instagram is getting
tick-tockified and look at how ugly and out of balance
this is becoming kids minds are being corrupted and poisoned
by this tick tockification of our social media system our
information ecology is being poisoned with all sorts of conspiracy
theories and ideologies and anti-mainstream narratives and other kinds of
nonsense take a look at drug addiction or really any
addiction as an example of the ugliness of being out
of balance drug addiction is your perfect example but there
are so many other kinds of addictions if you're jerking
off 10 times a day look at how ugly and
out of balanced your life is the Health Care system
the American Health Care System especially look how ugly and
out of balance it is and therefore it's not able
to create deep Health in people because remember health equals
holism and balance so if the Health Care System itself
is out of balance because it's corrupted and skewed by
corporate interests and big Pharma lobbying trying to sell you
drug drugs and opioids and try to maximize profits this
this all corrupts the ultimate objective of Health because what's
being cared about is not health or the the health
of mankind what's being cared about is profit margin mostly
how about the example of capitalism corporate lobbying and how
resources and money are distributed throughout our societies this is
the epitome of ugliness and being out of balance look
at the income inequality look at the disparity between what
CEOs are being paid and what their employees are being
paid this sort of late stage capitalism that we're seeing
everywhere around the world in all the developed Nations this
is the epitome of imbalance and then look at the
kind of imbalance that causes in our environment environmental destruction
pollution global warming heavy metals in our drinking water in
our fish uh the overfishing of the oceans and how
out of balance this is becoming and how ugly it
is the way we do factory farming the kind of
nasty pesticides that are put into fruits and vegetables how
ugly and out of balance this is and then when
you ingest those heavy metals and toxins and Plastics and
pollutants and antibiotics and stuff into your body this causes
your whole body to get out of balance which causes
a host of autoimmune disorders which are very common now
thyroid disorders and all sorts of there's there's like at
least a couple dozen different kinds of autoimmune disorders maybe
even up to 100 different kinds of autoimmune disorders that
are very common these days where is that coming from
well it starts with industry and pollution which comes from
late stage capitalism which then goes through our food supply
and drinking Supply and then eventually gets into your body
and then corrupts your brain your body and your mind
of course look at the ugliness of American politics right
now the ugliness of Maga and trumpism also look at
the ugliness of the Socialists left there's ugliness there too
it's also out of balance look at various sorts of
transgender ideologies non-binary ideologies um I'm not saying there's some
validity to it there is but also it's again it's
gotten taken way too far it's gotten very out of
balance you know when people are creating dozens and dozens
of custom gender pronouns and all those kinds of um
you know nonsense this is this is creating imbalances in
our society and conservatives are correct to be worried about
this now does that mean that the conservatives are right
in you know they're transphobia no I'm not I'm not
giving license to transphobia here but you should notice that
the kind of gender problems that Society has been having
over the last like let's say 10 years um you
should see ugliness and imbalance in that and I don't
just mean transphobia obviously transphobia is ugly and imbalanced but
I also mean just people going overboard with defining their
own genders and expecting others to to play ball and
to just think that it's all just kind of arbitrary
it's not so arbitrary it's also creating imbalances um within
that masculine feminine polarity dynamic that otherwise is beautifully balanced
it's creating a balances there um look at the rise
of movements like you know the incels and the black
pill and red pill stuff like that um some of
the extreme forms of feminism again these are happening because
there's imbalances between people are really not being taught very
well how to embody the masculine and how to embody
the feminine and from this there's gender confusion going on
and there's a people who can't get laid who are
you know becoming in cells who are getting frustrated over
that um yeah because men are not being taught how
to be men and women are also not being taught
very well how to become women by which I just
mean masculine feminine take a look at the economy and
the bad financial management that's going on the imbalances in
the economic system take a look at as an example
bad business management you know businesses that are mismanaged by
corporate Raiders and and so on that are trying to
you know extract maximum value take a look at the
kind of imbalances that are happening within business take a
look at the imbalances that are happening within your specific
industry like maybe you're you're working in the healthcare industry
or you're working in the food industry or you're working
in the pharmaceutical industry or the computer Silicon Valley industry
the internet industry the social media industry you know whatever
industry you're in take a look at imbalances within your
industry as a whole that's a good lens to look
at it from every industry has its own kinds of
imbalances take a look at our education system and universities
how badly out of balance and ugly they are becoming
now also in a sense corrupted by late stage capitalism
and when I say late stage capitalism that does not
mean that socialism is the solution necessarily I'm rather agnostic
about that and like I said just earlier is that
socialism itself has many imbalances and ugliness in it too
so the solution is not so simple take a look
at the ugliness and imbalances within relationships and sexuality that
you have or others around you have take a look
at the imbalances in the consumption of entertainment and media
for example video games and Mindless forms of entertainment take
a look at the imbalances with a lack of socialization
being shy and socially awkward not being able to talk
to girls inability to get laid those are some ugly
imbalances and all the ideologies that arise because of that
the mgtow movement the incels the black pill the red
pill all that kind of garbage take a look at
the imbalances that we have with mental disorders right now
we have a wider spread of mental disorders than ever
before people with add with OCD with depression with bipolar
disorder with schizophrenia what are these mental disorders these are
imbalances ugly imbalances in the mind and a lot of
these are fed by ugly imbalances in our culture and
also ugly imbalances and pollutants in our food supply you
see it's like a perfect storm of all these coming
together these mental disorders aren't just coming from one place
you know like autism as well is on the rise
various kinds of cancers and so forth you know diseases
of the body um and also honestly a lot of
Mind cancers diseases of the Mind in terms of ideology
we have a lot of toxic ideologies out there right
now various kinds of Cults what is a cult a
cult is an ugly imbalance what is a conspiracy theory
it's an ugly imbalance take a loot look at your
mood swings your emotional mood swings see your emotions are
out of balance if you have a messy sloppy life
you have a sloppy living condition you don't clean your
room as Jordan Peterson tells you what is where is
this coming from this is coming from imbalance as well
and it looks ugly literally your house and your room
looks ugly because your mind is so imbalanced that you
can't even balance the physical objects in your living space
so those are some of the examples of uh what
imbalance looks like see not so pretty contrast that with
for example you walk into a Zen monastery what does
the sun Monastery look like if you've seen some pictures
it's this pristine ordered simple minimalist clean environment with you
know simple trees and some flowers and some rocks and
they have those sand Gardens you know that's the sort
of stereotype of Zen that we have what is that
the aesthetic of Zen is an aesthetic of Harmony and
balance you're not going to find a heroin addict shooting
up in a Zen Monastery in the corner and in
a Zen monitor you're not going to find you know
like objects just thrown around the the monastery kind of
willy-nilly you know just like piles of of burger wrappers
and and like and ketchup stains on the on the
walls and just pizza slices in the corner foreign you're
not going to find that because in Zen they can
appreciate this Sublime balance and they try to actually embody
it and actualize it in the way they run their
monasteries in the way they arrange their Gardens and their
flowers and um the way they even build those Zen
classic you know Monastery buildings they're built in a sort
of like orderly minimalist way that's not an accident that's
because some of those guys are actually woke and they
know what they're doing now uh here's another trap is
that when I say balanced you have to be careful
that what your ego mind considers fair and balanced isn't
the balance that I'm talking about right they're sort of
like the true balance God's balance and then there's what
your ego and all your biases consider fair and balanced
the kind of [ __ ] that Fox News calls
fair and balanced is exactly not fair and balanced do
you see that so just because you think something is
fair and balanced or you call it fair and balanced
be very suspicious of that that doesn't mean it is
it could be exactly the opposite of that and in
fact people who Proclaim to themselves to be very fair
and balanced these are usually the least balanced and fair
people obviously calling something fair and balanced this is not
an honest signal because words are cheap it's easy to
call yourself fair and balanced when you aren't Here's a
thought experiment for you that might shock you consider the
possibility that whatever the current state of the world is
consider the world as it is right now with all
the political Shenanigans and upheaval and War and craziness that's
going on right now so you got all that in
your mind right now consider that that is actually what
absolute balance looks like ta-da what no that's not possible
you know we got the we got the war in
Ukraine and we got Donald Trump doing crazy [ __
] and after all Leo you say Donald Trump is
a devil and all this so how could how could
that be balanced that's not balance we can only have
balance after Trump is dead or something like that no
the shocking point is that Trump with all of his
shenanigans and all the wars in the world that that
is what balance looks like that's absolute balance that's meta
balance that's infinite balance meta balance means that even losing
balance is part of the balance that's infinite balance that's
Sublime balance that's Exquisite balance when you can see the
balance in the universe within all of Trump's [ __
] con Artistry and shenanigans and Putin's stupid War when
you can see that that's when you understand what I'm
teaching you with Sublime balance be careful here because the
fool easily tricks himself into thinking that he can rebalance
a complex system with his favorite intervention and a lot
of times that ends up backfiring you know in systems
thinking what one of the first things they teach you
in systems thinking is that systems are very complex and
counter-intuitive and they behave in tricky ways and that a
lot of times the intervention you think that's going to
improve the system actually makes the system worse makes the
problem worse so the fool rushes in to modify a
system whereas the sage the Wise One carefully sits back
and just observes the system and questions whether an intervention
is necessary at all Sometimes the best way to manage
a complex system is not to intervene that requires wisdom
that's counterintuitive usually wise interventions and complex systems they are
subtle that are gentle whereas foolish interventions are gross and
rash they lack the necessary nuance and that also is
something we're seeing in our political system right now is
we're seeing a lot of gross and rash solutions to
very complex and nuanced problems which doesn't tend to solve
the problems which just multiplies them here are some practical
applications from this episode areas where this idea of balance
applies so well look at this balance between saving and
spending money now these these applications this is like this
is where all the abstract stuff becomes very practical look
at how practical this gets saving versus spending money that
requires balance working hard versus enjoying your life that requires
balance working versus resting that requires striking a sort of
dynamic balance Theory versus practice that requires Exquisite balance education
versus doing business that requires balance you can have too
much of one or the other pursuing survival needs versus
spirituality that needs to be balanced I know a lot
of you guys are struggling with that who follow my
work or how about Solitude versus community that requires balance
being alone versus socializing we've talked about that recently in
my episode called how social socialization makes you stupid how
about balancing between being selfish and being selfless that requires
balance because if you just go out into the world
and you just try to be selfless all the time
that's not going to work that's foolish selflessness doesn't work
how about balancing between the Practical being practical and being
idealistic that requires a careful balance between progressives and conservatives
that requires a balance how about emotions and reason that
requires the balance left brain versus right brain requires a
balance being open-minded versus closed-minded that requires a balance being
serious versus being playful requires a balance chasing after success
versus doing good for mankind that requires balance realism versus
idealism requires balance the masculine versus the feminine in you
requires balance masculine compassion versus feminine compassion requires balance I
have a very old episode about the difference between those
two how about balancing between telling the truth versus holding
back the truth out of compassion that requires balance balancing
between material and spiritual Pursuits balancing between chasing sex versus
pursuing work or career balance when doing critique very few
people are able to do a high quality balanced critique
of anything the critiques you see on YouTube they're all
highly imbalanced and biased if you want an example of
a balanced critique go check out my episode called understanding
Jordan Peterson where I try to do my best balanced
critique of Jordan Peterson notice how different it is from
most of the critiques you see on YouTube of Jordan
Peterson which are very imbalanced and I'm a big critic
of Jordan Peterson um it took me a lot of
awareness and self-reflection and care and wisdom to do that
episode in a balanced way how about balance in thinking
about a thing a lot of people simply can't think
about anything without being imbalance in their thought process how
about balance when making your art knowing when to add
more to your art or versus taking away from your
art you know minimalism that can be a tough balance
to strike how about the balance between individual versus Collective
action a lot of people struggle with that one including
Jordan Peterson uh balance between the outer exploration of reality
versus the inner exploration of Reality by which I mean
you can go out and travel the whole world Adventure
to all the countries in the world that would be
outer exploration of reality you can go skydiving and dirt
biking and skiing that's outer exploration of reality but what
about inner exploration of reality exploring your mind through psychedelics
meditation and spiritual work how do you balance those two
how about balance between the spiral stages check out my
series on spiral Dynamics to learn more about that but
those of you who are aware of those stages I
see a lot of people struggle with with balancing those
stages they end up demonizing one stage or another stage
or they just think that the the best Stage is
the turquoise stage and all the other stages are bad
stages very common trap but in reality you have to
balance all the stages up and down your spiral that's
challenging to do I have myself sometimes lapse and striking
the right balance there so easy to demonize one stage
or another how about balancing between saying too much versus
saying too little that's one that I personally struggle with
a lot a lot of times I say more than
I should how about balancing between caution and boldness should
you be bold in life but if you're bold you
take risks and those can bite you in the ass
or should you be cautious but if you're cautious you
don't take risks you don't take action and then you're
kind of stuck how do you balance between those two
I can't give you an algorithm to do it I
can't give you a script you have to use your
creative intelligence to do it that's why you're here that's
why you're intelligent in the first place that's what will
allow you to solve these problems notice that good design
of any kind is all about balancing trade-offs whether you're
designing a car a skyscraper an airplane a video game
it's all about balancing the trade-offs of finite things I'll
actually talk about this topic of trade-offs in a separate
episode coming up soon but for now just notice that
a good video game requires Exquisite balance and how do
you balance a video game you have to be very
unbiased towards all the players in the game because if
you have a favorite class or a favorite character or
a favorite player in the game as the designer and
then you're gonna create the game design the game based
on your sort of you know pet favorite let's say
you're designing an RPG and you like the wizard class
so you make an overpowered wizard class is that good
for the whole game is that good for the whole
player base no that's a selfish game designer who's going
to create a badly balanced game and then people aren't
going to like that game see so if you think
of Life as a giant massively multiplayer RPG God is
the designer of this massively multiplayer RPG its job is
to design it for the good of all players without
any partiality without playing any favorites and that's exactly what
God has done it's the perfect game perfect with a
capital p and look at government governance good governance spoils
down to balance it's all about balance balancing the people
versus the corporations balancing different interest groups balancing between different
religions balancing between religious people and secular people all of
this has to be balanced that's why government is so
difficult and so contentious and so uh polarized balance cannot
be an algorithm because reality is infinite and Consciousness is
fluid we're not dealing with the static thing here we're
not dealing with a finite thing here notice that too
much of anything turns into evil if this is true
then good absolute good is the balance of all things
with respect to all things this is the divine order
also notice that balance equals peace there's a connection between
balance and peace if you want peace in the world
you need balance because War conflict and struggle these things
are a lack of balance these only happen when there's
imbalances in society without this War doesn't happen there's a
quote from Thomas Paine that I want to read to
you which goes like this quote the balance of power
is the scale of peace end quote in the end
from the biggest possible picture everything in the universe has
to balance out and equal to zero and that's exactly
the case and I want to end this episode with
the following quote by Allison Lurie which says quote nature
can seem cruel but she balances her books end quote

down below um I share some more of my my
private stuff my private pictures and things there come check
out the actualized Forum where you can join a community
of like-minded people who are into this kind of topics
and these kind of existential questions and metaphysical inquiries if
you'd like you can support me at patreon.com actualized with
some money I appreciate those donations helps me to keep
the Channel free from various kinds of corporate corrupting influences
and the final thing I want to end on is
this remember to be balanced in your consumption of self-help
Theory see an older episode of mine called balancing Theory
versus practice this is one of the episodes that I
think are one of the most underrated episodes of mine
it's kind of an old episode um it doesn't seem
very flashy but some very profound things were said in
that episode go go watch that one again uh re-watch
it a few times it'll take you a few times
to get it because it's very easy to get stuck
in self-help Theory and spiritual Theory and you have to
develop the capacity to be able to break yourself out
of mental masturbation mode Theory mode with taking action use
action to break yourself out of being stuck in theory
but paradoxically stay tuned and keep watching because there's still
more important theory that I have yet to teach you
that will be coming in the next few years I
have over a hundred new episodes planned some of these
topics are going to be very profound and uh covering
new material that I haven't talked about before so the
trick here is that you want to keep staying abreast
of the theory but don't get stuck in that make
sure you're taking action on this theory in your life
so that you're starting to see the fruits and the
benefits stay tuned and I'll see in the next one
