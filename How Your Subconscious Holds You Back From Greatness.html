hey this is Leo for actualised org I want to
talk about an interesting situation that I ran across and
basically this is going to lead us into the concept
and the idea in personal development of looking and being
really attuned to finding ways subtle ways that your subconscious
is holding you back and limiting you and here's the
example that I come at this with which really took
me for a bit of an epiphany a realization and
once I saw what was really happening with me so
my girlfriend was over and she flew over to visit
me for for some time and when she was here
for about a week what happened was that I was
cooking for her and I was just doing my thing
I was cooking and I was sauteing some mushrooms and
I had a whole carton of mushrooms that I was
a that was chopping up and throwing in the saute
pan and as I was doing that I started sauteing
the mushrooms and sauteing the mushrooms and there was a
full pan of mushrooms more than enough for two people
and then I had other things that I was going
to make as well and I'm sauteing this and as
I'm stirring it around with my spatula one of them
one of the mushrooms it's not even a whole mushroom
like it was like a sliver of a mushroom half
of it fell out of the pan and it kind
of tumbled and rolled off to the floor and I'm
like really quickly I go I reached for the mushroom
and I throw it back into the pan from the
floor three-second rule right so kind of a funny and
weird Shaiful example and then my girlfriend saw me she's
like did you put that mushroom back in the pan
and I'm like ah yeah and I kind of thought
about it for a little bit and then after that
whole incident I thought about it more and what I
realized that really was a signal of something much deeper
for me really what that was because I was really
upset that that mushroom fell out of the pan and
I didn't want to throw it away because to me
it was wasteful to throw away that mushroom I thought
it could be put to use as silly as that
is but why did I do that and why was
I so insistent on it and why was that like
an automatic unconscious response that I had and moreover why
am I still resistant to that scenario because in my
mind and sometimes this happens as I'm cooking stuff and
stuff falls out I'm always tempted I'm always tempted to
grab it and make use of it I don't to
waste it and now that I've kind of had this
realization I'm a little more cognizant of it and I've
actually made a rule that I don't do that I
always throw it in the trash from now on and
I didn't do that for hygienic reasons I actually think
that you could eat stuff off the floor and nothing
bad is going to happen to you fact is that
the human body is designed to handle a lot more
than we think it can and people have been eating
stuff from mud and dirt for for eons before the
whole world was sanitized and clean the way it is
now so it's not so much that that's the problem
the real problem and the big problem that the hygiene
issue is really masking is the scarcity problem why the
hell do I have scarcity about half a mushroom because
I could take that mushroom and throw it out but
I don't want to because I feel it's wasteful and
when I looked at that I'm like oh oh that
goes deep and then I look back into my past
and the fact is that I have scarcity issues around
money because when I was growing up money was always
a source of conflict in my family and we had
some good times money some bad types of money overall
it was a really mixed bag but what it created
in me is the sense of insecurity about money and
the sense of scarcity the fact that I might not
have enough and even though right now objectively I'm financially
well-off I'd have no problems I have no no debt
I have nice savings I'm comfortable I have a business
I have a job so all those things are in
place but I'm still coming from that old city mindset
and it's really hard to just say okay let's just
turn that programming off it doesn't really turn off you
have to really introspect and work it to turn it
off and in fact right now I'm still running on
that programming because I was cooking a dish earlier tonight
and I lost one of the little cherry tomatoes that
was had on my salad dropped on the floor and
at this point I know what I'm doing so I
still have that rule that I've brought it away so
I did throw it away but still for a minute
like first a brief millisecond I hesitated and I'm like
why why don't why can't I just like keep it
and my reasoning now is not based on hygiene it's
based on the fact that I'm trying to reprogram my
scarcity mindset because the scarcity mindset goes much deeper than
just food on a salad what it's really about it's
about money in fact is that I mean I know
that I have some quirks about money and that I
can be too stingy and too conservative with my money
so for me it's the opposite problem that some people
have some people are just wasting the money everywhere and
they have the problem they can't hold on to it
but then for other people actually hoarding money and being
too conservative with their money is also a problem you
might wonder how that is well for me for example
how that manifest is that I might be too conservative
for example in investing in a situation where I know
that I can get a good return or I might
be too conservative to really invest in a business that
I am creating not somebody else but myself that I
believe in so I might be too stingy to really
invest in my own goals and because my business is
tied to my values and to my life purpose ultimately
what it all ties back to is that I can
be so stingy that I'm holding myself back not only
financially but I'm holding myself back from living my purposefully
and for me that's been a huge huge huge struggle
in fact one of the reasons it took me a
long time to find my life purpose is because I
was so held back by the money aspect of it
I couldn't just let myself go and say well I'm
going to do whatever I want to do and trust
that it's going to make me money I'd be very
certain that it would because I had this hang-up about
the fact that not only do I have to be
doing something that I'm really passionate about can potentially be
really good in and that fits with all my values
and all my strengths but I also have to be
able to make a really good living doing it and
that has always always held me back in fact it
still triggers me because those whatever happened in childhood and
growing up whatever those limiting beliefs and experiences were they're
still with me they're still stuck in this in this
head that I have and they're part of my subconscious
and even though I'm trying to reprogram myself it's going
to take I anticipate probably years of work to really
get that ironed out and it's not going to happen
just spontaneously if I leave it this is going to
have to be an active participation on my part so
I already have a couple of books lined up specifically
about wealth and not just how to get rich fast
but specifically what I'm talking about is like wealth psychology
understanding really what are the triggers that people have about
money where the limiting beliefs and what are some exercises
and other techniques for getting rid of those so I've
already got a couple of those on my on my
wish list and so I'm planning to I haven't really
delved too deeply into into money psychology right now I
was on too many exercises on that but I feel
like that's going to be a huge growth spurt for
me and a huge release when I can handle that
because it's not even about the money ultimately I don't
really care that much about money as long as I've
got enough to like pay the bills but what it
is about is that if I don't feel secure then
that is preventing me from going out there living a
charged kind of life because the only way you can
go out there and take the risks that you want
to take is when you feel secure and relatively comfortable
and this has been actually demonstrated in psychological experiments where
what they do is they they take a young baby
like a couple years old and they have that baby
in a room and then what they do is they
set up circumstances in a way where the mother leaves
and then they monitor the baby and what they found
is that the baby is much more likely to go
exploring in the room and playing with the toys and
talking to new kids and doing some of this scary
stuff for a baby when the mother is present and
it's not because the mother is really doing anything it's
just because the baby feels a sense security and therefore
is comfortable venturing out and doing something a little bit
risky out of its comfort zone whereas when the mother
is gone the babies in the same room same exact
situation but now it's concerned for its safety and that
concern is so paralyzing that it's not going to go
out there and play with any toys it's not going
to go try to make new friends it's not going
to explore the room it's just going to like cowered
a little corner and cry for its mommy and that's
literally what's happening to us when we have hang-ups right
and I'm talking about money but this stuff this applies
across the board to anything for me personally I can
see that my hang-ups about money have really limited me
in business and have limited in the amount of money
that I currently have and have really limited my life
purpose so when I figure out my money psychology I
feel that I'm going to get a huge boost in
all all those areas and I'm noticing that myself but
I'm also noticing that I'm gonna have to do the
work right and the same situation I want you to
take a look and see do you have hang-ups around
money or maybe you have hang-ups around something something different
maybe you have hang-ups in relationships and you keep self
sabotaging yourself in relationships or you have hangups with with
with your social life where you have hang-ups in in
your department of health and and fitness you know whatever
it might be you might have hang-ups there and usually
those come from childhood experiences now maybe someone told you
in school that you were ugly and so now you
feel shy around people or maybe someone ridiculed you and
now you've got that or maybe somebody told you you
were stupid and so now you've got that limiting belief
that you're kind of living with and so you don't
go out there and you don't study and you know
you don't take education very seriously and you don't challenge
yourself out to to do stuff that's out of your
comfort zone where you have to learn because you feel
like you are limited there so these things seem very
childish but and they are because they actually were generated
in childhood and early adulthood perhaps but you know they
stick with you to have a way of sticking with
us because they're very deep in the subconscious and we
usually rarely do the development work the personal development work
that's necessary to weed this stuff out but there is
a silver lining and the silver lining is that you
can weed out almost any hang-up that you have so
literally whatever it is you should be confident and know
that there are tools and resources available right now to
fix all of it any of it no matter how
bad it was I don't care how bad it was
there's a way to get over it to the point
where you can feel safe secure nothing is no longer
triggering or influencing you of course the bigger the problem
was originally the more work you have to do to
to do yourself out of that hole but you can
do it and it's there and the resources on this
website and other many other places can help you do
that so definitely encourage you to do a little bit
of edge respecting and start to notice how how one
of these potentially big blocks from your childhood might be
manifesting itself in very subtle ways something like am up
trying to pick up a mushroom off a kitchen floor
or maybe some other subtle way it comes out in
whatever area of your life all right so I'm going
to leave you with that just wanted to share that
little insight I thought it was interesting made me think
when I first realize it and that's what I'm going
to leave it I'm signing off but before I do
a couple of quick reminders number one is go ahead

want to enlist you in helping me spread the message
and then of course finally go to actualised org for
