            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/C9MS701rvoQ' target='_blank'>Self Deception - Part 2 - 60+ Self-Deception Mechanisms</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Mind's role in constructing reality</b>: The mind is a self-deception engine that creates a dream-like illusion of our reality to sustain our existence. Attention is kept external to prevent self-reflection; any internal examination would rupture the illusion of reality.
</li><li><b>The deceptive nature of mind</b>: Through comprehensive research and study, Leo Gura reveals fundamental and complicated aspects of mind's deception, from cultural to personal levels, spanning across topics such as literature, science, religion, and history. 
</li><li><b>Examples of deception in nature</b>: Nature employs deception for survival. An example is the cuckoo bird, replacing other birds' eggs with its own, which hatches earlier and ejects the legitimate eggs. Adults unknowingly feed the deceptive chick, demonstrating self-interest and survival priority over morality.
</li><li><b>Human self-deception</b>: Humans have elevated deception, using self-deception to deceive others for selfish gain. This is pivotal for social cohesion, enabling individuals to escape adverse consequences while believing in things they don't technically know or understand. 
</li><li><b>Believing in an objectively real reality</b>: One common self-deception is that humans consider reality purely objective and downplay the mind's significant role, allowing the mind to implant its own beliefs as facts. 
</li><li><b>Underestimating self-deception's significance</b>: People fall into self-deception when they underestimate its importance. It's invariably overlooked when deemed insignificant.
</li><li><b>Assuming avoidance of metaphysics</b>: The belief that metaphysics can be avoided restricts understanding and exploration of profound concepts. Scientific people often disregard metaphysics as outmoded and insignificant.
</li><li><b>Science's reliance on metaphysical assumptions</b>: Even scientists unknowingly rely on metaphysical assumptions and beliefs which they often adopt unconsciously from their culture, religion, or science. The scientific method is contingent on many unfounded assumptions.
</li><li><b>Confusion of concepts with reality</b>: Mistaking scientific models and concepts for reality is a common mistake among scientists. While science relies heavily on conceptualizing and modeling, it's essential to understand that these are mere representations, not the actual reality.
</li><li><b>Effects of language and labeling in self-deception</b>: Belief, hearsay, and improper understanding of concepts due to language and labeling can eventually lead to self-deception. These give a false illusion of understanding, misconfusing belief for direct experience.
</li><li><b>Ideal traits for scientists</b>: Daily meditation and mindfulness are essential for scientists to prevent getting lost in conceptualizations and models. Questioning their own beliefs is also necessary.
</li><li><b>Beliefs vs Direct experiences</b>: The importance of differentiating beliefs from direct experiences is emphasized. Commonly, school education is based on beliefs more than direct experiences, which could lead to self-deception when heavily relied upon.
</li><li><b>Influence of childhood imprinting on beliefs</b>: Childhood imprinting plays a vital role in shaping beliefs. Children adopt the ideas and beliefs presented in their environment. Often, societies, and even science exploit this process to shape children's beliefs.
</li><li><b>Beliefs through worldview</b>: Upon being exposed to multiple self-consistent worldviews, people tend to choose the worldview they align with or have grown up with, leading to an arbitrariness in their belief system.
</li><li><b>Denial of knowledge due to societal conditioning</b>: Society conditions individuals to perceive uncertainty and lack of knowledge as inadequacy, as a result, admitting lack of knowledge is rare, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Role of contrast in understanding concepts</b>: Contrast is required for the mind to understand and perceive concepts. Based on this contrast, people form their reality. The mind deceives by eliminating contrast, leading to unawareness of certain truths and assumptions, resulting in self-deception. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of the scientific method</b>: Science is often accepted as being free from assumptions, people are unaware of the meaning of epistemic and metaphysical assumptions, often mistaking them for self-evident or obvious.
</li><li><b>Emotions as a tool for manipulation</b>: Emotions are tools that the mind uses to manipulate us and avoid self-awareness. Emotions often override abstract considerations, truth, morality, and love.
</li><li><b>Reactions of ego</b>: Ego reactions occur when our self-agenda is threatened. These are often associated with emotions. The ego's job is to maintain itself and resist change, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Defense mechanisms leading to self deception</b>: Projection, distraction, crusading and addiction are all defense mechanisms leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Psychological addictions</b>: Overthinking, daydreaming, judging, and resenting are psychological addictions, which are the most deceptive ones. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of clinging to pet theories</b>: Ignoring contrary evidence and clinging onto pet theories lead to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Confirmation Bias</b>: One of the common mechanisms of self-deception is Confirmation Bias, where one tends to seek and interpret information which confirms one's existing beliefs and blocks out conflicting ideologies.
</li><li><b>The prominence of paradigms in self-deception</b>: Paradigms and paradigm blindness, where individuals are stuck in a particular way of thinking and are unable to consider evidence outside of that framework is a significant source of self-deception.
</li><li><b>Question Begging</b>: Assuming the answer to a question one is trying to investigate is referred to as question begging, a mechanism of self-deception.
</li><li><b>Dismissal of ideas</b>: People often dismiss ideas as nonsense without genuinely considering them. This leads to blaming others for societyÂ’s problems, playing victim, and focusing on limitations, causing self-deception.
</li><li><b>False Skepticism and Human Species Bias</b>: False skepticism and human species bias, where people believe their understanding of reality is universal, are among other mechanisms of self-deception.
</li><li><b>Ignoring certain aspects of life</b>: Dismissing deep philosophical discussions because they don't have immediate practical benefits, and favoring status quo, are forms of self-deception.
</li><li><b>Imprint of cultural preferences</b>: Cultural preferences are often a result of indoctrination, making it challenging to teach non-duality due to embedded preferences.
</li><li><b>Collective Ego</b>: Cultures are manifestations of collective egos and have a role in the maintenance of the collective ego. 
</li><li><b>Discussion on self-deception mechanisms</b>: Leo Gura discusses several mechanisms of self-deception and emphasizes the importance of noticing these mechanisms within oneself, and in others. He highlights the need for accurate testing equipment to navigate through these traps.
</li><li><b>Belief that reality is fully understood</b>: Believing that you've figured out everything about reality can hinder personal growth and prevent acquisition of new knowledge. 
</li><li><b>Inherent objectivity of reality</b>: The belief that objective realities exist independent of human interpretation is a false assumption that permits the mind to inject fact into subconscious belief-systems. 
</li><li><b>Underestimating self-deception</b>: Assuming that self-deception isn't significant, is easy to spot, or mainly affects others, often leads to difficulty in recognizing or addressing it. 
</li><li><b>Avoidance of metaphysics</b>: Scientific minds often dismiss or underestimate the significance of metaphysics, forgetting that it shapes worldviews despite attempts to avoid it.
</li><li><b>The danger of over-conceptualization</b>: Confusing conceptualizations or models with reality is a common problem, particularly in scientific fields. Professionals in scientific fields are advised to meditate regularly to heighten awareness and avoid getting lost in conceptualizations. 
</li><li><b>Trusting in language and labels</b>: Language can create illusions of understanding and can foster a false sense of familiarity with unknown concepts. 
</li><li><b>The fallacy of belief and hearsay</b>: Often, people do not understand the difference between a belief and direct experience. Much of what we learn in science is based on beliefs rather than direct experience, making science a belief-based system similar to religion. 
</li><li><b>Mistaking belief for fact</b>: Many scientific concepts that are accepted as facts are actually beliefs, as most people have not personally confirmed or observed these concepts. They are accepted based on faith in the scientific method and the scientists who conducted the observations.
</li><li><b>Belief vs. Direct Experience</b>: Leo Gura discusses self-deception related to scientific knowledge, pointing out that the majority of our understanding (for instance, of planets) is based on secondhand information rather than direct experience. This blurs the distinction between belief and direct experience, leading to self-deception when people ask for scientific evidence of self-inquiry or meditation without realizing these processes constitute the direct evidence they seek.
</li><li><b>Judging Worldviews</b>: Leo warns against judging the correctness of one's worldview based on its cohesion; just because a worldview feels complete doesn't make it true. Multiple cohesive worldviews exist, and people often select one based on upbringing and personal preference, leading to a subjective and often self-deceptive understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Uncertainty</b>: Humans naturally dislike uncertainty and often claim to know more than they genuinely do. A refusal to admit one's lack of knowledge is another common form of self-deception, often reinforced by societal conditioning which equates ignorance with deficiency. 
</li><li><b>Childhood Imprinting and Indoctrination</b>: Leo addresses the crucial impact childhood indoctrination has on shaping our sense of reality, as children easily inherit beliefs, assumptions, and worldviews from their environments. This imprinting process is extremely powerful as it forms the basis for belief systems forming later in life. Societies, religions, and even science exploit child imprinting to shape future generations' perspectives. 
</li><li><b>The Need for Contrast</b>: The importance of contrast in forming human perceptions is discussed. Being born into poverty or wealth, for instance, shapes the mind's perception of reality based on the available contrast. Similarly, the presence or absence of racism in one's environment can drastically affect perceived realities of global racism. This clarifies the potential self-deception by lack of contrast, as individuals may be unaware of certain truths that they have not directly encountered. 
</li><li><b>Authority of Scientific Knowledge</b>: Leo concludes with a critical analysis of scientific knowledge, highlighting that these pieces of information are often accepted without firsthand evidence or questioning. This unconscious acceptance of authority-backed information forms one of the self-deception mechanisms, causing individuals to filter out any ideas that challenge their pre-existing beliefs.
</li><li><b>Importance of Contrast in Understanding Reality</b>: We often rely on the contrast to our existing knowledge to understand and learn new things. Without contrast, the mind loses its ability to discern and whatever happens appears as reality. The understanding of poverty or wealth, the experience of racism or equality, all depend on the contrast to a person's baseline reality. Unawareness of change can lead to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Significance of Assumptions in Self-deception</b>: Humans make numerous assumptions, both consciously and subconsciously. These assumptions, if unchecked, are taken as ground reality resulting in self-deception. For example, the prevailing materialist paradigm and the scientific method are often uncritically assumed as self-evidently true by many in our society.
</li><li><b>Self-evidence or A Priori Truths</b>: The concept of self-evidence or a priori truths is deeply flawed as it reinforces the notion that certain truths are obvious and need no empirical investigation. The truth, however, is completely different as we are completely clueless a priori. Everything is learned through experience and the tag of self-evidence encourages taking things for granted, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Role of Emotions in Self-deception</b>: An emotion's primary purpose is to put a person into motion. Emotions, particularly fear, anger, and boredom are extremely effective mechanisms used by our mind to manipulate our behavior and avoid self-reflection. These emotions are very difficult to master as the mind primarily manipulates us through emotions, not logic and reason.
</li><li><b>Impact of Ego Reactions on Self-deception</b>: Ego reactions are prevalent when a person's self-interests are threatened. These reactions, closely related to emotions, often lead to anger, hostility, or defensiveness. Our mind uses ego reactions to maintain itself and resist change, allowing individuals to be self-deceptive and easily manipulated.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Scientific Research</b>: Scientists often unconsciously prioritize their professional or personal agenda over the pursuit of truth. Defensiveness and emotional reactions are common when their work or theories are threatened. This ego-driven rather than truth-driven approach contributes to self-deception and manipulates the scientific process. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Culture on Perception and Charater</b>: Cultural norms and mores heavily influence an individual's perceptions and behavior. The mind, set according to cultural practices, can resort to self-deception to adhere to the culturally defined reality. Furthermore, cultural prejudices, projecting superiority of one's own culture over others, can also lead to self-deception. 
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Materialism and in the Scientific Method</b>: It is crucial to critically examine the taken-for-granted assumptions in materialism and the scientific method. The limitations of these methodologies demand conscious awareness and a commitment to avoid self-deception for genuine discovery and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Ego and Its Reaction to Intellectual Defenses</b>: Leo Gura discusses various self-deception mechanisms that people often engage in. He focuses on how the human ego reacts strongly to defense of intellectual positions. Using an example of scientists attached to their theories, Gura emphasizes that instead of objectively addressing new information or criticisms, these individuals might build an emotional defense mechanism to protect their pet theories. Furthermore, he asserts that few scientific and philosophical books pay adequate attention to the role of emotions and ego in their process as it might indicate the corruption of their supposedly primary, rational processes.
</li><li><b>Deception Mechanism of Projection</b>: Gura explains the self-deception mechanism of projection. It occurs when people deny acknowledging something within themselves and instead attribute it to others. This is often apparent as people tend to project personal characteristics they prefer not to acknowledge, onto figures or groups they perceive as evil or different from themselves.
</li><li><b>Distraction and Red Herrings Mechanism</b>: Gura mentions distraction as a significant weapon of the ego, where it successfully deviates attention from truth and self-reflection by simply dangling a metaphorical red herring.
</li><li><b>Crusading and Distraction</b>: Crusading is discussed as another method of self-deception where individuals passionately defend their positions or ideas and spend their time condemning opposing views rather than focusing on personal growth and self-reflection.
</li><li><b>Self-Deception in Addiction</b>: Gura argues that addiction is a significant form of deception and distraction, especially psychological addictions to actions like overthinking, daydreaming, judging, and resenting. He links these subtle psychological addictions to the more obvious physical addictions, stating both stem from the desire to distract oneself from inner dialogue or problems.
</li><li><b>Pet Theories as Self-Deception</b>: Gura outlines the idea of 'pet theories' or ideas that individuals cling to stubbornly, often regardless of contrary or new information. He suggests that this tendency to hold onto pet theories, be it scientific hypotheses, political ideologies or religious beliefs, can lead to significant self-deception.
</li><li><b>Confirmation Bias and Paradigm Blindness</b>: Gura confirms that the human mind tends to construct narratives using confirmation bias, where it selectively picks evidence that matches its assumptions, leading to self-deception. He also refers to the issue of paradigm blindness, where people are unwilling or unable to see evidence outside their established paradigm.
</li><li><b>Taking Basic Things for Granted</b>: Gura observes that people often take basic aspects of reality such as life, existence, matter, time, and money for granted, without deeply questioning them. He implies that it is within these basic, unchallenged areas where the mind can deceive us the most.
</li><li><b>Question Begging</b>: Lastly, Gura points out question begging as a common deceptive mechanism where individuals assume the answer to the question they are investigating, thus reasoning in a circle, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Question Begging</b>: Leo Gura discusses the mechanism of question begging, where people answer a question by assuming the answer they're trying to investigate. He uses the example of questioning the reality of the brain, which leads to circular reasoning; the evidence of the brain's existence, such as observable neurons, is contained within the mind, leading to a cyclonic self-justification.
</li><li><b>Judgment, Criticism, and Name-Calling</b>: Close-mindedness, characterized by immediate judgment and criticism of unfamiliar or challenging concepts, prevents people from exploring or accepting new ideas. This leads to a pattern of self-deception, as dismissing ideas due to their novelty prohibits genuine investigation and potential growth. 
</li><li><b>New Age Bias</b>: Averse reactions towards "new age", spiritual or religious concepts are a form of close-mindedness that inhibits personal development. Despite potential truths hidden in these "woo" ideas, a materialistic and mainstream culture often rejects them as nonsense, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Blaming, Scapegoating, and Demonizing</b>: Leo mentions that the mind often projects its issues outwards, blaming others or circumstances for personal problems, in order to avoid personal responsibility. This mechanism allows for false victim narratives and self-deception.
</li><li><b>Arguing and Debating</b>: Instead of introspection and self-reflection, people often distract themselves by engaging in arguments and debates. This defensive mechanism prevents deeper personal understanding and growth, resulting in self-deception.
</li><li><b>False Skepticism and Debunking</b>: Some people identify as skeptics or debunkers, focusing on discrediting unproven concepts or ideas. However, while busy debunking external concepts, they ignore or avoid scrutinizing their own internal belief systems, leading to self-deception.
</li><li><b>Human Species Bias</b>: According to Leo, this mechanism refers to the belief that human perspective or understanding of reality is universal. Scientists particularly fall victim to this form of self-deception, assuming that our human-specific knowledge and understanding, such as mathematics or physics, would be universally comprehensible to any intelligent species.
</li><li><b>Alien Intelligence and Human Understanding</b>: Leo Gura suggests that if humans ever discover intelligent alien life, it would reveal how our understanding of the universe and reality highly depends on our human biology and psychology. Alien understanding would differ greatly, depending on their physiology, brain chemistry, and culture. 
</li><li><b>Human Species Bias</b>: Humans often devalue other species and focus primarily on human welfare. This bias allows them to ignore the violence inflicted on other species for human betterment and urbanization. Gura states that prolonged peace on earth is unattainable because life inherently involves destruction, death, evil, and selfishness.
</li><li><b>Dismissal of Philosophy</b>: Many people disregard deep philosophical discussions that do not offer immediate practical benefits. This dismissal restricts understanding and exploration of existential matters.
</li><li><b>Muddying the Waters</b>: To maintain the status quo, minds often complicate issues, resulting in stagnation. This mechanism hinders the uncovering of truth and prevents the shattering of illusions.
</li><li><b>Cultural Preferences and Indoctrination</b>: Cultural preferences are largely a result of indoctrination. The culture one grows up in molds their preferences in food, entertainment, attraction, and religion. This indoctrination can restrict the acceptance of teachings from other cultures and create bias towards one's own culture. 
</li><li><b>Upcoming Part three of the lecture</b>: The video ends with Leo, Leo Gura, informing his audience about an impending part three of the lecture. According to him, it will feature an in-depth coverage of the self-deception mechanisms highlighted in part two, and further discuss how to successfully avoid falling into these traps. He likens the process of becoming self-aware and dodging these psychological pitfalls to navigating a minefield, emphasizing the need for accuracy, dedication and constant vigilance.
