[Music] you understanding authority the deep problem of authority what
is Authority most people have never seriously thought about what
authority is or how it comes to be and actually
Authority is a much trickier notion than many people assume
notice that you rely on Authority all the time but
you don't actually understand how it works but you will
by the end of this episode as long as you
keep an open mind and really really accept some of
the radical things I'm going to say here because the
true origin of authority is so radical that you're not
gonna want to believe it but before we get to
that let's sort of frame the the question or the
issue what do we mean by authority here authority simply
is the power or Trust that you place into other
people or things in society and you rely on these
things or people in whom you place this trust to
be a source of truth or knowledge or reality for
you in fact what you're doing not knowing really what
you're doing is that you're you're placing or rather you're
using these people and things as anchors to ground your
own sense of reality without which you'd be completely lost
but how do you know who to trust should you
trust the Bible should you trust the Koran should you
trust scientists which scientists should you trust should you trust
the biologists the chemists the physicists the astrophysicists the quantum
physicist which quantum physicists should you trust there's a lot
of them they disagree with each other should you trust
your elementary school teachers or your middle school teachers or
your university professors which culture should you trust should you
trust Western culture Eastern culture Indian culture American culture European
culture African culture and even more importantly by what criteria
are you going to determine who to trust really think
about this from a very fundamental level think about it
from the level of like you are born into this
world and you have no understanding or knowledge of anything
you don't know the difference between up and down and
you certainly don't know the difference between truth and falsehood
and you certainly don't know who you can trust and
who you can't trust people just assume that these things
are Givens and that these are easy questions to answer
not at all so who are you gonna trust how
do you know that you can trust for example your
university professor about the things he's teaching you you see
the problem here is that you're gonna say something along
the lines of well I can trust my university professor
because of da-da-da-da-da but how do you know you can
trust that you see and then trust that and trust
that and trust that you see you have an infinite
regress problem because any authority fear that you cite we
can always question them and then ask ourselves well by
what authority is that authority figure an authority figure and
you see this creates a really tricky problem in fact
it creates a vicious circle because it's begging the question
all the time so if you say for example that
we can trust MIT scientists how do you know that
well because in school you were taught that scientists generally
tell you the truth but how do you know that
was true how do you know what they told you
in school was true well because my parents told me
that I should go to school and listen to the
teachers there okay but how do you know that your
parents were correct you see eventually what the mine does
that sort of surrenders and says well it's probably just
right I mean why go into all this toxic skepticism
I mean leo we just have to add some point
we just have to accept that some stuff is just
a given and that's where you get yourself into a
lot of trouble because what you're doing there is that
you're giving authority to a thing or to a person
or to an institution without being conscious that you're doing
so and I want to make you more conscious to
this now here's where it gets really radical you know
I talked about non-duality a lot if you've been listening
to my content so you need to have some basic
understanding of non-duality in order for this episode to make
sense so I'm assuming that you understand it so here's
something though that you don't understand about non-duality yet there's
a lot of radical implications to non-duality that people don't
understand until they get really deep into non-duality so here's
one of them if non-duality is true like I say
and everything is one that's what none well it means
it means that you can't draw a boundary between anything
because all boundaries are in a sense arbitrary and relative
then what that means is that there is no difference
between you and other and other person another being which
means that ultimately when you connect all the dots there
can be no authority but yourself you are the only
authority in existence that's utterly profound and life-changing to understand
because most people do not act as though they understand
this because they actually they're not conscious of it because
they actually believe that there are higher authority figures in
the universe than them that they can listen to and
look to for truth and guidance and advice and what
I'm telling you is actually there ain't no such thing
there is only you there is only you again it's
very easy to overlook the significance of what I'm saying
here so we're gonna go into it in some detail
to make sure that you get it this is very
radical stuff when you really get it it's gonna freak
you out this is going to utterly mind [ __
] you all authority whatsoever is your authority ultimately the
deepest authority you hold is the claim that you exist
so if I ask you do you exist you will
of course say yes Lee of course I exist but
how do you know that under whose authority are you
claiming that you exist under your own of course you're
not asking me if you exist you're not asking a
scientist you're not asking Albert Einstein whether you exist or
not you're not even asking your parents whether you exist
you are asking yourself now this is such a fundamental
question that most people would say well Lia there's no
alternative to saying that I exist so of course I
exist because Here I am so I mean what's the
big deal no you're not getting it you are telling
yourself that you exist and you're actually believing that that's
not a given that's not obvious consider the possibility that
if you did not tell yourself that you exist the
universe would not know that you exist you exist because
you say you exist and for no other reason now
of course you're in such a tricky position here in
life because you have to survive once you've already committed
yourself to them to the to the position that you
exist that now of course you can't even consider that
you might not exist that doesn't even seem like a
plausible position to you well this is where we have
to really open your mind here so what I'm telling
you is that all authority ultimately comes from you and
that there can be no other Authority because there actually
is no other but you so not only are you
the arbiter of whether you exist or not but also
beyond that you are the arbiter of all other truth
in the universe you control what is true because and
here's where it's very radical stay with me you are
God and you created yourself and you created the entire
universe and you created all others and you are the
truth with a capital T now you're not conscious of
how you created yourself the universe and all others that's
a question for another day we can't get into that
here but you in fact did create yourself and the
universe and all others you just don't know how you
did it yet well that's that's something we got to
work on but since you did that since you are
God and since you are one because God is one
there can't be two gods because God is infinite and
you are infinite there is no one you can turn
to to ask whether it's true that you are God
because you're God think about this from God's point of
view let's say just imagine that there was a God
and let's just imagine for now that the God wasn't
you but just the the kind of classic Christian God
of the guy sitting up in the clouds who separate
from you so if there was such an entity how
would this entity know that it existed man it's not
so not so easy as you think you know most
Christians just assume that well God would know that it's
God would it would it though how would it know
that who would it turn to to verify that it's
God what if God was doubtful what if God wasn't
sure whether it's God what if God had to like
scratch his head and say to himself wait a minute
I'm God but I can't be God that's crazy for
me to say that I'm God Who am I to
say that I'm God that's very nauseous take an egotistical
after all what if I'm not God let me go
let me go ask let me go ask somebody whether
I'm actually God surely somebody must know if I'm God
or not after all if I'm God someone should be
able to tell me that I'm God surely there must
be a book where it is written that I am
God otherwise I can't know that I'm God I mean
what if I'm deluding myself you see this is the
reality of what it would be like for God to
come to know itself see people just take it for
granted that well if there was God God would just
know itself automatically and there would be no problems it
doesn't work that way and the reason I'm framing it
this way is because you are it you how do
you think you were born you created yourself you just
aren't conscious of it yet because you're in denial that
you're God because you think it's egotistical or narcissistic to
think that you're God and you think that if you
were God you would surely know it but surely there
must be that first time when God realizes that it
is God well what I'm telling you is that that
first time is right now for you right here this
is the discussion we're having you are God in denial
that you are God and there's nobody you can ask
because what it means to be God is that you're
everything when you're everything who can you ask can you
ask me you can't ask me cuz I'm you I'm
a projection of your own mind you can't ask your
science teacher because your science teacher is your own imagination
you can't ask your parents because you imagined your parents
you can't look it up in a book because you
invented and written wrote all books so who are you
gonna ask you see the deep existential problem here if
you are everything if you are the truth with a
capital T what it means to be the truth is
that it's impossible for the truth to turn towards anything
else other than itself to know that it is the
truth because if it was to turn towards something else
that would already be an act of delusion because the
truth would have to think well that's something else is
something separate for me which can help me to figure
out myself but that means you're not realizing that that
thing is also you which means you're not in the
highest truth to be in the highest truth is to
be in a state of total non duality in oneness
which means that there cannot be anything that you go
to or turn to to reflect yourself there cannot be
any process of gathering evidence or reason or logic because
reason logic and gathering evidence and all proof is already
you you are it so if you're not conscious that
that is what God is then you ain't conscious that
you're God so in fact you are the ultimate authority
as God is because you are alone and you are
one all authority stems from you all Authority is projected
out from you and imagined by you including all authority
figures the only way that anything has authority for you
as a human right now you're imagining that you're a
human is because you have seeded it your authority but
you have done so unconsciously in a state of delusion
you are not taking responsibility for your true authority as
a creator of your entire world life and experience you
offload this responsibility onto others because it's way too much
responsibility to accept that you are the ultimate and only
authority and that you cannot discover truth aside from your
own self what I'm saying is that if you say
that some source is true or credible you are in
fact creating that so very practically in the human realm
we've got things like Nobel Prizes phd's doctorate doctorates diplomas
credentials none of this has any value or meaning or
significance or authority in and of itself other than the
authority that you give it so here's how Authority really
works you start out life with 100% absolute authority then
you unconsciously give that authority to parents teachers adults politicians
leaders celebrities scientists people with Nobel Prizes PhDs institutions governments
cultures and so on and so forth you make various
judgments about who you can trust and who you can't
trust and in doing so you are actually projecting your
authority in an unconscious way and then denying that that
authority came from you so for example you might listen
to some Nobel Prize scientists tell you something and then
you will say well that that's a very trustworthy person
look look at how credible that is he's so truthful
what he says must be true and when I tell
you are you conscious that you are the one who
is giving the truth power to him you will say
no because you'll say that no Leo he's a he's
a scientist he's very well-respected and he's got a bunch
of Nobel Prizes and PhDs and all of this and
and the community respects them and science is a credible
industry or a credible epistemic process and therefore that's why
it's the truth it's not the truth because I say
it's the truth Leo it's the truth because it actually
is the truth and what I'm telling you is that
that's wrong you're wrong what you had to do was
first give your own authority to all of these things
like the method of science to school to university to
Nobel Prizes to all of this you have to give
your authority to it and then it gets kind of
reflected back at you as though it's being given or
rained down upon you it trickles down upon you when
really you are the one from whom it trickles see
this gets a little bit more obvious when we start
talking about religious examples which we'll get to in a
second but before we get to that let me give
you some more examples so for example all research studies
all scientific experiments all data all evidence all interpretations and
all analysis is only true if you give it authority
and truth what Liat what how can that be possible
I mean a scientific experiment demonstrates the truth a mathematical
proof demonstrates the truth I'm not projecting the truth into
it the truth is there and I'm just discovering it
wrong wrong you're not conscious of how you're giving it
the truth how you're giving it authority who gets to
say whether this particular scientific experiment was valid you do
you not the scientist of course the scientists can also
say whether it's valid or not he can have an
opinion about it but ultimately it's your opinion about it
that matters the most because who says whether that scientists
opinion of that scientific research study is valid only you
can decide that nobody else can decide that who gets
to decide what counts as evidence in the end only
you who gets to decide whether a particular interpretation or
analysis of a situation is correct in the end only
you who gets to decide what counts as data only
you this is a little bit more obvious in religious
examples so for example we've got religions we've got holy
books we've got scriptures we've got gurus priests rabbis Imams
politicians and kings and in the past these all the
politicians and kings and and priests all of this was
mixed together now we have a little more separation of
church and state than we used to but for thousands
of years this was all mixed together and in fact
actually science was also mixed into this and philosophy and
universities they were all mixed into this universities were religious
schools that's what they were originally don't forget that so
you see who determines whether a religion is credible and
valid you only you you could say only up a
weekend we can take measurements and we can scientifically debunk
certain aspects of the Bible only if you give your
consent to those debunking efforts who determines whether the debunkers
are actually valid or not only you which is precisely
why if you haven't noticed yet people around the world
believe such crazy things there are so many different worldviews
and beliefs and religions and scientific theories and conspiracy theories
and just political theories just God knows how many ideologies
and cults and all this how is any of this
possible it's possible precisely because people are not aware that
whatever they give their authority to becomes an actual Authority
in their life they're imagining it and the reason that's
happening is because you have the ultimate authority within you
you get to say what's true you might say well
leo but but nobody can can deny and contest an
obvious truth like that the Sun is shining in the
morning when you walk outside no one can deny the
existence of the Sun wrong of course you can deny
the existence of the Sun you can say that the
Sun is a hallucination you could say that you're in
a dream right now the Sun is just like a
simulation in a matrix for example you're a brain-in-a-vat you're
just hallucinating the the Sun there isn't really a Sun
all right so see you always have the the last
say because in the end who gets to determine what
is a hallucination who gets to determine what is reality
and fiction who gets to determine what is imagination and
what is truth and what is delusion you you and
nobody else can do it start to take acceptance of
this start to take ownership and responsibility for what you're
doing because you've been making this up your whole life
and you don't want to admit it here's an example
for you that's sort of radical Albert Einstein is a
creation of your own mind that you imagined you've never
met Albert Einstein you have no idea if you actually
lived you're imagining Albert Einstein and as you did so
you told yourself that this guy is a really smart
important scientist and that he discovered some important truths about
physics and therefore he should be looked up to after
all he's one of the most genius scientists of all
time you imagine that entire story see but in order
to pull this off in order to hold Albert Einstein
as an authority to cite him as an authority figure
for your arguments about reality you had to deny that
you actually made him up and made him an authority
you have no idea whether Albert Einstein actually advanced truthful
ideas you haven't deeply studied Albert Einstein you haven't studied
his his theories of general relativity you don't really understand
what what he talked about you imagine that you do
you believe it you have faith in it and therefore
it's an authority for you and you use it to
anchor your worldview you see you do this of course
not only with Albert Einstein but in a hundred different
ways with various scientists religious leaders gurus spiritual teachers parents
educators politicians leaders you name it this helps you to
create a sense of reality because see why do you
do this because if you do this and you're not
conscious that you're doing it then what you can do
is you can create the illusion of an independent source
of truth you can then say oh but I read
it in the book and therefore it must be true
because I trust that book or you know Albert Einstein
wouldn't be lying to me there's no way he could
be wrong because he was he was tested you know
his theories were tested by other scientists but how do
you know that because you read it in a book
somewhere because you you listen to it in some YouTube
video you see so now you're giving authority to YouTube
videos into books but how do you know that that
YouTube video or that book that you read in elementary
school was correct you don't it's faith we're talking about
faith here what I'm saying is that 99% of your
entire worldview and everything you believe is held on blind
faith but of course you don't like to admit that
especially if your scientifically minded you hate to admit this
because you want to differentiate yourself from the religious people
so you think that you have some leg up on
them and that you don't use faith to build your
worldview well you're completely deluded in this respect that's what
I'm trying to show you in reality there are no
sources of truth independent of you you are the ultimate
source you divide yourself to create a sense of other
and a sense of reality let's take a look at
various domains here where this issue of authority comes up
welcome tickly at religion science politics and then spirituality so
it's easiest to understand this within religion because most people
understand that religions are full of dogma and myths and
fairy tales and falsehoods this is obvious to most people
so of course there's still plenty people in the world
probably 50% of people in the world who still don't
understand this but but okay those of us who are
beyond that we do so what's the classic problem with
a religious fundamentalist like a a fundamentalist Muslim or Christian
the problem is that you start to argue with them
about the existence of God or something and you tell
them like well okay so how do you know that
God exists and they'll say well because the Bible says
so okay but how do you know that the Bible
is true well because the Bible is the Word of
God but how do you know that it's true that
it's the Word of God because God created it but
how do you know God created it because the Bible
says it so it turns into a vicious circle very
quickly and you know those of us who are more
scientifically minded we see through that very fast the religious
person of course can't see through that because they're locked
in their paradigm and they're not understanding that they are
the one who are giving authority to this holy book
all holy books work this way whether it's the Bible
or the Quran or the the Torah or the Vedas
or the Bhagavad Gita or anything you might say well
Leah but the bhagavad-gita you know this is a classic
spiritual text which has been around for thousands of years
and it has been validated by the best gurus and
teachers around do you see what you just did there
you did that and in doing so you gave all
those people and that that holy text all of your
authority because how do you actually know that the Bhagavad
Gita is true and that all of these holy teachers
and and traditions were correct you don't know we just
assume so you just have faith in it and to
have faith in something is identical to saying that you
gave it your authority see so a person who has
faith in God has given their authority to an image
of God in their mind that's all they've done now
of course they're gonna deny this and go say no
no Leo Leo God has actual authority so I'm actually
giving my authority to the proper source which is actual
God and what I'm telling you is that no you're
full of [ __ ] you're imagining that you're doing
that actually you're engaging in idol worship you're not giving
true authority to the actual God because the actual God
is you not an image in your mind not a
belief not some bearded man in the sky nor a
holy book you you if you want to give true
authority to God realize that you are the ultimate source
of all of existence then you'll realize that you are
God and then your authority will be placed in the
right place but until then you're just playing games you're
deluded you're not conscious of what you're doing how about
the area of science and universities in academia well here's
we're going one step more advanced than religion with religion
it was pretty obvious what I just explained to most
people but with science just people resist this because they've
been so conditioned to think that science is the opposite
of religion and now science doesn't rely on faith but
actually science has the exact same authority problem as religion
atheists are in denial about this they think that well
no Leo Authority surely Oh in science we do have
authority we have our Nobel Prize winners and PhDs and
so forth but that is backed up by empirical evidence
and studies so in this respect it's different than religion
it's not like just believing in the Pope you know
the Pope says something and people just believe that they're
the Pope is infallible but a scientist a scientist is
fallible and people don't just believe scientists blindly you clearly
haven't studied the history of science you have a myth
of how science works that's not how science really works
science is completely preoccupied with this issue of authority it
is the lifeblood of science his authority every scientist devotes
his whole career to protecting and defending his integrity and
his authority making sure he doesn't make mistakes why is
he so careful about this why is he so careful
about getting published in the most respected research journals and
getting cited the most compared to all of his colleagues
why do they care so much about Nobel Prizes and
and research grants and working for the most prestigious universities
precisely because it's not about the truth it's a status
game it's a game for authority it's a social construction
the way science works is that you need to build
a consensus amongst your peers that means they need to
accept your ideas if they don't accept your ideas you're
banned from the club of science even if your ideas
are true true the second area within science authority and
credibility is primary which is why scientists are so obsessed
with it in such unhealthy ways and this of course
corrupts the endeavor of science and academia and university how
do you know that all the stuff in university that
you were taught was true did you verify any of
it for yourself of course not you verified less than
1% of everything you learn at university and if you
go to verify a lot of it you'll discover that
it's false but of course you never bother to do
it because you just assume that it's not worthwhile to
do and that is true actually this problem of believing
in the Pope that religion suffers from science suffers from
exactly this same problem and if you look at the
history of science you'll see this exact same problem this
is what Thomas Kuhn talked about in his his famous
book revolutions within science and where he coined that the
notion of a paradigm go check out my episode called
how paradigms work for more on that the other area
that's important to cover here is politics now today we've
sort of separated politics from religion a lot we've separated
politics from philosophy a lot and and we're very cynical
about politics these days but in the past hundreds of
years ago thousands of years ago politics and government was
the ultimate source of authority and it was wedded with
religion and with philosophy and even with notions of science
and truth all of it was wedded together such that
the monarch or the dictator was divinely anointed and his
proclamations were the highest authority and truth and people just
accepted that and believed it so what changed between that
thousands of years ago let's say in ancient Egypt we
might imagine or or or even in Europe you know
in the medieval times the the kings and monarchs were
divinely anointed they were actually the sons of gods sometimes
they were even called gods you see so how was
that possible back then but it's not possible today no
American president can get elected today proclaiming himself to be
God isn't that interesting what changed well what changed is
that we stopped giving our authority to those people that's
what changed and the reason that change was possible was
because you or we all of us collectively and you
of course individually are responsible for who we give our
authority to which person which leader which institution which epistemic
system which paradigm which ideology and so on and this
is why throughout history you see different cultures you know
the pendulum swings from one ideology to another ideology politically
religiously and from and in other ways and the reason
that is possible is because we have control over what
we call authoritative we're projecting the authority into it the
authority is not baked into anything is what I'm saying
and finally we get to the most trickiest domain which
is the problem of authority within within spirituality and non-duality
so I specifically separated spirituality from religion because spirituality is
more sophisticated it's much more tricky so here's the problem
you might have agreed with everything I said up to
this point because you fancy yourself you know an intermediate
level spiritual practitioner and you've been following various teachers on
YouTube you've been self inquiring you've been meditating you've been
listening to gurus and so forth and you think you
understand what's really going on but you're still deluding yourself
because now you've just created new authority figures out of
these who is it for you at heart all a
have Mooji Rupert Spira Sadhguru you know I can name
a list that goes on forever of such people your
favorite gurus and teachers and enlightened masters or if it's
not individual people that it's its entire schools so maybe
for you it's Zen for you as Buddhism for you
it's yoga for you it's a Kriya yoga for you
it's hatha yoga for you it's some other thing you
know for you it's channeling some alien entity for you
it's Bashar for you it's um-hmm Christ or Buddha Mahavira
osho or some book like I said the Bhagavad Gita
or some Zen book or someone you know Patanjali yoga
sutras whatever it is all of this is still the
same thing you're projecting your authority into your gurus and
into your spiritual schools see cuz how do you know
that Zen is true how do you know the Buddha
was the most enlightened how do you know Christ was
was truthful and enlightened you don't know you have no
idea it's it's pure speculation and faith on your part
and you are not conscious all the while you're doing
this you're not conscious that you are imagining that thing
or that person and you are creating a false idol
and that you are projecting your authority into that person
which is precisely the thing which is keeping you from
fully awakening to yourself as God how are you gonna
awaken to yourself as God when you think that Sadhguru
is something that is real and truthful and above you
an authority figure above you who knows more than you
if you think Sadhguru knows more than you that means
you're not conscious that you're God you're not conscious that
you're the absolute truth because Sadhguru is one step removed
from you being the absolute truth you are the truth
the truth not something you know the truth is something
you are there can be no intermediary whatsoever between you
and the truth no guru only you all gurus are
your own imagination you've imagined them all including Christ Buddha
and anyone else and if you don't realize this you
ain't fully awake and that's precisely the thing that's keeping
you from fully awakening you see this goes deep it's
very tricky there's a lot of ways in which you
deny your own authority is God and the biggest reason
you do this is because you want to act humble
see it's like awliya but i but what you're saying
here is so narcissistic and egotistical i need to worship
my guru and i need you know I need to
respect my guru coz he knows more than me he
has more experience than me as long as you believe
that as long as you imagine that you're stuck experience
is right here nobody can get you closer to your
own experience of existence but you you're in it you're
in existence you are existence and yet you're looking for
some other human [ __ ] being to tell you
that you exist and what you actually are you need
some guru to tell you that you're God you need
me to tell you that you're God it's a [
__ ] absurdity what you're doing the only one who
can tell you that your God is you by [
__ ] realizing that that's what you are not by
me telling you common folk fine authority figure is very
appealing and of course it all starts with childhood why
do we find authority figures so appealing because it creates
a sense of objective grounded reality for us when we
come into this world we know nothing we understand nothing
we're completely lost and helpless and we need somehow to
orient ourselves and to start to distinguish truth from falsehood
otherwise we [ __ ] die or [ __ ]
if we don't do this so we find ourselves immediately
upon entry into this world in a very precarious situation
we need to start to distinguish truth from fiction quickly
to stay alive but in our haste to survive who
we of course end up shooting ourselves in the foot
because we give our authority to all these other figures
who are supposed to help us to survive you know
you give your authority to your mom and to your
dad when you're young and you sort of just trust
that you know your mom and your dad they know
more than you they can help you to live in
you know dangerous situations you let them handle stuff and
then when you get into school you also start to
just buy into that idea that well in school the
teacher knows more than me and in university the professor
knows more than me and at my first job my
boss knows more than me and when I'm entering spirituality
my guru of course knows more than me there's some
truth in that because you do enter the world ignorant
but when it comes to the most fundamental truths you
can't get those from people you have to get them
from your own self because the truth is that all
those other people are actually aspects of your own self
and so this whole growing up process that we do
as children and teens is we create a false sense
of security by anchoring our reality into Christianity or Buddhism
or science or atheism or philosophy or skepticism or rationality
or logic or chasing Nobel Prizes or whatever it might
be and this is very appealing because then you don't
have to struggle to figure out reality making sense of
reality becomes so much easier when you can create a
few authority figures who you can just listen to this
saves you so much time and energy so much hassle
so much frustration it means you don't have to think
for yourself it means you don't have to struggle with
doubt it means you don't have to self-reflect seriously it
means you don't have to really self inquire you don't
have to face challenging at existential questions because your culture
just gives you all the answers and you just accept
them as truth it means you don't have to explore
alternative perspectives and ideologies and points of view people find
this very appealing especially people in spiral dynamics stage purple
red blue and orange each one of them posits its
own authority figures so for example sage purple person will
will cite the tribe and the tribal culture as the
authority figure and tradition heritage sage stage blue people for
example will cite their civilization in their ethnicity as the
source of ultimate authority and their Bible their holy book
and their and their religion stage orange people will will
evolve beyond that and they will cite as authority figures
mmm reason logic mathematics and science and then you know
you can keep evolving beyond all that each time you're
ascending and you're transcending these various authority figures until ultimately
get to the highest levels and you realize that the
only authority figure the entire time has been you taking
different forms projecting itself through different forms now let me
address one objection here but Leo so do you expect
me now to personally verify every little bit of information
I mean this is impossible don't I have to rely
on experts and authorities and people who know more than
me I mean I don't know everything yes you don't
know everything and that's exactly what I'm saying you can't
verify all information the fact the matter is is that
the epistemic situation we find ourselves in as humans is
that we're in an unknown world and we have to
survive and it's a life-and-death game and we are always
dealing with imperfect information highly imperfect information there's much less
that we know then that we don't know in all
circumstances no matter what we're doing in a relationship in
school in science in the laboratory in politics and governments
in your family life in your work in your business
there's so much you don't know and so you're constantly
afraid and so you're looking for a sense of security
in and you need information to help you to survive
and to be effective and successful in all these different
domains so of course it's natural that you turn to
books into experts and you need to practically do that
for purposes of survival but what I want you to
understand is that there's different ways of going about that
there's the way that most people do it which is
just blindly accepting everything and not doing any serious self-reflection
or existential investigation and then there's the other way which
is that yes you can use those sources of course
of course read books and so forth but there are
certain aspects of your understanding of reality which cannot be
outsourced to anybody and cannot be trusted to anybody not
to the most enlightened guru can you trust this it's
your job to figure that part out to verify it
and these are the topics of who are you what
is the world what is God what is the purpose
of life these sorts of big questions these are the
ones that you can't just outsource and you can't just
go read up in some holy book or get from
some scientist or prove with some research study these are
the ones you personally need to roll up your sleeves
and get involved with see and it's also about a
certain attitude that you need to take most people's epistemic
attitude towards life is that uh well the truth is
just easy to understand whatever is true is just what
my culture tells me and there's nothing interesting or radical
to discover that kind of arrogant attitude is exactly what
I'm trying to steer you away from the proper attitude
is one where you are fully appreciative of how little
you know and how precarious all of your knowledge is
and just how blind and how faith-based all of your
beliefs are and how just how precarious your entire worldview
is how easily it can crumble house is a house
of cards really held together it was snot that's what
your worldview is and that the slightest little poke or
prod or question asked in the right way will destroy
your entire worldview see most people are in denial about
that they spend all their time defending the little snot
constructed house of cards rather than questioning it seriously which
is what we're doing here with actualized org so it's
it's a very different epistemic attitude that I'm sharing with
you here 99% of people do not think for themselves
please notice this I hope you have noticed this in
your several decades of living in this life if you've
lived to your 20s or 30s by now I hope
you have noticed that 99% of people do not think
for themselves including you they just blindly accept the thinking
of others now there's a little trap here that people
fall into when they get into spiritual work in spirituality
commonly they're sort of a disparagement of thinking and you
might fall into the trap of thing that well thinking
is bad I should stop thinking before you go that
far first realize the basics the basics is that actually
thinking is good what's bad is having others think for
you that's what's really dangerous independent critical thinking that's amazing
that's great you need more of that before you stop
thinking to attain nirvana first start thinking critically for yourself
for the first time in your life because you haven't
been doing up to this point and in fact most
people pursuing nirvana they ain't actually thinking properly they're trying
to stop thinking before they learn how to stop how
to start thinking what's bad are simplistic linear black-and-white ways
of thinking absolutist ways of thinking that's what's truly dangerous
99% of people do not think what they do is
they follow they pair it and they eight check yourself
isn't it true that 99% of everything you think on
a daily basis isn't something that you originally developed or
derived for yourself but actually something that you got from
following somebody else and then parroting them and aping them
isn't that what you're doing with me you're sitting there
scribbling your little notes in your notepad trying to write
down all the wisdom I give you but in the
end all you're doing is you're just parroting and aping
me and then you wonder why nothing is changing in
your life of course not you think you can take
the highest wisdom of the universe and you can just
parrot it and ape it and you think you're gonna
get the results and benefits of it get the [
__ ] out of here who are you kidding it
doesn't work like that you have to work for this
wisdom you have to derive it for yourself it has
to be totally owned by you look at some case
studies here of how people give away their authority so
think of the fundamentalist Muslim or Christian think about how
they give away their authority to their religion to their
priests to their holy books to their various icons and
rituals think about how much time and energy they devote
to that and that they waste and as they're doing
all of that they're overlooking the most obvious thing which
is that all that Islam and Christianity is pointing you
towards is that you are God you are you don't
need to open a [ __ ] Bible you don't
need to go to church you don't need to pray
you don't need to put on a cross you don't
need to do this you don't need to you know
pull out your prayer rug five times a day and
face Mecca and make pilgrimage and all this you don't
need any of that as long as you realize that
your God and as long as you don't realize that
your God or that your Allah none of that other
stuff will substitute for it which is why religious people
are actually so evil and practice in theory they're the
nicest most loving most spiritual people in practice they're the
most closed-minded ignorant deluded ungodlike people that walk the earth
isn't that true of course it is how about with
and of course they deny it see so if you
tell a fundamentalist Muslim a Christian that he is the
one who is giving authority to the Bible and to
the to the prayer and to the cross and to
all these religious symbols he's gonna deny it he's gonna
say no Leo it's it's Islam is the one true
faith I mean I'm not I'm not doing it it's
it is what it is it's you know it's Muhammad
and it's all on and it's Jesus Christ you know
it's them there it's not it's not me it's them
this is how twisted and fucked-up it is his how
do you help a person like this how do you
save a person like this you can't you can't and
the reason you can't save a person like this is
precisely because they are God that's the irony of it
that's the paradox it's precisely because you are God that
if you believe with your full heart that Christianity in
Christ is the one true Messiah that will be true
for you until such time that you stop believing that
and nobody and I mean nobody will be able to
disprove you or to convince you otherwise why is that
precisely because you are the ultimate authority so whatever you
give your ultimate authority to will be that for you
whether you realize it or not so the only way
that one of these fundamentalist Muslims or Christians will ever
discover the mistake that they've been making is through physical
death you see they have to physically die to realize
that that they were denying that they were God you
know it would be nicer if they could figure it
out earlier you know they could live a much better
life but for many people that's how it is worshipping
of icons and deities a lot of people especially in
the east in India especially and they love their various
deities and icons and avatars that they worship you're imagining
all those and you're giving all of those authority and
by the way notice anything that you give authority to
the only reason you give authority to it is simply
because you grew up with it and it was the
only alternative that was offered to you which is precisely
why if you grew up in the Middle East you
will be a Muslim and if you grow up in
some Christian nation you will be a Christian and if
you grow up in India you will be a Hindu
and you will believe it you ain't do what anything
sophisticated by being a Muslim or a Christian or Hindu
you're being a robot you're being a Sambi you're just
doing whatever everyone around you is doing and you don't
even explore the alternatives of course there's rare exceptions but
for the most part this is how it works now
let's move on to science as case studies here let's
consider the scientific materialist rationalist atheist reductionist positivist bunch of
terms which all describe the same type of person I'm
talking about the Sam Harris type of person so this
person is equally creating sources of authority there's just a
different flavor different flavors they're more scientific they're more rational
they're more materialist it's more about citing studies and and
so forth but essentially the same [ __ ] is
going on you haven't actually verified these studies haven't done
these studies you haven't done any serious science you don't
even know what science is you pretend to be a
champion of science you haven't you haven't bothered to contemplate
the nature of science at all you have no idea
the epistemology that is at the root of science and
so so yeah you're doing the same thing and you're
a denial about it of course totally in denial about
it how about the skeptic in the D bunker as
a case study these are often the same type of
people as I was just describing same thing the skeptic
and the D bunker has sources of authority that they
use for their debunking in their skepticism that's the the
twisted perverted irony of modern skepticism go check out my
episode called uh true versus false skepticism where I go
to that a lot of depth how about the example
of the Zen student and his master I've met people
like this in real life who are Zen students devoted
to their Zen master and they listen to everything a
Zen master says and they follow his every word hang
on his every word worship Him but they ain't [
__ ] enlightened they don't know that their God it's
easy to tell you see they're too busy worshipping the
master and following the master to actually question the master
seriously so even in what you might think of as
the most pure of spiritual schools like Zen it's one
of the purest and least corrupt ones this problem is
still enormous Lee prevalent the problem of authority and if
it's not your Zen master then it's the Buddha you
pray to the Buddha or you wish to become the
Buddha well actually if you want to become the Buddha
that's actually pretty good if you realize that that you
can become the Buddha see the problem is that people
pursue the Buddha but they still have a there's still
a hair of separation so they might think that they
can become a Buddha but they don't understand that they
are the Buddha you aren't a Buddha you are the
[ __ ] Buddha the original Buddha is what you
are and if you don't realize that then you ain't
enlightened like the Buddha you can actually reach a distinct
point in your consciousness will you where you will realize
that you are the actual [ __ ] Buddha but
how many people have gotten there not very many precisely
because they're too busy worshiping the Buddha which is why
you know and then they tell you when you meet
the Buddha you kill the Buddha that's what that means
of course same problem with in yoga and and following
various Hindu your gurus it's actually an especially big problem
within Hindu spirituality and yoga because for them they especially
emphasize the path of devotion to the Guru I'm very
critical of this path of devotion to the Guru not
because you can never awaken through this process not because
you can't gain valuable insights and wisdoms from the Guru
of course you can of course you can but it's
very dangerous because most people who follow a guru never
fully take back their authority especially if you don't just
follow and listen to a guru you know there's a
distinction between just following a listening guru and then actually
devoting yourself to a guru like living with him and
like kissing his feet you know some people are into
that [ __ ] so it's those people who are
following the path of devotion that I'm most worried about
like they will never ever fully realize that they are
God because for them to do that is to admit
that they imagine their own guru how are they going
to ever admit that to themselves when they are committed
to worshiping his ass it ain't gonna happen so while
gurus are our cool people and you can learn a
lot from them you can listen to them you can
read their books and watch their videos just you know
be careful to keep keep a distance and realize that
you are giving them your authority how about the case
study of an insane psychopath like literally a mentally deranged
person who lives in his own reality have you noticed
that you can't get through to such a person that
person is the lost cause he has to be locked
up and you know you have to be careful around
him because you might [ __ ] stab you with
a fork in the back while you're trying to feed
him dinner or something because he's lost in his own
reality why can't you get through this person precisely because
he's given his own authority to some mental constructions that
he's created some psychopathic schizophrenic you know delusional world that
he inhabits he's given us so much authority that he's
stuck he's paved himself into a mental corner and it's
very hard to break through to these people of course
it's possible it's possible to always reform somebody but you
know some of these people really are like lost causes
and the reason that is is because he's God imagining
himself to be a psychopath and if God wants to
be a psychopath God will be a psychopath full [
__ ] bore like God's not [ __ ] around
he'll be a psychopath to the death and then after
he dies he'll realize oh yeah I was just pretending
to be a psychopath I mean it's hilarious but it's
also tragic and brutal at the same time or consider
the case study of someone like Alex Jones uh uh
really deranged conspiracy theorist you know just listen to him
talk listen to way he believes his own [ __
] you can tell first of all you can tell
that he probably has some mental illness but secondly and
that's on top of his enormous ego and narcissism and
relatively low level spiral dynamics development but uh but you
could just tell like he is so committed to giving
his sphere conspiracy theories via his own authority as God
that they're true for him they're true for him and
you're not gonna you're not gonna get through to him
he's the lost cause this is why open-mindedness is something
that I preach and that is so important because open-
is the antidote to getting locked in to the delusions
and mesmerism z' of your own mind if you want
to discover that you are God you better be very
[ __ ] open-minded otherwise you're gonna get hung up
on one of these ideologies you're gonna give all your
authority way when you give all your authority way how
can you recollect it to recollect your authority is to
recollect it to recall it to remember what you are
that you are the source of the entire universe that
you're imagining the whole thing that's what recollection means spiritual
it's a spiritual term so what I'm saying is that
whatever source you say is credible becomes credible to you
whatever worldview you say is credible becomes credible to you
whatever you hold reality to be becomes that way for
you because you are the creator of all of reality
by ceding authority unconsciously to others you paint yourself into
a corner in your own mind and you get paradigm
locked and then you're unable to reach the highest levels
of truth consciousness love and life I want you to
notice that all worldviews are viciously circular and self-reinforcing especially
those which are based in gross egotism like look for
example at what Alex Jones is doing because he's basing
his worldview in gross egotism in fear hatred judgment and
so forth to low level of consciousness all of his
conspiracy theories are viciously circular they reinforce themselves as they
must because that's the only way you can construct your
own little bubble of reality and that's exactly what the
devil does the devil is God constructing a bubble reality
within the larger hole of God you see it's like
a cancer within the body of God a cancer arises
of this sort of runaway effect of just mechanical procreation
and proliferation which becomes a sort of a runaway chain
reaction effect which ends up destroying the entire system of
course you can't really destroy God because God is infinite
but you can destroy aspects parts of God like you
can destroy the planet you can destroy planet Earth with
devilry and that's exactly we're talking about devil right here
so devilry in its essence what is devilry devilry is
the denial that you are God and that's exactly what
the Christian tradition teaches you is that Lucifer is the
fallen angel who separated himself from God and said that
he wants to he would rather rule in Hell than
serve in heaven isn't that what the myth says isn't
that what you're doing isn't that what you're doing by
projecting your authority onto others to accept that you are
God you would have to start to serve God which
is what you're terrified of because you want your own
egoic self agenda to be the thing that's being served
which is why you don't want to accept that you're
a god because if you accept it and realize that
your god your whole life would change much of your
devilry would be expunged in the light of God because
you would take back responsibility you would walk delicately on
the grass making sure that you don't injure every blade
of grass and flour that's growing there because you're conscious
you're so conscious that it's all you that you created
it it's your creation you love it see but you
don't want that you want to just [ __ ]
[ __ ] around like a devil Trane's around like
a devil and be oblivious to your own creation other
than what serves you as little human being so here
are some action steps for taking back your authority first
realize that all authority must come from you it all
flows from you so try to actually trace back all
the authority figures that you believe in trace them all
back to you whether it's a scientific study or a
PhD or some government official or some religious leader trace
it back to you actually trace back in your own
past go through your memories and try to remember those
moments in your life in your childhood in your youth
where you gave your authority unwittingly to these different sources
because you did do that secondly become conscious of how
you see your authority to others what I mean by
this is not just in the abstract I mean on
a daily basis you're giving your authority to various teachers
and people in books and leaders and so forth you
have to keep being conscious of it not just once
but like over and over and over again every week
every month until you start to really accept it see
for what it is thirdly take responsibility and ownership of
this whole process you're doing it fourthly start thinking for
yourself start deriving your own answers and conclusions rather than
asking me or somebody else for the answers fifthly take
responsibility for delivering yourself to the truth don't expect anyone
to give you the truth it's your job to discover
the truth only you can discover the truth understand this
nobody and nothing can prove the truth to you because
the truth is what you are discovering the truth is
your life's work don't you dare try to outsource this
to anybody else not even to a truth realized guru
especially not true a truth realized guru and lastly get
to a point in your life where you actually directly
become conscious that you're a god this is very important
because everything I said here you will not be able
to implement and actualize until the day that you actually
finally discover that you are God not as something that
I said not as a belief not as a theory
not as a speculation but as the absolute truth you
need to have that moment of Epiphany to master your
life you must figure it out for yourself books videos
audios teachings are nice but they will never be able
to do the work for you at some point you
must cut the umbilical cord and you must go into
a free fall into a state of groundlessness where you
feel completely lost and alone and here you might start
to feel like you're going insane like you're losing your
grip on reality it might seem to you like you
don't know what what's real anymore that's exactly where you
need to go expect that that's where you will go
you will reach that point and in the end once
you bust through even that in the end you will
finally realize that you are God you have always been
God there is nothing but you here there is no
other I have always been you I am just a
projection of you and no one will be able to
validate any of this for you do not look to
me do not look to your guru do not look
to a book to validate that you are God if
you are looking for validation that you are God you're
still not conscious that your gut only God can know
fully that it is God because it's the only thing
that's here and because it's infinite it needs infinite consciousness
and intelligence to realize this by looking for external validation
you are not tapping into infinite consciousness and intelligence you
are actually mesmerized by your imagination of an other and
you are unconsciously projecting your authority into that other such
that external validation is even possible when you are fully
in a non dual absolute truth God consciousness state there
will be no possibility of external validation because internal and
external will cease to exist and proof will be a
laughable notion evidence science all of these will be fictions
and imaginations utter silliness you will laugh at ever having
taken them seriously your knowledge of yourself will be self-illuminating
self knowing self validating absolute you will have absolute self
knowledge absolute self understanding total omniscience because the truth is
that there's nothing external to you and it will feel
like you're inside of a black hole you will feel
all alone and it will be simultaneously the greatest thing
you've ever discovered the most beautiful truth that could ever
be shared and in that moment you will also realize
the tragedy that it can never be shared with anyone
because you're all alone and all others are just something
you imagine and in the end the whole world may
tell you that you've gone crazy but you need to
be so deeply conscious and grounded in the truth that
that doesn't faze you at all because you know what
you are now if you don't fully take back your
own authority you will then compromise with ignorance you will
look for others to validate you and you will not
be stable II grounded in the absolute and you will
be compromising with Devils remember that truth is not a
popular consensus truth is not the midpoint of all opinions
truth is what you are you must come to your
own conclusions and yet at the same time I must
warn you that you must also be open to constructive
feedback and you must be willing to reevaluate your beliefs
and ideas and worldviews and you must still turn to
experts for outside perspective not so that they can validate
you but just because they can expose you to new
ways of looking at the world you need to be
conscious that even though yes you are God you still
have blind spots you might wonder well Leo how can
God have blind spots isn't this a contradiction no it's
not a contradiction God contains all limitations within it and
it's precisely because God's mental power the power of imagination
is so infinite that it can trap itself into various
corners and dead ends as it constructs this infinite labyrinth
of reality and it explores all these different dreams and
nightmares and delusions so God can delude itself which is
precisely where you find yourself right now you are God
deluded so just remember that others can help you to
see your blind spots so in this sense others are
important even though others are you others can show you
new ways of looking at the world that you never
even thought were possible so there is value in relationship
there is value in learning from experts and teachers and
gurus and there is value you know falling in love
with somebody and having them show you know a new
way of looking at the world their way of looking
at the world there is value in exploring different religions
and Sciences and different epistemic schemes and different paradigms so
this is all in line with what I was telling
you about open-mindedness make sure you keep yourself open because
just because you are God doesn't mean you can't be
a [ __ ] up at the same time doesn't
mean you can't be arrogant doesn't mean you can't be
closed-minded doesn't mean you can't make mistakes doesn't mean you
can't be wrong also don't misunderstand me I'm not telling
you that other is somehow bad or wrong or inherently
untrustworthy I'm making a meta point here I'm trying to
point you to the fact that author is you realize
that other is you so I'm not telling you to
distrust all others that would be a mistake to interpret
what I'm saying that way also understand that society is
built upon false Authority Authority is very useful for survival
it gets you power money fame and sex which are
basically all of your most basic survival needs so there
is enormous survival pressures upon people and institutions to create
and erect erect false fronts of authority and to hoard
Authority and to play various manipulative political games to place
themselves on top of the hierarchy so that they are
the authority figure because if you can if you can
appear as an authority figure within society and get a
bunch of people to believe you man you've got your
survival taken care of you're gonna have all your sex
needs taken care of all your financial needs and basically
anything else you want will come from that so this
is the game that mankind has been playing for thousands
of years this is a very dangerous game leads to
a lot of suffering and unnecessary war and violence and
so forth so this problem of authority that we've been
talking about contributes to self-deception it's one of the self
deception mechanisms that I talked about in my three-part miniseries
called self assumption mechanisms so go check that out if
you haven't already it's one of my most powerful series
you can deceive yourself by placing authority in religion holy
books sighs or any other thing but you can also
deceive yourself by placing authority too much and exclusively within
your self now here's where total tricky because now I'm
talking about the ego self see there's a difference between
placing authority within you as God versus you as the
human ego so a lot of Devils will misuse this
whole conversation here and they will say this to themselves
it was aa leave so Leo's saying I don't need
to trust anybody all those gurus are all full of
[ __ ] all experts are [ __ ] I'm
I'm the ultimate authority that means that whatever I believe
is true and all about conspiracy theories I knew they
were right I knew they were true and then you
just go off on that and then you become an
Alex Jones figure if you do that you see so
I'm not telling you to do that be careful placing
authority in your ego is one of the worst things
you can do that's even more dangerous than placing authority
in some guru so this is where it's tricky and
there's no easy way to determine you know what is
ego and what is God that's tricky it'll take you
years of practice to be able to distinguish those two
if you want a simple rule of thumb God is
your highest feeling of love and ego is your fear
judgment and hatred so that's a little simple rule for
you it's a very good rule but even with love
you can easily deceive yourself a lot of times the
ego will co-opt love and it will think that it's
actually following the love of God when actually it just
being egotistical and wrapping yourself in a cloak of love
which is conditional and sort of quasi spiritual but not
actual genuine divine love so be careful with that see
my episode what is love for more on that love
is the deep topic there's many ways that you can
deceive yourself with love so yeah so be careful be
careful with where you place your authority don't place it
in others but also don't place it in your ego
otherwise you're gonna become an ideologue or a cult leader
or a psychopath or some unn self-reflective narcissist you know
some Trump like figure that's what happens when you place
ultimate authority in your own ego you get Donald Trump
so don't do that so yes you are God talking
to yourself right now but also be careful because even
though you are God talking to yourself that doesn't mean
that everything coming out of your mouth is valid the
point is that God can dilute itself not only can
it that's mostly what it does when it's in human
form so be careful just because every guru is God
and you talking to yourself doesn't mean that every guru
is telling you valid things so make sure that you
cross-reference different gurus cross-reference high-quality sources this is one of
my most important sort of secret methods that I use
to make sure that I don't delude myself is that
I study literally hundreds of diverse sources which helped me
to spot my own blind spots and even then I'm
I'm still fallible I still make mistakes there can be
no foolproof formula for arriving at the truth because consciousness
of a vast infinite thing and there are so many
ways that it can trick itself and get wrapped up
in itself various vortices of delusion that occur within consciousness
so watch out you must always stay vigilant against self-deception
and that's what I'll leave you with all right if
you liked the video make sure you click the like
button for me that helps out spreads the message and
come check out actualize that work that's my website you'll
find my blog there you'll find my book list speaking
of high quality sources over 200 of some of the
best books that I've ever read compiled for you and
reviewed the life purpose course and the forum and that
the last thing I'll say is this you might wonder
you probably have watching all these videos Leo do you
ever doubt yourself what if you're deluded Leo what if
all of actualized Org is just one giant delusion and
you're misleading yourself and all these other people all of
your talk about God what if this is just a
cult yeah how do you explain that it's nobody there's
just no way to communicate it you see I've become
conscious that I'm God and I become conscious that everything
is my own creation and so I've taken back my
full authority and from your point of view I look
like a deluded psychopath or a narcissistic cult leader for
for saying this but the irony of it is that
it's the absolute truth but you'll never know because I'm
speaking to you from inside the black hole that you
have not yet entered when you enter this black hole
for yourself you will discover exactly what I told you
but of course at that precise moment you will also
discover that I'm imaginary and that there's only you and
that now you will find yourself in the exact same
position where I was speaking from where you have access
to the absolute truth you know for a 100% certainty
that you are God and that you have invented everything
and that you are the only source of authority in
the universe and that there's nobody else you can turn
to you will know that and you will want to
share this truth with other people but you'll realize that
you can't and then you'll understand my position and that's
the twisted beauty and paradox of reality that is infinite
consciousness you
