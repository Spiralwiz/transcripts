hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm going to show you how to have amazing
mind-blowing sex I'm excited let's get started let's show you
how to have sex in an amazing way so that
your girl can have orgasm after orgasm after orgasm and
fall in love with you in a way that she's
never fall in love with another man in her life
so let me start off by saying that this is
a guide for men not for women there are important
tips and tricks that we can talk about for women
that will be another video but it's much more important
to discuss the technique and the proper mindsets for men
why is this because the man is the leader in
the bedroom and a lot is riding on him the
woman she flows with what the man is doing she's
following she's being submissive she's surrendering herself to the man
to you so this being the case you need to
know what you're doing you need to know how to
lead properly and you need to know how to stir
the right emotions both in you and in her to
make this a mind-blowing experience so a lot of it
really has to do with the man I would say
90% of amazing sex is about what the man is
doing and only 10% is about what the woman is
doing so if you're a man and you've never had
mind-blowing amazing sex then you're really missing out on something
and this leads me to the next point which is
why am I even talking about this topic why is
this and why is this an important topic for a
personal development why is this an important topic for men
two points really first of all is that this is
one of the best peak experiences that you will have
in life is amazing mind-blowing sex and just from the
friends that I survey from the things that I overhear
one of the things that that really blows my mind
is how bad men are in the bedroom I hear
it from women I hear from my guy friends just
by seeing the way they interact with their girlfriends and
the women that they're dating and having sex with and
I just see it by the way the guys talk
about sex I just know that they don't understand what
the hell is going on so this tells me that
that you're missing out you are missing out and your
girl is missing out so both of you are missing
out this is like a peak experience in life I
mean think about it you're on this earth for a
short period of time you want to experience everything there
is as much as you can in all the different
intensities that you can well sex especially amazing mind-blowing sex
is one of those things that I feel like a
lot of guys and girls miss out on for their
entire life I mean girls definitely miss out on it
because you can read the literature and like nearly a
third or up to 50 percent of women have difficulty
just having an orgasm a single orgasm to me that's
ridiculous that's just pathetic for me mind-blowing amazing sex means
that my girl is gonna have five to ten orgasms
per night I'm gonna have one maybe two orgasms per
night and it's not just the quantity of the orgasms
but it's also the intensity of them and the duration
and length of them so I'm talking about long deep
like mind-blowing orgasms I'm also talking about like a deep
intimate connection also if you're not so much into the
intimacy part it can be like very kinky very very
dirty type of sex so all of those components will
come into play here so this is just one of
those things that you want to experience it's kind of
like going and seeing a beautiful sunset or going seeing
the Grand Canyon that that to me is what amazing
sex is like the second point is that if you're
the guy and you're having difficulty keeping women loyal to
you if you're having difficulty keeping women in a relationship
with you if you're worrying about a woman cheating on
you this kind of stuff then I think the biggest
thing you're really missing is the x-component the amazing sex
component for me I never really have to worry about
a girl cheating on me I mean she might there's
always the chance but I don't have to worry about
it because I know that the sex that I give
her is so amazing that she can't experience that kind
of deep intimate connection with virtually anybody I'm not kidding
this is not just a subjective feeling I mean sure
she's gonna subjectively fall in love with you but it's
also beyond that it goes into the objective realm because
literally only maybe one in a thousand guys understand how
to trigger these deep orgasms and women and so what
that means is that probably if you do it to
your girlfriend or to your wife she will never again
in her life even if she has sex with 20
other guys she will never again experience the kind of
deep emotions she experiences with you during sex this is
a very powerful thing because this literally hooks women to
you like crack it makes women much more easier to
deal with it makes them fall in love with you
it eliminates the the disloyalty problems it eliminates a lot
of tension in the relationship so this can actually be
a very powerful tool and like any powerful tool can
be used both for good and for bad so be
careful I'm not advocating here that you use this to
manipulate or to trick women I'm I'm telling you to
use this for good use this to build a deep
relationship use this to get whatever like nice things you
want out of the relationship not to manipulate her to
hook her in any kind of like nefarious way so
be responsible there here's the thing to me sex is
about the mindset it's not about the techniques and as
guys we tend to be very mechanically oriented we tend
to be very logical we tend be very methodical and
so when we start talking about sex as a guy
you might start to think well just give me the
exact how-to and I'll go do it like tell me
what I should do with my fingers tell me what
I should do what kind of thrusting motion I should
do tell me what kind of take a position I
should put myself in and her that's not the important
part and that's really not where guys are screwing up
where guys are screwing up are with the mindsets and
the emotional components so in this video I'm gonna really
hammer on mindset but I'm also going to give you
some techniques and I'm going to show you exactly the
process that I go through so you can know exactly
which steps to go through in order to have an
amazing sex experience so the first and most important mindset
that you got to understand is that you have to
love to please the girl now for some guys this
might actually be kind of like a a weird notion
because we're we're told as we learn to get better
with women one of the things we're told in the
kind of the dating and attraction community is we're told
well don't supplicate to women don't be the nice guy
and that's true when you're attracting the girl but when
you're in bed with her and you want to make
an amazing experience because you're the leader you have to
have a vision for where you're leading you and her
and that's giving her amazing orgasms it's not about giving
yourself amazing orgasms sex is not about being selfish sex
is about giving your gift to the woman you're not
doing this to please her or to supplicate to her
you're really doing this because you're a masculine guy and
it feels really good for you to unleash your masculine
energy on the world and on your girl so that's
the mindset behind it to me when I get in
the bedroom it's like oh man I'm like a kid
in a candy store it's like yes yes like I
get to finally like share my gift and I get
to show how masculine I am and not in a
sense of showing off but just like a very genuine
and authentic expression of my masculinity like that's exciting to
me I love to please the girl I love the
idea that I can give her five or ten orgasms
I love the fact that I'm gonna give her the
most powerful orgasms she's ever had in her life and
that she'll never probably have again with anybody else like
I love all those components and I think that that's
that's what makes me good you know I'm not good
because I know a lot of fancy techniques and I'm
not good because I have a big dick or anything
like that it's simply because like I actually want to
get emotional I want to make the girl feel amazing
like I want excellence in the bedroom so it's kind
of like a standard that I set for myself and
you need to sit set that same standard too and
you need to bring that mindset to the bedroom because
what I find a lot of guys do is they
they just take it very mechanically and it's just about
kind of like blowing your load so you just like
get the girl in the bedroom and then you just
have sex with her and you blow your load and
when you're done that's it it's done and then you
leave like that kind of attitude with that kind of
attitude there's no amazing sex that's just blowing your load
kind of sex and the woman isn't satisfied with that
at all but more than just that like you're you're
missing out on so much as the guy too so
that's the first most important piece the next very important
piece is that you have to be out of your
head and you have to be emotionally open and vulnerable
during sex for some people this is difficult because they
have past traumatic events maybe a bad childhood or whatever
or abuse of some kind that keep them kind of
emotionally locked up I know a lot of guys sometimes
they act very stoic right that kind of a like
Schwarzenegger kind of guy with that kind of like Schwarzenegger
macho man look and he kind of behaves that way
he doesn't smile he doesn't show a lot of emotion
he's not charismatic well that doesn't work in the bedroom
in the bedroom you got to be able to really
be emotional at yourself go and you got to get
out of your head and be unselfconscious one of the
really cool things about sex is that it's really us
one of the peak flow state experiences of life a
flow State experience is an experience where you totally lose
sense of yourself because you're so absorbed in the activity
it's like when you're in that zone if you're playing
a sport or if you're at the gym or you're
killing it at work or you're playing a video game
or something that you can get in the zone where
you're not thinking about anything analytically you're just performing behaving
and enjoying and soaking it all in and it's this
magical almost spiritual experience there's a very little resistance there
and very little thinking so if you're a guy one
of the most important things is to get like the
techniques and stuff out of your head you have to
get it internalized so it's kind of like a second
nature instinct and that will come with practice and I'll
tell you more about that later but very important to
get yourself out of the head out of the head
so that you can be emotional and open you got
to understand as far as mindsets go that for women
sex what is it about it's not about the mechanics
see guys get this really really wrong and this is
why there's a lot of confusion guys think like well
to have good sex I need a big dick what's
my you know is my big is my dick big
enough to make her happy this kind of stuff you
can understand that like this stuff doesn't matter to the
woman pretty much at all at all because what she
cares about is the emotions in the sex emotions women
are emotional creatures just in their everyday lives when you
get them in the bedroom they're super emotional creatures you've
got a almost it's kind of interesting because you're going
to be dominant as you're having sex but you also
have to be emotional too so you're kind of taking
on both masculine but also kind of feminine characteristics some
of you guys who are way too serious can't put
a smile on your face like this kind of if
you're this kind of guy who can't smile can't be
emotional around a woman well in the bedroom like I
can just imagine how that scenario goes it's very stiff
and stilted and mechanical that's not what's sexist about sex
it's about emotional expression letting yourself go being vulnerable sharing
yourself first of all you got to want to do
that if you don't want to do that you think
that that's like a [ __ ] thing to do
well man you're missing out on a lot be careful
about making that kind of judgment it's not a [
__ ] thing at all the most amazing sex that
the woman's gonna experience that you're gonna experience is when
you are emotional and she's emotional I'm gonna show you
how to do it in a very masculine way so
don't be worried about that but do understand like the
foundation of where amazing sex is coming from like I
really want to stress understanding the foundation so that these
kind of things about like your dick size you don't
even enter into your head because dick size that has
to do with emotions that's a purely visual and like
a little bit of a mechanical type of thing another
thing you gotta really understand about women a woman's deepest
fantasy do you know what that is is to be
in deep emotional intimacy with her man very important deep
emotional intimacy with her man every word of that phrase
is very important with her man that means with you
right she chose you she doesn't want to have sex
with any random guy she's not like a guy she's
actually interested in you like she wants you and your
personality to be the thing that [ __ ] her
that's basically what she wants she wants that intimacy she
wants to feel like she's your girl she wants to
be able to surrender to you she wants to be
penetrated by you not just physically but also emotionally and
the physical part that's not the important part she has
a guy you think like well I'll just penetrate her
physically no that's not the most important part to her
the emotional component is even more important than the physical
component because any guy can penetrate her physically but only
her man the one that she fought wants to fall
in love with can penetrate her emotionally in the ways
that she wants and the second component here is really
she wants to be dominated if she's feminine in your
masculine and you're playing that dynamic what creates that kind
of sizzle and creates those that chemistry those electric sparks
that fly between you two that kind of like amazing
connection that's created by the tension between these polar opposites
of masculine and feminine masculine is about penetrating feminine is
about absorbing and and receiving and surrendering that's the dynamic
you got to understand there there's two super critical components
of sex to amazing sex they're very easy to remember
and I'm gonna actually have a whole video after this
one that's gonna tell you how to build up both
of these components so the first pillar is intimacy right
we already talked about a little bit intimacy you need
to you need to convey a lot of intimacy in
the way that you're having sex the second pillar is
dominance you need to be dominant in the way you're
having sex so that you impose yourself on the girl
the girl is able to surrender to you by the
way if you're wondering like well what about some sort
of role-playing where the guy is the one that that's
being kind of dominated the girl is a dominatrix that's
more like kinky style sex you know there's a lot
of different various types of sex and very weird types
of sex I'm not getting into that here I'm just
covering basic vanilla type of sex it's gonna be amazing
and mind-blowing but you know it does assume that the
guy is the masculine one and the dominant one and
the girl is the feminine one this is going to
be true for 90% of men and women this dynamic
will work well for maybe 10 or 5% of the
population you know they're into some other kind of stuff
so we're talking about heterosexual traditional type of sex here
so what I want to do now is I want
to go through my process I actually shot this video
already this my second time shooting this video and that's
because as I shot the first one I saw that
even though I was telling you all the little techniques
and tricks it wasn't good enough because I felt like
you weren't gonna get the whole sense of how I
make sex amazing for my girl and for me so
what I want to do instead is I want to
take you through the process of literally how I would
seduce a girl have sex with her from beginning to
end so you can just see and as we're going
through the process I'm going to pause and I'm gonna
highlight different tips and tricks that you can use for
yourself now one thing to remember about this is that
one very important component of sex is just a variety
right you don't wanna be having sex the same way
all the time so what I'm talking about here is
I'm kind of giving you a very basic blueprint and
they'll work really well but you don't want to always
be doing it exactly this way what you'll be doing
is you'll be kind of taking this blueprint and you'll
be adding your own little twists and turns and you'll
be experimenting you know by yourself and with your girl
so let's get started so the first thing that we
got to mention before we even get into sex is
number be clean clean yourself girls are usually pretty good
at this guys sometimes not so much right a woman
likes a nice-looking clean-shaven well-groomed man and also nice smelling
man smell are really important to women so make sure
that you take frequent showers make sure that before sex
you go and you wash your private parts wash your
dick wash your balls trim down there don't have a
bush down there don't make it ugly make it nice
and trim you should have just like a little bit
of hair not a lot just a little bit so
that the woman feels comfortable going down on you you
feel comfortable yourself also trimming makes your dick look longer
so there's you know multiple nice things about that be
clean if you're going to have sex in the evening
and you showered in the morning that's not sufficient you're
gonna have to go wash up before you have sex
so a lot of times what I do is if
we're making out and I know that no sex is
coming before we start getting to the heavy foreplay what
I'll do is I'll just I'll just go to the
bathroom sometimes I'll tell her hey I'm gonna go wash
up or sometimes I'll just say hey no I'm just
going to the bathroom she's not really gonna care in
fact what you'll probably want to do is after you
go to the bathroom you come back and you tell
her hey go wash up and she'll go do it
right women are usually pretty good about washing up but
sometimes they have a smell down there or whatever to
be safe go to go wash up and if there's
a specific problem that you've had with her in the
past tell her to go wash up it's really simple
the second thing before you start sex is make sure
you've got condoms condoms and make sure that they're located
right near the sex location so near your bed in
the bed stand is the best thing make sure the
box is open it's not like a plastic wrapped or
something because you have to go get scissors to open
it up or something like that just you know open
the box make sure that they're handy also have two
condoms as guys one of the really good things we
should be doing I hope you have this habit carry
out a condom in your wallet right a lot of
guys do that that's smart because you never know you
might need one well what I do nowadays is I
carry two condoms in my wallet I find this is
actually very important for a couple of reasons reason number
one is that if you go you know you're going
out partying or whatever you have sex someplace that's not
your home so you're gonna need at least one but
then what if you have sex with there on the
condom breaks or the condom slips off falls on the
floor or something like that that's going to be a
very bad experience for you because you're gonna have this
hot girl there ready for sex and you're not gonna
have a condom so what's gonna happen is that either
you're gonna disappoint her on yourself or you're gonna have
sex with her unprotected so don't do that very dangerous
the second thing is that if you have sex with
her at night and then you're gonna sleep with her
in the same bed and then you're gonna wake up
in the morning together you're probably gonna want to have
sex with her again and again if you only had
one condom you've already used it so then you're out
of luck and then again what are you gonna really
trust yourself to not have sex with this hot girl
that's lying in your bed that really wants you just
because you don't have a condom you probably will have
sex with her unprotected so again watch out for that
so carry two condoms okay the next tip I'm going
to give you is we already mentioned this but sex
is not about blowing your load all right get that
out of your mind sex it's not about blowing your
load sex is about making for me sex is about
making her feel the most amazing experience you could ever
feel in her life to me it's like sharing my
gift with this girl that's what it's like for me
I want you to really adopt that mindset because honestly
the reason I like to talk about mindsets here is
because the mindset fixes a lot of the technique problems
automatically see if your mind said going into the bedrooms
I'm going to blow my load then you're gonna do
all the wrong things and you're gonna have to remember
all these counter techniques to fix those wrong things that's
just a bad way to go instead come in with
the right mindset I'm there to really please the girl
I really love to please the girl with that mindset
everything else will come into place and you'll even innovate
your own strategies and techniques along the way all right
so you really have to slow down slow down when
you're having sex this is where this mindset is very
important have to love to please the girl to do
that you have to slow down if your mindset is
about blowing your lower then it's just like you know
quick and dirty and then get it in and out
kind of situation so let me start talking about how
actually do it so for me the best way is
you know I've got the girl let's say she comes
over to my house or to my apartment and she's
there I'm with her in the count on the on
the couch in the living room and I know I
want to have sex with her and so I you
know I start to amp things up usually what that
means is you sit next to her you start kind
of playing her poking her putting your hands on her
that kind of stuff I can start with some playful
type of physical contact then you want to start to
get it to kissing kissing and really making out making
out on the couch that's like one of my favorite
things and when you're making out make sure to take
it nice and slow and make sure that you really
spend your time there I can spend 15 to 20
minutes just making out with the girl that alone right
there we'll get her super aroused and really excited for
you sex really good sex is about arousal and teasing
and then only later comes the climax and the satisfaction
of the stuff that you were teasing so it's really
about being very good at foreplay in teasing I'm gonna
show you how to do just that so what I
do is I start kissing her all right kids are
nice and soft nice and slow you can vary it
up you can kiss her gently on the lips you
can kiss her a little harder you can use a
little more tongue you can bite her bottom lip you
can right bite her top lip you can put your
tongue in her mouth move it around the corners of
her mouth and the different lip there's a lip slips
that she's got so you can do that the other
thing you can do is you can start kissing her
face or you can start kissing her neck area women
are really really turned on when they get touched or
kissed on the neck as you're doing that you also
want to incorporate your hands so part of this thing
about being dominant is putting your hands on her that
means to her that that's like she's being controlled and
taken by you so you know put your hands on
her hips put your hands on her breasts this is
still she's still clothed we're assuming both you still clothed
you're just on the couch making out but you can
already start rubbing her and kind of groping her and
caressing her and fondling her you could also take her
hands put them in your hands this kind of stuff
so just like slowly start really slowly building it up
building it up building it up another really nice technique
is that as you build it up you do something
really hot and sexy maybe you kiss her on the
neck but then you pull back and you just start
going back to the kind of like kissing her on
the mouth kind of thing just not as erotic then
maybe can go back to the neck and if you
can go a little bit towards the breast and then
you go back to the mouth so this builds up
like anticipation within her it makes her feel kind of
tingly like like there's like this kind of like kinetic
energy in the air like something's gonna happen she's not
quite sure what is exciting right you want to really
build up that excitement within her so start making out
with her as you're making out a really cool thing
that you can do I really have to do this
is what you do both of you are still clothed
but you take your shirt and you lift it up
so that your stomach area is exposed about around your
belly button area and then you do the same for
her and as you're making out maybe she's lying on
top of you or you're lying on top of her
what you do is you just expose both your stomachs
and you push them together so there's a feeling of
like connection and warmth between you and her but your
clothes are still on and you're just making out with
her and you do it in a way where it's
really not obvious what exactly you did so you know
what you did but she's not really quite sure but
she's just going along with the with the ride and
she's feeling very intimate and she's feeling you really turned
on because like she gets the sensation as though you're
inside her but you're not really so it's a really
good way to kind of foreshadow what's coming next so
just like middle stuff like this and so just keep
building it up this way the next thing that's really
important is eye contact you need to have powerful seductive
intimate and dominant sorts of eye contact when you're having
sex this is really important for women looking into the
guy's eyes this is how she knows that she can
trust you this is how she knows that she's safe
with you this is how she knows if she has
an intimate connection with you you should also feel that
with your girl - so when you're kissing her you
know take time to kiss kiss kiss then pull back
and just kind of like admire her and look lovingly
in her eyes just like very kind of like sweetly
as though she you think she's adorable she's beautiful you
don't need to say anything you can just look in
her eyes and she'll know it she'll feel it that's
kind of an intimate type of look you can also
give her a more dominance I'm gonna [ __ ]
you kind of look right so the intimate look it's
just kind of like you know you're like looking really
adoringly at her the dominant look is you're looking at
her kind of like you want to kill her so
it's more like you know like you're giving her kind
of like a stern really serious look don't take it
over the top you don't want to come off like
some rapists creepy seal your killer kind of guy remember
that she has to feel safe with you throughout this
whole process so it's not about any anything like that
but like it's kind of like she knows that you're
gonna take her and you're gonna [ __ ] her
brains out that kind of look so give her that
one too and you can kind of vary those around
so I'll be doing this I'll be making out with
her of course after that you know after a while
of doing that then you start slowly pulling up the
shirts and pulling down the pants and just like slowly
taking off layers of clothes you do it for yourself
you can do it for her girls really find it
hot when the guy takes off his shirt especially if
you got some muscles going that's really nice so go
ahead and do that that's gonna turn her on both
visually but also she can kind of feel you and
touch you the next thing after that is you know
you try to undress her as much as you can
at that point what you might do since you're still
in the living room is you might like take her
by the hand and then lead her to the bedroom
if you want to have sex in the bedroom so
that's actually really nice because what that's showing is that
you're commanding and you're leading and she loves to follow
so that's that's the perfect frame so let's say you
take her by the hand and you walk her and
let's say she still has her underwear on but you
took off all her clothes the rest of them and
you and you've still got maybe your underwear on you're
otherwise naked so you now you lead her to the
bedroom you lie on the bed at this point what
I like to do is you know we've already made
out we've done a little bit of erotic touching now
we talk we start to get into the really like
very erotic touching this is where you can get so
much mileage so much excitement built up and I feel
like a lot of guys miss out on this what
you do is you use your fingertips and you use
your hands and you use your lips and your tongue
and your mouth to basically touch and caress and massage
and kiss up and down to her entire body literally
from fingers to toes and everything in between except you
don't go near her vagina and you don't touch the
nipples so you avoid the money areas you save those
for last this is what builds up enormous anticipation within
her gets her super wet super excited makes her nipples
super hard so what you do is you start from
the most non-sexual areas and then you move closer and
closer towards the most sexual areas so what would that
mean that means you know start around her face kiss
and touch her face you can hold her face in
your hands all that stuff is great let's say she's
lying on the bed what I would do is I
would actually tell her to lie on her on her
stomach on the bed and just kind of lie back
and let me do the work and at that point
what I would do is I would sit on my
knees on the mattress and I would get to work
and I start kissing her hands her arms her elbows
this area right here the inner elbow part is very
sensitive you can kiss on that you can lick on
it you can suck on it you can touch it
with your fingertips and just move through the arms because
the arms are very non-sexual so the arms are really
great to start with you can also do the legs
start at the bottom of the legs so start near
the feet and then moved up the calves and up
the thighs the inner thighs are extremely sensitive and very
erotic and sexual so I would save those for a
little bit later delay on those a bit start kissing
around the butt cheek area that's also very sensitive but
you can do that you can kiss her sides you
can kiss her back you can kiss you can kiss
on a stomach which is also very erotic and sexual
you can also kiss around the breasts and you can
kiss on the breasts under the breasts over the nipples
but avoid the nipples that's going to make her super
like eager for you so basically do the kissing and
you can do different types of kissing you can do
little like little pecs like like this you can also
do very big sloppy wet kisses and you can do
them quickly or you can do them slowly so a
big like slow sloppy wet kiss would be like like
that and like you get it really sloppy and wet
and after you do that kind of kiss another cool
trick you can do is you can kind of blow
on that area that's still wet after you kissed it
so you kiss like this and then you just go
like that you blow on it that can feel really
good and it just like it's that like little extra
touch that most guys would never put into the technique
you can also do two types of blowing you can
do a faraway kind of blowing which is cold like
like this this will cool her body you can also
do a kind of about a really warm kind of
moist blowing which is like you get your mouth really
open wide not narrow and then you blow you just
kind of like breed on her and you come really
close to her skin so it's like this it basically
gets her kind of moist and warm so you can
vary between all those another really great thing that I'll
do is I'll really use my fingertips to powerful effect
you can do a lot of things here you can
use your hands you can use your whole finger you
can use the pads of your fingertips and you can
also use the very tips you can even use the
nails so all of these can be used in various
different techniques so one thing that I really love to
do is I love to use the tip of my
fingertips and I'll just run them along her body and
I'll start without even touching her body I'll get really
close to her skin and what I'll do is I'll
just trigger the hairs on her skin right just the
hairs not even her skin but just the hairs which
makes her like get these little goose bumps makes her
really excited then I'll get a little bit deeper and
I'll she's struck to touch just very like gently just
like caress with the fingertips you can do that and
you can do that in all different places on the
body then you can get more like a massage going
where you're actually like putting pressure slow pressure into it
you can also use your fingernails to kind of do
a little bit of like a scratching motion gently so
you're not hurting her with the mouth we talked about
the different types of kissing you can do but you
can also use your tongue your tongue you can use
the whole tongue like very wide you can also use
the tip of your tongue like this just to kind
circle it around a little bit and you can also
come in a lot of contact with the skin or
just like a little bit of contact where you're grazing
so you always want to start off slow and light
and then go heavier that's the idea the idea is
that you're ramping slowly upward right slowly upward so start
with very light touching then go heavier and heavier and
heavier if she's getting more and more excited for you
so this touching is like super important and as you're
doing this I would also start to give her a
little bit more of a preview of what's happening next
so I would take my hands I'd put them on
the really inside of her thighs very sensitive I start
to like squeeze that I also love to take my
hand put it on her tummy the area just a
couple of inches below her bellybutton put my hand there
and just kind of like put pressure and put warmth
on her tummy cuz to her that's like you know
she knows what's coming you're gonna be inside her she
wants that preview of the fact that you gonna be
inside her and like that's super deep like intimate inside
you kind of feeling so all of that is great
you can experiment around and just try all sorts of
different stuff the next thing is dirty talk dirty talk
is super important in fact I'm gonna shoot a whole
video on dirty talk because it's a I think it's
an important topic and there's a lot of different things
that you could say I will actually want to give
you a lot of examples in that video here I'm
just going to give you a very couple of examples
I find that most people don't do dirty talk and
the first time you try to do it it feels
a little bit on I think this is why most
people don't do dirty talk because when they first tried
it feels like kind of oh man this is too
dirty it's kind of embarrassing it's kind of shameful like
you got to throw all that out the window in
fact dirty talk is one of the coolest things about
sex I love dirty talk so much to me it's
like man like I take it to an art form
like during the day I will think of dirty stuff
to say to my girl at night all right I
really love to do dirty talk and it wasn't always
that way I had to kind of train myself up
for it what does dirty talk mean and when should
you do it really you should start doing it from
the point where you start making out with her and
you're thinking of having sex with her so you know
start foreshadowing the kind of things that are gonna happen
and there's really two different types one type of dirty
talk is the more intimate type of dirty talk and
then the other type of dirty talk is the more
dominant so the more intimate type of dirty talk might
be something like baby you know I love you so
much like that kind of thing another thing is like
baby I just want to undress you and like eat
you up from head to toe that kind of stuff
the more dom and type of dirty talk is kind
of like you might be like rubbing her tummy and
then you tell her something like i'm gonna stick my
dick inside of there or I'm gonna nail you to
the bed or I'm gonna nail your ass to the
wall or it might be something like you're gonna be
my dirty little slight tonight right I'll give you more
examples as we go on and also in the special
dirty talk video but basically you start telling your dirty
things you start building the canet the intimate connection between
you two you can ask her questions you can give
her dominant commands you can tell her exactly what you've
gone to do to her five minutes from now so
you can tell her how you're gonna [ __ ]
her you can tell her the ways in which you
want to [ __ ] her you can get very
graphic and very detailed or you can use kind of
innuendo so that's up to you the really important thing
is the teasing right so for example the way that
I'll tease is like you can take a finger tip
just like lick it make it wet and then you
can rub it around nipple just like around the edge
of her nipple and just I keep doing that for
a minute and then like she by that point she
really wants you to touch her nipple but you don't
do it you look your finger again and you go
on to the other nipple and then maybe after you
do that what you do is you blow a little
bit on the nipples just like uh like this like
this by that time she's so excited for you and
at that point what I'll probably do is I'll actually
you know you want to you want to actually resolve
the excitement so at that point you actually like take
and start touching the nipples touch the nipples suck on
the nipples that usually gets a girl really really wet
and excited so at this point you know she's super
excited she's super aroused she's probably never been this aroused
by any guy in her life like very few guys
go to all this length this might take you thirty
to sixty minutes to do this whole process and that's
great you should be having sex for sixty minutes to
two hours that's how long your sex should be you
should not be having any sex that's less than sixty
minutes that's not sex that's a that's very rushed ridiculous
sex so notice that just slowing everything down that will
get you so much so now when this is all
done she's really excited for me she's begging me she's
begging me to be inside her I can actually ask
her I can actually make her beg and I'll do
that sometimes because it's a very dominant thing I'll say
I'll say something like baby beg for my dick inside
you all right something like that and then she'll beg
and if she doesn't beg in the way that I
want or if I don't sense that it's sincere enough
or if I don't sense that she's horny enough then
I'll just all back off and I'll say am I
gonna [ __ ] you or you know just kind
of like play with her a little bit make her
really play into it make her beg make her want
to be [ __ ] and she knows what's going
on so she's gonna play into it like it's it's
great for both of you after this point what I
would get into is some fingering so she's really excited
at this point what you do you get you get
your fingers you get them wet she should be already
super wet now you take your finger start with one
finger start rubbing it around like her crotch and inside
the the lips of the vagina and just start rubbing
it around rubbing around you can rub her [ __
] experiment around how you do that and of course
the really key thing that you're building up to is
the actual point at which you penetrate her with with
your fingers I'm not even talking about your dick yet
so just with your fingers that point I'll build up
to it for a long time so I'll rub you
know I'll rub all around her lips and her Clint
and get her really really wet really excited I can
feel how wet she is on my fingers and then
what I do is I'll take my middle finger and
I'll take the kind of the pad of my middle
finger and I'll move it down from the [ __
] and from the lips more towards the actual hole
and what I'll do at that point is I'll just
kind of like glide it over the hole and I'll
kind of like also I'll be looking at her so
usually the way it is that she's next to me
her face is next to mine I might be kissing
her her legs are open were lying on the bed
and my hand is between her legs and I'm doing
the fingering but my attention isn't on the fingering I'm
not looking at that I'm looking at her that's what
builds that intimate connection so at that point I'll really
want her to beg me to penetrate her with my
finger and I'll really tease her what I'll do is
I'll take my pad of my finger and like if
this is the hole then I'll just I'll just like
very lightly rub it right around the rims of the
hole and then just kind of like press on it
a little bit so my tip is maybe going in
just like a little tiny bit at this point she
should be so excited that her hips her whole butt
and hip part of the body will be moving towards
your finger because she's like gonna want to penetrate herself
on your finger and what you can do is you
can actually pull the finger away and you can tell
her uh-uh-uh don't be a bad girl so you just
like you play with her you toy with her after
a while of course once she's super excited then you
you got a fulfill on your promise put your finger
in there start fingering her learn where the g-spot is
the g-spot is inside the upper wall about one inch
in it has a little bit of a different texture
to it so you can rub the g-spot you can
also go deeper all the way outside I find that
girls love it when it's even deeper than the g-spot
and just kind of basically rub your finger and move
it around and swirl it around and curl it you
can pump it there's different things you can do in
fact I have a really great video called how to
make a girl squirt which goes a lot more into
how to do a really powerful fingering technique so you
might want to check that out start with one finger
then after she's really excited I'll I'll use the second
finger as well so two fingers is this your middle
and your ring finger that's the squirting technique but you
don't have to make her squirt with that you can
just make her [ __ ] the trick here is
that your fingering her and now she's so excited that
it's gonna be very easy for her to come she's
gonna come very quickly it might take you two minutes
of pumping like this and she'll be she'll be melting
all over you so this is really cool and I
want to make her [ __ ] with my fingers
in fact sometimes I'll make her [ __ ] twice
with my fingers before I've even penetrated her but always
at least once to me this is cool for a
couple of reasons one is that it kind of takes
pressure off me you know as the guide there's a
lot of pressure on us to make the girl come
I feel like if I can get at least one
orgasm in for the girl you know at least like
now I know she's satisfied even if we stop at
that point I know she's already gonna be fairly satisfied
with me that takes more you know a little bit
of the pressure off me so this is nice another
good thing about this is that you know sometimes you're
gonna come very quickly sometimes it's hard to tell whether
you're going to come fast tonight or you're gonna you
know take longer to come and so I don't want
to disappoint the girl by sticking my dick in there
and then coming a minute later and not having her
orgasm so that would be a letdown so what I
want to do is I just want to make her
[ __ ] with my fingers once twice even do
it more don't worry about her getting finished or somehow
exhausting herself women can have unlimited numbers of orgasms they're
not like guys this is a very cool thing you
can give them literally an unlimited number of orgasms it's
amazing it's amazing way you can do 10 orgasms that's
not nearly the end of it that's just the beginning
so she's not gonna get exhausted from one or two
orgasms so make her [ __ ] with your fingers
at that point she's gonna be super eager for you
to be inside her she's gonna tell you she's gonna
be clawing at you she's gonna be clawing at your
dick right so this is great and just a side
note sometimes in some my other videos I would tell
guys that I make a girl come five to ten
times and they would be saying like Leo how do
you do that that sounds like you're doing something amazing
you have some amazing dick or something like that no
it's not it's it's very simple actually look here's how
it works you make her [ __ ] twice with
your fingers then she spreads her legs you start having
sex with her you have sex with her and you
make her [ __ ] twice with your dick that's
also not that hard you know I come pretty quickly
it doesn't take me that long to come especially like
if I'm really into it there's a lot of emotion
going on I can come very quickly but still you
can kind of use you know you can use the
muscles like around your dick to kind of hold it
in hold it back you can also use little techniques
to delay so maybe you're having sex with her in
one position and you're getting really close to come then
you can pull out change positions and by that point
you're not ready to come anymore then you can go
do it some more that you can change positions again
and again and just kind of like rotate stuff around
like that maybe you can go down on her she
goes down on you so you can alternate so you
how you give her two orgasms with your dick then
after you come inside her or you come outside her
however you want then that's all ready for orgasms you've
given her you can do two more orgasms with your
fingers so that's six orgasms right there and that's a
pretty simple process to go through every single time there's
no there's really no reason that you shouldn't be able
to do that the only question is do you want
to are you gonna take the time to do it
this comes back to the original mindset right do you
love to please the girl I do that's why my
sex is amazing the question is do you want to
adopt that mindset I really encourage you to adopt it
so anyways going back so she's been fingered now you
have sex with her there's all the different positions you
can go study them pick up a book whatever pretty
simple right missionary doggy style basic stuff you can also
throw her on the on the coffee table on the
kitchen counter you can have her leaning up against a
wall that's really hot and sexy and dominant so there's
all the different positions you can try try to delay
your own orgasm because as soon as you come that's
pretty much it it's over at least for the penetration
component you could still finger her a little bit after
that but it's gonna end pretty quick so try to
delay yours as much as you can if you have
premature ejaculation issues that will be a topic for another
video I'm not gonna discuss that here so basically what
I'm going to do is I'm going to [ __
] her when I'm [ __ ] her really important
I contact in those positions that you can so if
it's a missionary lots of eye contact that's why missionary
is so great if it's doggy style that's more of
a dominant position there try to be more dominant you
know spanker you can you can kind of throw her
around a little bit on the bed you can grab
her hips I love to grab the hips and kind
of pull them towards me or kind of move them
around it shows that I'm kind of controlling her and
then of course as you're doing all that the way
that I like to have sex is it's all building
up towards my climax right that's the hottest thing for
her is when I come inside her that's them that's
the most like an orgasm where you come inside the
girl whether you're using a condom or not that's that's
the best if you're not using a condom that's like
even ten times better so her orgasm is gonna be
the most powerful when you come with her in her
and she wants to come with you so you two
are gonna really synchronize when you come inside her I
almost find that almost always the girl starts coming no
matter where she is in her orgasm she'll start coming
again and again and again you want to get pretty
good at being able to like pound her without coming
yourself so there's like certain angles in certain positions that
you can find where you know it feels good for
you but it doesn't feel amazing for you but it
still feels amazing for her so find those positions that
allows you to have like you know the penetrating motion
without making you come so fast and stay away from
the ones that make you come so fast keep those
for later but ultimately my sex you know I'm talking
dirty to her the whole time I'm saying intimate things
to her the whole time I'm telling her throughout the
whole thing that I'm gonna [ __ ] inside her
how amazing it's gonna be how dirty it's gonna be
how much of a [ __ ] she is you
know how much you love her if you're on in
loving relationship in your your on that term basis where
you're saying I love you you know say that to
her too and then finally you're going to come inside
her or wherever and you can finger her somewhere after
that and then you two are done now what's really
important is the after sex component don't forget this a
lot of guys forget this you can build a lot
of intimacy and allow loyalty from your girl she can
really fall in love with you after the sex is
done and that's through the cuddling and what you do
after sex don't fall asleep after sex that's pathetic don't
fall asleep after sex and don't just go silent either
and stare at the ceiling like what I like to
do is after sex I like to pull her really
close I like to cuddle her you know tell her
how amazing it is you can caress her body you
can just kind of like look lovingly in her eyes
you know all that kind of lovey-dovey stuff do that
like you will not believe how much kudo points that
gets you from a girl plus you should like this
too it's amazing to me this after sex cuddling thing
it's almost as good as the sex itself in fact
sometimes it's even better it's like because you're it's so
relaxing you've got all the chemicals kind of flowing out
of your body like it feels amazing and now you've
got this beautiful girl next to you so like take
that time to build up that connection that's really cool
and that's pretty much it that's the whole process alright
so we covered a lot of stuff here and actually
I'm gonna like I said have that second part to
the video we're just going to tell you how to
be more intimate and how to be more dominant how
to work on both those I'm gonna give you very
practical things that you can do so that's gonna give
you even more techniques the question now is how do
you actually learn all this because you know there's a
lot of different stuff we covered and remember that component
about not being in your head well if you go
into the bedroom and you try to do all this
stuff that I told you in the exact same sequence
what's gonna happen you're gonna you're gonna ruin the sex
because it's not going to be spontaneous and natural what
I want you to do instead is the following I
want you to focus on three core principles three mindsets
which will help a lot of the techniques fall into
place naturally one is I love to please the girl
two is I love to be masculine and three is
that excellence in sex is very important to me we
won the video review those points those three principles integrate
those into your mind visualize and make sure that you
really believe them that you really want them from this
all the rest will tend to fall into place the
other thing I really encourage you to do is read
and buy books on sex there's a ton of them
out there you can find stuff online you can take
video courses there's ebooks there's products all this great stuff
so make sure to to dig into it study it
studying sex is important it's cool there's nothing weird about
it next is porn most of you guys probably watch
a ton of porn anyways but you know what there's
actually bad porn and good porn good porn is I
mean like porn where you can actually learn techniques you
can see cool stuff happening like you can see that
the male guy who was having sex with the girl
he's like he's performing in an amazing way so make
sure you find those porn take mental notes when you
watch that porn and see oh he's doing this that's
cool I want to do that with my girl or
oh she's doing that maybe I'll tell my girl to
do that so you know get a lot of ideas
from porn find what you find the most sexy from
porn and then incorporate that into your routine of course
try to integrate one piece at a time you're not
going to do it all at once if you've never
had sex before you're not gonna be able to go
and do all this at once you know just start
with the very basics maybe you want to focus on
kissing and touching and teasing maybe start with that then
maybe you want to move on to a little bit
of dirty talk spend a couple of nights just practicing
dirty talk then a couple of nights later maybe you're
gonna try some spanking some other stuff so just like
slowly incorporate and sprinkle this stuff in that's going to
be the best way to do it and ultimately what
we're talking about here is practice practice practice and the
best way to do that is not through one-night stands
but through getting a girlfriend if you want to get
really good at sex what you need is you need
some of that you'd have sex with consistently frequently lots
of times and you can also build up the intimacy
so one of the reasons I find that guy is
actually I know a lot of guys who have had
sex with lots of girls I mean guys who have
had like sex with 100 girls 200 girls 300 girls
but these guys can be bad with girls in the
bedroom they can be bad at sex because a lot
of the girls that they're having sex with these are
one-night stands one-night stands tend to be the lowest quality
sex that's another thing it's like a one-night stand sure
it can be exciting because it's like a very you
know new strange person strange situation it's exciting but also
you can't really get deep with that person you're using
a condom with that person you're a little bit of
afraid of you know where that person's been or what
they're doing you're you guys are not in sync with
each other you might have you might you don't really
know that person too well you don't know they're kissing
style you don't know what kind of sex they like
or don't like so the best way get a girlfriend
you know be with her if you want to be
with her forever fine if you want to be with
her for six to 12 months be with her pert
will 6 or 12 months have sex with her a
lot as you're having sex with her what you do
is you go back to this video and every time
you have sex before you have sex you watch this
video again you take notes and you find ok what's
that one thing from everything that Leo talked about that
I'm going to incorporate this night and then you go
and you do it so maybe tonight it's gonna be
dirty talk next week it's gonna be spanking next week
it's gonna be something else and so over the course
of like 6 to 12 months I found you can
get really good at sex just with one girl because
you're having stuff continuously but you gotta you got to
not go you know fly by the seat of your
pants you have to actually put a little bit of
like Saint thought into the way that you're having sex
so prepare beforehand if I find that if you do
this you know it's a little bit unnatural and mechanical
at first it seems like well sex sex should be
so simple I shouldn't be studying how to have sex
you know what don't take that attitude take this attitude
I'm gonna study how to have sex with the next
six to twelve months but then I'm gonna be like
a sex God a sex machine I'm gonna be so
good that we're gonna be falling in love with me
every single time and at that point it's gonna be
so flew it's so natural so easy that I'm not
gonna need to remember any of these techniques I can
throw away my notes it's all gonna be up here
and honestly it will be because sex is a very
natural thing and you don't need that much experience to
get good if you have sex 20 times 30 times
40 times and you incorporate all the stuff I told
you you will become extremely good and you will be
in the top 1% of all guys on the entire
planet and women will love you for it do not
mistake how much women love sex women love deep dirty
intimate sex more than guys do because there are very
emotional creatures they need it more than guys do guys
we like to bust our nuts women they like that
deep emotional connection so take the time give it to
them you're gonna feel great she's gonna feel great it's
gonna be a win-win for everybody and use this new
developed skill of yours responsibly all right this is Leo
