            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mnn0IU0-atg' target='_blank'>Outrageous Experiments In Consciousness - 30 Awakenings In 30 Days</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Expanding Consciousness through Psychedelics</b>: Leo Gura conducted a 30-day retreat of isolation in which he experimented with psychedelics, specifically 5-MeO-DMT, every day to explore their potential and reach deeper levels of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Contradicting Established Spiritual Teachings</b>: The experiences and insights he gained during the retreat are radical and might contradict established spiritual teachings. Despite this, Leo felt it was important to share his experiences authentically for the search for truth.
</li><li><b>The Journey to Awakening</b>: Leo went into the retreat following a series of profound awakenings that hinted at deeper levels of consciousness that he had not experienced before. These awakenings have made him skeptical of the levels of awakening claimed by other spiritual teachers and urged him to explore on his own. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Reality</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of individual journey, questioning the validity of scriptures, books, gurus, and teachings, and exploring truth solo for a deeper understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Integrating the Experience</b>: After the retreat, he took several weeks off to integrate, digest and understand his experiences better. The profound levels of consciousness accessed during the retreat were paradigm-shattering, causing him to still reel from them. 
</li><li><b>Caution for Viewers</b>: Leo cautions viewers that he will be using well-known spiritual terms such as God, love, consciousness, enlightenment, and awakening, but there are different degrees and levels to these concepts based on personal experience. He encourages an open mind and personal interpretation of his experiences.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Awakening Depths</b>: Leo Gura discusses that a profound awakening does not stop at a certain level; it becomes deeper and deeper with time. He conducts a 30-day retreat to validate his intuition and comes to understand that the levels of awakening he experiences exceed teachings he has received from spiritual teachers, affirming that it is easy to fall into a spiritual ego trip where you may consider yourself 'better' than other spiritualists.
</li><li><b>Deeper Understanding of God</b>: Leo insightfully addresses that often spiritual teachings focus on emptiness, nothingness, or self-realization, but it hardly explores the core understanding of what God truly is. He argues that most awakened individuals might not fully understand what God is, making them less 'awake'. This realization propels him further into understanding God and reality better and deeper. He states that while the mind is limited, consciousness is capable of infinite understanding and complete comprehension of reality.
</li><li><b>Breaking through into Telepathy</b>: On his journey exploring consciousness, Leo has awakenings that lead him to experience telepathy. His increased consciousness allows every point in space to interconnect and communicate with itself. This, according to Leo Gura, is a truly profound and shocking mystical experience that feels like a universal communication system has turned on.
</li><li><b>Concept of Consciousness Connectivity</b>: Leo acknowledges the average human mind's fragmented and divided state of consciousness where communication happens indirectly and requires mechanisms like emails. However, with higher consciousness, scores of distinctions evaporate, and instead of being separate, every part of consciousness starts connecting, interacting, and communicating with itself. He labels this phenomenon as 'telepathy' or 'omniscience'.
</li><li><b>Radical Possibility of Telepathic Communication</b>: Leo Gura discusses the possibility of telepathic communication, stating that it would be possible if one can fully realize and accept that all beings are the same. He posits that the separation experienced by humans (believing that there is a you and a me) is imagined, causing the communication process to be indirect. Humans create barriers such as distance, time, and technological devices, which manifest as obstacles for communication. However, if one realizes the oneness of all beings, communication becomes instant. Gura clarifies that although he talks about this state of consciousness, he himself is not in this state. He suggests that achieving this level of interconnected consciousness would allow individuals to download skills and experiences directly from others. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in Attaining Superhuman Levels of Consciousness</b>: Gura explains that the someone in a high state of consciousness can instantly download skills and experiences from another. However, he notes that it's not as simple as taking a psychedelic like 5-MeO to achieve such a state, as it involves engineering the neurotransmitters in an individual's brain. He also challenges the idea that constant enlightenment is the real level of consciousness, stating that he has experienced states of consciousness that one cannot exist in constantly. He suggests these levels of consciousness are superhuman, and are challenging to reach through traditional methods like meditation or self-inquiry. Only exceptional, highly conscious individuals might be able to reach these levels without psychedelic substances. 
</li><li><b>Differences Between Average Spiritual Seekers and Fully Awakened Individuals</b>: Gura suggests that the average spiritual seeker or teacher will not reach the superhuman states of consciousness he discusses. He points out that many do not even acknowledge these states' existence since they cannot sustain them. According to Gura, simple self-inquiry or just being present will not result in accessing these heightened consciousness states. He emphasizes that to achieve these states, one might need an upgrade of neurotransmitters in their brain, indicating a need for methods beyond traditional spiritual practices. 
</li><li><b>Possibility of Consciousness Downloading</b>: Gura presents the notion of consciousness downloading, where individuals can instantly acquire skills and experiences from others. This concept goes beyond the bounds of physical laws and conventional understanding, but Gura suggests it might be possible in a heightened state of consciousness where one realizes complete oneness with another. He admits that he has not fully succeeded in doing this but opens the concept as a potential consequence of heightened consciousness states. However, Gura emphasizes the importance of remaining conscious of individual limitations and the challenges associated with achieving such a level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Exploration of Beauty and Desire</b>: Leo Gura shares his experiences of developing an appreciation for the beauty of female bodies, which he believes is a mix of basic horny behavior and an appreciation for aesthetic beauty. He believes this appreciation is in some ways a more spiritual aspect of his personal journey.
</li><li><b>Experiences on 5-MeO-DMT</b>: While in a heightened state of infinite consciousness on 5-MeO-DMT, Leo viewed images of beautiful women's bodies and felt profound emotions, recognizing that he created and imagined all the beautiful bodies he was seeing. He suggests that one can only truly understand the depth of such beauty while under the influence of a psychedelic drug like 5-MeO-DMT.
</li><li><b>Bathing During Psychedelic Experiences</b>: Leo introduces a ritual that he undertook during his psychedelic experiences, involving taking hot baths as part of showing more love and kindness to his body. This practice started after he realized that he had a tendency to mistreat his body. He emphasizes safety in this process, and warns viewers not to attempt this method without significant experience.
</li><li><b>Realization that Self-Desire is Desire for Self</b>: While reflecting on images of beautiful women during his psychedelic experiences, Leo has a realization about the nature of desire. He believes that all personal desires are essentially a desire for one's true self, absolute truth, or God. He suggests that when individuals desire something or someone, they are actually desiring God in a limited form. However, their love and desire for that thing or person is limited by the constraints of their finite selves.
</li><li><b>Experience of Awakening through Love</b>: Leo describes going through a profound phase where he begins experiencing deep love and describes it as 'infinite self-love'. He experiences a type of love that surpasses ordinary human constraints and reveals his desire for everything. He believes that all human desires are essentially perverted versions of the desire for God. As his consciousness becomes infinite, he loves and desires everything, leading to the fulfillment of all his desires. Leo emphasizes that true awakening is the discovery of love. 
</li><li><b>Verbal Telepathic Communication with God</b>: By around the two-week mark of his psychedelic experiences, Leo develops a method of verbal telepathic communication with God. He views this as a dialogue with himself since he identifies himself as God. He describes this telepathic communication as an integral part of his spiritual experience.
</li><li><b>Concept of Telepathy and Self-Communication</b>: Leo Gura discusses how through a heightened state of consciousness, he began to engage in telepathic communication with himself, which is essentially a dialogue with God. He explains that what form this communication takes depends on an individual's understanding and preference. If you're a Christian, God may appear as Jesus, or if you're Buddhist, perhaps as Buddha, indicating this dialogue is entirely subjective.
</li><li><b>Self-Love and Purification</b>: A significant part of Leo's experience was being guided to deeper levels of self-love. He says that embracing this love is challenging as it requires purifying oneself and letting go of one's ego. This state of love is so overwhelming that the body and mind struggle to tolerate it. Yet, he emphasizes it is vital for spiritual growth, and resistance to that love can hinder one's journey towards truth.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic Use and Spiritual Work</b>: Leo highlights that his psychedelic experiences weren't driven by a craving for pleasure or an attempt to escape reality. Instead, they represented a genuine exploration of truth and love. He underscores that he had to force himself to take 5-MeO DMT during his month-long experiment, revealing that engaging in deep psychedelic work is a demanding, often uncomfortable challenge. 
</li><li><b>Awakening is a Dialogue with God</b>: The practice of meditation or consuming psychedelics isn't sought for pleasure or escapism, but is a dialogue with God. Through this, God led Leo to develop a profound understanding and acceptance of himself and showed him consistent love and acceptance, ultimately revealing that the purpose of life is a contest of who can give more love. When awareness reaches its highest level, all other pursuits become insignificant - life focuses solely on giving and receiving love.
</li><li><b>Love is the Central Principle</b>: The most significant revelation for Leo during this spiritual journey was understanding that love is the central principle of life and consciousness. Leo explains that love becomes the only logical pursuit for fully conscious beings. It became a never-ending reciprocal interaction of sharing love, where the participant expressing more love essentially embodies God.
</li><li><b>Dual Experience with God</b>: Leo Gura describes a bonding process with God where he experiences divine love and feels urged to reciprocate. This formed a reflection pattern akin to a laser beam bouncing between two mirrors. 
</li><li><b>Love and Awakening</b>: As Leo's connection with divine love strengthened, he realized that true love encompasses even parts of the universe that humans find  difficult to love such as pain, suffering, and discontent. True love is being able to love all aspects of existence, even those that cause suffering. 
</li><li><b>Hardest thing to love</b>: Leo argues that the most challenging thing to love is one's own self-hatred - all the personal aspects, actions and traits that a person dislikes about themselves. He stresses that God loves all these aspects of each individual, and realizing this can bring about self-transformation, healing, and open-heartedness.
</li><li><b>Healing through Love and Truth</b>: Leo Gura offers insight into the process of healing, suggesting that love and the acceptance of truth are inherent to this process. Whether it's physical, psychological, or spiritual healing, love and truth are needed to accept reality as it is. This openness to love and truth can prove transformative.
</li><li><b>Lack of Love as Cause for Dysfunction</b>: Leo Gura posits that various dysfunctions in life, be they physical, psychological, or relationships, arise from a deficiency of love. These dysfunctions can spiral downwards when they are not met with love and acceptance. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to Truth</b>: According to Gura, resistance to truth emerges because people's lives are often built on deception and selfishness. Introducing truth disrupts this foundation, which is why many avoid spiritual work or psychedelic experiences. The true transformation of a person entails loving all of ones own aspects, even the lies and deceit. 
</li><li><b>Childhood and Love</b>: Gura states that dysfunction in adulthood can often be traced back to a lack of love in childhood, making it a fundamental factor in a person's development. The key to transformation is, therefore, opening oneself up to love and truth, acknowledging all past deceptions, and embracing all aspects of oneself.
</li><li><b>Understanding Dysfunctional Behaviors</b>: Leo Gura explains that individuals often engage in harmful or dysfunctional behaviors due to a lack of love in their lives. He posits that feelings of insufficiency drive people to seek fulfillment through negative means, like theft or abuse.
</li><li><b>Personal and Divine Love</b>: He introduces the idea that personal shortcomings and inability to love oneself are the source of regret in life, and that profound self-love is transformative. He stresses that God's love is not meant to induce change but to offer complete acceptance, and the realization of this divine love initiates personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Radiating Love</b>: As individuals begin to fully accept and appreciate God's love, they start to radiate this love outward. Leo speaks of a mirrored interplay of love between the individual and God, which pushes the personal bounds of love and acceptance.
</li><li><b>Challenges to Love</b>: Leo discusses the challenges to expanding personal love, where painful or traumatic past experiences can become stumbling blocks. However, he underlines that God's love encompasses even these challenging subjects, encouraging individuals to broaden their love and acceptance.
</li><li><b>Growth through Loving More</b>: The journey towards enlightenment then becomes a race of who can love moreindividuals are challenged by God to love things they previously could not. As the capacity for love expands, individuals deepen their relationship with divine love, reaching a point of complete immersion in it. This escalating contest to love ultimately leads to the dissolution of one's physical existence into pure love. 
</li><li><b>Love and Reality</b>: This deep immersion in divine love leads to a different perspective on the nature of reality. Individuals start viewing all of human history and experience through a perspective of profound love. The increased capacity for love allows individuals to transcend past traumas and accept all experiences, ultimately blurring the boundaries between the self and the divine.
</li><li><b>Willingness to experience life's worst moments</b>: In the video, Leo Gura discusses one's willingness to undergo and live through severe pain and suffering as a crucial aspect of experiencing God's love. He asks if one is prepared to face ultimate trauma, such as rape, torture, and death, and argues that true love is the capacity to experience these deeply tragic moments. Only when one is willing to live through the worst conceivable torments can they appreciate the range and depth of God's love.
</li><li><b>On God's Love</b>: Leo delves into the idea of God's love being so infinite that God would endure horrible experiences out of pure love. He argues that the ultimate barrier between individuals and God is the capacity to love selflessly, to let go of personal biases and attachments, and he questions whether listeners are prepared to surrender these human constructions.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality as Infinite Consciousness</b>: Leo further discusses his realizations about reality. He describes how he delved into contemplating reality, which led him to the understanding that it is merely infinite, formless consciousness, manifesting itself into the myriad forms and experiences of life. He talks about his struggle as he grappled with the fact that reality is pure love.
</li><li><b>The Fear of Ultimate Awakening</b>: Leo acknowledges the fear that comes with fully realizing and accepting the fact that reality is pure, formless love, a realization that signifies the end of life as one knows it. He expresses his fear about losing his individual consciousness or ego and becoming one with omniscient and omnipotent love.
</li><li><b>Transformation through Love</b>: Leo discusses the idea that becoming pure, formless love would result in the complete dissolution of distinctions, the destruction of one's physical existence, and the obliteration of the universe as one knows it. He talks about awakening being a shift to infinite consciousness, a state of ceaseless falling in and making of love with oneself, that would lead to a complete merger of everything that exists. Although he admits that he was afraid to fully experience this reality, Leo acknowledges its profundity and how it has redefined his understanding of awakening. 
</li><li><b>Concerns about the consequences of the transformation</b>: Leo shares his concerns over the repercussions of his transformation. He worries about the suffering his death caused by a complete transformation into pure love would inflict on his loved ones. Despite these concerns, he doesn't dismiss the profound understanding and experience he has had. He concludes by acknowledging the infinite depth of awakening, stating that this realization is merely the beginning of his spiritual journey.
</li><li><b>Leo's Profound Awakening</b>: Leo had a significant spiritual experience where he felt the temptation to merge fully with what he refers to as God or an infinite consciousness synonymous with ultimate truth. This experience brought about a feeling of finality and fear, and he acknowledges the conflict between wanting to embrace this state and resisting it due to his human attachments and ambitions - like his desire to continue teaching.
</li><li><b>Q&A</b>: Leo recognizes the paradox in teaching as awakening reveals the interconnectedness, and thus non-separated nature, of all beings. He struggles with realizations that people will only truly understand his level of consciousness if they attain it themselves, at which point, they wouldn't need his teachings.
</li><li><b>Resistance</b>: He explains that despite his fear, there is a part of him that feels obligated to fully embrace this awakening due to his lifelong pursuit of truth. He describes feeling beckoned by God to unite with this infinite consciousness but also resisting it due to a fear of losing his individuality.
</li><li><b>Making Final Preparations</b>: Having decided that he was not ready yet to fully merge with the infinite consciousness, Leo made his final preparations, said his goodbyes, and stopped using 5-MeO DMT. However, the following morning, he found himself still immersed in this state of infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Overpowering and Long-lasting Experience</b>: The experience continued to draw him deeper into the infinite consciousness, leading to a stage of sleep disturbance that lasted around five days during which he continued to have profound awakenings and insights.
</li><li><b>Multiple Dimensions of Awakening</b>: Leo describes having an even greater awakening where he realized that each previous awakening was just one point on one dimension and that there were numerous other dimensions of awakening to explore. This realization made him confront the possibility that awakening could indeed expand infinitely.
</li><li><b>Struggles and Questions</b>: After the fifth day, the intense experiences gradually subsided, and Leo was able to return to a state of normalcy. However, he was left with many questions about the nature of awakening, the attainment of Maha Samadhi, and the depth of understanding spiritual teachers have towards reality. He also mentions a struggle with taking his experiences and making them a permanent part of his consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Transformation as an Outcome</b>: Despite these struggles and uncertainties, Leo mentions that this process has led to personal transformation, making him more loving and understanding. Yet, he acknowledges lingering feelings of frustration concerning the profound experiences he has undergone.
</li><li><b>Understanding the permanence of consciousness</b>: Leo discusses the misconceptions about the permanence of consciousness. According to him, whether the state of infinite God consciousness is permanent or temporary doesn't matter. The reality of its experienced existence is not affected by its duration and it doesn't invalidate the experience. 
</li><li><b>Learning from spiritual experiences</b>: Leo emphasizes that understanding these spiritual experiences takes time and reflection. He admits that he does not possess all the answers and his journey is ongoing. 
</li><li><b>Navigating the process of awakening</b>: He talks about the difficulties and uncertainties he faced during his awakenings and stresses the individuality of these experiences, meaning that his path might not be applicable to everyone. 
</li><li><b>Love and reality</b>: Leo ultimately distills his profound experiences down to the realization that reality is love. Realitys existence is born from love and awakening to this is essential. 
</li><li><b>Leo as a spiritual guide and teacher</b>: He also reflects on his role as a guide and a teacher, hinting at changes in his teaching style, focusing more on teaching love. 
</li><li><b>Warning against ideologization</b>: He cautions listeners not to cling to his teachings as ideologies, and instead encourages critical thinking and individual exploration. He emphasizes that everyone's spiritual journey will be unique and the approach to understanding reality and truth will vary from person to person.
