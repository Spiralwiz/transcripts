            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/KrL-3s-UMjA' target='_blank'>SMART Goal Setting - How to Set Extremely Effective Goals</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>SMART Goals Introduction</b>: SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely. These criteria are targeted towards ensuring a goal is effectively set and increases the likelihood of accomplishment. This concept is widely recognized in environments that involve personal development or corporate settings.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Specificity</b>: Leo emphasizes that specific goals are more achievable than vague ones. Goals like improving my wardrobe or getting into a relationship are considered vague. Instead, goals need to be detailed and precise to be fruitful. For example, instead of setting a goal to live in a nice house, one should elaborate on the specifics like location, size, and unique features desired.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Measurability</b>: Goals need to have a clear indication of when they are fulfilled. For instance, if the goal is to live in a high-rise in San Diego, having a specific address in that high-rise indicates achievement. This means one needs to establish objective metrics to measure progress.
</li><li><b>Establishing Attainable Goals</b>: Goals should align with one's capabilities and should be realistically achievable. Evidence of attainment can involve things like being featured in a news article, having a high-traffic industry-related website, or getting frequent calls about one's expertise.
</li><li><b>Realistic and Timely Goals</b>: Goals should be possible to accomplish within a specified timeframe. Considering practicality and time in goal setting drives the success of the individual's objectives.
</li><li><b>Improved Goal-Setting Process</b>: Leo believes in an improved version of goal-setting, which focuses on setting inspiring goals that are aligned with one's values and feelings. These goals should be visualized in detail regularly.
</li><li><b>Rule of Writing Down Goals</b>: Leo insists the importance of writing down and reviewing goals everyday until they are accomplished. If not written and reviewed consistently, goals tend to remain as vague desires and not specific ambitions.
</li><li><b>Sharing of Goals and Experiences</b>: Leo encourages sharing experiences and goals which can serve as motivation and lead to growth. He also advises people to sign up at actualised.org for more comprehensive details on goal-setting.
</li><li><b>Goal Specificity</b>: Leo continues to emphasize that people often have broadly defined and vague goals such as "doing better at their job" or "being more visible in their industry". He stresses the importance of specifying the details to such goals and coming up with concrete metrics or indicators for success.
</li><li><b>Attainability of Goals</b>: Goals must be things that align with your skills, strengths, and interests. Leo suggests that setting a goal that doesn't resonate with your personal desires or abilities will often lead to failure.
</li><li><b>Realistic Goals and Expectations</b>: Goals must not only be possible to fulfill given your current skill set but also within a realistic timeframe. There should be plans in place to support and achieve the goal.
</li><li><b>Timelines for Goals</b>: Leo suggests always allocating a specific timeframe for your goals. This could be as detailed as a specific year, month, week, or even day. He reiterates that the more specific, the better.
</li><li><b>Leo's Customized Goal Setting Approach</b>: Leo proposes a variant of SMART goal-setting technique which involves setting large, inspiring goals that are aligned with personal values and desired feelings. He believes that setting such goals inspire motivation and excitement, making them easier to achieve.
</li><li><b>Visualizing Goals</b>: Leo's personal rule is that a goal is only considered set if it's continuously reviewed and visualized every single day until it is accomplished. He believes it's essential for the goals to be written down and retrospectively looked upon every day.
</li><li><b>Alignment of Goals with Personal Values and Feelings</b>: Leo puts emphasis on setting goals based on your actual desires rather than society's expectations. For instance, if spending time with family is a priority, then work should be organized in a way that supports this value.
</li><li><b>Community Interaction Encouragement</b>: Leo ends by inviting viewers to share their goals and experiences in the comments section, and to sign up for the free newsletter at Actualized.org for more detailed goal-setting techniques.
