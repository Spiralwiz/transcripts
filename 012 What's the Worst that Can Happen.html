            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/QxUwcHrKsa8' target='_blank'>What's the Worst that Can Happen</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Addressing Fear for Success</b>: Leo discusses the paralyzing nature of fear and how it impedes success in various aspects of life. He proposes a simple technique - asking oneself, "what's the worst that could happen?" Often, the worst outcomes are found to be not as terrible or probable as initially imagined. 
</li><li><b>Uncovering Deep-Rooted Fear</b>: Leo emphasizes the vitality of identifying and working through more profound fears, using his decision to move to Vegas as an example. He demonstrates a step-by-step process with his coach, illustrating how delving deeper into fears can uncover crucial core fears. 
</li><li><b>Value of Resources and Achievement</b>: One of Leo's core fears was found to be the waste of resources and lack of achievement and creativity, resulting in an unfulfilled life. He expresses the substantial impact this fear has on all aspects of his life. 
</li><li><b>Exploring Fears and Decision-making</b>: Through exploring this fear, Leo found that, despite potential risks, moving to Vegas was an opportunity for personal and professional growth. Although he was apprehensive about moving, after weighing the risks and potential benefits, he decided the venture would be worthwhile. 
</li><li><b>Path to Success and Fulfillment</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of confronting fears to achieve success. He advises listeners to take action against fear as a means of diminishing it. He warns against avoidance of fears, as it leads to prolonged suffering, and notes that fears are frequently exaggerated and not as daunting as they initially seem. 
</li><li><b>Reality of Fear Perception</b>: He proposes that individuals often overestimate the severity of potential outcomes, making them seem catastrophic. He asserts that it's crucial to keep fears in perspective, focus on realistic outcomes, and challenge oneself to look beyond the surface-level fears. 
</li><li><b>Empowering vs. Disempowering Attitude</b>: When confronted with fear, one can choose an empowering or disempowering approach. The former allows for better performance and a sense of control, while the latter can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies of failure. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of Consciousness when Dealing with Fear</b>: Caution is advised when using the strategy of contemplating the 'worst-case scenario'  a negative thinking or emotionally weakened state may exacerbate feelings of fear. Support from a coach can provide an objective perspective and help challenge limiting beliefs. 
</li><li><b>The Peril of Ignoring Fears</b>: Ignoring fears can be likened to temporarily patching a severe injury  the relief is only brief, and the issue persists. He believes that confronting fears, despite the discomfort, can lead to the fear seeming less intimidating and a decrease in personal suffering.
</li><li><b>Opportunity for Enhancing Social Skills</b>: Leo Gura mentions how moving to Las Vegas presented an opportunity for him to enhance his social skills, due to the lively nightlife and socializing opportunities in the city. He had been consciously working on building up his social skills, and Las Vegas seemed like an ideal place to continue this development.
</li><li><b>Weighing the Costs of Move</b>: Leo recognizes the potential hassles and costs of moving, including breaking his existing lease and the time lost to moving. However, he calculated the raw cost (around $6,000 and a couple of weeks of time) and saw it as a small price for the experience and potential growth he might get from living in Las Vegas for a year.
</li><li><b>Perspective on Worst-case Scenario</b>: The worst-case scenario he considered was not liking Vegas and having to move back. Yet, he viewed this through the lens of an opportunity, where even if things go wrong, he could still gain valuable life experiences and grow from them.
</li><li><b>Delving Deep into Fears</b>: Leo discusses digging deeper into your fears to understand them. By asking "what's the worst-case scenario" and then reflecting on why that would be bad, one can get to the core fear or concern. In Leo's case, it was the fear of lack of achievement and the desire to be creative and make a meaningful impact on others' lives.
</li><li><b>Common Root Fears</b>: Leo lists some commonly held root fears that most people can relate to, including fear of failure, fear of judgment by others, fear of insignificance, fear of being unlovable, or the fear of success. He posits that these fears often underlie most other fears we have.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Fears</b>: The ultimate goal of digging into your fears, Leo states, is to unblock oneself to move forward and be productive. He recommends taking action against your fear as the most effective way to dissipate fear and overcome it.
</li><li><b>Approaches to Dealing with Fear</b>: Leo discusses five different ways that individuals generally react to their fears. Some refuse to face their fears, leading to suffering and stagnation. Others may face their fears and realize they have been exaggerating their threats, meanwhile, certain fears may be discovered as highly improbable after examination. Additionally, some may find that their initial fears are only surface-level, with deeper fears lying beneath. Lastly, individuals may come face-to-face with their fear and choose to respond either in disempowerment or empowerment.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Empowerment Over Fears</b>: By facing fears with an empowering mindset, individuals can have better performance and make sound decisions rather than succumbing to disempowerment which often leads to poor decisions or self-fulfilling prophecies. Leo advises this practice even when fears are inherently out of personal control.
</li><li><b>Using the "Worst That Can Happen" Technique</b>: While this technique can be useful in addressing fears, it is important to use it correctly. It must be conducted from a positive mindset and high conscious state, full commitment to the process is necessary. Attempting this half-heartedly can lead to a worsened state of fear.
</li><li><b>Having a Coach During the Process of Addressing Fears</b>: Coaches can provide objectivity and support while challenging any limiting beliefs that arise, making them a beneficial aid in the process. 
</li><li><b>Adopting a Sustainable Approach to Success and Fulfillment</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of facing fears, even though it can be painful. Ignoring fears is compared to "putting a band-aid on a broken leg". The goal here is achieving long-term, sustainable success and fulfillment by addressing and overcoming fears.
</li><li><b>Outcome of Confronting Fears</b>: By truly looking into one's fears, they can realize it's not as menacing as initially believed. The fear of the fear often supersedes the actual fear itself. By digging deep and facing the fears, individuals can live more empowered lives and feel better about themselves.
