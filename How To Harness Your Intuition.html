hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to harness
your intuition [Music] intuition is key to self-actualize you watched
my older video called self-actualization where I actually give a
rigorous definition of what self-actualization means you'll remember that one
of the points of a self actualized individual is that
they're highly intuitive and that they use their intuition as
a compass to direct their life a lot of people
don't do this because they're out of touch with their
intuition so that's what we're going to address here your
life lacks big-picture thinking and it lacks motivation purpose and
it lacks strategy not the little picture tactics and details
a lot of people get totally lost in life frying
the little fish and ignoring all the big fish that
they should be chasing and so they get a lot
less out of life than they could and this is
especially bad in modern Western culture which has a left
brain bias what this means is is that as a
culture we don't really teach our children how to harness
their intuition and we don't even hold it as acceptable
for adults in this culture to use intuition to make
decisions because just think about it if you're sitting in
a corporate boardroom and you're trying to convince the boardroom
to do some new project or some ambitious new thing
with the company what's going to happen if you have
some proposal they're going to ask you for logical reasons
and justifications for why your proposal is correct and they
will not accept as argument something like well my intuition
tells me it's right they won't accept that because in
our culture everything has to be over rationalized and over
justified but in fact if you take a deeper look
at what's going on is that most of the most
important decisions you make in your life are actually stemming
from your intuition and then when you start to get
your logical mind in there and you try to start
to rationalize it and over justify it that just screws
up the process so at least with your life I'm
not saying to be able to change your corporate culture
overnight but at least in your life you need to
be honest with yourself and admit that intuition plays a
huge role and if it doesn't that's the extent to
which your life doesn't go very well intuition is more
powerful than logic will ever be ever be because purpose
and vision which is the thing that pushes forward everything
in life no matter if it's you personally or in
a corporate boardroom or if you're the leader of a
government or whatever vision comes first it's what creates a
strategic intent it's what generates the big picture that then
allows you to go in there and fill in all
the details with your logical mind you see the human
mind is a very interesting thing and it's a lot
more mysterious and complex than you would think this sort
of linear thinking from A to B to C the
sort of cause and effect linear thinking is not able
to crunch a lot of data and to make really
high quality high-level decisions and to have wisdom what you
need is you need to be able to crunch a
shitload of data that your logical mind will never ever
be able to grapple with and the only way you
can do that is by trusting your subconscious mind to
do that processing for you and your subconscious mind it's
not very reasonable and it's not very logical and it's
not very linear it's a vast distributed network that functions
in truly mysterious ways but what it can do very
consistently is it can crunch tons of data tons of
factors very subtle factors and data that your logical mind
would never understand it can crunch all that and come
back to you with decisions wisdom creative insights and so
forth in a very spontaneous way but this is a
human way it's not a logical computer way so if
you're a computer geek you have a problem with this
and you know in our Western culture we're all in
a sense sort of like stuck in this left brain
computer geeks way of thinking when in fact what we
need is we need more visionaries you need to be
the visionary in your life you need to be the
visionary for your company you need to be the visionary
in your organization and within the community that you're living
in at large you need to be the visionary that's
what we need to move humanity forward and also for
you to create the kind of life that you want
be careful discounting intuition as some kind of voodoo airy-fairy
thing it's really not you just need to get in
touch with it it's really a higher order form of
intelligence it's the difference between using just like a calculator
to crunch some numbers and using a vast supercomputer that
functions in ways that you don't even understand yet that's
the power of intuition your intuition is much more powerful
than logical intelligence that is not what makes human beings
amazing it's not our logical intelligence it's our intuitive intelligence
that makes us amazing but you need to demonstrate this
for yourself not just to believe me personally in my
own life I've always been rather intuitive and I think
that that's been one of the keys to my success
in fact if I take a look back at my
life history since I was in middle school and even
earlier since I was just like six years old I
can think back all the way back there and all
the way till today and right now I can see
that every major transition every area in my life were
I grew the most were my consciousness increased permanently in
big ways all that was tied to me following my
intuitions so I can think back to high school when
I had this intuitive urge to take harder classes and
so I ended up enrolling in a lot of very
difficult challenging AP college classes and that transformed my entire
intellectual understanding of life got me passionate about education and
then when I was in college I had an intuitive
urge halfway through college to switch majors like very radically
switched my major from engineering to philosophy and that was
a huge shift for me that was very important also
when I got my first job in my first career
was in the first six months I got the intuitive
urge that I need to quit my career and quit
my job and so that was a challenge you want
to follow up on but I did and that paid
off a big time for me also then when I
started working for myself I got this intuitive urge that
hey you know I really want to get back into
education I want to educate myself the way that I
did in high school because I lost touch with that
after I exited college and so I got back into
reading and studying just for myself and that was hugely
important also then when my first business started to become
successful I got the intuitive urge that I need to
quit my first business at the height of its success
and that was a very challenging intuition to have into
work but I worked it and that ended up leading
to actualized org and then I got into a diverge
after I started transitioning into actual eyes adored I got
the intuitive urge to to move cities to move from
Dallas to Vegas and that was important for me at
the time that was also an intuition that I got
then I got intuitions about focusing on enlightenment and making
that the thrust of my personal development and putting that
above all other concerns within personal development that was important
even when I consult my intuition for taking substances like
psychedelics you know I ask myself like should I take
this psychedelic now or shouldn't I and I just quietly
listen to what my intuition tells me and my intuition
gives me an urge and it tells me whether I
should and shouldn't and then I'll try to honor that
and to the extent that I do usually turns out
well lately I've been getting intuitive urges to evolve actualized
auditory to really radically change up the content that I'm
delivering and so I'm currently working with that and then
also I'm getting a really deep urge just to stop
playing the game of life entirely to stop pursuing success
to even stop pursuing success through actualize org to even
stop helping people like I'm getting that kind of like
really really deep desire just to free myself from every
single attachment that I have and that's something I'm currently
working on so this is just a list of examples
because I want to make this tangible not keep it
in the abstract you know you might wonder well Leo
intuition what does that really mean and what that really
means for me is that when you quiet your mind
down when you're free of distractions and you're just sitting
there alone in solitude what you should notice is that
there's a little voice inside of you that comes up
with all sorts of interesting things which is different from
monkey mind and is different from logic it's sort of
like your higher-self your muse speaking to you now I
don't know how it is for you but for me
this is a pretty strong voice and it's spoken to
me for my entire life and to the extent that
I've been able to follow it it's been responsible for
almost all of my deep-seated success and then the extent
that I didn't follow it or that I stalled or
that I tried to suppress it to that extent my
life didn't go very well and I wasn't satisfied but
intuition is difficult to follow it's not easy you might
wonder like well what's the problem so I'll just listen
to this voice and off we go and everything is
fine but there's three key failure points that I see
with following one's intuition firstly is that most people can't
even hear it first problem because you got to hear
it to take action on it secondly even if you
can hear it most people are so full of impurities
personal impurities that they can't follow it and thirdly is
that even if they clear up all the impurities and
they hear the voice they just don't get to work
on it so those are the three failure points now
I want to talk about why these happen and how
to overcome them with some solutions so firstly is that
you can't hear the little voice inside of you why
does this happen largely for just two reasons and these
are largely cultural reasons first is that it's drowned out
the voice is drowned out by our culture and our
media and all the people in your life and all
the distractions and secondly because there's a cultural modern Western
cultural bias to be overly logical overly materialistic and overly
pragmatic and this all this taken together means that you
very rarely listen to that music site of you so
what's the solution well firstly it's to acknowledge that true
intelligence comes from something much deeper than you you are
not the source of intelligence this is a very bad
habit that Western Minds have put themselves into is this
idea that somehow we are the master race or the
master species on this planet and we have some sort
of form of higher logical intelligence that's better than all
the animals and all the other creatures and and all
of that and that there's nothing above us and we're
way above everybody else ah no that's a highly arrogant
highly conceived and highly ignorant understanding of how intelligence functions
a better way to understand intelligence that intelligence actually doesn't
come from you but that intelligence is like interwoven into
the fabric of existence itself and this is a very
difficult thing to explain to somebody who hasn't done any
higher consciousness work who hasn't meditated who hasn't achieved some
of the higher consciousness states that are possible or maybe
done some psychedelics uh at least you know to start
to see that you are not the end-all-be-all and that
you are actually not the one who's generating intelligence this
sounds kind of cuckoo if you grew up and you
went to university you just kind of went through that
really westernized materialistic kind of frame of mind that tells
you that intelligence is only the analytical form of intelligence
that exists where you can do a mathematical theorem or
write something in a book or read something in a
book or write a dissertation and that's like the pinnacle
of intelligence actually no that's not that's not intelligence is
a much deeper thing and that's something you need to
get in touch with so firstly I just want you
to acknowledge that there's a possibility that intelligence is a
lot faster than you think it is so just acknowledge
that because when you do that opens up room now
for intelligence to come to you from sources beyond yourself
it's not as crazy as it sounds in fact the
more you start to do what I'm going to be
telling you here following these steps this will become so
obvious to you some of you will be listening to
me and you're like Leah of course why are you
even stressing this point I'm stressing the point because for
a lot of people this stuff is very off-putting because
it sounds hippy but as your consciousness increases it will
become more and more obvious to you so another thing
you need to do to start to hear the voice
you need to remove distractions I'd say that this is
probably the number one reason people don't follow their intuition
is that they're too distracted with all the stuff they
do in their life all the pragmatic logical stuff all
the chores all the social obligations to the point where
you have no free time for even five minutes of
silence and solitude in your everyday and of course when
you don't have any silence or solitude you can never
really hear the voice it gets drowned out by the
TV by the internet by the videogames by the pornography
by by your parents and your friends and your partying
and all that stuff so that one is huge I
have a whole episode called lifestyle minimalism which goes into
depth about how important it is to minimize your lifestyle
this is one of the reasons why so that your
intuition can come forth and you can actually start to
hear it also I think is very important to contemplate
your death to start to hear your voice because you
need to be aware of the fact that your life
will not continue forever this materialistic orgy that you're a
part of as you're part of mainstream culture this is
not going to continue forever alright and you need to
realize that when you realize that then your priorities will
start to realign you'll start to move away from materialism
and towards deeper things in life I have a whole
episode about how to contemplate your own death so maybe
go watch that one so that you can start to
grasp the fact that your life is going by very
very quickly it's gonna escape you much faster than you
ever thought possible when you realize that then you will
open yourself up more to intuition having your life near
near-death experience you know people if you rather read about
someone having a near-death experience like cancer car crash a
some other kind of family tragedy all their priorities get
reshuffled why is that because they come face to face
with death and when you're faced with death materialistic pursuits
stop being very significant to you and then the intuition
comes out and tells you hey what are you doing
you're wasting your life let's work on frying bigger fish
here also you need to get clear about what you
want out of life and hint what you want is
not success it's not sex it's not money it's not
a marriage these are not what you really want I'm
talking about what do you really want from life how
do you get very clear about that my life purpose
course goes into a lot of depth on that so
I don't have time to go into it here meditation
is very important as a habit because it creates that
kind of stillness and solitude that you need and while
you meditate you will notice that your intuition comes through
your meditation and also the more years you meditate the
stronger your intuition will get the easier and more attuned
you will become to that very subtle muezzin side of
you because it's a subtle voice it's very easy to
get it drowned out by politics by internet by family
squabbles and all this kind of stuff and lastly as
a solution to not hearing your intuition is you need
to start to get more in touch with your emotions
do exercises that help you to actually feel into your
emotions now meditation can be one of those maybe yoga
uh maybe so you know there's a lot of different
exercises in the self-help field that help you to get
in touch with your emotions so start doing those so
that was the first problem now the second problem is
that you're full of many impurities what does this mean
well the problem here is that you've got your ego
you've got various cravings fears traumas and dogmas which all
are a distorting filter overtop of your intuition so your
intuition gets distorted by these things the bigger your ego
the more distorted your intuition will be in fact the
ego will co-opt the intuition and use it to all
sorts of crude low consciousness ends basically what's the solution
to this well firstly the solution is to have benevolent
motives in your life and that whatever you're moving towards
or whatever you're trying to accomplish in your life make
sure that at the highest level that this is coming
from love and not from defensiveness not from fear not
from craving not from self identity or self-importance not from
protecting yourself or your family or your clan and not
from defending dogmas or beliefs or worldviews that you have
all of notice how all that is very different than
coming from love coming from love coming from beauty from
coming from a sense of contribution these are what I
would call benevolent motives but Nevel it higher consciousness values
so start there then move on to spiritual purification spiritual
purification is the entire process basically of purifying your identity
of your cravings of your fears of your deepest held
beliefs and worldviews and your sons your sense of self-importance
your life story dropping all of that purifying all that
away burning in a way so that you're left with
like a sort of an empty vessel and then what
happens is that you become a vehicle of the intuitive
voice inside of you you become a servant of the
muses which is not what you are right now because
even if you can hear the muses the problem is
you've got all these personal fears and all these personal
cravings for sex and for for food and for and
for security and for money and for success and for
fame and for validation for approval when you've got all
that stuff in the way you can't really follow your
intuitions because your intuitions will try to push you beyond
all that but you won't be able to go there
because you're weighed down by all these heavy egoic things
it's almost like you're a hot air balloon right and
the intuitions want to pull you up because they're light
and airy they're sort of spiritual but you've got these
big massive weights every single fear every single belief you
hold every single childhood trauma that you still live in
reaction to every single part of your identity that you're
attached to all of that is like ropes tying this
hot air balloon to the ground and so what spiritual
purification is is like taking some scissors and systematically slit
snipping every single one of those ropes so that then
you can float off high in the air releasing beliefs
is a very big component of this I just released
an episode very uh in depth episode last week about
the limitations of beliefs and the mechanics of how beliefs
operate and how to start to go about dropping them
so that's going to be a hugely important aspect of
being able to follow through on your intuitions because a
lot of times you get an intuition like oh maybe
I should start this business or maybe I should go
help people in in a third-world country or maybe I
should do something nice for this person but then what
happens all these limiting beliefs come up and say oh
well I can't do this and I shouldn't do that
and you know what if that's wrong and that there's
no possible way that I could do this because you
know it's not what I believe is possible for myself
you might even have limiting beliefs right now about intuition
maybe you have the belief that intuition is just nonsense
that intuition is just something I'm making up that intuition
isn't very important it's not very powerful or that you
can't strengthen your connection to intuition or that logic is
better than intuition maybe you hold that kind of dogma
and you're really attached to that because you have this
identity of like I'm a very logical scientifically minded person
I can't give that up if I give that up
then I'm just opening myself up to all this kind
of nonsense and then I'll get lost and then I'll
just be like all the silly people out there who
believe in all sorts of nonsense see that might be
an attachment you have and that's just one example of
many many many many attachments and beliefs that you need
to release another solution to clearing up your impurities is
to change your environment your environment especially again in modern
Western culture is a huge source of impurities not only
is it impurity to remove but it's an impurity it's
like a impurity generation machine it's like extra bad not
only do you have this impurity in you but then
the environment keeps recreating that impurity so that if you
take the impurity out it just poisons you more the
next day the next week the next month so what
do I mean by change in your environment changing the
place you live in cleaning up the kind of information
that you take to your body and into your mind
by information I mean media the news you watch the
politics you listen to the friends you hang out with
and so forth cleaning up your diet because that's a
huge source of impurity in you and believe it or
not that affects how your mind works and it affects
whether you're even able to listen to your intuition at
all because you know what when you go to a
giant buffet and eat a bunch of greasy food you
come back you flop down on the couch watching some
TV your intuition by that point even if your intuition
is telling you stuff you're in no position to listen
to it because your body and your mind have been
filled with so many impurities and also cleaning up your
relationships cleaning up your family relationships your friendships and especially
your intimate relationships your marriage and by cleaning up I
mean making sure it's not toxic anymore or cutting those
ties which are toxic and which you cannot clean up
because those will involve you in neverending needless drama and
when your mind is caught up in drama in fighting
and bickering and this tug-of-war that goes on with your
toxic relationships you have no more room for hearing the
subtle intuition inside of you and the last tip I'll
give you for clearing out impurities is also make sure
that you free your body of tension your body swords
a lot of tension in it and that's something I
haven't talked about very much in Prior episodes is just
how much of your problems are not only psychological but
actually physiological you hold it in your body get some
body work done maybe get some massages maybe do some
yoga maybe do some weightlifting you know whatever you need
to do to get the tension out of your body
and also practice releasing the tension that's being held in
your body right now notice for example right now as
you're sitting there or standing there listening to me notice
which parts of your body are tense the more relaxed
you can make your body go ahead and relax everything
in your body right now that's been tensed notice that
tension is a function of unconsciousness it takes consciousness to
release tension so as you release systematically more and more
tension from your body as you spiritually purify yourself not
only psychologically but physiologically you will notice that intuition sort
of just like courses through your entire body it's a
pretty cool phenomenon search the course through your entire body
because your entire body becomes like a lightning rod for
divine inspiration and divine wisdom which comes from beyond you
yeah it's difficult for a lot of people to grasp
this especially if they carry a lot of tension in
their body right it seems like you're stuck in your
mind as you let go of all the tension in
your body your mind opens up the body and the
mind become a unified system the channels are opened up
and then you can be very creative and very productive
which brings us finally to the third failure point with
intuition is that people even if they have intuitive hits
and they have these brilliant sparks of insight and genius
and you know there's a little voice inside you telling
you what you should go out and do what do
most people do they don't do it but they don't
work the intuition it's not enough just to have intuitions
pop up here and there that is like a source
of insight and a source of inspiration but you need
to then take that and work it the problem here
is twofold one is simply a lack of seriousness a
lack of commitment to your intuition and secondly it's a
lack of requisite variety requisite varieties of fancy turn that
basically means a lack of creativity on your part a
lack of flexibility in being able to get something accomplished
so let's talk about the solution of these the high-level
solution to this is for you to realize that your
number one job in life is to serve your intuition
that's what you're here for on earth is to serve
your intuition there's nothing else for you to be doing
but serving your intuition your intuition is not you it
comes from outside you and your job is to be
a servant of that and to do whatever is necessary
to clean yourself up to open your ears to listen
to it to receive the message and then to go
out there and be a diligent executor of this intuition
that's in a nutshell what you should be doing in
your life but how many people are actually doing that
how many people are actually conscious of that as their
mission in life very few so what you need to
do is first of all just to understand that secondly
though you need to commit to following your intuition because
following your intuition is hard it's scary it takes courage
it takes work it takes discipline it takes learning new
abilities it takes growing yourself it takes cutting attachments it
takes letting go of your sense of identity it takes
some changing your belief systems it means doing lots of
very practical things that might be at first uncomfortable to
you like moving to a different country or starting public
speaking or learning a new computer programming language or going
back to college or quitting your job you know all
this kind of stuff requires actually making changes to your
life if you're following your intuition your life will tend
to change rather dramatically every couple of years that's what
I found people who don't follow their intuition they tend
to just kind of like get bogged down and stay
put in one little corner of the world for their
entire lifetime and they don't grow very much they live
in the same house in the same city in the
same state in the same country in the same state
of mind at the same job forever and there's not
much growth to be out there if you're really following
your intuitions your life is always in flux and it's
always changing you're always changing your job you're changing your
relationship you're changing the books you read you're changing the
seminars you go to you're changing the friends you out
with your changing what kind of business you do and
that requires a willingness to make radical changes it requires
not getting comfortable in any one spot very easy to
get comfortable it also requires mustering the courage you know
sometimes I have an intuitive hit that tells me something
like this entire business that I'm doing is wrong I
got to stop that's a scary intuition to follow because
I might have just spent five years building up this
business and now all the sudden I wake up one
morning and it all all of a sudden this business
is wrong that means I have to have the courage
to say okay well if it's wrong then I gotta
start to wind it down and I got to start
on the next thing what's the next thing and I
gotta go work on that and build it from scratch
that takes a lot more effort than just to say
oh well maybe maybe I'm just deluding myself and just
to kind of sweep that under the rug push it
aside suppress it for five 10 years and then by
that point maybe my intuition will give up I'll get
so jaded and so uh you know I'll I'll get
so complacent that it's just going to be a dead
end another solution here is that you must create a
sort of intuition incubator in your life your job is
to incubate the intuitions they don't come to you in
a polished precise step-by-step blueprint form it's not like oh
I got an intuition about which business I should start
and I also gained it also came with a hundred
page business you know step by step business plan and
blueprints for how I'm going to do it know it
comes in a very rough form and your job is
to incubate that polish it up over time and then
to go out there and work on it so how
do you create an intuition incubator well first of all
by following the steps I told you you know you
are your own biggest obstacle as far as the incubation
of intuitions because of all the impurities but once you've
gotten the impurities out then what I recommend is that
you journal a lot about the intuitions you actually have
write them down keep track of them catalog them articulate
them in actual specific and clear language contemplate them a
lot think about them and then create action plans convert
your abstract ideas into action plans of what you need
to go out there and do and then because you're
committed to following your intuitions you will then go out
there and do it and be very strategic in the
way that you follow your intuitions some intuitions that I've
had required 5 to 10 years of laying the groundwork
before the intuition could come to the surface and bear
fruit you see like with my life purpose I had
an intuition when I was still in in the middle
of high school that I needed to find my life
purpose and that I needed to make a career around
my life purpose I just had that intuition I didn't
know what exactly that meant I didn't know how I
was gonna do it and then I went through all
of four years of university and then also uh one
year in my first job that's five years and then
also about three more years starting my first business that's
about eight years and during all that time I was
looking for what my life purpose is trying to figure
it out and I was failing I wasn't getting it
and I had to restart from scratch sometimes completely from
scratch several times until I was able to finally figure
it out with actualised org and still I'm still evolving
and I still continuing forward I'm not less resting on
my laurels right but that was an example where I
had to be strategic and very persistent and I had
to had a very long-term view my number one commitment
had to be to my intuitions and not to my
comfort level not to my personal security not to staying
in one city because I have to move around around
the whole country to try to accomplish this see I
change cities once twice three times three times I change
cities from west coast to East Coast in order to
do this all right so that's just one example what
I see is that many people they get an intuition
they even then come up with a little plan for
it but then their plan is so short-sighted that it's
like well if this plan happens in the next three
months okay but if it takes any longer than three
months then there's no way in hell they're going to
do it because they're not like really serious about their
number one priority in life which is that they are
a vehicle of their intuitions if you're not serving your
intuitions who are you serving you're probably serving by default
your ego and lower consciousness and just comfort and convenience
so that's a covering the Third Point now uh before
I end I just want to briefly clarify this point
about how do you tell apart true versus false intuitions
sometimes we get an intuition but we're not quite sure
you know is this intuition coming from the right place
or maybe is this my ego being sneaky and deceptive
how can you tell the difference it's quite simple false
intuitions defend themselves with justifications when they are questioned whereas
true intuitions are silent when they are questioned yet the
more you question them they still continue to have that
sort of magnetic pull to them this is an insight
that I learned from Christopher Wallace so I want to
give them some credit here I found this to be
very true when I look back at my life this
is exactly how it works if you have it intuition
go ahead and question your intuition I'm not telling you
to just act on your gut all the time because
sometimes your gut could be wrong so sit there like
I said incubated ponder it think about it don't make
rash moves be very strategic but as you question be
mindful be mindful of what happens when you're questioning your
intuition let's say you have an intuition to move to
another city now you might want to question and say
well why do I want to move to another city
what's going on there should I really do that what
are the pros and cons as you start to question
that take a look is the intuition starting to defend
itself and coming up with all sorts of justification that
is becoming very logical that's a sign that it's probably
the wrong choice yet if it has just this sort
of silent pull to it like you're just almost like
magnetically attracted just like magnetically attracted then you're probably going
the right direction also the false intuitions tend to be
protective and they tend to come from a place of
playing not to lose whereas the true intuitions tend to
be aspirational coming from a place of love or beauty
and it's a playing to win not applying not to
lose see so with this example of moving to another
city well one reason you might want to move to
another city is because you feel like well if I
change cities then that will like increase my ability to
do this personal development for whatever reason you might think
that the current city you're living in isn't good well
you might want to question that and just look into
that and see are you really moving to their city
in order to run away from something that would be
playing not to lose or are you moved to the
city for aspirational reasons because you're playing to win see
that would be just one example so use that to
tell it apart what you'll discover as you raise the
quality of your consciousness as you do more of this
self-actualization work that I speak of all the time your
intuition will skyrocket as you spiritually purify yourself you will
rely on your intuition more and more and more and
more until you get to the point in your life
where you are not making any logical decisions about your
life all the decisions in your life are made for
you not by you by but by the kind of
spooky and mysterious intelligence that permeates all of existence and
you will develop a connection to this intelligence and you
will start to see that this intelligence is way way
way beyond anything that your little mind could come up
with and you will develop such rock-solid faith in that
intelligence that you will become a force of nature driven
and fueled by this intelligence because you will actually surrender
your entire ego to this thing and you will become
its vehicle and at that point is when your life
really becomes amazing and magical because all of a sudden
you're not living for yourself anymore you're not living not
to lose you're living to win you're living aspirationally you're
living for something way beyond yourself it's like you're living
and you feel like you're uh a part of the
entire universe acting on itself and that is a very
powerful place to come from because it gives you a
lot of motivation it gives you a lot of staying
power with whatever you decide to do because you're not
doing it for your petty little self anymore the way
most people undertake all the stuff they try to accomplish
and that's why they fail so often right because they're
doing it for their petty little selves and not for
the entire universe become an employee of the universe let
the universe be the boss learn to listen to it
develop your capacities to be a good executor and then
you will be a force of nature alright that's it
UH one last thing I want to mention is that
I have a worksheet for you to help you to
work on these intuitions some practical questions that you can
go and answer right now so uh check for the
link below it's a free pdf go ahead and download
it and fill out that worksheet I'm signing off go
ahead click the like button for me post your questions
or comments down below share this episode with a friend
and lastly come sign up to actualize that word right
here this is my newsletter sign up to the free
news stick with me as I release more content on
how to self-actualize and how to develop a deeper connection
with that higher power inside of you that deeper calling
inside of you everything that I've been able to accomplish
in my life has stemmed from me really being in
touch what's what's with what's truly important hey you have
to get in touch there's a lot of people out
there who are very hard workers who are working 80
hours a week but these people are not satisfied with
their work and their work is not that meaningful because
like I said before they're frying small fish they're not
in touch with the deeper intelligence that is permeating through
them they've been out of touch with that probably because
they are living in their ego probably because they've never
heard about these things and probably because they aren't following
through on any kind of persistent education of their mind
filling their mind with the right concepts and ideas which
is what actualize that org is here to help you
with so if you stick with me over the next
year the next two years just watch one of these
episodes every week start taking action on things I say
don't just watch also take action and you will see
that everything that I talk about and more actually becomes
possible and becomes true in your life right all this
stuff I talk about it's not just cool ideas this
is stuff you can live this is stuff you can
embody and the stuff honestly that I talk it out
is just like the tip of the iceberg of what's
possible what's actually possible the entire thing if you ever
saw the entire iceberg you would be shocked beyond belief
so I'm excited to have you taste even the tip
of it and then go with me all the way
to the bottom to see how big the thing is
it's huge it's remarkable it's miraculous it's amazing so sign
up stay tuned and I'll see you soon for you
