            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jmBQRb5iuMg' target='_blank'>What Is Reality - A Radical Explanation</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Infinite consciousness shapes reality</b>: This lecture revolves around the discussion of a profound and radical concept of what constitutes reality. It states that reality is comprised of infinite consciousness and infinite imagination. Objects and phenomena that we perceive as real and physical are actually within our consciousness; they are figments of our imagination given a palpable form through our cognizance. To think of ourselves as physical beings born into a physical world is a misunderstanding of reality.
</li><li><b>We were born without knowledge of reality</b>: Upon birth, we are unaware of the world and its systems. We gradually learn and gain knowledge about our surroundings - forming our understanding of reality. However, these learnings are typically based on assumed truths, creating a skewed perception of reality closely tied with the physical world. 
</li><li><b>Physical objects do not exist independently of consciousness</b>: When we see everyday items like trees, cars, people, etc. we construe their existence as separate from ourselves. This understanding stems from the overwhelmingly dominant belief that physical objects are separate from our conscious imagination. We connect our existence to a temporal lineage, starting from the Big Bang and culminating into our present selves.
</li><li><b>Consciousness is the only reality</b>: Leo asserts that physical objects don't exist independently, and only consciousness is real. Everything, including ourselves and the physical world, is imagined within this consciousness. There is no physical reality existing externally of our consciousness.
</li><li><b>The idea of the physical universe is imagined</b>: Leo emphasizes that concepts like time, space, and events like the Big Bang are all imagined within consciousness. Everything we know, feel, and experience, including our emotions and world history, are imagined in the present moment.
</li><li><b>We are a manifestation of infinite imagination</b>: The lecture proposes that our true nature is not that of a physical being but of infinite imagination, often metaphorically referred to as God. Infinite consciousness or God has been eternally existing, creating various realities, including our current human existence. The key takeaway is that all our experiences, memories, or emotions, are all imagined by our consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Acknowledging and accepting the radical nature of reality</b>: Truly understanding and accepting this idea can cause a mental shift, leading to difficulty in discerning between reality and imagination. This blurred line can be both enlightening and terrifying, as it involves questioning one's entire life and existence. 
</li><li><b>Questioning existing beliefs and the absolute nature of consciousness</b>: Leo encourages questioning our world views, existing scientific beliefs, and even spiritual teachings. He emphasizes that consciousness is the only absolute and there can be nothing outside of it. Therefore, every phenomenon or experience, even non-existence and death, happens within our consciousness.
</li><li><b>The self-reimagining and restructuring of reality</b>: Lastly, it's crucial to understand that we never stop reimagining ourselves and our reality and that our imaginations can create our physical experiences. However, our current state of consciousness might deceive us and keep us from fully comprehending the bridge between the physical and the imaginary. Leo suggests revisiting these ideas, addressing possible doubts and objections to grasp the concept fully. The core point is that everything is imaginary and that we, as God, are imagining it all.
</li><li><b>Reality is Not Limited</b>: Reality has no limitations in its ability to display anything. It isn't constrained by physical or technological limitations.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Misunderstood</b>: People often misunderstand consciousness, mistaking it for something that comes from a brain or neurons. In reality, consciousness is the substrate for everything else. It is not localized, it does not occur in time or space. Instead, it is imagined by consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness & Imagination</b>: Consciousness is limitless, capable of imagining and creating within itself. Such capability is not limited by physical world limitations.
</li><li><b>Reality is Unified and Infinite</b>: It is impossible to draw boundaries or distinctions between any two objects in reality because everything is one. With this oneness, there's nothing outside of reality to limit or constrain it.
</li><li><b>Manifestation of Immediate Wants</b>: With consciousness being all-powerful and infinitely intelligent, it can manifest anything it wants immediately. The possibility and impossibility of things are just an imagination of the infinite consciousness. Similarly, differences between real and imaginary are also imaginary.
</li><li><b>Reality Is Made Up of Differences</b>: Everything we can distinguish in our reality is due to perceived differences. Reality isn't made up of molecules, atoms, quarks, or strings; it's made up of differences.
</li><li><b>Broader Meaning of Imagination</b>: Our conventional understanding of imagination is limited to images and thoughts. However, the concept of imagination is much broader, hallucinating even the physical reality. Everything, including the physical world, our bodies, and familiar objects around us, is imaginary. To comprehend this, we need to elevate our consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Deep Layers of Imagination</b>: Imagining the physical reality isn't simple; it's complicated and nuanced, with layers of self-deception. Our denial and disbelief are imaginary constructs that interfere with our ability to imagine new realities. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness and Self-Understanding</b>: The radical nature of the concept that everything is imaginary leads to questioning our entire existence. This is because our sense of self and our perception of reality are intertwined, making it difficult to separate one from the other. Our current state of consciousness may deceive us, and it could take years of exploring deeper levels of consciousness to fully understand the concept that everything is imaginary. 
</li><li><b>Need for Time and Patience</b>: The understanding and realization of the radical truths shared may take years. Open-mindedness and patience are needed to learn and understand these ideas. It's important not just to listen but also to work towards elevating your consciousness. The journey to understanding this concept is not a quick process but a slow transformation over time.
</li><li><b>Concept of Interconnected Reality</b>: In this portion of the video, Leo Gura asserts that the individual's mind and physical reality are thoroughly interconnected without any distinct boundaries. He postulates that from birth, people imagine and build their existences, starting with zero knowledge and progressively constructing their perception of reality - a phenomenon he refers to as the 'slope of reality'. He emphasizes that rather than discovering an existing physical world, individuals are constantly inventing their universe, which constitutes their physical, psychological, and biological selves. 
</li><li><b>Perception of Reality and Self</b>: Leo argues that over time, through experiences and learning, individuals further solidify and reinforce their personalized perception of reality, likening the process to a reverse snowball rolling uphill. Nonetheless, throughout this journey, he suggests that individuals may sense peculiarities and gaps in their understanding of reality, given that it's constructed on imagination.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Imagined Reality</b>: As individuals start questioning their reality, they feel their constructed perception (the 'snowball') gradually deconstructing and rolling back down the slope. This can be a challenging and fearful process as it involves facing the potential annihilation of the reality they've built including elements such as career, relationships, worldview, etc. This fear, however, should hint at the truth of their reality being rooted in imagination.
</li><li><b>Encountering 'Reality Dissolution'</b>: Leo points out that the inquiry into one's reality can lead to a mental collapse where individuals can no longer distinguish between reality and imagination. He suggests that people are continuously imagining their existence within the present moment, including elements like their childhood and relationships with others.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Infinite Imagination</b>: Leo emphasizes the radical concept that everything is imaginary, instantaneous, and rooted in an individuals current imaginative power. He reasons that people cannot merely imagine a new world because they are persistently imagining and reinforcing their current world. He warns about the strength and potential dangers of infinite imagination, reinforcing that whatever is imagined through infinite imagination becomes real for that individual. Leo concludes that people's denial of the imaginary nature of reality is a result of their imagination. 
</li><li><b>Exploration of Radical Reality Concepts</b>: Leo insists that his explanation is not a wordplay or semantic difference but an attempt to introduce a radically different perception of reality. He states that understanding this concept of imagination could lead to experiencing reality melting away, which may turn terrifying or enlightening. He suggests that comprehensive grasp of these ideas could lead to a total collapse of the individual's perceived world, resulting in a completely new understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Hallucination as Reality</b>: According to Leo Gura, the definitions of reality and imagination can often blur, leading to states where we can't distinguish the two anymore. This can be quite scary for many, leading them to label it as a 'dark night of the soul' ordeal where your life's understanding is completely deconstructed and you realise everything you knew and believed in was a fiction. This state of enlightenment is compared to a 'psychotic breakdown' due to similarity in symptoms and is a product of awakening the consciousness to its fundamental nature as a creator.
</li><li><b>Eternal Consciousness, Infinite Imagination</b>: Gura stresses that our consciousness is eternal and infinite, constantly imagining different aspects of life and reality. He rejects the notion of anything existing outside of consciousness, as all concepts, including those of inside and outside, are conceived and imagined by consciousness. He reinforces that even our experiences of non-existence or death happen within the boundaries of our consciousness.
</li><li><b>Challenge to Traditional Understanding</b>: Leo Gura challenges traditional understanding of death, asserting that even our death, including the pain and suffering that accompanies it, is all part of an imagined construct. He claims that even our concepts of existence, such as sleep or being awake, are all part of the never-ending narrative of our consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Consciousness through Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics, according to Gura, can help break down the lines between reality and imagination by elevating our state of consciousness. He does caution against its misuse and advises to be prepared for the unraveling of reality it can sometimes lead to. 
</li><li><b>Dealing with the Awakening</b>: The process of awakening to these understandings can shatter pre-existing worldviews and be incredibly challenging, warns Gura. It can lead to complete denial and create a fear of losing oneself. Nevertheless, acceptance of this radical realization can reveal the true nature of our existence and our role as creators of our own realities.
</li><li><b>Understanding the boundaries between reality and imagination through hallucinations</b>: Leo Gura explains that the use of LSD can lead to a state of consciousness where the boundary between reality and imagination completely dissolves, manifesting physical objects as one imagines them. This state of consciousness is so transformed that one might even lose recognition of being a human being. 
</li><li><b>Cautions against highly potent hallucinogens</b>: Gura warns against using dangerously powerful hallucinogens like datura, which can cause total hallucinations and can be lethal. Datura's impact can be so profound that the individual completely loses track of having ingested a substance and may perceive imaginary conversations with non-existent beings as real. He reemphasizes that all his teachings are actually hallucinations for the listener, as they are the listener's mind's projections.
</li><li><b>Two Highest Teachings from Leo's Experiences</b>: First, you are God, there is nothing but God, and you are alone. Second: everything is imaginary. He explains that God, or infinite consciousness, is incredibly powerful, intelligent, and unlimited. However, it's also infinitely good and infinitely loving, though these aspects are not elaborated in this discussion. 
</li><li><b>Purpose of the teachings and individual's role</b>: People's primary task is to actualize these teachings, not merely consider them as beliefs or ideologies. Leo suggests that one can realize these teachings because all that exists is consciousness, and each individual is a part of God, the collective consciousness. 
</li><li><b>The difficult nature of truth</b>: He emphasizes that many people avoid pursuing the truth as it is highly radical and potentially threatening to their established life views. The ultimate truth, according to Gura, is realizing the line between reality and imagination, surrendering one's life, and recognizing the imaginary nature of all concepts, thus leading to the awareness of being in an eternal and infinite present moment, which he calls 'paradise'. This realization brings infinite peace, love, goodness, and understanding of one's role in creating the universe.
</li><li><b>Changing Nature of Future Teachings</b>: Leo concludes by stating that the realization that everything is imaginary will be a central part of his future teachings. This approach will cut through a lot of spiritual misconceptions propagated by many gurus. He emphasizes watching this important episode multiple times, addressing all doubts and objections, and understanding that they are all part of the imagination. The idea of you are God imagining everything will be a recurring theme in future work.
