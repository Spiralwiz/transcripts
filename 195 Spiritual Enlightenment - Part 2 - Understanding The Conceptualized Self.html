            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/IX-oeoOqaYU' target='_blank'>Spiritual Enlightenment - Part 2 - Understanding The Conceptualized Self</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding The Conceptualized Self</b>: Leo discusses the illusion of self in spiritual enlightenment. 
</li><li>- <b>Questioning Self Identity</b>: Challenges conventional thoughts about self-identity being tied to a physical body, proposing the idea of self might not reside in the body but in the mind or consciousness. 
</li><li>- <b>Examining the Mind</b>: Explores whether fundamental self changes when parts of the brain are altered, encourages viewers to question their association with their mind. 
</li><li>- <b>Identifying with thoughts</b>: Questions if we are our thoughts or the entities creating the thoughts. Leo suggests our identification might not be with all our thoughts but with some specific mental phenomena or experiences. 
</li><li>- <b>Defining the Soul and Spirit</b>: Examines definitions of spirit and soul, criticizes preconceived notions influenced by societyÂ’s beliefs. Encourages viewers to conduct empirical investigations to experience their own soul and spirit firsthand, instead of relying on external input. 
</li><li>- <b>Self perception and Self image</b>: Discusses how we form our self-image by creating thoughts about ourselves. Asks if eliminating certain self-defining thoughts would change our fundamental identity in any way. 
</li><li>- <b>Theoretical vs Empirical Investigation</b>: Critiques the tendency to theorize about the self rather than examining empirical evidence. Advocates for an introspective, evidence-based approach to understanding self and refutes the efficacy of theoretical analyses.
</li><li><b>Conceptualizing Reality and Existence</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to question their assumptions about the nature of existence. He critically discusses the scientific model of the Big Bang, highlighting that it does not provide a satisfying explanation of what existed prior to the Big Bang, or why the universe is constantly expanding. He challenges the belief that something must come from something, suggesting that existence could have sprung from nothing. He compares existence to a bubble, proposing that we might be inside a bubble within a series of bubbles, like nested realities. However, he states that this theory still leaves unanswered questions about the origin of the largest bubble or ultimate level of existence. He also addresses the possibility that an entity, like God, created existence, but points out that this still begs the question of the origin of that entity. The overarching point Leo makes is that humans generally fail to grasp the true nature of existence, explaining that these mysteries persist since we're unable to venture outside of our existence to understand it thoroughly.
</li><li><b>Phenomenon vs Noumenon</b>: Leo introduces the philosophical distinction made by Immanuel Kant between phenomena, the sensory experiences we have of reality, and noumena, the things that exist beyond our sensory perception. This theory suggests that while details about an object, like an orange, can be directly perceived (its roundness, color, smell, taste), the 'true' object that lies behind these perceptions remains unknown, as it is always filtered through our senses. 
</li><li><b>Matter-Qualia Distinction</b>: He further presents the scientific distinction between matter, the physical composition of objects, and qualia, our subjective experiences of such objects. For instance, an orange's physical characteristics are composed of matter or energy, while our sensory experiences of the orange (its color, fragrance, etc.) constitute the qualia. Leo does not provide any solutions or assertions, rather his intent is to provoke deeper questioning and exploration of the mysteries of existence.
</li><li><b>Identity Tied to Physicality</b>: Leo Gura discusses that our identity is not solely based on our physical bodies, but also our minds or consciousness. He examines our beliefs about our sense of self and encourages viewers to consider the deeper layers of their identity beyond the physical body.
</li><li><b>Existence and Reality</b>: Leo investigates the nature of self, the reality of existence, the soul, and the spirit. He emphasizes that we may not be our thoughts, but the entities behind them. He criticizes the tendency to theorize without examining evidence and encourages an introspective approach to understanding the truth.
</li><li><b>Perception, Sensation, and Conceptualizations</b>: Leo introduces three types of entities: the actual thing, the sensations of that thing, and the perceptions or concepts of it. He highlights the difference between raw perceptions and concepts influenced by personal beliefs and attitudes. He elaborates on the role of concepts in the understanding of reality and self.
</li><li><b>Conceptual Living</b>: Leo suggests that humans live in the realm of concepts and overlay them on top of sensations, thereby creating a false sense of reality. He questions the concept of self and promotes the idea of pinpointing the 'real you'.
</li><li><b>Introduction of the Internal Voice</b>: Leo introduces the concept of the internal voice, explaining it as the constant stream of language and thoughts in our minds. He emphasizes the role of this internal voice in forming beliefs, objections, criticisms, and concepts about reality.
</li><li><b>Identity Formed by the Voice</b>: Leo questions the nature of the voice and who it's created by. He proposes that the voice is responsible for creating the concept of self and that these constructed concepts and beliefs may be preventing us from realizing our true selves.
</li><li><b>Concept of Labels</b>: Leo discusses the impact of labels and how they shape our understanding of reality. He introduces mindfulness as a tool to expand our consciousness and see the truth beyond labels.
</li><li><b>Perception and Existence</b>: Leo challenges the idea that a distinct self or entity perceives reality. He argues that there is only the reality, and perceptions and existence itself are mysterious and miraculous. He encourages viewers to consider the limitations of human intuition in understanding reality.
</li><li><b>Limited Human Intuition</b>: Leo argues that human intuition is shaped by basic needs and is limited in understanding the complex and intricate nature of the universe. He emphasizes the importance of not being confined by our intuitive understanding.
</li><li><b>The Journey of Self-Discovery and Enlightenment</b>: Leo invites viewers to join him on a journey of self-discovery and liberation from the limitations of our understanding. He advocates for the pursuit of enlightenment and the dismantling of constructed identities.
</li><li><b>Concepts as a smokescreen</b>: Leo Gura suggests that the concepts our inner voice constructs act as a smokescreen, preventing us from seeing what he refers to as the 'real', non-conceptualized self. He posits that the identification one has with their body and their self-image could be purely conceptual and not a physical reality. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the voice</b>: Leo challenges the authenticity of the inner voice, questioning whether it really defines who we are. He notes that the voice can create unfactual concepts and stories, leading him to suggest that our self-identification and self-image could be just as fictional. 
</li><li><b>Problematic identification with the physical body</b>: He further criticizes the automatic acceptance of the inner voice's assertion that 'I am the body'. He explains this identification with the body, stating that when we feel pain or distress, we instinctively believe we are incurring direct harm. 
</li><li><b>Exploring the essence of the self</b>: Leo queries what remains of the self if all thoughts and images were to be removed. He shows interest in exploring the profound question of one's true essence outside the influence of the inner voice and self-image. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the voice's construct of the self</b>: Leo discusses the construction of the self by the inner voice, describing it as a simple process. He illustrates this through imitation, showing how the voice carries a continuous narrative of thoughts, emotions, and identifications, all labeled as 'I'. 
</li><li><b>Imagery and perception</b>: Leo explores the idea of having a self-image, a mental representation that we identify with. Yet, he questions why we consider the things felt inside our bodies as part of us, but don't have the same identification with external objects we perceive. He suggests that feelings inside the body could just be being perceived in the same way as external objects.
</li><li><b>Challenge to existence within the body</b>: Leo Gura challenges the pervasive belief that we are confined to our bodies, suggesting that what we feel within ourselves might be distinct from our true selves. He urges the viewers to consider the possibility that our identification with our body could be as fictional as imagined scenarios. 
</li><li><b>The back of the head demonstration</b>: Leo further attempts to illustrate the idea of concepts by asking viewers to consider the back of their head. He explains that until confirmed by looking in a mirror, the concept of the back of our head exists merely as an image and thought, implying that our sense of self could be similar.
</li><li><b>Existential Questioning of the "Voice" Construct</b>: Leo Gura discusses the concept of the "voice" in our minds, which we trust implicitly. The "voice" constructs the very ideas of our existence, constantly generating labels that define our identities. However, Leo questions this trust placed in the "voice", pondering the validity and reality of these labels. He suggests that this process creates a "smokescreen" obscuring the realization of our true selves.
</li><li><b>The False Self and Label Elimination</b>: Our minds can be likened to a "spin doctor" that convinces us to believe in the constructs and labels that the "voice" creates. Getting rid of these labels provides an opportunity for self-reflection and questioning of the "real" self beyond the labels. Emerging from this smokescreen would require a different way of accessing the real self, not through labeling.
</li><li><b>Accessing Reality Beyond Labels</b>: Leo proposes the notion of developing mindfulness, awareness, or consciousness to see the truth beyond the labels created by the "voice". He suggests the possibility of not just 'seeing', but 'being' the truth, a state attainable by transcending the act of labeling that dominates human lives.
</li><li><b>Dissolving the Inner-Outer World Distinction</b>: Leo questions the conceptual distinction between inner and outer worlds. If this concept is broken, we would experience a merging of perceptions and reality, eliminating the disparities between them and establishing a state of being that is reality itself. This concept envisages the dissolution of the perceived individual self. 
</li><li><b>Difficulties in Dissolving Delusions About Self</b>: Dissolving notions of the inner-outer world distinction and the self would be challenging. It involves a deep disillusionment of life and self, an endeavor most people shy away from due to the convincing excuses given by the "voice". 
</li><li><b>Perceptions and the Question of a Distinct Perceiver</b>: Leo ends with a thought-provoking question about the existence of a specific entity perceiving existence. He suggests that perceptions and existence might be intrinsically interwoven, thus rendering the need for a perceiver unnecessary. This idea challenges fundamental assumptions about our existence and reality.
</li><li><b>Self-Perception and Existence</b>: Leo Gura discusses the paradox of self-perception, questioning how anything, or anyone, can truly see itself. He goes to the root of the question, asking who is actually seeing one's self. This search leads to the realization that there is no distinct observer, rather there is only external reality, suggesting that the perceived and perceiver merge. 
</li><li><b>Limited Human Intuition</b>: Leo Gura dissects how our perceptions of reality may not be as accurate as we assume, as our intuition is primarily driven by basic needs like hunger, shelter, and socialization. He reflects on the limitations of human intuition in comparison to the complexities of the universe, and cautions against being conceited about our ability to intuitively grasp the nature of existence.
</li><li><b>Flawed Human Intuition</b>: Leo explores how human understanding has repeatedly been proven wrong in history, from the idea of a flat earth to the concept of the earth being the center of the universe. He suggests that our intuitions may continue to be overturned as we dig deeper into fields like astronomy, cosmology, and quantum mechanics.
</li><li><b>Plausibility of Reality</b>: He challenges our conventional notions of what's plausible or implausible about reality and argues that such notions are heavily influenced by our limited human intuition. He encourages viewers to be open-minded and flexible in their understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Empirical Understanding of Self and Reality</b>: Leo expresses his excitement about the potential of merging perception and truth and seeing the self and reality as inseparable. He indicates that such union can result in profound personal discoveries and solve various life problems, adding that it can have practical benefits by helping to resolve psychological problems connected to false self-perceptions.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Enlightenment Journey</b>: Towards the end, Leo invites viewers to join him in this exploration of self and reality. He encourages them to sign up for his program where he shares more insights on the subject. He insists that pursuing this knowledge is highly rewarding as it releases individuals from the mental cages they live in, leading to personal liberation. 
</li><li><b>Connection Between False Self Perception and Life Blocks</b>: Leo states that every hindrance to one's life, whether it is in relationships, business or personal development, stems from the false self created by the individual's voice in their head. He suggests that by dispensing with the false conceptions of the self, not only can one gain insight into the nature of reality, but they can also liberate themselves from their own mental constraints.
