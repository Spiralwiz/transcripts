hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about self help ok let's
talk about self help and I love this topic because
I love self help and why do I love self
oh why why am I so passionate about it I
hope that I can transfer some of my passion about
self help to you because I think that this is
one of the most powerful ideas out there for improving
the quality of your life is self help I'm honestly
so passionate about it because of the effect of it
that I've seen on my own life I mean I've
proved it to myself and you can't have to go
through a process yourself to prove to yourself that self
help is something that can be really really valuable to
you and really really transform your life in amazing ways
the reason that I love sub help is because to
me it is the ultimate way to improve life and
to me it's very obvious that if I see a
tool that I can use in order to improve my
own life and to get everything that I want from
life get all the fulfillment that I want the peace
of mind the financial success that I want the relationship
success that I want the sex that I want the
the body that I want the fitness level that I
want the health that I want I want to do
whatever it takes to get that because to me when
I'm firing on all cylinders and I have all those
elements in place in my life and they're all doing
great then I'm feeling awesome and I'm feeling like I'm
living to my fullest potential and I'm excited and I'm
happy and I'm calm and I mean what else what
else do I want from life that's really all I
want is I want to be fulfilled I want to
be content I want to be con I want to
be secure and I want to be out there giving
my gifts and doing the best that I can be
doing and living the best kind of life that I
could be living and of course to do that requires
something more than what the average person does the average
person I would say goes through life and they do
the things that society kind of makes a parent and
makes easy and maybe even makes mandatory for you to
do what does that mean that means you go to
school that means you go to college that means you
go and you get married after that you get a
job and then you save up some money and then
you try to retire and you try to live healthy
and done whatever and then try to raise a family
and that's kind of how life flows and along the
way you learn a lot of lessons because you can't
go through that whole process to not learn stuff but
I think that the quality of life that the average
person has in this country is still not nearly even
5% of what it could be not even 5% of
what it could be and so when I realized that
and I saw that there are books and seminars and
ideas and tools and information out there that can make
the difference between living a life that's 5% of my
abilities and 99% of my abilities then I'm like wow
ok I'm on board I don't care what it takes
I'm going to study this stuff this stuff is awesome
this stuff can potentially do that there's stuff out there
that can potentially transform my life so much that I
can't even recognize where I came from there's information out
there that can completely revolutionize how I see the whole
world my model of reality make me successful make me
good in relationships make me good in areas of fitness
and nutrition like there's information out there that can do
that like wow that's amazing to me that's amazing because
I can easily imagine a universe or a world where
that's not the case I can easily imagine a universe
where you're born and then you grow up and then
you're stuck and you can't change and the conditions that
you were raised in are the ones that are now
going to be guiding your entire life and that you
can't do anything up to improve your money situation you
just have as much money as you always had you
can't do anything to improve your health you just are
the way that you were you can't do anything to
really change your relationships those are just going to go
in the same way that they've been going and probably
not very good in a dysfunctional sort of way and
you can't really recreate your career into a really thriving
we're either you're just kind of stuck at that original
job that you got to me that's like damn I
could easily imagine a universe that was like that and
in fact most people in the world live their lives
as though the world worked this way as though this
was reality they feel stuck in one or more of
these areas and I was like that too and I
still am that way is certain respect in areas of
my life not in any big areas I mean I
study this stuff so much I process so much self-help
material that it's basically impossible for me to now go
back and to play the victim in in any major
area of life but I still find myself playing a
minor victim in little parts of life but even that
I intend to basically burn out of my system through
self-help so this is ultimately why self-help is so cool
because everything that you want from your life whether it's
more money more women more men better relationships a marriage
happiness success fulfillment Fame recognition more knowledge more peace of
mind less stress more health all of that is yours
for the having it's all yours for the taking you
can take it you can have it but you are
gonna have to do some work and that work is
going to be called self-help self-help is really a movement
that started really started to thrive in the last 50
years that really took off has been popularized by a
lot of big-name self-help gurus out there people like Tony
Robbins and Jim Rohn and Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar
and just all the other big-name people out there who
are offering advice to ordinary folk on how to live
their lives right even someone like Oprah Winfrey I mean
what is she doing she's doing self-help she's showing you
how to improve your life in all these different ways
and on the surface you can see like self-help oh
that's so corny that's so silly so stupid that is
one of the worst mindsets that you can have because
if you think that self-help is silly or somehow it's
just blown up by the media or somehow it's just
positive thinking and that all self-help is is just positive
thinking and that it's just overblown through advertising and it
doesn't actually work you can't actually transform your entire life
like those are just rare examples of freak accidents you
can't actually lose a lot of weight you can't actually
earn millions of dollars you can't actually start an amazing
business you can't actually create an awesome family you can't
actually change how your relationships work Wow if you think
that if that's true for you then you are so
so so stuck and what's even worse is that not
only are you stuck but you've taken one of the
only tools that are out there self-help you've taken this
tool and you've basically thrown it aside and you've discounted
it which is Wow to me that's like I feel
very sorry for you because you have thrown away so
much you basically what you've done is you've thrown away
literally your entire life you throw an own throwing away
all of your potential in life when you hold that
mindset so that's a really dangerous one watch out what
I love about self-help is that there are books out
there there are information products out there there are CDs
there are seminars there are videos there are YouTube videos
there are websites there are blogs there are magazines there
are mentors there are people that can help you to
figure all this stuff out it's out there and most
of it is relatively inexpensive I mean there could be
expensed with self-help some of these CD products are expensive
sometimes I got to spend some money on books I
mean I've literally spent thousands of dollars on books thousands
of dollars on books seminars trainings video products I spent
thousands of dollars on that because to me it's worth
it I don't know what else I could be pouring
my money into in life that's more valuable than this
because here's how I think about it is that if
I read a bunch of books and I go to
a bunch of seminars and I talk with a bunch
of successful people that I'm going to get the wisdom
that I need and once I know and I have
the beliefs and the mindsets and the tools and the
techniques that I know I need then I can create
any kind of life that I want and to me
that's just like that's like wow this is the foundation
of it all and sometimes you can get discouraged because
you read a book you go to a seminar and
it doesn't quite click for you it doesn't quite give
you the promised results a lot of times this stuff
is a little bit overhyped a little bit over advertised
but that's just in the short room not in the
long run what I find with self-help is that this
is something you have to kind of become a hobbyist
in become a self-help junkie that's what I did I
mean I love doing this stuff I love reading I
love reading about self-help even if I don't get paid
for it even if it's not part of my job
I mean I started off and sort of studying self-help
for years before I really made it profession of it
and I don't think people necessarily need to make profession
of it you can just read self-help again a lot
of amazing nuggets to just help you out in the
everyday things that you're doing in your life the business
that you're running the families you've got the relationship that
you're in the health routine that you're trying to get
established whatever you don't have to become a self-help guru
to start to get some of the benefits of this
stuff but you do have to start to build up
a foundation and part of the trick with beginning self-help
is that you have to work a little bit at
the beginning to start to build up a foundation because
what people tend to do is instead of building a
foundation they just try to go and solve a problem
and they think that well I've got this one one
thorny problem if I could just fix that one problem
that I've got for example if I could just make
my marriage run smoother then that's it I don't I
don't need this self-help stuff it's stupid I just I'm
doing what if I want a technique that'll help me
fix my marriage or technique they'll help me attract that
girl in class that I really like or a technique
that will help me just overcome this problem that I'm
having with my business partner just my business partner we're
not getting along something there is going bad or my
money situation I just don't have enough money if I
could just pay my bill tonight if I could just
pay the bill by the end of this month then
I'm gonna be happy well that is a short bonded
way to look at your life at a short minded
way to look at self-help I mean maybe you can
get a technique or tip here or there that will
help you with that stuff but it's not going to
create that awesome foundation for creating extraordinary life to do
that I find that you need to become a little
bit more of a student not just a technique seeker
but a student start to read multiple books start to
bind to the idea that wisdom and knowledge is valuable
and important in the long run because the knowledge and
wisdom that you accumulate right now even from this one
video that I'm that I'm throwing at you here that
you're watching that's going to be knowledge that's going to
stick around for the rest of your life and 20
years from now you might remember this video and this
video might get you to go out there and buy
an extra self-help book or it might make it get
you to go out there and go go see a
seminar with somebody like Tony Robbins or go and maybe
hire a coach or maybe just go and you know
have a mentor who will mentor you for free find
a mentor there many mentors out there in the world
or it'll just get you to already pick up that
book that's already on your bookshelf without having to buy
anything just pick up the book that's already there and
read it one more time study it take some notes
on it maybe refresh your memory right that's going to
be the power that's the power of knowledge is that
it keeps coming back and paying dividends year after year
after year after year after year it's amazing because the
investment you make right now of reading a book sure
it's a little bit painful you'd rather go and party
with friends or watch some television that's more convenient understand
I do that too but the investment you make for
example in reading a book that investment will stick around
for the rest of your life and what happens is
that when you make a series of these investments if
you just read one book I mean they'll be nice
but what happens is that when you start to read
many books start to attend several seminars and you start
to really get involved with self helps really studying this
stuff then it like builds and builds and builds and
after a while it's almost like if you were managing
a portfolio of stocks you know if you just have
ten thousand dollars with a stock that's not really a
lot it's not going to do much for you but
when you get for example ten million dollars worth of
stock then just the the dividend payments every quarter on
that 10 million dollars is going to be enough to
basically live off of and you can quit your day
job I mean that's kind of like what it is
with self-help is that you start to build up and
build up and build up and after a while it
reaches a critical mass it reaches this critical mass where
you start to see dividends paying out disproportionate to the
amount of investment that you've made all along the way
and then you see that it's going to keep paying
out more and more and more and it's like oh
my god this is too good to be true I
can't believe that this is actually possible in in our
universe it's literally too good to be true but it
does take that initial building up of that critical mass
and so that means that the first year or two
of self-help might be a little bit slow for you
we have to trust that this wisdom will start to
kick in and that right now if you're reading a
book and you're kind of slipping up and you're not
getting that the results you want or maybe you watch
some of my videos and you follow along with my
videos and you're like saying yourself yes these videos are
awesome but then I go out I try some of
this positive thinking stuff right try some affirmations or I
do some technique here and it doesn't really seem to
change my life too much yes that can be that
can be the case but that's only because you've been
doing it for a very short period of time if
you study this stuff and you actually practice it and
you kind of stick with it for a couple of
years you're going to start to see that there's really
something here and you're going to start to build up
something extremely powerful you're going to create that foundation of
success for you from which everything else can be rising
out of you're literally going to create a foundation for
the skyscraper that's going to be your whole life and
every aspect of your life can become extraordinary because you're
gonna have the wisdom and the know-how and the self-control
that you need to help yourself out of any problem
in any situation that you've got in life it's really
quite amazing so this is where I'm going to wrap
it up in short what I'm going to say is
that actual ways to do self help let's summarize 1
reading books 2 attending seminars 3 buying and listening to
products video and audio products I can't recommend them enough
they're amazing for studying actually taking time throughout your day
to sit down and not just read this stuff or
go to a seminar but then actually study it process
it review your notes take notes ok what what's taxed
how about introspection actually sitting down and thinking about this
stuff maybe the shower or while you're on your way
to work we're actually dedicating a block of time like
a half an hour to sit and introspect about this
stuff I can't even articulate the benefits that that will
have for you if you just make a habit of
that how about journaling journaling is really really powerful as
a self help technique meditation meditation is also an extremely
simple a very very very powerful habit to build and
it's one of the most effective ways of doing self-help
coaching coaching is also great I am a life coach
I pitch my own services of course if you want
you can use me but go ahead and use any
other coach you want doesn't really matter coaching can be
a really really powerful way to break through some sort
of block that's holding you back so whether it's a
money problem that you've got or you've got some really
serious problems your relationship that's about to crumble or you
can't hold together your current career or the career that
you've got going for you isn't what you really want
to be doing coaching can be really good for tackling
one of those issues and helping you bust through it
so that it's never going to be another issue for
you in your whole life so that can pay big
dividends even though coaching can be a bit pricey because
it's the unperson to person one-on-one so there's all that
and then of course you have to actually go out
and take action pushing your comfort zone the bottom line
of how you do self-help is that you push your
comfort zone in any area of life that you want
to get better at when you push your comfort zone
there's going to be payoff from that mental payoff there's
going to be learning learning is going to be happening
wisdom is going to be created so not only do
you have to study this stuff but they have to
guy should go out there and ply it you have
to practice it and really start pushing your comfort zone
going in and leaning into your fear whatever it is
that you fear start doing those things the more you
do those the more lessons you learn the more self-developed
you become and the better able to to help yourself
in the future because when the new problem comes up
and a lot of times life is all about just
problems recurring and recurring recurring it's really nice to be
able to solve that problem once and for all by
yourself and then to be able to help yourself through
all the same problems that will be coming up for
you because what you're going to notice when you're doing
a lot of self-help is that there are some very
common threads between all the problems in life and then
actually when you get to the very core of them
and you break them down at the root and you
really understand them and solve them at their root then
it's like a cascade effect all of a sudden so
many different seemingly unrelated parts of your life and problems
in your life become automatically solved because you really solve
them at the root you've identified the root of the
problem alright this is Leo I'm signing off please post
