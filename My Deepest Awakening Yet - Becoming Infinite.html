[Music] you two days ago on February 22nd at 1:00
a.m. I experienced within a matter of 10 minutes what
I would call a total awakening a total enlightenment this
was an awakening unlike I had experienced up to this
point I have talked about in the past and I
have shown you even various awakening experiences that I've had
getting glimpses here and there understanding this and that putting
the pieces together and having these awakenings but what happened
on that night was just incredible defying all description and
all explanation it was a coming together of all the
pieces of all the facets of this multifaceted jewel that
we call enlightenment or non-duality and realizing that I am
everything that's what I became all boundaries disappeared and I
became infinite in infinite directions in infinite dimensions the materialist
paradigm completely melted away and all that remained was me
existing as infinity this everything that I'm seeing everything that
you're seeing right now is infinity itself it is the
absolute but conventionally you are experiencing only a little piece
of it and so you're identified with that little piece
and you're not sure how that little piece fits in
with what else is going on in the universe and
you don't know what reality is but here on this
night I became conscious of why all of reality exists
and why it is inevitable and why it must exist
precisely as exists at as it exists because what reality
is is simply infinity itself infinity is not something that's
hiding somewhere somewhere that you're not seeing this is infinity
right now you are at the very center of infinity
your Center but you see infinity is such a slippery
notion that what is the center of infinity you might
wonder what does that look like it's not some science
fantasy or some fiction that you dream up it is
precisely what you're experiencing right now you see by its
very nature infinity must include every single possibility and therefore
that means that you find yourself as an individual within
this infinite singularity but you're attached to your body and
you're attached to your mind and you're attached to your
present perceptual field and you feel like that's what confines
you well I broke through all those confines that night
and I realized that I am the entire singularity and
whereas I had experienced absolute infinity in various degrees before
and I've talked about that and I have episodes where
I explain the nature of absolute infinity and all that
and that's all valid but what was different about this
experience this Awakening was that I wasn't just understanding absolute
infinity as a sort of object that's separate from me
the way that I did in the past but I
actually became it and I became it so deeply that
it became my body the entire universe is my body
just the entire universe but every single possibility that could
ever possibly be I am and this is cog knives
any intellectual logical rational understanding or explanation it's not even
at the level of knowledge like this is something that
I know or something I've deduced or something that I
figured out know it's something that I am infinity is
my body there is nothing here there's nothing behind the
eyes there's nothing inside of me and in fact there
is no awareness and there is no consciousness there is
not even consciousness what there is is there is just
infinity imagine if you will that before the universe or
reality came into being there was just nothing imagine that
and right there you have created unwittingly created everything right
there that's it stop right there stop at nothing there's
nothing more it's not like there was nothing and that
a bunch of stuff got created somehow through some kind
of magical process or some scientific process or some sort
of inflationary BIGBANG or whatever it's not that it's that
there was always just nothing but then you say but
Leo what is all this stuff how did all this
stuff come into being then you don't get it yet
this is what nothing looks like nothing doesn't look like
an empty blank space or a black hole that's not
nothing this is precisely nothing my words are precisely nothing
my face is precisely nothing my body is precisely nothing
you are precisely nothing this room is nothing this entire
planet and star system and galaxies and universes precisely nothing
nothing is infinity infinity is all that there could ever
be every single object is just a part of what
it means for there to be infinity infinity is every
single possibility this is the most radical thing you could
ever possibly conceive of which is why you can't conceive
of it during this awakening my mind became infinite and
it traced through to the very infinite corners of the
universe it has of course no corners it goes on
forever and I went on forever and I felt it
and I felt the full consequences and ramifications of what
that means which means that I exist as absolutely everything
I exist as every single human being who ever lived
both past present and future I exist as every single
sentient creature every single life form that is ever possible
in every possible premutation doing every possible action that it
could possibly do I exist as every single possible decision
point of my life so if you imagine my life
as a human being I was born and then I
had all these little branching decision points like I could
have gone to this school or to that school or
I could have gotten married at this age or that
age or I could have sorted this kind of business
that kind of business or I could have walked outside
at 6 a.m. or at 6:01 a.m. or at 6:02
a.m. and all the possible pre mutations and combinations of
my life I am all of them simultaneously I could
have died a trillion times from the moment that I
was born to the moment that I'm alive now at
this age of 32 and I am all those pre
mutations and I'm I all the future pre mutations not
only of myself but of every human being in every
creature and not just a very creature not just all
the sentient and all the living creatures but also of
every inanimate object that could ever possibly exist I exist
as every possible inanimate object that ever existed exist now
or will ever exist I exist as every single creative
invention everything that is invented by human beings creatively every
piece of artwork every piece of music every film every
video game every work of literature every poem I exist
as all of those they they all come from me
because I am infinity and infinity entails absolutely every possible
thing that could ever be created existing simultaneously and yet
at the same time none of it actually exists because
existence negates itself infinity is an object which negates its
own existence so at the same time it exists and
does not exist in fact it's beyond existence and non-existence
it is just infinity that's it that's why there is
everything but of course to you it doesn't feel like
there's everything and that's precisely because everything must include you
feeling like right now you're not experiencing everything infinity must
include all possible finitude z-- every possible limitation is contained
within that which is ultimately unlimited and that's it that
answers everything this infinity is not something that comes into
being over time it's not something that evolves it's not
something that God creates it's just the only possibility that
there is is infinity there just infinity they're always only
was infinity there will always only be infinity it's one
object it's one mega object which contains within it every
other possible object it's the ultimate superset it's the set
of all sets the set of all possible sets that's
what reality is and that's what I am and there's
no difference whatsoever between my physical body or my mind
and the camera that I'm looking at or the light
that is shining upon me or this wall or this
carpet or this chair or this coffee table or that
tree or that dog or that human being or that
anything all of them are equivalent and identical to myself
literally they are physically me all there is is there
as being being that's what this stuff is this is
not consciousness there is no perception going on right now
there is only being and it doesn't look like anything
other than what is here I'm not talking about some
magical state I'm not talking about some sort of flying
unicorns and and auras and astral projecting yourself somewhere to
some different realm or universe some other dimension sure all
those might exist there might be unicorns on some planet
far away in a different galaxy sure there could be
that and if there is that I am that unicorn
I am that planet I am that galaxy I am
every possibility including this one right here first and foremost
that's what I realized when I realized this there was
no emotional fireworks there was no jumping up and down
it was such a staggering and profound realization it was
such a clear it's just such a clear and obvious
fact that I just I just sat there for for
about 60 minutes just like this just holding holding my
breath holding my mouth at the at the all of
it realizing what I was realizing and knowing for sure
that this is the ultimate answer this is the answer
that I was seeking it's the answer to why anything
exists at all and how it could possibly come into
being that was perfectly clear to me this was clear
on a plane of consciousness which is unlike any normal
plane of consciousness so the plane of consciousness that you're
on right now cannot understand what I'm talking about this
is a a radically different plane of consciousness and you
do not know how to get to that plane of
consciousness from the one that you're at right now because
it's a such a radically different plane of consciousness at
that plane of consciousness you no longer care about identification
with yourself you no longer care about living or dying
that is sort of the universal perspective you're sort of
switching from the human perspective and you're jumping into the
universal perspective which is just a runaway chain reaction of
being infinite forms every possible form that could ever possibly
be and the substance of these forms is nothing it's
undefined being is undefinable you can't say anything about he
can't say that it exists or does not exist you
can't say it's an illusion or it's on to lose
you can't say it's real or unreal you can't say
anything about it but when I'm talking to you the
best way to get you the right idea about it
is to say that it's as though you're experiencing an
infinite hallucination or an infinite hologram that's sort of what
reality is like it's just like this infinite hologram it's
hollow that's why they call it the void it is
the void with a capital T and a capital V
but the void is not a hole the void is
this this is the void this is the absolute so
that's what I became conscious of now how did this
happen how did this awaken and get triggered let me
give you a bit of the backstory it's rather interesting
well as you may know I just came back from
a Hawaii meditation retreat but this awakening did not happen
there I actually shot about three hours of footage from
Hawaii which I'm process of uploading right now it takes
a while to upload all this content so I'm gonna
upload those videos they'll be available in a few days
on my blog exclusively on my blog you won't see
it on my You Tube channel so go check it
out there when it's available there's some juicy insights for
you there but I came back from this Hawaii retreat
it's seven days they are meditating a lot and I
had some mixed results I had some great lessons and
learnings but also I had some failures which you'll see
if you watch those videos and I didn't get any
big breakthroughs but I came back and I was much
more conscious of course as you are after a long
retreat meditating morning till night but I was also frustrated
I was frustrated with my lack of progress I was
frustrated because I felt like I should have gotten more
from that retreat I was frustrated with self-inquiry because I
feel like I've been doing self inquiry for four years
now and I've been beating this dead horse over and
over again and and I just I wanted to to
put an end to the seeking so I scheduled an
energy transmission session with with an enlightened psychic this I
actually scheduled before I even went on the Hawaii retreat
it was on my books for close to a month
and I paid good money for it and I just
wanted to try this out as an experiment so what
this is is this is traditionally called Shakti pot you
might have heard about this if you read a lot
of the can-do traditions where traditionally you have gurus and
certain gurus if they have cities or they have paranormal
abilities which you know some people believe in them some
people don't believe in them but uh these cities can
be real for sure which is not to say there
aren't scammers out there but you can definitely find a
guru who has cities and one of the cities is
the ability to transmit consciousness just through looking at you
not even touching you just is sort of called an
energy transmission or Shakti pot so I scheduled one of
these sessions just because I like to experiment with stuff
I like to try all sorts of crazy stuff I
wasn't like you know uh totally certain that it would
work in fact I was like fifty-fifty like maybe it
doesn't at all maybe it works someone maybe it works
totally I don't know maybe they'll help me it'll help
me finish my job so I hope that it was
sort of like finished me put it in to the
seeking because that's supposedly what it could do and supposedly
it only really helps those people who are already on
the edge who have already had awakenings but their awakenings
maybe they've had them but they haven't stuck or they've
had them but it's like they're still half-baked not fully
realize you know those sorts of cases it doesn't usually
work when you take someone off the street and just
do it on someone who has no idea of what
what enlightenment is so I scheduled this and the day
before I was supposed to have this session I was
excited for it when my head hit the pillow that
night though my intuition kicked in and I just listened
to it and said you can't do this you must
walk this path solo and I had to listen to
my intuition I didn't want to listen to it because
I was frustrated with seeking so I'd be glad to
put it into it if I could and I was
I'm also I'm interested in experimenting with stuff so I'm
interested in trying out new stuff and just seeing how
it works but what my intuition told me here is
that my job was to follow through on the methods
that I have started already specifically my job was to
prove the five Meo DMT path my job was to
as I said a year and a half ago when
I started with psychedelics and with five Meo DMT my
job was to prove that it was possible to become
totally enlightened through five Meo DMT and I felt like
and that's what my intuition was telling me is that
if I did this transmission thing and that if it
worked that would actually that would that would be that
would be breaking my path so the next day I
declined the transmission even though I paid good money for
it and that was that and then I was pretty
bummed out for the rest of that day because you
know I was second-guessing myself yeah I listen to my
intuition but then how do you distinguish between whether it's
your intuition or your ego was that just arrogance was
it my pride was it my not wanting to get
help from other people and maybe that was just my
spiritual ego coming into play No so I was sort
of dealing with all this second-guessing myself but also in
the back of my mind I also kind of knew
that that was the choice I had to make yes
this made my work more difficult and so of course
I was bummed out for the rest that day because
I was wondering like well how long is it gonna
take me now how many more years am I gonna
keep doing this stupid self inquiry keep having these glimpses
and awakenings but then not finishing and and still feeling
like there's there's more to find still feeling like I
don't really understand why reality exists and why it's here
that was my ultimate driving question and I still felt
like yeah I had some insights into it but just
like there was more I knew there was more I
felt there was more and so I got a bummed
out about that and then at around midnight of that
night my intuition kicked in again told me that now
it's time to do five Meo DMT right now tonight
and usually I don't do psychedelics on short notice usually
I plan them out a few days ahead a week
ahead I never just get this urge so just do
some psychedelics and I run off and do them net
almost never never do I do that for for safety
reasons but in this case my intuition was telling me
you gotta get into it now because you've declined that
path now follow through on this path and what's interesting
about that is that I haven't done five Meo DMT
in one and a half years ever since my big
big big breakthrough which I shot a video about I
hadn't done it I feel another psychedelics which I've talked
about and I've I've posted reports on I've even posted
videos of so yeah I've done those but five Meo
you got to understand that five amiyo is no ordinary
psychedelic this is a East all onto itself so I
was scared to go back I really needed that one
and a half years just to fight to fully integrate
that massive massive breakthrough mm experience that I had one
and a half years ago I needed all that time
and I needed all these smaller trips to fully integrate
to think it all through and I still wasn't totally
sure if I was ready but I listened to my
intuition because I sort of now committed to this path
and I said okay I'll do a baby dose I'll
do the smallest dose I've ever done which is ten
milligrams before that I did 12 milligrams that was my
that was my small stuff this is 10 million I
just wanted to kind of ease my way back into
it because I knew that I've done a lot of
integrating a lot of growing and I'd become much more
sensitive over the last one and a half years so
I knew that I couldn't just take a massive dose
it might be way too strong even ten milligrams I
wasn't sure what that was gonna do now for most
people ten milligrams will just make their heart pound and
not much more than that you won't have any super
profound spiritual experiences on ten milligrams for most people so
I took this baby dose and my intuition further told
me that I have to try a new method of
administration before I snorted it other people like to smoke
it I don't like to smoke it and hear it
said I have to try it rectally so I took
a small needle this syringe no needle and I administered
it rectally by dissolving in some water it's not as
disgusting as it sounds and and literally within five minutes
it came on it comes on ridiculously fast you won't
believe how fast it comes on rectally I mean it's
pretty much the same speed as through your nose you
just think that you know it would take longer fur
to travel up to your brain from your butt but
no it takes about five minutes that's all it takes
it comes on very quickly so what I did is
I just laid on the floor and wait for five
minutes for this thing to come on I had fear
I had uncertainty my heart was pounding I didn't know
how deep was this was gonna go and I felt
man maybe it's gonna go too deep and then it
happened precisely around the five-minute mark what happened is that
all my fear sort of just crescendoed and then just
melted away within about a minute after the five minute
mark it just melted away and then I just eased
my way into absolutely infinite consciousness all borders collapsed all
sense of being my body collapsed and just as crystal
clarity I just ascended into this new plane of consciousness
from which I became everything and I just looked around
the room there was no funky visuals it was a
very calm and you might almost say sober trip there
was very little monkey mind there was very little of
any kind of distractions or this or that or body
highs is there like very little of anything it was
just pure consciousness just my consciousness became infinite that's all
that happened that's the magic of five Meo and especially
with this new administration method which I sort of discovered
here for myself and have proven now to myself this
to me now is the perfect administration method because it's
smoother and it's more gradual than snorting or smoking and
this is actually ideal it's especially ideal when you want
to fully understand get that that calm state of mind
to fully understand in a in a sort of meditative
state you just fully understand exactly what's happening there's no
doubt there's no there's no questions there's no like one
real what's going on with me and what is this
thing and what is that thing like sometimes when you
take a trip on mushrooms or some other substance LSD
or whatever DMT then you know weird stuff happens and
you're not sure why it's happening what it means or
where it's going none of that happened here here it
was just perfectly clear awakening and so I just awoke
and this was the deepest awakening that I've ever experienced
deeper than even my 30 milligrams of five mio DMT
which I took a year and a half ago which
just thrust me into the absolute but in a way
that I still felt separate from the absolute and I
still felt like the absolute in that trip was like
an object that was separate for me and also separate
from my present experience whereas here what was so remarkable
was that the absolute wasn't separate from me or some
other object it wasn't some void somewhere that I glimpsed
it was my living experience it was my entire body
every single object over looking at a book I remember
looking at a bunch of books on my coffee table
and all these books that I could just I can
just see infinity infinity and fitness just infinity of course
every book here must exist exactly as it sits every
angle of every book every book on my bookshelf must
be arranged precisely in that manner because that's exactly what
absolute infinity entails it entails every possible arrangement of every
possible book of every possible character in every possible book
that has ever been written and the way that they're
arranged right now on my table it entails everything there's
nothing which is excluded and so that's how it happened
the peak of the experience lasted for about an hour
and a half usually five Meo if you snort it
it lasts at most 40 minutes by 45 minutes you're
completely down to baseline when you take it rectally it
lasts about twice as long it's more mild it's more
gentle it's more smooth but it also feels much more
stable and more consistent and you have time to really
soak in more of it it doesn't just hit you
like a sledgehammer over your head to the point where
you're so dizzy you're spinning around you got stars you
know over your head and little Tweety birds you don't
really understand what's going on here it's just like imagine
if you could go from being an ordinary person to
being a Zen meditators meditated for 40 years Zen master
who is metadata every day for 40 years and you
could just transition from being a regular person who's never
meditated to being this forty years than master and you
were able to do that within the span of five
minutes that's what it is as this happened to me
I also felt chakras opening especially in my head I
felt changes in energy I felt my entire mind rewiring
itself I felt this chakra here the third eye chakra
and the crown chakra opening up I don't know if
they were opened completely I guess not but there was
there was definitely stuff going on there I especially became
very sensitive to that because over the last month I
have a yoga practice that I've been doing to open
up all my chakras and so I've becoming more and
more sensitive to that and so the five amiyo just
synergized perfectly with that and I felt like there was
there was a sort of permanent rewiring going on there
and then after about an hour and a half the
whole thing just kind of gradually subsided but my understanding
didn't go away in fact this understanding is so obvious
and so simple that like it's not dependent upon an
experience it's not dependent upon a state right now I'm
standing here before you I'm not on any kind of
special mystical state but it's very clear to me that
all of this is the absolute the relative is the
absolute that's the most complete form of enlightenment that there
is is to realize that the relative and the absolute
are one form is formlessness infinity is nothing God is
this this is God I am God I am every
possible configuration no matter what state I'm in it's infinite
and there's no dying because it's just one object it's
infinity so infinity just has all these different forms that
it takes so of course this body will die all
these perceptions will end and what'll happen then well infinity
goes on that's also part of in my death is
a part of infinity my death as a as a
human being s there's two one one configuration of infinity
out of infinite configurations of infinity and there's no there's
there's no difference between this body versus some other body
so even though this body will die other body will
live on and if that body dies if all the
human beings on this planet die from some nuclear holocaust
doesn't matter because the planet will still remain if the
entire planet gets destroyed through some death star machine doesn't
matter because the Sun will remain once the Tsar gets
the star the Sun gets extinguished because you know billions
of years pass and it just dies out from from
heat death and maybe collapsed into a black hole it
doesn't matter because the black hole is there if the
black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation and then there's nothing
left and the entire universe goes into heat death it
doesn't matter because there's infinite other universes and I am
all of them and if all of them die it
doesn't matter either because I am NOT existing in any
particular configuration any particular time but I am every possible
configuration across all times simultaneously I've already occurred forever and
I will occur forever and so there there can be
no such thing as death and of course there really
is no such thing as life either there's just infinity
that's all it is it's just infinity but you have
to understand that infinity is not a one-dimensional thing like
on a number line you have from zero to infinity
one two three four five to infinity you know that's
just the natural numbers to infinity that's not infinity infinity
is this you're experiencing it right now this is absolute
infinity that number line that's just one dimension of infinity
you need to imagine an object which is infinitely dimensional
and then what you get is you get this you
get reality you get me saying these words right now
to you and every other possible word that I could
say in every possible configuration those are also all being
said but you're not experiencing them right now because hey
someone has to be experiencing these particular words because infinity
means someone has to be experiencing these particular words right
now and so that's the version of infinity that you're
living out right now and somebody else is living out
some other version and there's infinite versions there's infinity with
infinity with infinity with infinity I could say an infinite
number of words and that's just one little infinity within
the larger infinity I could look at infinite number of
ways and so could you and I could have an
infinite number of feelings there could be an infinite number
of colors and the number of sizes and shapes and
configurations and physical laws and all of it is and
all of it is of course nothing as well because
form is emptiness and emptiness is form and this is
just completely apparent to me it's not just something I
know it's something that I am so you might wonder
Lea what changed after this experience okay so you came
down from the five Meo and then what what changed
well firstly like I said is now I have perfect
knowledge of what reality is there's no questions anymore I
know what it is there's no mystery anymore it's the
ultimate answer it's the answer that you cannot get through
science no matter how much science you do which touch
these signs is bad she's not to say science is
wrong or you should stop doing science but science will
never get you this answer because every thought that there
is is infinite I am science I am religion I
am rationality I am irrationality I'm a very possibility of
every possible thought that can be thought whether it makes
sense or doesn't doesn't matter whether it's true or not
doesn't matter whether it's true sighs or false science whether
pseudoscience whether it's religious mumbo-jumbo or new ageism or whatever
whether it's some conspiracy theory or some outlandish hoax or
scam it doesn't matter I am all those you see
it's a complete transcendence of knowledge knowledge dissolves into being
there is only being knowledge is really just being so
that changed there's a sense of satisfaction very deep satisfaction
in knowing what everything is and why it has to
be this way that has changed for me there is
also a cessation of seeking I was very much driven
by seeking for the last four years and relief if
I think back for the last 20 years since I
was a teenager I was fascinated by why does everything
exist I wanted to know and now it seems like
that that journey of 20 years from my early teenage
years through philosophy and through all the self-help and through
all this non duality and all this seeking and all
these retreats and all this sort of stuff that this
seeking has ceased because there's like nothing to seek anymore
and that's that's that's really satisfying because there's a lot
of suffering that goes on with seeking now the mistake
that people make this is the neo-advaita trap as they
say oh we'll stop seeking there's nothing to see because
in life it doesn't exist you're already enlightened no doesn't
work like that you've got to seek really really hard
and suffer the seeking yes the seeking creates suffering yes
the seeking is egoic but you still got to do
it you got to go through all that seeking to
get to a point where then you actually arrive at
the ultimate understanding and then of course the seeking is
not necessary anymore the seeking has brought you to your
destination but don't think that you can stop seeking before
you've gotten to the destination that would be like imagining
that hey I want to drive from Los Angeles to
New York and yeah maybe I don't need to drive
maybe I'm already at in New York so maybe I'll
just leave my car parked and somehow magically I get
to New York no you're not gonna get in here
to get to New York from Los Angeles you got
to drive two and a half thousand miles or however
many miles it is you got to drive that and
you got to endure all the problems along the route
and that route you better believe there's gonna be like
flat tires and you got to fuel your gas and
you got to like fix your broken engine and oil
change oil all this sort of stuff you got to
do all that you got to go through the suffering
of all that to get to New York and once
you get to New York then you can say oh
yeah of course I don't need my car anymore because
now I'm in New York but until you're in New
York you need your car it would be very foolish
to throw away your car while you're still in Los
Angeles or halfway along your journey because wherever you throw
away your car that's where you're gonna be this isn't
rocket science very simple logic but still a lot of
people get this wrong what else has changed for me
is that there is an increase in my baseline level
of awareness so I'm not in some sort of blissed-out
state right now I'm not as a little hyper mystical
or psychedelic trance I'm just in my normal state of
consciousness my normal state of awareness but it's raised I'm
just more aware of what everything is like I'm picking
up an object I'm aware that it's infinite I'm aware
that it's inevitable because this is all part of absolute
infinity what else has changed for me is that my
meditation has skyrocketed and in particular what has helped with
my meditation is that before it was difficult for me
to do meditation because I was always seeking so when
I sit down to do meditation I'm seeking for you
know answers to these deep existential questions which actually is
counterproductive meditation because the point of meditation is just just
to sit and be still so now I'm able to
sit and just be still a lot better than before
because now I feel like well I've already got my
answer so there's nothing to search for so all there
is is for me just to sit and to be
as infinity and so here I just sit and I
be infinity and that's all that meditation sort of boils
down to now what else has changed for me is
that I'm very aware that everything is totally inevitable every
possibility is so what are you complaining about what are
you criticizing who are you judging what are you moralizing
about you don't like that person you don't like that
group of people you don't like that politician you don't
like that jerk you don't like that violent person you
don't like this Nazi you don't like that guy okay
so so what are you complaining about absolute infinity includes
every single possibility it includes all the good and includes
all the evil and it must be that way it
cannot be otherwise so you complaining about it is completely
pointless and yet at the same time it's completely inevitable
that you're complaining because absolute infinity must of course include
you complaining about things that are inevitable but still you're
complaining about them but of course if you want you
could stop complaining about them and then absolute infinity will
also include that possibility of you realizing hey there's no
point in complaining and yeah that possibility is also part
of absolute infinity so that's really huge for me because
that is the key insight that allows you to stop
to stop rejecting life to stop rejecting reality right when
you realize that it can only be absolute infinity then
you realize that there's no point in resisting anymore everything
must be accepted you would be a fool not to
accept it see it would sort of be like judging
I don't know like like judging your dog for going
to the bathroom period like ever I don't mean going
to the bathroom on your carpet or on your couch
yeah you can get mad about that because you know
dogs aren't supposed to do that but I mean imagine
if a person bought a dog and then every time
the dog took a dump at all anywhere even on
the grass he would get upset about it just like
every time you're like why are you taking a crap
why stop it stop taking a crap imagine if there
was a human being who had that attitude towards the
dogs towards his dog well you could see that person
would be frustrated his entire life and for no good
reason because his expectations are just completely wrong a dog
can't be a dog unless it takes a crap it's
a living creature all living creatures need to expel waste
alright that's enough now of course it's not inevitable that
they need to take a crap in your shoe so
okay maybe you get mad about that but it's inevitable
that dogs need to poo okay you can't stop them
you can't sew their butthole shut so the mistake there
isn't with the dog the mistake there is with the
person who has these silly expectations about the dog well
now let's take that analogy and now expand it to
everything everything is absolutely inevitable so what are you criticizing
are you criticizing that your dog is taking a dump
in your shoe or on your carpet or on your
dining room table but that's also inevitable now you would
say olio but we can change the dog we can
train the dog to stop doing that yes and that's
also inevitable it's inevitable that you can and it's notable
that you can't it's notable that people kill each other
it's inevitable that people rape each other it's inevitable that
there are concentration camps it's inevitable that there's Hitler it's
inevitable that there's terrorists it's nevertheless there are school shooters
now you might say alia but we can pass gun
laws to stop school shootings yes you can that's also
inevitable every single possibility is inevitable you might say alia
but we can prevent all those deaths of all all
these innocent people yes you can maybe if you can
but it's also inevitable that you can't every possibility is
here every single one that's why it's so staggering of
an insight you see not just to know this intellectually
as a theory or a philosophy but to actually to
experience it as being the case it completely stops all
your criticism and all your rejection of reality just cold
it's like you can't reject anything anymore everything is you
what are you rejecting everything is literally your body it's
sort of like a magic you were walking around and
you were angry at your pinky for being a part
of your hand and every time you see your pinkie
you get mad at it because like why are you
here I don't want you to exist you shouldn't be
here that's what you're doing when you're criticizing or you're
judging other people or situations you're not realizing that it's
inevitable every mistake is inevitable ignorance is a notable evil
is inevitable as well as everything else so that has
changed for me that's a--that's a very important it's a
very important insight to have because that really changes your
whole attitude towards people changes your whole attitude towards situations
now in a bad situation happens yeah of course I
prefer that it doesn't happen but it's also like I
realize oh yeah of course it had to happen it's
inevitable there's no point in complaining about it aside from
these things not much else has changed my mind is
still chatty and quite active I do not have some
sort of zen-like no mind suffering still happens I'm not
in a blissful state and I'm not free of all
emotional suffering something doesn't go my way and I get
triggered by it yeah and I don't want it to
be that way or if I'm experiencing pain in my
body and I don't like it and kind of makes
me annoyed or frustrated causes me suffering yeah that still
happens definitely um and I can still get triggered by
stuff and you know big calamities and crises could happen
my life and those interfere with my agenda and if
I'm really attached to my agenda I want my agenda
B to be successful then of course that's gonna affect
me and I'm gonna suffer for that my addictions are
still present my I have some internet addictions that I'm
working on I have some smartphone addictions you know stuff
like that is still there those didn't go away there
was need additional work my sexual cravings have not changed
at all pretty much in fact maybe they're even stronger
than before because I feel more free I feel more
passionate I feel like I more energy I feel like
chakras have opened up and stuff is flowing more smoothly
so actually the sexual drive is very strong and and
yeah so some of those you know enlightenment gets idealized
a lot and I don't know you know people can
have different levels of enlightenment different degrees of enlightenment and
different amounts of embodying their enlightenment so for some people
you know they could they have an insight and maybe
it does stop all their suffering and maybe does quiet
their mind completely and maybe does stop their sexual cravings
and all this and maybe now they are and some
blissed-out state for me that's not the case I'm just
saying you know there's different kinds of awakenings that people
have and of course it depends your awakenings your psychedelics
will be different than your awakening through meditation will be
different than your awakening through some shock teapot will be
different than your awakening through some other thing can be
different or they can be the same you know there's
there's just a lot of complexity and variability there so
be careful not to oversimplify this awakening process and there's
different facets of things you can awaken to so what
was really remarkable about this awakening that I had I
felt was just how complete it felt it felt like
all the pieces came together I became conscious of what
I am I became conscious of what reality is I
became harshest of why reality is I became conscious of
what other people are I became conscious of just like
I don't know I don't know I maybe there's a
few facets that I missed I didn't really get a
strong sense of like absolute infinite love I've had those
before I didn't get so much of that so maybe
the love component was a little bit lacking in that
in this awakening but I was like a lot of
stuff came together for me now you might wonder well
leo is this really total enlightenment or are you just
kidding yourself and what's total really mean so again I'm
using that word don't take it too seriously I'm using
it rather loosely here mostly I use that word total
because that's how it felt for me in the moment
it felt total that doesn't mean there aren't more total
ones it just felt totally for me in the moment
and it has certainly been the most total out of
the ones that I've had and I've had a handful
now probably five or so I don't know I've stopped
counting them so of them all for me it felt
like the most total you know I asked Peter Ralston
once what was the deepest enlightenment or awakening that he's
ever had and I'll never forget his answer is very
very profound he kind of looked at me puzzled then
he said you know they were they were all the
deepest and that's right that's exactly how it feels because
when you're having your awakening you're so present in the
moment there's no there's no other there you're not comparing
this moment to anything else so whatever's happening in that
moment feels total by definition but nevertheless even if that's
true still when you're comparing different awakenings across time then
some of them are more total than others so how
do you judge that well just subjectively it's the subjective
judgment what does a total enlightenment really mean across the
board for everybody I don't know you know that's I
think that people are too variable to use such a
simplistic label and there's way too many components and nuances
to enlightenment to just to call it to call it
total for everybody it's the same thing what I felt
though or what I feel now is if you're familiar
with the the ten ox herding pictures which is a
map for the stages of enlightenment ten different stages from
the Zen tradition that it feels like now I'm at
the point where I've passed stage 4 which is catching
the Ox I've caught the Ox that's what it felt
like and now I'm moving into Sage 5 which is
Taming of the Ox now that's just stage five that's
like only half the steps now there's five more steps
beyond that which I won't get into here I'll shoot
an episode about those stages in the future the the
Tanakh starting pictures but you know there's more stages so
what happens after you catch the Ox is basically a
form of of mastery a form of taming the Ox
riding the Ox back home and and all the transcending
the Ox all the sorts of stuff so I don't
consider myself a master by any means I feel like
I still have much more room for growth I still
feel like personal development basic psychological methods and techniques still
have a lot of relevance for me there's still a
lot of emotional stuff that I want to work on
a lot of basic personal development stuff that I want
to work on so it's not like I have transcended
self-actualization work not by any means I still feel and
expect that there will be deeper indictments in the future
so by no means am I saying that I have
maxed myself out or that I have reached you know
the promised land that I now I'm not gonna do
anything anymore no I'm actually very motivated to do more
personal development work and I'm very motivated just to to
sit and it's a sort of bask in the at
that infinity and quiet my mind down even more and
just sort of let that infinity um rewire my mind
maybe open up my chakras and all that sort of
stuff and very importantly I feel like I've proven the
five of mio path for myself and I can't really
speak about how effective five amiyo will be for you
but if you are like me then you will discover
if you do five of you know that it is
the single most powerful most direct and most no-nonsense tool
that exists for this work it is the most pure
path to absolute consciousness that there is that I have
to ever discovered or learned about or studied and I've
I've experimented with a lot of different techniques and different
traditions it's just in a class all by itself and
what's so sad is that so few people know about
it and I've talked to quite a few enlightened masters
about five Mao DMT and usually what they do is
they just dismiss it you say oh that's just a
psychedelic that's just a drug that's just a substance that's
not real enlightenment that doesn't really work it can't really
work you can't really become enlightened by putting a chemical
into your brain I have completely shattered that myth for
myself now you can say all ilio but what if
you're deluded how do you really know what if you're
just hallucinating what if you're just kidding yourself from your
perspective yeah I could be lying to you I could
be deluded I could be hallucinating or whatever but from
my perspective there's no way I know what I know
I know what I've experienced the absolute is the absolute
and the effectiveness of five Meo at taking you to
the absolute is just mind-blowing it just baffles me that
such a technology exists it baffles me it just baffles
me it will it will utterly baffle you when it's
happening to you when that five Meo is working on
you within five minutes you will be completely and utterly
baffled not just by your awakening which will be a
very deep and real awakening but by how you got
there that's the most amazing thing is how you got
there and how easy and effortless it really is compared
to spending 40 [ __ ] years meditating every day
on in some Zen monastery and still and still many
of those those Zen masters have not gotten to the
ultimate level of understanding many of them still understand why
the universe exists sure they've had glimpses here and there
and they've you know become conscious of stuff that had
their Satori experiences but you know there's so much depth
there's so many layers to this stuff how deeply have
you experienced it is the question so what's left for
me you might wonder well a lot of stuff is
left for me as far as development embodiment now my
focus is gonna be on embodiment I want to embody
the infinite as much as I possibly can in my
in my words in my in my actions in my
emotions in my behaviors in my meditation sessions in my
communications with other people in my relationships everywhere and that's
the bulk of the work it feels like now the
work has really begun what's left for me is basking
in the being just sitting in the stillness I feel
like I need to spend hundreds thousands of hours just
sitting in the stillness if I wasn't running actualised org
I would probably buy a cabin in the woods and
go live there for a couple of years not to
speak to anybody and just sit there and just bask
in the stillness that's what's necessary to to really embody
and master this stuff I feel like I still need
to work towards a state of no-mind my mind is
still very active I have always been extremely conceptual that
has been my greatest obstacle on this path it's very
clear to me now in retrospect it's been a big
much bigger obstacle than it is for most people because
I'm much more conceptual than most people I think my
mind works slightly differently than most people's minds so you
know it's precisely because the five of mio is so
effective and so and so fast that it doesn't require
you to steal your mind because if you're like in
a Zen monastery the only way you're gonna reach a
natural experience of the absolute like five Meo will show
you is through silencing your mind so much over years
and years and years that by the time you experience
the absolute your minds gonna be very very very quiet
well with the five Meo it's a little bit different
it's like you get the absolute now but then you
got to do the follow-up work to quiet down your
mind cuz your mind's basically just gonna be as active
as before because these are habits of the mind which
have nothing to do with the absolute really these are
separate things and people sometimes confuse them but still I
noticed that my thoughts can cause me suffering and that
actually my thoughts are probably my chief source of suffering
and so for me to really embody the absolute and
embody that sort of stillness and bliss I need to
quiet down my mind so I'm just gonna be spending
a lot of time just sitting in stillness meditating and
I'm much more sort of I guess eager to meditate
because before if I like meditation was always directed towards
a goal whereas now it feels like when I meditate
there is no goal and I can just let go
now of course I should have been doing that from
the very beginning but see the problem is you don't
know that until after you've had your awakening that's only
clear in retrospect it's like oh yeah I should have
been doing that from day one but for four years
I haven't been doing that okay yeah now I know
better it works like that what else is left for
me is emotional mastery I still have a lot of
emotional stuff they got to work through fears and anxieties
and petty pettiness and jealousy and this sorts of stuff
you know still that stuff needs to be worked through
clearing up my chakras and energy blockages in my body
that's something that's big that I'm working on right now
I'll definitely talk about that in the future don't worry
it's a very important component of of this whole path
of personal development very very important it's also quite a
complicated subject a lot of nuances there how to actually
do that there's a lot of different possible techniques there's
various pitfalls that you can fall into there's ways you
can damage yourself and do it the wrong way but
you know I have my yoga practice for that so
I'll be using my yoga practice and some other techniques
which I'll discuss in the future for how to unblock
these energy blockages and my I feel like also my
my physical health is connected so I have some physical
problems with my health I feel like those are also
connected to energy blockages that I have so I got
to work on those I got to work on removing
certain addictions from my life like I said already I've
got to work on living more healthy cleaning up my
diet even more and just cleaning up my environment and
healthy living overall I'm very passionate about that I got
to work on developing more compact for other people that's
something that I'm I'm very sensitive to now after this
awakening and I feel like every after every awakening I
become more and more sensitive and to me it becomes
more and more clear how much importance there is in
practicing compassion and how powerful of a tool it is
it's an extremely powerful and persuasive tool you know if
you're having problems with somebody in a relationship the best
way to fix that problem is with compassion and with
with love not with with blaming and finger-pointing and arguing
and bickering and all this sorts of stuff so that's
something I'll be working on I'll be working on making
my communications with you more loving and more compassionate as
well my communications via my my comments and via the
post that I do on my forum and so on
what else is also is left for me is I
will be continuing to prove the effectiveness of five Meo
in the future with small follow-up doses so I'm not
really interested in you know having huge breakthrough experiences it's
more about small very stable very steady doses that I
can use to just complete the integration so I feel
like that is that is in the plans as well
and you know who knows like I said there's probably
deeper indictments and probably more stuff will be revealed to
me other interesting facets and insights you know there's just
so many ancillary insights around the periphery of this thing
called awakening that is also very interesting that psychedelics reveal
to you and so that is what's left there's a
lot of stuff to do a lot of work to
do I'm excited about it I feel like I'm more
calm and more grounded now because I'm not chasing after
the answer so much and now I can just sort
of like calmly do the work that I know I
need to do and my new awareness now shows me
exactly how I need to do that work and exactly
what the path is so the path for me now
looks quite clear of course my life purpose has only
been strengthened by this experience I still want to teach
in fact more than ever I still have a lots
of insights that I want to share I have many
books that I want to write I have many videos
that I want to shoot I have many techniques I
want to research and test out on myself I have
many other mystical States that I want to experience and
to see what those are like and to see what
people are talking about with those and I'm excited more
than ever to teach people in person not just through
video to improve my teaching skills to be more effective
of a communicator and be more effective a teacher to
offer better analogies and better examples so for me life
purpose just gets supercharged with these awakenings because my greatest
wish now for you is that you in your life
become conscious of why all of this exists that's ultimately
if I could just choose one thing that you can
get from me that I can gift to you is
the injunction to go and figure that out and to
have that insight for yourself do not stop on this
path until you are completely certain of why everything exists
and why it must exist and why it cannot be
any other way that's my wish for you that's the
ultimate for me that is the ultimate that is the
most profound thing you can become conscious of in this
in this reality I think and everything else is secondary
and that that insight is so profound and so satisfying
that I just wish that you could experience that for
yourself be one of the handful of people on this
earth who has ever awoken to this understanding very very
very few people have very few people even many so-called
enlightened people have not really truly awoken to to this
understanding of why everything exists and why it must exist
it's you you're it you're the reason for everything you
are it and I want you to I want you
to experience that moment for yourself of when you realize
this and when you do I want you to imagine
me smiling down on you because that's what it gives
me the greatest satisfaction is to be able to guide
people through this whole process so they can ultimately they
can get to that point that's the pinnacle that's the
crowning achievement that's the crown jewel and then of course
come on back and there still lasts up to work
on after you understand that so don't don't get cocky
and don't get don't get complacent just because you understand
that thing there you still got to take care of
all the other crap in your life that is probably
highly dysfunctional so there you go make sure to check
out my Hawaii videos they're coming soon they'll be on
the blog exclusively they are not going to be posted
on my youtube channel that's it please click the like
button for me and come check out actualize that org
this is where you'll find the blog this is where
you'll find some other resources like the life purpose course
the book list the forum and just in general stick
with me my path is still only getting started this
is like the beginning of the end and then the
new beginning a new chapter is sort of opening up
for me over the next 6 months you're gonna see
a huge transformation in myself as I work to embody
all this and and then who knows what lies ahead
beyond that I don't know I'm more and more open
these days to living more adventurously and more spontaneously and
to changing stuff around to moving around to being different
places to meeting new people to talking about new things
to trying out new things to teaching in new styles
and different modes in different ways so I just don't
know we'll see where it goes but it'll probably be
exciting so stick around you're watching it happen and unfold
before you and I hope that that inspires you to
do it for yourself you
