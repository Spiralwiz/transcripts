            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/lpPKRFh-yCc' target='_blank'>Critical Thinking - Use Independent Thinking To Build A Powerful Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of Critical Thinking</b>: Critical thinking is a skill that allows one to solve problems in their life, identify bottlenecks and obstacles, and work on improving those areas. It involves independent thinking, where you analyze and think about problems on your own.
</li><li><b>Importance of Independent Thinking</b>: Critical thinking allows for independent thinking, where you're not simply taking information handed down to you but generating the answers for yourself. This results in true understanding, perspective, and mastery. Great thinkers in history like Socrates, Einstein, and da Vinci were known for their independent thinking, and they derived truths for themselves.
</li><li><b>Information Overload and Critical Thinking</b>: In the age of information overload, people tend to grab and assimilate information without critically analyzing it. This often leads to the adoption of beliefs and values from other sources rather than generating one's own understanding. Critical thinking fosters the ability to derive truths independently.
</li><li><b>Learning through Critical Thinking</b>: Critical thinking is key in education, helping students develop deep understanding of subjects. For instance, in geometry, being given theorems and asked to prove them encourages critical thinking, leading to true understanding of the subject.
</li><li><b>The Socratic Method as a Form of Critical Thinking</b>: The Socratic method, which involves asking deep questions and exploring chains of reasoning, is an example of critical thinking. It develops a deeper understanding of ideas and beliefs.
</li><li><b>Developing Critical Thinking Skills</b>: To build critical thinking skills, one must actively engage with information, question its validity, and consider its implications. This involves pausing and reflecting while consuming information, such as when reading a book. 
</li><li><b>Commercial Interests and Critical Thinking</b>: Society is being inundated with information, often motivated by commercial interests and marketing tactics aimed to manipulate beliefs for profit. Developing critical thinking skills can allow individuals to break free from these influences.
</li><li><b>The Deception of Commercial Interests</b>: Leo discusses the global commercial industry, highlighting how billion-dollar marketing departments exploit consumers' beliefs for the maximal profit. This exploitation is deemed as powerful and dangerous and leads individuals towards harmful products they might not even need.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Self-Direction and Self-Reliance</b>: Without critical thinking, individuals tend to rely heavily on the media, cultural influences, and academic figures, most of which provide unsubstantiated or distorted information. This lack of self-reliance and undue reliance on others leads individuals down undesirable paths. 
</li><li><b>Unplugging from Societal Influences</b>: Leo uses the analogy of a herd of cattle running towards a canyon to describe society's blind acceptance of shared beliefs. He suggests that unplugging oneself from societal influences is the key to avoiding misinformation and discovering truths independently.
</li><li><b>The Misinformation and Distortions in Society</b>: He asserts that the majority of ideas, beliefs, and norms pushed by society are incorrect, unhealthy, and largely false. It is critical to analyze such concepts and determine if they are applicable to oneself, instead of accepting them without question.
</li><li><b>The Power of Critical Thinking</b>: Independent, critical thinking, according to Leo, gives individuals the strength to create their own paths, foster new ideas and initiatives, assist others, and achieve personal fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Implementing Critical Thinking</b>: To foster critical thinking, one must limit passive information consumption from various sources. Although these sources can provide useful initial information, one must subject that acquired material to personal, analytical scrutiny. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Beliefs and Systems</b>: Leo encourages skepticism towards all kinds of belief systems, such as religious beliefs, historical narratives, and philosophical concepts. Doing so requires valuing personal opinions above those of others and independently seeking truth.
</li><li><b>Curiosity and Open-mindedness</b>: The two main factors for critical thinking, according to Leo, are curiosity and open-mindedness. Curiosity drives deep understanding and a search for knowledge, while open-mindedness ensures a comprehensive exploration of ideas and truth. 
</li><li><b>The Results of Practicing Critical Thinking</b>: Leo concludes by asserting that practicing independent and critical thinking will eventually lead to significant personal growth and a break from society's 'herd mentality.' It allows the individual to chart a unique, positive path forward. 
</li><li><b>Actualized.org and Critical Thinking</b>: Lastly, Leo invites viewers to visit Actualized.org and subscribe to its newsletter. The content provided is a result of his own critical thinking, providing unique, deeply researched ideas that can serve as high-quality 'fodder' for others to critically analyze and learn from.
