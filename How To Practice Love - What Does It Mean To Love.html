[Music] what does it mean to love this will be
one of my most important episodes that i've ever released
and it's going to be very practical too now i've
spent a lot of time contemplating the nature of love
what is love how does love work and i've talked
about some of that in great detail some of the
like the deep metaphysics of love i've talked about that
in a two-part series what is love part one and
part two go check that out if you miss those
and what i find is that there's nothing more valuable
really to contemplate than the nature of love because that's
what consciousness and reality are personally i reached a point
in my own understanding and contemplations where i was installing
these door stoppers you know these springy door stoppers i
was installing these doing some upgrades in my bathrooms and
uh i became so conscious of the metaphysics of love
that when i flicked this thing and just heard it
oscillating that i became aware that even the oscillation of
this spring is love now that's love at the highest
possible metaphysical levels and i don't expect you to get
that right here right now and in fact we're not
even going to be talking about that in this episode
um we're going to be focusing more on the human
domain the relative domain of how to actually love others
around us this is going to be much more useful
for you but just as an aside i do hope
one day in this work if you really go deep
with me in this work and you actualize your full
potential of awakening and contemplations on love you will one
day become conscious that this is love but we're moving
on past that and even though i have understood love
and realized that at the highest possible metaphysical levels i
still struggle to embody it at the day-to-day level at
the human level at the relative level what i call
the relative level and and so i still need to
do a lot of work there and so as i've
been doing that work and thinking about how do i
do that work right before you can do it you
have to ask yourself how do i even begin doing
it uh that's what led me to the realizations and
insights that i'll be sharing with you in this episode
so i continue to contemplate the relative levels of love
and the question here is you know we we'd like
to say i love you a lot or we like
to say i love blank i love this i love
that this person or this thing whatever you're applying it
to i love pizza right or you probably tell your
family members i love you or you tell your spouse
or girlfriend or boyfriend i love you but you say
it as a platitude you say it flippantly you say
it mindlessly you don't actually know what that means or
what it entails and that's a big problem because if
you're not clear on what i love you means and
how to actually practice it then how can you love
now love is is interesting because a lot of times
people can get the idea that love is just this
frivolous thing that it's not something deep or profound that
you know it's just a human emotion or it's just
something you know extra like you know it's the icing
on top of the cake and that love isn't fundamental
but just from science and psychology we know that babies
baby monkeys baby rats and even of course baby humans
they die from lack of love you would think you
could raise a baby monkey or a baby rat or
maybe even a baby human without love just as long
as you give it the food and the shelter just
that the basic stuff right that an organism needs to
survive and that you'll grow up fine right dead wrong
dead wrong even if these organisms end up surviving physically
to maturity which a lot of them actually won't they'll
die but even if some of them do what the
research shows is that they are completely psychologically dysfunctional just
ruined and destroyed and incapable of being rehabilitated that's how
bad it is so i was thinking about this and
of course you know deep down i understand why they
need that love but um uh i was thinking about
it like what i mean there is like why they
need it as a consciousness right see if you're if
you're at the material sort of biological level you might
say like well why does a monkey baby monkey need
love why does baby rat need love but you're thinking
about it wrong the way you got to think about
it is like this baby monkey or this baby rat
think of it as a consciousness right it's not an
organism it's a consciousness why does this consciousness need love
like metaphysically why does it need it contemplate that and
when you awaken to what love is actually have some
enlightenment on this point then you'll start to realize why
it needs it and the reason that is because consciousness
is love that is its nature and also just think
about it then from the sort of biological perspective is
like you have this little baby consciousness within this larger
consciousness which is what we're going to call the universe
but you have this little baby consciousness monkey a rat
or a human whatever it is just think of how
vulnerable that consciousness is to what the larger system can
do to it all the ways it can be abused
and misused and traumatized but anyways i was thinking about
this and i was asking myself if we're just comparing
the difference between a baby monkey that receives love and
one that doesn't and is completely dysfunctional or even dies
as a as a result of not getting it what
is the difference like what is what is what are
the adult monkeys doing to make sure that the baby
monkey receives all the love it needs to be healthy
and fully functional like what are the steps is it
like feeding the monkey is it grooming the baby monkey
is it coddling the baby monkey is it hugging it
is it kissing it is it scratching it is it
biting it what's it doing so that the baby monkey
feels the love see this is sort of the granular
level you have to take it down to and we're
going to take it down to this granular level with
humans of course not with monkeys so the question then
becomes how do humans receive love and what does that
look like and the problem is that too often love
is treated as this vague abstraction or just a vague
feeling some romantic feeling and uh we don't think about
like the deeper aspects of it so here's a list
sort of a master list that i've assembled of how
do you actually love a person practically what do you
do here it is you'll want to take notes on
this this list right here write this down because and
keep coming back to it because this list will change
your whole life that's how powerful this list is really
i should be charging you thousands of dollars for this
list but i'm giving it to you for free why
would i do that well maybe one day you'll understand
so here's the list number one attention and awareness giving
it and in this case i'm going to be using
the word it or other to refer to like we're
coming at it from the point of view as let's
say you and i are the parents and it or
other in this case is the baby or the thing
that we're trying to love the object of our love
so how do we show love to this object is
the question and look it can be a it can
be a human it could be an animal it could
be a even a physical object of course a physical
object won't need many of these but mostly we're going
to talk about humans so uh you give it your
attention and awareness and your time that's just fundamental imagine
if you are trying to love an object or a
creature or a being and you are not even giving
it your attention can love even happen without awareness and
attention think about that think about how important just attention
and awareness is the next point is physical contact touching
holding hugging cuddling and even more fundamental than all of
those is proximity physical proximity just that alone can bring
forth feelings of love and think about if you don't
offer physical proximity just sitting next to or being next
to or even being in the same space as the
thing you're trying to love think about how it's gonna
feel the next point is connection and it's actually a
much deeper point because this really goes to the core
of what love is love is connection but for now
think of it as you're trying to create a connection
with this thing whatever it is you're trying to connect
with this person and there's different levels of connection different
kinds of connection there's physical connection there's emotional connection there's
intellectual connection that's possible and then there's spiritual connection which
would be the highest form of connection but really you're
not picking one out of these four you're going to
be trying to do all of them and in fact
if you want to love something if you really love
something then you're going to be trying to connect with
it with in every possible way in every possible dimension
that's available to you so these four and maybe others
that i have even overlooked here i don't know you
know you want to always keep your mind open to
more more ways of forming connections but at least these
four so of course that's why physical contact and proximity
is so important that's the physical connection that's being created
there but then of course the physical although that's very
important um by no means is it the most important
the next point is taking good care of it if
you love a thing you want to take good care
of it right a lot of these should just be
intuitively obvious to you as i mentioned them you probably
haven't really thought about this before but as i mentioned
them it should be like oh yeah of course that's
so obvious um and to take care of a thing
then you got to care about its needs helping to
meet its needs helping it to survive because if you
love a thing then what that implies is that you
want it to survive you want it to exist think
about it like in this sort of like profound way
if you love a thing you actually what you love
is you love its existence first and foremost you recognize
the beauty and value of its existence and you want
it to keep existing and you want to help it
to exist if its existence is endangered pretty profound huh
now of course there's a problem here in that this
is going to create an attachment and it's going to
create a bias because you're attached to this thing existing
this way it's a finite object you're attached to helping
it exist and to survive but then what about the
other objects so we're definitely talking about a biased kind
of love here right because what you're doing the difference
between the sort of like metaphysical platonic existential forms of
love godly forms of love um at the universal sort
of level the universal love the difference between that and
loving a object or a particular person or being is
that you're sort of focusing and channeling that love towards
a specific form within consciousness now there's problems and limitations
with that but we're not going to be worried about
that because the context of this whole episode is that
we're talking about how to love specifically how to love
the people in your life just recognize that there's limitations
to that whole paradigm eventually you're going to want to
go so deep in your love that you're going to
even have to transcend the attachment to needing to help
people to survive and you have to even let that
go to reach an even deeper level of love but
that's a little too advanced for us here we don't
want to get off track so continuing on that same
theme of helping to meet its needs is sheltering it
from excessive suffering fear and trauma that would destroy or
[ __ ] it that's really the function of parenting
the parent is there to protect this vulnerable child from
suffering fear and trauma not 100 percent of it you
don't want to remove all the suffering in your child's
life you don't want to have your child never experience
fear but you don't want it to reach such levels
that it's going to traumatize that child and [ __
] that child for the rest of its life so
that the child will not be able to get over
the suffering and fear so as a parent and this
is really a good sort of model of how you
get these insights about love is look at you know
what loving parents do look at what a loving mother
or father how they take care of their children and
what you see is that uh they're not overly protective
but the most extreme forms of suffering they're sort of
like gauging how much suffering and fear and challenge of
life can this little consciousness handle and if it's beyond
that then we're going to protect against that but we're
not going to protect against every you know little little
bump and scratch because that would that would actually make
this little consciousness too weak because consciousness needs some some
tension and some some difficulty in order to grow and
toughen up and develop a thick skin and then be
able to survive on its own and if you love
a thing you don't want it to be dependent on
you for the rest of its life you want it
to become stronger and ultimately independent of you and even
if you really love a thing you want it to
surpass you in your own development you wanted to reach
levels of consciousness and growth that even you yourself have
not been able to yet actualize uh the next aspect
here is having its back defending it being loyal to
it and you can tell when someone is loyal to
you and has your back and when someone isn't you
can tell when your friend has your back and then
some of your friends that are a bit more sketchy
that you wouldn't trust so readily why not it's because
you realize that they actually don't have your back you
can't rely on them the next point is taking on
its agenda as your own this is a huge mistake
that we make when we try to love others is
that we try to impose our agenda on them confusing
our agenda for its agenda this is a classic mistake
that parents make you know the child might have its
own agenda of like well i want to grow up
and be an artist and the parents are like no
you're going to be a doctor or an engineer or
a lawyer that's the parent's agenda they're not listening to
the child's agenda they're not taking on the child's agenda
as their own the next sub-point of this point is
making its agenda an extension of yours or even we
can even broaden that out even further is making it
the other that you're trying to love making it an
extension of you how would you treat your child if
you were treating it as you would treat yourself literally
when you're loving a thing or a being you're taking
your finite sense of self or identity and you're expanding
it to incorporate and include that object this is difficult
to do it's scary to do this because it makes
you vulnerable because like let's say you're this macho man
you're very strong you're rich you're emotionally healthy and um
you've got great defense mechanisms and you've got security guards
and you're living in a in a castle with walls
and security systems like you're perfectly secure you have all
your needs met but then you have this vulnerable child
and this child goes off into the world and you
can't have security around her all the time you can't
be there to protect her all the time when she's
with her friends and partying doing this or that and
if you've actually extended your sense of identity to include
her as part of it then she is you and
if something happens to her something happens to you if
she gets hurt you get hurt but see you can't
extend your castle walls to incorporate her otherwise you're going
to lock her in your castle but then you're going
to stifle her development you see so there's a there's
a great assumption of vulnerability when you love some other
truly because now you're you're tied in with with its
survival its survival becomes your survival its pain becomes your
pain and for a lot of people especially for a
lot of men this is very difficult to do because
we as men like we try to build ourselves up
to be kind of invulnerable we are ourselves up and
first of all that doesn't really work so well because
you're never really invulnerable all your armor is just sort
of a house of cards that can easily collapse but
we do that anyways we put ourselves in a good
position but then but then see you have to you
have to go beyond that you can't just stay inside
your castle all the time you have to you have
to learn to extend your love to others around you
who are much more vulnerable than you not as intelligent
as you not as rich as you not as strong
as you see maybe you're this like six foot five
300 pound like gorilla looking macho dude who can defend
himself and knows you know he's a black belt jujitsu
and all this sorts of stuff right but then you
have a daughter who's 5 foot and she doesn't know
jiu jitsu how does she defend herself and now she's
a part of you see that's going to be very
threatening to you because you've built up this whole identity
of being this macho jiu jitsu guy who can beat
everybody up and so this is actually going to create
a problem with you being able to love your daughter
unless you let go of this sort of armoring identity
that you've created for yourself because the people you're going
to be loving they're not going to be as strong
and armored as you and if you're not comfortable with
that you're simply not going to be able to actually
make them extensions of you of course the next point
is treating others as well as you would like to
treat yourself this is the golden rule the next point
is being happy when it succeeds as though its success
is your success celebrating the ones you love success actually
being happy and you can practice this like with your
friends and family members like when they have a big
payday when something's going great in their life and they
tell you about it are you genuinely happy for them
if you aren't if you're just kind of like meh
whatever that's cool but like whatever if you're like that
then what does that tell you about your level of
love for these people see if you were treating these
people as an extension of yourself equal to yourself you
would feel as happy for them when they succeed as
you would feel for yourself when you succeed think of
how happy you feel when you get a huge raise
at work or you get a big refund check from
the irs or something like that you feel great but
when your friends tell you about that or your family
members tell you about that do you feel the same
way probably not so you gotta actually learn to start
to become happy for others in fact what you might
notice is actually something very ugly is that when some
of your friends or family members tell you something that's
going great for them you might actually feel resentful deep
down you might you might actually feel like why did
they get that and i didn't get that and see
the reason you feel that is look they got that
but i didn't get that you see what that's implying
is that there's actually a division in your mind between
them and you you hold them as not you because
if you held them literally as you you would be
as happy for them as you are for yourself notice
that that's a good little litmus test right there and
personally i'm not the best at that one um uh
i definitely need to practice feeling happier for others when
they are succeeding because a lot of times i'm so
focused on my own success and my own work and
my life purpose and so forth that i just become
like almost oblivious to the success of others and i
notice how that disconnects me and doesn't make me as
loving as i could be the next point is wanting
for it what it wants for itself this is really
part of that point about taking on its agenda as
your own but i like framing it in this way
of wanting for it what it wants for itself so
what are the highest things that you want for yourself
see if i love you then i should want those
things for you too and a lot of times again
people get confused here because they project the highest things
that like here's the mistake that would happen here is
that i know the highest things that i want for
myself and so i just assume that that's the stuff
that you want for yourself too but that's not always
the case because we have different agendas different needs and
so forth all right so i have to set aside
my own highest things that i want for myself and
i have to find out the highest things you want
for yourself and then champion those when you get them
and it might be very different than what i want
for myself like maybe what you want for yourself is
you want to become a great lawyer and maybe for
me like becoming a great lawyer that's like not something
that i respect even i don't really even respect lawyers
that much personally but if that's what you want for
yourself and that's what you need see the mistake here
is for me to try to convince you that no
that's that's wrong but if i truly loved you then
i would want that for you because you want it
for yourself the next point is sacrificing for it on
its behalf working on its behalf if you truly love
someone you're willing to sacrifice for them and work on
their behalf and this is actually a point that a
lot of guys especially i noticed a lot of guys
like in the pickup community or in the red red
pill or in cell communities black pill communities all this
kind of stuff um um this sort of like toxic
masculinity uh a lot of it like there's there's a
sort of like attitude of like well women women should
work for themselves and i shouldn't have to work for
the woman and buy her stuff and do give her
gifts and do all this kind of stuff you know
she should do it all for herself and it's just
kind of like attitude of cheapness basically and i've suffered
from this in the past so i'm speaking as an
ex-addict to this cut attitude i've gotten over it to
a good degree maybe i have some more work to
do but but basically the key shift that i realized
is that like yeah of course you don't want a
woman to use you for your money right um you
don't want that but if you really actually fall in
love with a woman uh what you should want to
do is actually work on her behalf this is not
about you you know just her needing money from you
it's not really about that um you should be willing
to sacrifice for your woman and and if she loves
you she'll be willing to sacrifice for you too and
not necessarily in the same ways right because men and
women are different there's an asymmetry between the masculine the
feminine so men will sacrifice for women in their unique
way and what in the way that women need and
then women will sacrifice for men in their unique way
and in the way that men need that's ideally how
it would work of course now that doesn't it doesn't
doesn't always work that way there's a lot of dysfunctions
that can happen there and of course it's all it's
possible to be in a relationship where you know we
both seem to love each other but that i'm sacrificing
for you but then you're not sacrificing for me i'm
willing to work for you but you're not willing to
work for me and then of course that becomes abusive
and exploitative the next point is supporting it nurturing it
and encouraging it encouragement is big if you love someone
you're going to encourage them to be their best and
not in the not because you need them to be
better for you but just because you're encouraging their self-exploration
their self-expression and their self-actualization notice that subtle difference because
a lot of times parents will think well but i'm
encouraging my child to get good grades and to go
to law school and this sort of stuff but it's
like yeah but those are your issues those are your
priorities that is that what the child really wants right
so your encouragement has to be aligned with what the
child really wants so really the encouragement here is again
self-exploration self-expression self-actualization if the child isn't interested in getting
good grades then you're not really encouraging it by telling
it to get good grades if the child's not interested
in going to law school you're not encouraging it by
telling it to go to law school encouragement here would
mean okay child what do you want what do you
really what are you passionate about okay let me encourage
your passions that would be true encouragement that's self-exploration self-actualization
self-expression and even beyond encouraging think of it as cheerleading
you're cheerleading the other on in their own goals you're
supporting them in their passions and their vision the next
point is super important and it's really like a profound
metaphysical point i've actually talked about in a previous episode
where i talked about um how authority works another previous
episode where i talked about um the infinite gods awakening
that i had but anyways the next point is respecting
its sovereignty this is this is just so fundamental basically
if you don't respect another consciousness of sovereignty then you
can't love it what do i mean by sovereignty basically
you treat it as a sovereign consciousness on the same
on the same footing as you not above you and
not below you it's equally sovereign to you and this
is this is really difficult for a lot of parents
and in a lot of relationships this is a real
problem because we tend to hold our sovereignty like as
the most important we put our own sovereignty on a
pedestal and then we try to subsume the sovereignty of
every other person that we interact with underneath our sovereignty
and this leads to all sorts of problems so practically
what it means to respect someone's sovereignty is to not
manipulate that person not try to control them not try
to dominate them not try to exploit them not try
to hold yourself as above them or more important than
them in any fundamental sense for example an authoritarian boss
or politician will actually get the idea in their mind
that they are at a higher position of authority and
that somehow you know because i'm the boss or ceo
of this corporation that like my sovereignty should reign supreme
over this whole organization and all the people that are
underneath me this is actually bad leadership good leadership conscious
leadership which i'm gonna have a whole episode on soon
conscious leadership stay tuned for that's gonna be huge um
eye-opening episode uh but conscious leadership's conscious leadership demands that
you recognize the sovereignty of everybody else that you're leading
and that you're not above them and by recognizing other
sovereignty that's what stops you from trying to manipulate control
dominate or exploit them i have a deeper discussion of
this in my episode called um um infinite gods awakening
go go check that one out i talk about this
point about sovereignty the next point is total acceptance of
it as it is an absence of judgment if you
love a thing you accept it as it is you
don't need it to be different you don't need it
to change because if you needed to change what you're
really loving is not the thing itself you're loving some
other fantasy that you created about some other thing which
isn't really the thing that you're trying to love you
see this if you really love your child you accept
it as it is not as how you want it
to be not judging it and this is what makes
love so difficult is because we usually need it to
be some other way for us not as it really
is therefore we don't really see it as it is
our need for a thing to fit our own agenda
and survival needs is so great that oftentimes we don't
even see what's in front of us we see what
we want to see we see what we want it
to be not what it really is a lot of
their parents if they're bad parents they don't even see
their children as they are they only see them as
the fantasies and ideals that they've imagined in their minds
of what a good child should be and that's what
makes being a good parent so difficult is that you
need to surrender those fantasies in order to make a
connection with the actual child you see because otherwise you
know we're talking about this theme of love is making
connection right you're forming a deep connection well how can
you form a connection to some object when it's reality
isn't sufficient for you therefore you construct a fantasy of
some alternative version of that object and what you're really
connecting with is that object what you're loving is not
this thing you're loving that thing which you're then pretending
is the real thing you're falling in love with a
fantasy you see and this leads to the point of
valuing the thing or the person for its own sake
not for what you need for its own sake which
leads to the next point which is appreciation if you
love a thing or a person you appreciate them as
they are that's what it really means to love something
is to appreciate its consciousness like if you say you
love pepperoni pizza what that means is you actually appreciate
it how it tastes that's what you're appreciating that's why
you love it if you love psychedelics why do you
love them it's because you're appreciating them when you're experiencing
them likewise if you love your cat or your dog
that that's why you love them that's a that's a
that's a chunk of consciousness that you appreciate you appreciate
its existence for its own sake otherwise you don't really
love it and the next point which takes this appreciation
even deeper is that when you really love a thing
and you form a deep connection with it you are
conscious you're seeing its intrinsic beauty now this brings us
to a deeper topic of beauty which really is an
existential topic that could have its own episode what is
beauty um in a nutshell basically beauty is infinite all
of consciousness is beautiful but you have to be aware
of that and most people aren't aware of that because
we're biased and selfish and needy but in your own
life you can find things that are beautiful that's a
bias of yours because everything is equally beautiful but you
find one specific thing you can see its beauty you
can see the intrinsic beauty of a thing whether you're
looking at a piece of art or a man or
a woman or you know whatever a child you can
see its beauty and the more conscious you are and
the more you focus on and really look at it
you can see more and more there's infinite beauty in
every object basically but you have to connect with it
to really to get the like to suck the beauty
out of it and to appreciate that and so the
more you love an object the more you're willing to
do that see like most people can't see the infinite
beauty in a piece of dog turd on the sidewalk
but they can see the beauty of a of a
great painting by van gogh or something like that now
there's equal beauty in both but some things for us
humans because we're so finite and selfish and biased some
things for us it's easier to see the beauty of
but also you can go to a museum like one
person can go to a museum walk by a van
gogh painting and um and just kind of like walk
through it but you know walk through the room look
at kind of go oh that's kind of interesting then
just keep walking right but like it's so shallow such
a shallow connection was formed there between that person it's
his consciousness and the van gogh painting but someone who's
like an art connoisseur and really a lover of van
gogh he'll you know he'll travel around the country halfway
around the country just to see that painting and he'll
spend the next hour just looking at it like really
close you know get up close to that van gogh
just like look at it and really appreciate every brush
stroke and see the genius of it and the use
of color and this and that and like maybe you
can even bring you to tears if if you're really
into that sort of thing now this you can extend
this example to basically anything you can do this with
human beings you can take one human being and you
can just treat this human being very casually and flippantly
transactionally then you don't really love that human being you
don't have a deep connection with it but like if
you really love someone you can like you can you
can look at their face for hours you can see
the beauty and every freckle on their face that would
be forming a much deeper connection the next point is
not needing anything from this other not making this other
a tool to satisfy your own needs we've sort of
touched on this already the next point is respecting the
other's point of view the one that you're loving wanting
to understand its point of view this is what really
makes loving humans and maybe even animals just different from
loving objects with loving a physical object like a painting
it doesn't really have a point of view but every
human you're going to be loving is going to have
their own point of view and a lot of times
their point of view is very different from your point
of view so this creates a challenge because if you're
not good at being able to jump between different points
of view you're basically going to be incapable of loving
people and you know how big i am on point
of view i'm always talking about the perspectival nature of
reality and you know in in epistemology all the epistemology
we've talked about in the past we're talking about looking
at different perspectives different perspectives on spirituality different perspectives on
the world you know this sort of stuff we talked
about this different paradigms so uh you really need to
get to a point where you're very flexible with different
points of view and for this you have to be
extremely open-minded so it's actually impossible to love deeply when
you're not open-minded because you're not able to be epistemically
flexible enough to take on others points of view and
therefore you can't really understand that other and if you
really love an other you want to understand it and
not just as like a specimen on a dissecting table
like you're dissecting a frog to understand the frog there
can be value in that you can try to understand
people that way but that's not that's not nearly enough
you got to understand their subjective experience their consciousness that's
what you're really trying to connect with you're not trying
to connect with their physical body so much as their
mind and their consciousness and their spirit you might say
so if you really love someone you take the time
to get the note to know them deeply and a
lot of times that's what that's what bad parents don't
do bad parents oftentimes just simply skip the step of
really getting to know their children like what do their
children really like what do they dislike what are they
passionate about what are they disgusted about what are they
frustrated what are their deepest fears what are their greatest
dreams and aspirations and see it's scary to really get
to know someone's point of view deeply because first of
all it's going to conflict with your point of view
which is going to make you start to question your
point because most people hold their point of view as
absolute truth and reality the way reality is if the
deeper you you get to know somebody else's point of
view it's going to start to like make you question
your point of view because maybe then you're going to
be wondering like well but they're just so different from
mine how do i know mine is right who's right
so there's that obstacle but then also you might come
to to realize that their point of view is so
different from your point of view that actually you two
are like incompatible or you just like you might struggle
to understand their point of view it might be so
like alien and different that you just might not understand
their point of view and that takes a lot of
mental work which you know most people just skip over
a lot of times you just want to like bludgeon
someone to death with your point of view so that
they stop speaking from their point of view you want
to like do a sort of a frame battle where
you out frame them out paradigm them and you want
like your paradigm to reign supreme to be sovereign right
but this is a sort of a subtle form of
domination that you're doing it's an epistemic domination and therefore
that connection you're not able to form that genuine connection
so an important component of loving someone is not forcing
your agenda or point of view on them respecting their
point of view which comes from recognizing that all of
us have different experiences and even pers different personality types
different ways of processing information even different neurology and neurochemistry
and genetics which make our experience of life very different
from each other now sometimes there's a lot of similarity
but a lot of times quite different too so validating
another one's point of view that means you love them
next is listening and caring about their interests even just
like look something as simple as just listening to them
a lot of people are just bad listeners if you
want to like just improve the quality of your romantic
relationships or your family relationships just sit and listen without
interrupting without being impatient that means you have to make
time for it and you got to pay attention to
it like a lot of times you might be listening
on the phone your mom is talking to you telling
you some story and you're listening to her with one
ear and then here you're at the computer doing something
else right so you're you're half there you're not fully
present you're not really listening caring about their interests and
sharing similar interests realistically this is what makes bonding and
connection happen between humans because if you have no interests
in common then why are you even relating to this
person most likely there's no point in there being even
a relationship here you're just doing out of some sort
of sense of obligation which is honestly a problem with
a lot of family relationships a lot of times with
family we just kind of feel obligated to love them
but we we have like no interest in common and
then we're just kind of like trying to fake it
but see the trick with love is that love is
an honest signal you can't really fake love i mean
you can try but it's not going to feel like
love and both of you are going to know it
it's going to be very obvious so sometimes you have
to let go of relationships where a genuine connection isn't
forming because like the points of you are too different
the value systems are too different the interests are too
different where common ground isn't found see doing something out
of a sense of obligation is not sufficient for love
if you think you can just hold a family together
just out of obligation your children and spouse they'll know
it they'll know that you're doing it as a as
some sort of like chore or ideal that you've set
you know for yourself but you're not really like your
heart's not in it see your heart has to be
in it otherwise you don't love it the next point
is a sense of togetherness and company if you love
the other then you'll want that and collaboration collaborating together
working together on something if you love someone you're willing
to collaborate with them the next point is being there
when the other feels down or hopeless being there for
them in their lowest time because see it's easy to
be there for somebody in their you know peak states
of happiness and excitement when your girlfriend or boyfriend when
they get a giant raise and everything's going great yeah
it's easy to be there for them um that's not
a real test of your love the real test of
your love is when they are hitting rock bottom when
they are you know uh wasted drunk depressed lost their
job got a cancer diagnosis or lost a bunch of
money in the stock market or are suicidal or found
out they have some sort of disease or mental disorder
being there for them then when they are ready to
kill themselves and to give up on life being there
for them then that's the real test of your love
because if you really love them you would want to
be there for them in their lowest right because like
think about it what is it what does it say
about you when you want to distance yourself and disconnect
from someone when they're at their lowest would you do
that to yourself would you do that to someone you
really cared about no you'd want to be there because
they need you the most in that in that moment
the next point is helping the other not to feel
lonely the next point is validating its feelings this is
a huge one this is what allows for that emotional
connection see we talked about the physical connection there can
be an intellectual connection if you have common intellectual interests
there can be a spiritual connection which really we won't
even get into here that's that's a whole topic and
of itself but but the emotional connection this is what
we're going to talk about right now um you need
to be able to empathize you need to be to
be able to ask you know here's a magic word
for you guys the magic word when you're dealing with
women in relationships is how are you feeling and really
for you parents with kids this is also the magic
phrase memorize just memorize this phrase and ask it a
lot how are you feeling how are you feeling this
is the magic phrase and then you ask that and
then they tell you and then you gotta listen so
it's important that you actually care about how they're feeling
because see if you're like oh well how are you
feeling and to you it's just an annoyance how they're
feeling like you don't really care then you don't really
love them you see because if you love them you
would care how they feel because their feelings would be
your feelings their pain would be your pain their happiness
would be you'd want to know because you care about
how you feel don't you right so of course if
you if you if they're an extension of you you
should care how they feel so you you should ask
them how they feel then listen to how they feel
then validate to them how they feel because a lot
of times what happens is especially with those guys is
that we hear a girl telling us how she feels
and they're like oh you're just being crazy or whatever
that like what you're feeling isn't important you kind of
dismiss and minimize how the person is feeling it's like
oh that that's some sort of silly feeling in this
case you're invalidating the feelings so it's very counterintuitive you
have to you have to validate the feelings even if
there's sort of like crazy feelings that you think she
shouldn't be feeling you got to validate those um and
i mean the same thing like with your children like
a lot of the problem with feelings is that feeling
time a lot of times feelings are just irrational they
make no sense and it can seem like why is
this person feeling this way about this situation like i
don't feel that way so why are they feeling that
way it's a silly way to feel like they're depressed
about something that they shouldn't be depressed about but again
see what you're doing here is you're you're sort of
like enforcing your point of view and your agenda and
your survival onto them uh the thing with emotions is
that they're irrational a lot of times and nonsensical no
sometimes they have legitimate messages they're communicating but a lot
of times they don't a lot of times they're just
kind of like nonsense and you got to put up
with that [ __ ] because you know what when
you're feeling bad a lot of times think about it
when you're feeling bad a lot of times you're feeling
bad for kind of stupid irrational reasons but you still
have to like cope with that somehow you can't just
dismiss that as unimportant even though maybe it's based on
some sort of silly logic or whatever so to build
an emotional connection you gotta do that and then you
gotta actually share emotions have emotions together share emotions you
know one of the most powerful ways to create a
feeling of love like very practically is cry together if
you ever cry together with somebody that's like whoa that's
huge that creates so much love because you're sharing that
emotion but of course it doesn't have to just be
that empathizing with the person of course is huge again
its pain is your pain its suffering is your suffering
and caring about its suffering for its own sake a
lot of times the trap here is that we care
about the suffering of someone close to us because we
just want to quickly help them to fix the suffering
so that we're not suffering because of their suffering but
that's not really caring about their suffering for its own
sake you see that's just because the suffering is annoying
you you just want to do something to kind of
like stop it real quick but like really to suffer
with them and to to care about their suffering for
its own sake the next point is meeting the other
where they're at this is a huge one especially when
you're dealing with people who are less conscious and less
developed than you are you gotta meet people where they're
at like if you're an adult talking to a small
child that's five years old you gotta meet the child
where he's at right you gotta talk to the child
in the way the child understands not the way you
would talk to an adult that's meeting the child where
it's at but then the same thing happens it has
to happen even with like your grown-up friends and even
your spouse and whoever else a lot of times you
might be more developed than them you might understand something
deeper than them and then you're having a conversation with
them and then you you're coming from such a high
position that it doesn't connect you're speaking things to them
it's not connecting right like if i was speaking to
a drug addict i'd have to kind of like lower
myself to the drug addicts level and talk to him
on that level like i couldn't be telling the drug
addict like oh you know just oh it's okay just
tough it out and just quit and uh cold turkey
is gonna be easy you know and then start talking
about metaphysics and god and love and stuff like that
doesn't that that's not at the level that the drug
addict is at and a lot i think a lot
of parents struggle with this when you're trying to teach
something to a child the child doesn't understand usually they're
not at the level of understanding the thing you're trying
to teach them personally i struggle with this in teaching
you guys because a lot of things i get sort
of frustrated um in that i'm trying to teach something
high and a lot of people i'm trying to teach
it to are not not nearly at that level so
there's a disconnect and i kind of expect you to
get it but really what i should be doing is
lowering myself to your level and kind of meeting you
where you're at sometimes i succeed in that sometimes i
fail in that something i definitely have to work on
the next point is understanding and forgiveness understanding especially when
they make mistakes forgiving them for making mistakes not holding
grudges not demonizing and moralizing to the one you love
because if you loved somebody you wouldn't demonize them you
wouldn't moralize them and you would be understanding of their
mistakes and you would forgive them which brings us to
the next point which is being patient with this other
the more you love someone the more patient you're willing
to be with them that can be a good little
litmus test when you're impatient with somebody that's that's a
little red flag tell you you don't really love them
the next point is huge i've also talked about this
in my in my last episode about the infinite gods
awakening this point is this is one of the most
powerful things you can do for somebody is seeing the
god and seeing the good in them even when they
don't seeing their goodness underneath their selfishness and pettiness and
devilry when you can look at a devil and see
the god within that is one of the highest forms
of love and that is in fact how you transform
and heal the devil into an angel is by seeing
the goodness in them even when they don't see it
when the other person is hating themselves you can look
past that when the other person is just behaving despicably
you can look past that not get triggered by it
see as just a facade look past that into the
godhead behind their eyes that's powerful that's very advanced if
you're able to do that that could be a whole
episode on its own right there um the next point
is recognition of its uniqueness so this one you're loving
do you recognize its uniqueness because this one you're loving
is is unique in the whole universe there's not two
like it there's only one of these people there's only
one of your children only one of your spouses you're
not gonna find another girl like this another guy like
this are you recognizing its uniqueness or are you trying
to diminish this uniqueness and try to make it like
everybody else or fit some fantasy of yours that would
diminish its uniqueness see honoring its uniqueness see if i'm
honoring your uniqueness as a conscious entity that you are
you're going to feel very respected and loved just from
that alone and this is where parents fail children a
lot is that the parents they just don't honor the
uniqueness of their children enough uniqueness and how they want
to dress uniqueness in how they uh you know what
hobbies they're partaking in uniqueness and their passions uniqueness and
their strengths and weaknesses like as a parent you have
to be very sensitive to the uniqueness of your child
and not just treat them as a generic child because
not all children are the same also like if you're
a guy and you really want to get into a
girl's heart like if you want to rapidly develop love
with a girl um one of the best ways to
do that is to communicate to the girl her uniqueness
girl like this will this will this will make a
girl fall in love with you when you're giving her
a compliment compliment her on her uniqueness not on stuff
that makes her the same as other girls that's huge
she'll really appreciate that that will that will really set
you apart from all the other guys um so you
can you can train yourself when you're complimenting people to
compliment them on their uniqueness and that's not just true
for guys picking up girls this is true like even
like if you're a boss and you have employees and
you want to have a like a great workplace culture
as as the boss it's not that hard to do
like ask yourself what's one unique thing that i appreciate
about each one of my employees and like actually know
the name of the employee and then in your mind
ask yourself what's unique about what's the unique like gift
or talent or skill or value that they bring to
our organization um that i can appreciate and compliment them
on forever in the future like maybe this guy is
like really has really great sense of taste and this
employee of mine is like really punctual always on time
and this employee of mine is like really attention to
detail oriented like great at that and this employee is
unique because of the way she dresses always in an
amazing you know sense of dress and then you communicate
that to them and they're gonna think you're the best
boss the next point is generosity and kindness the next
point is verbal approval and praise compliments this is especially
true for those people who have the love language of
words of affirmation they need a lot of verbal approval
and praise the next point is keeping your promises don't
make promises you can't keep the next point is peace
maintaining peace lack of conflict nothing kills love more than
conflict with this other yelling screaming and of course if
it gets down to physical confrontation then you're done that's
it you you've crossed the red the ultimate red line
um you can't uncross that line but even assuming you
never get to actual physical conflict just even just verbal
conflict is already gonna kill your love so trying to
maintain peace between you and the one you love that
is itself a sign of your love if you really
love someone you're gonna you're gonna kind of like bend
over backwards to try to make peace with them even
when they come to to butt heads with you you're
gonna turn away right it's almost like imagine like one
of those really like noble martial artists who like like
maybe a jujitsu master or something who's so good that
if you try to like if some idiot comes to
try to like fight him in a bar he's not
even going to engage in the fight right the idiot
might like run at him and try to like hit
him over the head with a beer bottle and this
jiu jitsu man what's he gonna do is he gonna
like beat him up no he's just gonna like move
out of the way just dodge and kind of like
deflect right because he wants to maintain peace because he
doesn't need to like prove how good he is how
tough he is that's a sign of love the next
point is telling the truth not lying this is huge
and and people don't really understand the significance of this
because this has like profound this goes really deep profound
metaphysical significance um the connection between truth and love i
mean but like just practically if you love somebody you're
gonna be telling them the truth now that doesn't mean
that sometimes you don't maybe i mean sometimes like it's
complicated because sometimes you gotta tell a white lie um
but like in the moment but fundamentally your relationship has
to be based on truth fundamentally and as soon as
you lose that basically all possibility for love is going
to be lost you can't build love on lies on
a foundation of lies and deception because there's there's actually
a deep connection between love and truth which i've talked
about elsewhere i won't get into that here the next
point is safety and trust if you love someone then
you're trying to build safety and trust with them you
want them to be able to trust you not in
a way where you then exploit them but like where
you're maintaining that trust in perpetuity that means you're never
cashing in on the trust it's like oh yeah i'm
going to get her to trust me for the next
over the next year and then i'm gonna i'm gonna
use that against like no that's not love true love
is you wanna you wanna main trip maintain that trust
and you don't wanna break that trust you're willing to
sacrifice yourself in order to maintain that trust so that
the other can rely on you this is what parents
ultimately need to offer their children their their children fundamentally
they're so vulnerable the child needs someone in the world
to trust out of the 8 billion people on the
planet the child needs at least one or two people
that they can just trust without any doubt and when
the child doesn't have that one or two people that
they can trust no matter what then that's a that's
going to be a very dysfunctional adult once that child
grows up because fundamentally what the child was taught is
that they can't trust anyone the next point is and
this is a huge one seeing the others realness warts
and shadow truly as the other is we we've touched
on this point uh before but like let's underscore this
what do i mean by seeing its realness if you
love a thing you want to see it as it
is not in some improved way in the future and
this again connects love and truth because love actually is
truth love has to be a recognition appreciation of the
realness of existence when you're looking at an object you
have to love it exactly as it is otherwise you're
not actually loving it and you're actually not seeing the
truth you're actually the truth in this case you're actually
in a position of rejection of truth you're looking at
an object you don't like how it looks it's kind
of ugly to you or whatever you want to be
different that means you're not really seeing what's there and
you're going into fantasy you're trying to modify it but
that's not what's in front of you right seeing it
as it truly is the next point is a deep
appreciation of its of this finite portion of consciousness as
it really is right so this this takes it even
deeper now you're actually when you're when you're looking at
this thing you're seeing it as a portion of consciousness
your own consciousness and that's a finite portion of it
and then you're appreciating that consciousness for what it is
like out of the infinite consciousness that there is this
specific form has the form it has it's finite it
has limitations and you're loving it as the finite form
that it is you recognize that it can't be infinite
it's finite and you're loving it in that capacity as
a finite thing that takes it really deep and then
a final point here which is really tricky is accepting
its selfishness in other words if you love a thing
if you love a consciousness a finite consciousness that's what
we're talking about you're loving a finite consciousness another human
if you're living unfinite consciousness you have to accept that
this finite consciousness is going to be selfish and not
to want to change that because you see when people
are being selfish we tend to want to change that
we don't like that and so one of the sort
of meta mistakes that you can make here a meta
trap in this in this work is like you write
down this whole list of all these things about how
to love right and then you're like okay good leo
i'm gonna practice this i'm gonna get really good at
this and then i'm gonna maybe even share this list
with my with my family and so forth and with
my spouse and my girlfriend boyfriend whatever with my colleagues
at work and then we're all gonna love each other
and then what you do is that when you're loving
them but then they're acting selfish towards you they're not
loving you back then you get angry at them and
want to change them and you no longer love them
because they're being selfish dicks but that's the real test
of your love the real test of your love is
not your ability to love someone when they're being loving
towards you and being selfless towards you the real ability
to love the real test of your ability to love
is how much can you love those people who are
very unconscious and very selfish because that's real that's true
about them and for you to love them you have
to love them as that not your fantasy of how
they are when they are enlightened it's like yeah it's
easy to love everybody when they're enlightened you see the
highest form of selflessness is the ability to not be
disturbed and to fully accept selfishness and that takes us
full circle so that's the list that's a powerful list
i hope you recognize the power of this list um
but we can really simplify this whole list this whole
what was all this list about really this list was
really only about one concept it was about love equals
selflessness that's all we're talking about here this is just
a list of ways to be selfless towards another because
that's what love is love is selflessness so the more
selfless you are the more loving you're going to be
and this also tells you why love is so [
__ ] hard why is it so hard to love
people um why why do parents struggle loving their kids
why do kids grow up with abusive parents who don't
love them why do many children grow up and they
don't even know what love is um why do spouses
fight and why do we have divorces and why do
we have problems at work between co-workers and bosses and
employees why do we have family conflicts and so forth
because all of these things for them to work would
have to be uh coming from a place of love
and truth and selflessness but we're all so goddamn selfish
and full of lies and self-deception and untruth how can
we love look how simple it is it's so simple
it's geniusly simple love is very simple but it's very
very difficult to actually implement and embody and that is
the whole work of being alive as a human here
is learning how to love by becoming more selfless and
spirituality develops this capacity to love by making you more
godlike because what is god god is infinite selflessness god
is love so really what i've been describing here is
the ideal form of love the ideal form of love
is what a totally benevolent selfless all-powerful omniscient being would
do in relation to you if you want to know
how to love just ask what would an all-powerful omniscient
totally selfless being how would how would it treat another
how would it treat you that's it it's that simple
now what breaks love the following i'll give you a
quick list we're going to go quick here because running
out of time violence abuse hate anger judgment criticism fear
lying exploitation cheating stealing neglect not making time for not
listening control domination manipulation demonization moralization blame disrespect ridicule breaking
promises projection gaslighting not caring about the other suffering punishment
especially punishing for making mistakes revenge closed-mindedness trying to change
the other to fit a fantasy fantasy some kind of
fantasy and ultimately selfishness if selflessness makes love if selflessness
is love selfishness breaks love makes sense right it only
makes sense now how can you know the things i'm
saying are true well let's do a quick visualization here
just to get you to feel i mean you should
have already intuited if you're intuitive you should already know
if you're wise you should already know the things i've
said are dead on but let's just make double sure
um so don't do this visualization if you're driving but
if you're not driving then go ahead and if you're
sitting there and you're not doing anything important close your
eyes we're going to go through a quick visualization here
so i'd like you to imagine that you were just
born and you're a small child this little consciousness that
came into this larger universe that is conscious you're vulnerable
you're fragile and even more importantly you have no idea
what's going on you don't know anything you don't know
what's right what's wrong what's safe what's dangerous like you're
you're in a state of complete ignorance and now really
become that little innocent consciousness very fragile and vulnerable imagine
yourself in that consciousness's point of view and now i'm
going to do some things to you here and you
just for yourself notice how you feel i'm going to
criticize you i'm going to judge you i'm going to
be angry towards you i'm going to yell at you
i'm going to lie to you i'm going to exploit
you and cheat you i'm going to steal from you
i'm going to neglect you i'm not going to make
time for you i'm not going to listen to you
i'm going to control you and dominate you i'm going
to manipulate you i'm going to demonize you and moralize
to you i'm going to blame you i'm going to
disrespect you i'm going to ridicule you i'm going to
make promises that i'll break to you i'm going to
project upon you and gaslight you i'm not going to
care about your suffering i'm going to punish you i'm
going to take revenge on you i'm going to try
to change you i'm going to hate you i'm going
to abuse you i'm going to do violence to you
how love do you feel on a scale of 0
to 10 if i do those things to you keep
your eyes closed we're still visualizing now shake your mind
free of that and let's do one more visualization again
imagine you're a little innocent consciousness that was just born
you know nothing you're in a state of ignorance you
come into the world you don't know what's going on
and now let's try this how does this make you
feel i'm going to shower you with attention and my
awareness i'm going to give you a lot of my
time i'm going to be in physical proximity to you

going to defend you and be loyal to you i'm
going to take on your agenda as my own i'm
going to make you an extension of me i'm going

on your behalf i'm going to support you nurture you
and encourage you i'm going to cheerlead you i'm going
to encourage your self-exploration self-expression and self-actualization i'm going to
respect your your sovereignty as a consciousness i'm not going

exploit you i'm going to totally accept you and never
judge you i'm going to value you for your sake
and appreciate you and see your intrinsic beauty i'm not
going to need anything from you and i'm not going
to make you a tool to satisfy my own needs
i'm going to respect your point of view wanting to
understand your point of view wanting to understand you your
uniqueness taking the time to deeply get to know you
i'm not going to force my agenda or point of
view on you i'm going to listen to you and
care about your interests and share similar interests with you

and i'm never going to cash in on that trust
i'm going to see your realness warts and shadow and
all as you truly are i'm going to deeply appreciate
the finite portion of consciousness that you are and i'm
going to accept your selfishness whenever you have the urge
to be selfish now ask yourself on a scale of
0 to 10 how love do you feel open your
eyes now on the actualized forum i asked what made
you feel loved as a child specifically i asked this
as a bit of an assignment i want to give
you that assignment here as well in case you missed
this on the forum and even if you did it
on the forum you should still really do this assignment
so here's your assignment you're going to get a piece
of paper or a notebook really multiple pieces of paper
and you're going to brainstorm you're going to ask yourself
the question what made you feel loved as a child
and this basically is anywhere from age 0 to age
20. so consider your mom your dad your siblings your
friends and the actions they did and try to get
really specific make a detailed list here what made you
feel loved so you can you can find specific things
activities that you did with these people or specific phrases
they told you or the way you guys hung out
together whatever write those down and then sort of do
an analysis of those items and pull out actual general
principles of what that means about how to love someone
so for example you might say well what made me
feel loved when i was a kid was when my
mother would read to me at bedtime or what really
made me feel loved is when my dad would bring
me gifts or what really made me feel loved is
when my my dad would tell you i love you
or um when we would go on a road trip
together stuff like that right so you write all those
down those are like the specific details and then you
you look at those and you do an analysis of
those and say okay well when my mother was reading
to me before bedtime uh what what is that really
like what was actually what was what was the love
there right it was it really in the reading of
the book is that really what the love was about
what was oh it's like oh well it's because she
was there for me and giving me attention maybe that's
what it was or it's because she was reading to
me because i was sick and i needed that i
was feeling that that's what it was it was the
support right or it's because she was reading to me
something that i was interested in and so it's like
an intellectual connection that we were forming it's like i
was interested in dinosaurs and she was reading to me
about dinosaurs even though she didn't care about dinosaurs and
that was the i felt love from that right so
do that kind of analysis and that should generate your
list of like you should generate basically the same list
that i gave you again this is a way to
validate that or maybe you'll come up with more stuff
to add to the list i'm not saying my list
was complete although it's pretty comprehensive also you should as
contrast to that which will help you is make a
list of the things that made you feel unloved in
your family when you were growing up and for many
of you maybe this will be even larger list um
this also helps right so then you realize that to
feel loved is just the inverse of being unloved so
for example if you say well i felt very unloved
because my dad would yell at me and beat me
with a belt and my mom would never be home
and she would be neglectful well okay so now now
you know what you need to do to feel loved
or if you're raising a child how to how to
make him feel loved is you gotta not be physically
violent number one and number two not be neglectful like
that now for some of you this will be a
difficult assignment because honestly a lot of kids didn't receive
much love at all when they were growing up if
you did consider yourself super lucky and only thanks to
that you're not some dysfunctional [ __ ] psychopath um
or have some kind of mental disorder but um and
you know that that's that's that's really tough um of
course you can heal that stuff but it's going to
take a lot of work to heal and you might
wonder well like leo i never i've never even felt
love i don't even know what that is i don't
even know how to make a list of it well
i'm very sorry that your childhood was so limited and
crippled um there's definitely things you can do to to
feel love and to reconnect with your love uh but
still just do this exercise uh if only if you
just make a giant list of all the things that
made you feel unloved just invert those and you'll get
the stuff that would have made you feel loved that
you missed out on and i mean what happened to
you is what happened to you can't really change that
but you can certainly turn yourself into a loving person
you can you can sort of jiu jitsu this problem
and say well because i've experienced how bad it is
to have grown up unloved i'm never going to do
that to my children or i'm never going to subject
my spouse or my girlfriend or my boyfriend to that
same kind of treatment you can flip it around so
you can actually turn unlove into a motivation to love
so there you go so looking back up at this
whole list that i gave you of what it means
to love another uh how do you stack up that's
my question to you consider your past relationships intimate ones
work relationships family relationships how do you stack up how
good are you at loving others probably not so good
see i i gave you a sort of impossible list
here i gave you the ideal form of love and
uh this ideal form of love would require that you're
completely selfless you'd have to be godlike to love to
this degree and you're very selfish and you're very finite
so how can you love to this degree see by
the way have you ever wondered why relationships like i'm
talking about intimate relationships are so hard especially intimate relationships
but i mean all relationships are hard but especially intimate
relationships are why here's here's the key because you are
entering this relationship in a selfish manner to use the
other as a vehicle to satisfy your own needs that's
the preconditions upon which the relationship is entered into at
all by you and probably the other two they're doing
the same thing from their point of view you're doing
this rather than meeting them as they are so you're
not really relating to them as they are you're relating
to your fantasy of them of who you need them
to be to satisfy all of your deficiencies so you
you then play this game of trying to mold the
actual them into the fantasy of them that you need
them to be for you to feel good and this
is the predicate for the entire relationship and when they
fail to live up to your fantasy you get upset
with them which creates conflict and fighting and ultimately uh
it breaks up credit to peter ralston for this insight
this is a brilliant insight into the nature of relationships
and why they fail i learned that from him but
it's very apropos here and um when you understand that
that changes your whole understanding of what it means to
create a relationship especially an intimate relationship this brings us
into the topic of conscious relationship which i haven't even
talked about yet i've been promising an episode on it
and this one isn't it this is just the tip
of the iceberg of that i'll have an episode in
the future just about conscious relationships and what that is
like what's amazing is when you realize that most human
beings have no [ __ ] idea how to create
uh a genuine relationship with another human being this is
completely out of most people's awareness and it's not taught
anywhere it's not taught in school it's not in university
it's like it's not taught anywhere for the most part
and yet we're relating with all these people most of
our our lives and then we wonder why it fails
and why it's so difficult well this is why so
i'll have a separate episode about that so anyways back
to love love is the hardest thing that you're ever
going to do love will test every fiber of your
being love cannot be faked your capacity to love is
an honest signal a selfish person is incapable of love
an fyi for you ladies who keeps struggling and struggling
to find a man who will love you and you're
wondering why realize this a self-absorbed man is incapable of
love if you want love from your relationships genuine love
not some sort of fakery you need to be in
a relationship with a person who's relatively highly developed we're
talking about developmental psychology here people who are low in
their developmental psychology in their moral development and their spiritual
development or their cognitive development or their in their emotional
development uh these people are incapable of loving you and
yet you keep dating these people so so the advice
here is stop dating materialistic on spiritual selfish selfish men
now that's easier said than done because then the problem
becomes well leah where do i find these spiritual selfless
non-materialistic men and yeah that's a problem i mean it's
also hard to find such women too humans are not
very well developed generally speaking and even the ones who
pretend to be spiritual are not very developed either a
lot of that sort of like spiritual spiritual people are
a lot of times just kind of front fronting you
know and i'm guilty of that myself i've played that
game um so yeah just because someone like gives off
the air of spirituality does not mean that they're not
actually um you know selfish underneath that like selfishness is
so profound that um you know just doing a little
bit of yoga or something it's not gonna it's not
gonna solve that problem some yoga some kombucha and some
new age seminars are not gonna solve that problem a
little bit of meditation here and there's not gonna solve
that problem this is a very deep problem this is
an existential level problem so uh the bottom line is
if you want love in your relationships like date people
who are more developed and then where do you find
these people well yeah it's hard the more developed someone
is the rarer that person is the harder it is
to find such people i don't really have a good
solution for you there other than just go meet more
people the more people you meet the more chances you
have of meeting one of them who's going to be
developed and also compatible with you and of course compatibility
also has to be there just because the person is
spiritually developed does not mean that they're compatible with you
that's a separate issue that needs to be looked at
i'm not going to go into that here um and
then you can go and try to like look for
people you know try to be in communities or places
where more developed people like to hang out um that
that might help if you're like at a bar or
a nightclub you're not going to find the most developed
people there which which is a shame because there's a
lot of good people looking people at bars and nightclubs
but unfortunately they're not very spiritually or cognitively or emotionally
developed which is why they're there to begin with so
anyways and in case you haven't figured out the above
list that i gave you um this is how to
raise the perfect child i have an older episode that
i did that's called how to raise rockstar children which
goes into a lot of like my ideas about the
psychology of raising good children um but in a certain
sense this episode here is actually like even more fundamental
because fundamentally what children need is is just love that
that's the most important thing if you're gonna if you
want the 80 20 rule on how to raise children
it's not a bunch of fancy parenting techniques it's simply
love eighty percent of your results are just gonna come
from love love your children and how do you do
that well you do all the [ __ ] that
i said above and you don't do all the stuff
that i said breaks love and that would be it
now of course that's again easier said than done i'm
not saying that would be easy that's probably one of
the hardest things you'll do in life is try to
live up to that list as a parent but also
the list i gave you above is how to have
the perfect marriage and another interesting bonus you get with
this list is all the stuff of course that i
said above applies for how to love yourself self self-love
go back through that whole list and rather than hearing
me talking about loving some other like you were imagining
loving a child of yours or a parent of yours
or a spouse of yours or a boyfriend or girlfriend
of yours rather than imagining that like this will be
kind of a mind [ __ ] and real eye
opener for you go through watch this whole episode again
and listen to me talking as though i'm talking when
i say other or it i'm actually talking about you
you'll be shocked at how bad you are at even
loving yourself you would think well but leo we're all
so selfish so i we should all be good at
loving ourselves right wrong wrong you judge yourself all the
time you criticize yourself all the time you beat yourself
up you moralize to yourself you do all the [
__ ] um you get angry at yourself you get
you do all the [ __ ] on that breaking
love list you do all that to yourself and you
forget to do all the stuff all the positive stuff
on the how to love list so start by practicing
that on yourself and then you can extend it out
to others once you feel the benefit of it now
when it comes to love this is as they say
this is a candle you got to burn from both
ends what do i mean by this i mean that
there's really i see there's two aspects to learning to
love to mastering love one aspect is accessing absolute love
through awakening and god realization which i've talked about a
lot in the past contemplating the actual metaphysics and the
existential dynamics of love contemplation of biases and difference how
i said that love love is indifference uh basically you
need you need to shift your state of conscience to
experience god's love realize that god is love realize that
you're loved existentially find the source of infinite love within
you within your consciousness realize that consciousness is love realize
that love is equivalent to absolute truth all that stuff
you can do that with maybe yoga or meditation but
realistically you're going to need something more powerful like psychedelics
to do that so that's like where the psychedelics come
in that's burning the candle from one end and then
from the other end what you got to do is
practice what i talked about in this episode this is
the more practical side this is the human domain of
love practice love in the finite human domain with your
relationships practice actually loving specific objects in the world objects
and people when i say object i include people in
that as well i mean object in a very general
sense right so both both are necessary because you can
get good at like taking a psychedelic and accessing love
existentially but then when you come back down from that
you might even understand what it is and so forth
but like you're going to be very poor at implementing
love in your day-to-day relationships on the other hand the
other that would be a mistake uh on the other
hand the other mistake would be that you you practice
all the stuff in your day-to-day life of loving people
and you think well good that's just gonna that's gonna
lead me to the ultimate love and the answer is
that it won't it won't it's not going to be
enough you're not going to reach infinite love existential love
you're not going to understand what love really is if
all you do is you're just a good parent and
a good friend and a good spouse those are great
and your life might start to actually go so well
and feel so good if you get really good at
doing that that you might feel like okay well i
got it there's nothing more to understand about love and
no you don't understand how profound love is because i
want you to get to the point where you realize
that this thing is love for you to realize that
this thing is love this this requires accessing absolute love
but also just because you realize that this thing is
love does not mean you're a loving person in your
romantic relationships so burn the candle from both ends think
of how valuable the list that i gave you up
above is this episode is giving you one of the
ultimate master keys to success in life and just to
make it explicit what i'm telling you is become a
good lover if you want a good life become a
good lover not in some cheap sappy way in a
solid authentic truthful way love must be grounded in truth
this requires serious work this is going to take you
decades this will take you a couple of decades at
least to get good at being a good lover it's
really difficult this is one of the most [ __
] difficult things you'll ever do but then again what
else is there to do in life you have something
better to do why are you here what if from
now on you started to look at life as just
a training ground for becoming a good lover what if
that's all life is what if there's nothing more to
life than that what if you stop thinking of life
as some sort of biological process that's happening on some
material planet circling around a material star in some material
big bang universe that just happened by some fluke luck
and you don't know why you're here and what you're
doing and it's all just meaningless and it's just evolution
what if you threw away that stupid paradigm and your
new paradigm was that you are a consciousness inside of
a training ground that you've constructed for yourself and put
yourself in to become a good lover and that that's
really what life and reality is about how's that for
a paradigm shift how's that for breaking you out of
your nihilism and your meaninglessness and your cynicism and your
rationalism and your confusion about what to do in life
what's the point of life this is the point of
life love is the point of life it's not complicated
it's so obvious once you once you see it it's
so obvious the list that i gave you above can
be applied to your intimate partner to your family to
your friends to your coworkers to employees to your clients
to your customers to the way that you do business
to strangers on the street to men to women to
animals to the planet to collectives to yourself so there's
a lot of areas of application here don't just think
of it as romantic love for example or parenting although
of course those are probably the two most obvious ways
so let's let's kind of like wrap this up by
by really getting fundamental here what is love love equals
connection say this with me love equals connection love equals
connection think of it as two droplets of water two
droplets of consciousness coming close enough together that they start
to merge together into one droplet slowly you know like
they form a little connection and a little connection grows
and grows and then eventually becomes one so love is
about reestablishing a connection between two disjointed disconnected lost parts
of consciousness that then find each other and reconnect with
each other merging into a unity at the ultimate extreme
if you love a thing you should want to deepen
your connection with it this applies to people but also
to things i talk a lot about how people tend
to be shallow and live life in a shallow way
well look here's a connection between that and love is
that really when you're living life on the surface in
a shallow way in a materialistic way what you're actually
doing is you're not deeply connecting with reality and that's
all spirituality is people who are spiritual and motivated by
spiritual pursuits they want a deep connection with reality because
you recognize the significance and miracle of what life and
reality are that you don't want a shallow form of
it you want a deep experience of life so then
the question becomes and like how do i live my
life and if you're well i want to live a
deep life because i recognize the sacredness of life i
want to live a deep life where i'm deeply connected
to reality and to myself and to others and then
the question is simply okay well what creates that how
do i deepen my connection what are the things that
deepen my connection and what are the things that sever
that connection and then it just becomes a matter of
let me just discipline myself to do the things that
deepen the connection and let me let go of all
the things that are obstacles impediments that are severing the
connection and keeping me disconnected see figuring out life is
not so hard i'm giving you the ultimate the ultimate
plan for how to live the best life you could
live right and you're going to use spirituality to deepen
that connection um but not just that you're also gonna
you're also just gonna do all the mundane things you're
gonna do that with love too even the job that
you get the career you have that's going to be
about deepening your connection with reality so that you can
love reality more and you know what the good news
is reality is infinitely deep so you can go as
deep as you want there's no limit the limit actually
is your willingness to go how deep do you want
to go how deep of a connection do you want
to have and what kind of things do you want
to connect with how wide do you want your connection
to be do you want to connect with the entire
universe do you want to connect with every living being
in the universe or do you want to be very
picky and only connect with a few little things here
and there then how deep do you want those connections
to be that's all up to you you have to
decide that for yourself so here's a magic question for
you for the rest of your life you can always
ask how can i connect deeper with this thing whatever
thing you're trying to connect to that you like let's
say it starts off with you just liking it you
have a you have a liking for something it's not
love yet let's say um how do you how do
i connect deeper with like let's say let's say you
like dinosaurs okay let's start there you like dinosaurs let's
say you like astronomy let's say you like history reading
history let's say you like politics let's say you like
sex let's say you like men or women let's say
you like children let's say you like computers let's say
you like languages you can only ask ask the question
about that is like how can i connect deeper with
that thing that i like and this question automatically generates
a whole trajectory for your life it generates a whole
potential life purpose for you it opens up the the
blueprint for how you're going to create a meaningful life
the problem though is that it's going to take work
for you to develop this deep connection that takes effort
that takes investment you have to build this deep connection
over years and decades this is not a shallow pursuit
here developing this connection and don't expect this deep profound
awesome connection to just be there for you from the
very beginning at the beginning it starts as something weak
and piddly like oh i just like dinosaurs i just
like reading some history i just like some some casual
why not one night stan sex it starts that way
you gotta then say okay how do i deepen it
like most people have no idea how deep sex can
go no idea they stay on the surface level of
sex it's it's tragic really how much potential is lost
the connection is right there there's an infinite connection that
you can create with almost any object in reality in
the universe but you're not capitalizing on that you're not
building it you're not investing it go see some of
my episodes about investment you need to invest in building
these connections this is what the majority of your lifetime
should be devoted to is deepening your connection to the
things that you're interested in the things you love whether
it's your family your children or whatever history dinosaurs whatever
you know if you like dinosaurs and you ask the
question how can i connect deeper with this thing at
first it might be like okay well let me go
buy some more dinosaur books you can read about dinosaurs
um then it can be like well maybe i should
go to university and actually study paleontology and then you
say well why not why am i why is there
something better i should do well i love dinosaurs okay
well then enroll in university go study paleontology study geology
maybe it starts there usually before you get to paleontology
you have to study geology um and then and then
maybe maybe you realize one day it's like well [
__ ] what this means for me for me to
connect with the dinosaurs like i have to actually go
out in the field and dig up some [ __
] dinosaurs find a new dinosaur and then that becomes
your life purpose and then you start to love your
life but you see to get to the point where
you actually go out and dig up dinosaurs for a
living get paid for it and so forth this is
not something you do in a weekend this this takes
cultivation this takes long-term investment i have an episode called
um why valuable things require investment over time go watch
that episode because this is exactly what i'm talking about
here we're connecting that with love and i'm gonna have
another episode in the future that i'm already that i
already planned about more the more talk needs to be
more needs to be said about investing because you guys
are so bad at investing in yourselves um a lot
more to say about that but anyways so like um
yeah it like for you to become like a dinosaur
hunter as your life purpose or whatever um this is
gonna take a decade of development but again do you
have something better to do you have something more that
you love if there's something more you love than that
then go do that the problem is that people are
not developing these connections and therefore they are not loving
their lives and therefore they're not yeah they're miserable and
also they can't generate much value for the world too
because when you're miserable you're not passionate how can you
generate value for the world you can't work really hard
you're not at your best love is what puts you
at your best when you're in love when you're loving
that's when you're at your best whatever you love it
doesn't matter what it is consciously work to connect deeper
with it lack of love is equal to disconnection separation
division and partiality romantic love is the desire to unite
and a feeling of union and connection between two separate
parts of consciousness romantically you want to be in union
but also there's a balance there you want to maintain
your autonomy and you want to survive as an individual
self so that's why romance is so tricky because on
the one hand you want to merge together on the
one on the other hand you want to maintain autonomy
and balancing that is quite difficult good luck with that
think of love as care for some part of reality
which isn't part of your separate self yet and then
as you love it you bring it into the fold
of yourself and and through this process here you're it
seems like you're bringing it in but actually what's happening
is that it's like you're bringing it closer to you
and then you have to bring yourself closer to it
so actually you're expanding the envelope of your identity and
self to encompass that thing like we talked about at
the beginning and that expands yourself so love expands you
love forces you to grow love forces you to confront
all of the obstacles that are preventing you from loving
deeper love is you can think of love as the
fuel for personal development why are you doing personal development
what are you developing towards why are you expanding yourself
why are you growing what does it mean to grow
as a human for what purpose to make more money
to have more sex no it's to develop and expand
your capacity to love that's what growth is think of
love as equivalent to care for other care beyond yourself
to care for another genuinely you have to expand yourself
and the smaller and more limited the self is that
you start off with the more needy it is the
harder it's going to be for you to care for
others because you're going to be too needy you're going
to need others to care for you but it can
still be done no matter you know no matter where
you are you can still you can always grow and
be more loving it's all a matter of degree think
of love as seeing the beauty of some part of
reality love as acceptance and seeing a thing's inherent perfection
interfacing with its beauty if you love to study dinosaurs
you see the beauty in the dinosaurs if you love
to study us astronomy it's because you see beauty in
the night sky if you love sex it's because you
see beauty in the sex if you love computer gadgets
and you want to be a you know a tech
geek or whatever then you love technology you see the
beauty in the technology it's going to be different for
all sorts of people that's one of the amazing things
about love is that it's infinitely diverse it expresses itself
in uh an endless variety of finite ways like this
think of love as the opposite of rejection hate criticism
judgment needing something to be different manipulation domination and bias
to accept reality as it is to see the inherent
beauty of reality or any part of reality a part
or the whole is love think about it like this
if you lacked all bias why wouldn't you extend the
care that you have for yourself to everyone else can
you see that it's biased that's preventing you from doing
that for more on bias and what i mean by
that and how profound that concept is go check out
my episodes one called self bias the other one called
understanding bias bias is core to my teachings and core
to understanding the ultimate structure of reality and core to
understanding love ultimately god is love because god is acting
on behalf of the good of all of existence that's
the highest good and the reason god is acting that
way is because it's completely selfless that's what infinite selflessness
would do it would act to ensure um the highest
good for the totality and you are god god is
not something other than you you are god you're just
dreaming you're stuck in a finite dream so really what
reality is is god as it's expanding its sense of
self and connecting with love little finite biased pieces of
love it's actually awakening to the fact that it's infinite
love and so the more you're loving the more you're
loving eventually you realize oh my god that's just what
i am i'm just love and of course that was
the whole motivation so i'm i'm literally explaining to you
the entire engine that runs reality it's an expansion of
love it's a it's a fractal of love consciousness is
realizing its own love for itself by healing and unifying
disconnected parts of itself to then culminate in the ultimate
unification which is infinity god love self with a capital
s and that's that that's reality nutshell now here's an
important point don't beat yourself up for failing to love
to this degree of perfection that i've outlined here i've
outlined perfection here it's actually impossible for a finite self
such as yourself to love to this degree you'd have
to be completely selfless which would jeopardize your survival as
a finite self it could kill you so that's the
existential bind and trade-off here the more selfless you are
the more it could kill you because you stop caring
about being a specific way being a finite human self
so the point here is not to become perfectly loving
you're never really going to live up to that in
practice on the material human level on this planet uh
really the point of this talk is to just inch
you towards higher love become a little bit more loving
than you've been yesterday last week last month last year
that's it that's all you're doing and as you do
that your life becomes better you start to feel happier
things go better for you there's less conflict less agitation
less fear less anxiety and so on and um but
don't moralize yourself like oh well leo says i should
be this loving and i'm not and so now i'm
depressed like no that's gonna again apply this to yourself
first and foremost if god was looking at you what
god would see in you is that you're really [
__ ] selfish needy and fearful and god perfectly understands
that you're not capable of that level of love but
god also sees the potential in you because god knows
you're god even though you don't know that yet god
god god sees the potential in you of growing and
gradually expanding your sense of self bit by bit by
bit practicing love a little bit more a little bit
more a little bit more accessing some awakenings and um
and making progress like an inchworm like a caterpillar inching
along towards love uh and and god is patient with
you and doesn't need you to be otherwise god is
accepting of your selfishness and your neediness and your limitation
and so there's no rush there's no judgment you're not
going to hell love at your own pace love genuinely
don't try to fake your love don't try to love
something that you don't really love like the love has
to come from a consciousness a sort of recognition of
the beauty of the thing that you're interfacing with not
because you have to because you want to and if
you don't want to then don't do it stay where
you are you can stay your entire life at your
current level of love not raise your capacity one bit
and god loves you all the same and there's no
problem at all the question though is are you going
to be satisfied with that at the end of your
life or are you going to wish that you pushed
yourself a little bit to level a bit more as
you satisfy your own needs life becomes more and more
about helping others satisfy their needs until eventually you reach
a point where you have no needs at all you're
completely selfless and then your life just becomes about service
to other again this is an ideal realistically you're probably
never going to reach this point but it's an ideal
to shoot for it kind of tells you what the
trajectory of life should be now one final trap here
that i want to point out for you especially you
ladies but some men as well uh nothing i said
in this episode is a license or justification or me
telling you to stay with your abuser if you're in
a relationship where somebody is abusing you whether it's a
parent or a spouse girlfriend boyfriend co-worker or boss you
might take it to mean that you have to stay
in that situation and work through it and suffer the
abuse not at all that's not what i'm telling you
at all in fact for people who think that my
advice is exactly the opposite in this case what it
means for you to learn to love first you have
to start by loving yourself is to love yourself you
have to respect yourself respect your own sovereignty respect your
own values and um what that means is set boundaries
learn to say no and leave this abusive situation once
you've left the situation i'm not saying you got to
hate the person who's abusing you you don't need to
hate them but leave leave get yourself into a safe
peaceful environment where you're not being harassed abused um bullied
around and then from that place you can keep doing
your work and you can even love your abuser from
that place where you're not with the abuser anymore you
see the mistake people make is they say well i'm
just going to love my abuser and stay no you
leave you never talk to them again and then you
can love them at a distance in your mind you
you can you can still have compassion and empathy and
sympathy for the abuser because the only reason they're an
abuser because they were abused um like that's that's all
fine but that doesn't mean you stay all right so
just avoid that trap otherwise it's going to get real
bad and it's it's not going to make you more
loving loving this you know narcissistic abuser who just keeps
taking and taking and taking this is not going to
this is not going to help you to actualize your
full potential as god all right i'm done here a
few final points here um before i go the life
purpose course i hope you realize this my life purpose
course is over 25 hours of practical advice and material
brand new material that i don't cover on my normal
channel in the free videos that really what it's about
you could think of it as it's like a blueprint
of how to develop a career that you love i
could have called it not the life purpose course but
the how to fall in love with your life course
i could have called it that so if you like
this idea that i was talking about you know the
dinosaurs and so forth the life purpose course fits right
into there it shows you how to practically do that
now in the course i don't talk about love so
much directly explicitly the way i do here but basically
that course is showing you how to find your top
values find your strengths and how to align your whole
life with that and then follow through on that so
check that out and the final point i want to
make here is that um it's important that you guys
understand and are patient with me um and don't expect
me to be perfectly loving towards you so love like
i said i mean this is a lifelong project right
i'm going to be learning how to be a better
lover for the rest of my life and i still
there's a lot of work i still got to do
on myself at the practical level and i'm still exploring
the metaphysical dimensions of love as well there's still more
insights i need there so um you might say well
leo you talk about all this love stuff but then
but then sometimes you're being a dick or an [
__ ] to me or like you're neglecting me or
you're not following all this stuff you said so you're
a hypocrite yeah the the leo that you know is
a finite form of consciousness right so as a finite
form of consciousness i'm not going to live up to
all these standards i'm i'm giving you sort of like
the pure i'm giving i i've taken the purest insights
direct from god given it to you that doesn't mean
i can live up to all of it this is
like a an ideal blueprint that i'm going to be
working for decades towards so be patient with me i
know i got a lot of work to do and
i'm not always loving um i don't always come off
as the most loving guy and you'll understand when you
actually try to implement this list if you really try
you'll understand how difficult it is and actually it's through
trying and failing and failing and failing and falling into
various traps and self-deceptions and seeing your own selfishness very
deeply and suffering through it all you'll going through breakups
and all this stuff like you'll realize how deficient you
are at love you'll realize how self you'll you'll be
disgusted with your own selfishness that's why most people don't
do this right and it's by going through that process
that eventually you'll you'll develop a compassion for the selfishness
of others such that you will not place demands on
others to be selfless for you because you realize that
that's a completely selfish demand to place on another is
to ask them to be as selfless as god towards
you to be perfectly selfless towards you that's the most
selfish demand you could make of someone you see and
you'll recognize that and then you'll understand why people are
not more loving and you'll forgive them for that because
you'll know firsthand how difficult it was for you and
you'll be so aware of all your personal deficiencies in
this area and then you'll stop judging others i hope
one day you get there until then stay tuned for
more you
