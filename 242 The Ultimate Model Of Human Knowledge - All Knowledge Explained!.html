            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/y_bs-W_xON4' target='_blank'>The Ultimate Model Of Human Knowledge - All Knowledge Explained!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Meeting with Thiago</b>: Leo Gura speaks about meeting Thiago, a deeply religious schoolmate, and how these interactions opened his eyes to a different worldview, forcing him to question his own beliefs and perspectives on God and reality.
</li><li><b>Disputing factual beliefs</b>: Debates with Thiago lead Gura to question why intelligent people, even when encountering scientific evidence, still clung to their beliefs - such as believing the earth was only 5,000 years old. This fueled his interest in the human psyche and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Comparing historical culture biases</b>: Studying history and observing how cultures were influenced by their beliefs caused further doubt for Gura, who started questioning how his current beliefs differed from those of cultures in the past.
</li><li><b>Intellectual blunders in history</b>: Noticing repeated intellectual errors in the course of history, even among reputable scientists, Gura questioned how these errors were possibly being repeated in the current day. 
</li><li><b>Epiphany on self-deception</b>: The resistance he encountered when trying to challenge the beliefs of others made Gura consider that he may be the one deceiving himself, leading him to critically reassess his own beliefs.
</li><li><b>Exploring Epistemology</b>: Gura began studying Epistemology, a branch of philosophy focused on the theory of knowledge. This led to a deeper exploration of truth, deception, and intellectual certainty. 
</li><li><b>An exercise in introspection</b>: He suggests a simple exercise where he repeatedly questions the truth of his beliefs to uncover their underlying assumptions, advocating for this method to be used by viewers in their own introspection.
</li><li><b>Arrival at assumptions</b>: This introspection leads Gura to a realization that all beliefs eventually boil down to foundational assumptions that, while seemingly fundamental, are also subject to questioning.
</li><li><b>Questioning of personal beliefs</b>: Leo Gura discusses how he started to question his previously held beliefs, including self-evident assumptions. He questioned his own belief in God and realized that his belief is based on how it fits into his overall worldview and intuition, rather than evidence. 
</li><li><b>Self-judging beliefs</b>: Leo realized that he was judging his own beliefs and questioned its validity. He equated the problem to the conflict of interest that would arise if he were to judge himself in a trial. He raised the potential for personal bias when judging our own beliefs and the potential bias of others we might ask to analyze our beliefs.
</li><li><b>Questioning the basis of practical beliefs</b>: Gura brought questioning to more fundamental beliefs, like whether the sun will rise tomorrow or the continued applicability of scientific laws. He realized that we take the consistency of these facts on faith based on past experience, but we dont truly know they will hold in the future.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of personal bias</b>: Leo came to the understanding that his belief in no God was no more justified than his friends' belief in God. He also noticed that all belief systems, including scientific ones, carry a personal bias. Each person uses their intuition to validate or invalidate beliefs, and these intuitions are fallible and biased.
</li><li><b>Realization of self-bias</b>: Leo realized that accepting beliefs as valid or not is often an emotional decision rather than an objective one. He argued that even when people claim that their beliefs are based on solid scientific evidence, personal bias and intuition are still at play.
</li><li><b>Influence of Philosophy on Leos thinking</b>: While studying philosophy, Leo came across a model by philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine. Quines model of knowledge as an interconnected graph of beliefs, with empirical data only touching the edges, validated Leos newfound doubt in his previously held beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Realization of potential self-deception</b>: Despite his realizations, Leo was aware that he could still be deluding himself with his theories. However, Quines model acted as validation for his doubts, and he recognised the need for constant self-scrutiny to avoid self-deception.
</li><li><b>Key Aspects of Human Knowledge Graph</b>: Leo Gura discusses certain aspects of Willard Van Orman Quine's model of human knowledge, comparing it to a graph with elements, like beliefs, interconnected and constantly adjusting to accommodate new experiences or empirical data. All knowledge, per Quine, is part of a man-made fabric, with empirical data only at the periphery and the depth and scope of the graph exceeding the data it contains.
</li><li><b>Beliefs and Underdetermination</b>: According to Quine, the totality of one's existing beliefs, or the knowledge graph, is "underdetermined" by its boundary conditions. This means there is a lot of "flexibility" or "wiggle room" in reconfiguring this graph to fit new experiences or facts. This underdetermination explains why people have different world views despite having access to the same facts. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in Verifying Single Statement</b>: Individual statements cannot be verified in isolation as their truth or falsity depends on other beliefs and facts within an individual's worldview. Adjustments in one part of a person's worldview often require corresponding adjustments elsewhere in the system.
</li><li><b>Tenacity of Core Beliefs and Adjustment of Knowledge System</b>: Quine points out that a strongly held belief, particularly close to the core of the knowledge graph, can prompt drastic adjustments throughout the rest of the system even when experiencing contrary direct evidence. This readjustment can involve rejecting or rationalizing the contradictory evidence, which makes arguing against well-entrenched beliefs extremely challenging.
</li><li><b>All Beliefs, Including Logical Laws, are part of Knowledge Graph</b>: Logical laws, which seem like hard empirical truths, are part of the knowledge graph and are not immune to adjustments based on new experiences or facts. Meaning, they can be as fluid and influenced by personal perspective and biases as any other belief. This realization puts a question on the intuitive trust we place on logical laws.
</li><li><b>Scientific Truths vs Other Beliefs</b>: Quine posits that scientific truths or beliefs, although they seem empirical, aren't necessarily more verifiable or accurate than other sorts of beliefs, such as about physical objects or gods. Such beliefs exist in our knowledge graph as "cultural posits" and their classification as superior is based on their effectiveness in working a manageable structure of our sense experiences.
</li><li><b>Reflection on the nature of beliefs</b>: Leo Gura discusses how beliefs are conceptual entities created by humans, not directly experienced facts. His reflection includes physical entities like objects or forces as well as abstract ones such as mathematics and logic. He notes that while these help humans understand raw data, often people get lost in models and theories and forget these are abstract constructs.
</li><li><b>Science and belief creation</b>: Leo reiterates that science, too, is based on belief formation. Scientists create models and concepts, supported by experimental evidence and empirical data, but there is still room for interpretation and personal influence in these models.
</li><li><b>Our beliefs about reality</b>: He also discusses how beliefs about the external world are not evaluated individually but as a whole (or a 'corporate body'). This understanding explains why discussions challenging deeply held beliefs, like religion, can often become heated, as the complete worldview of individuals comes into play.
</li><li><b>Arbitrary nature of knowledge graphs</b>: Leo notes significant personal influence and arbitrariness in the formation of our knowledge graphs, expressing that they could almost be considered as "complete fictions of the mind". He states that everyone creates fictional entities in their minds, irrespective of their scientific, religious, or philosophical inclinations.
</li><li><b>Worldviews work holistically</b>: The holistic functionality of worldviews can make them hard to question due to the integrity of their structure. This creates blind spots where people may feel certain and right, but could actually be moulding their worldview around facts, potentially ignoring or denying contradictions.
</li><li><b>Argumentation and justification</b>: Leo posits that argumentation is a tool used by the knowledge graph to maintain its structural integrity. He also expands the idea of the knowledge graph to encompass everyday life experiences and beliefs e.g., attitudes towards gender, politics, morality, personal accomplishment and relationships.
</li><li><b>Concern for practicality over truth</b>: Leo argues that people are generally more concerned with practicality than absolute truth. He explains that practical beliefs are part of the knowledge graph and subject to the same scrutiny and processes he previously discussed.
</li><li><b>Closure and introspection</b>: Leo concludes by encouraging viewers to introspect on this model of understanding knowledge and truth. He emphasizes that seeking absolute truth may not be a practical concern and encourages viewers to focus on understanding, evaluating and maybe even transforming their knowledge graphs.
</li><li><b>Exploration of practical aspects of philosophy</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges that while his theories might seem overly philosophical and not very practical, he believes there's truth in how people interact and sees a practicality in this model. Despite being unable to fully reconcile smaller questions regarding the effectiveness of scientific theories versus other fictitious entities, his curiosity was piqued in a practical way upon discovering the concept of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Concept of Self and access to empirical reality</b>: Leo suggests a radical idea regarding the perception of self as a boundary between oneself and the external world. He proposes that this "self" is a node within the knowledge graph and challenges the notion that it is a physical border separating us from reality. Leo posits that if this self could be discarded, we might directly access empirical reality without needing to construct entities or models about truth.
</li><li><b>The difference between explanations and truth</b>: Leo emphasizes that explanations and theories are not the same as truth. He underlines that truth is the root of everything and that all explanations, models, or theories are built to explain this truth. He recognizes that this, too, is another theory and would seem like adding more to the 'knowledge graph.'
</li><li><b>Destroying the knowledge graph</b>: Leo asserts that the only way to bring about a real change is not to add more to the 'knowledge graph'. He cautions that change can't be brought about by more thinking or by listening to his words. He asserts that the true change would come from completely destroying the knowledge graph and, by doing so, we are left with the truth.
</li><li><b>The Paradox of Illusions</b>: Leo argues that while all theories and models are illusions, it's crucial to identify them as such to retroactively deconstruct them. He claims that personal biases and belief influence every individual's knowledge graph, leading him to defend the view that everyone must question their knowledge graph to stop the addition of illusions.
</li><li><b>The Goal of Personal Development - Discovering Truth</b>: Leo argues that the ultimate goal of personal development is to discover the truth about one's own being and the nature of reality. He proposes that the discovery of truth would be a practical, life-changing experience that could dissolve all problems and barriers between oneself and the world. 
</li><li><b>Destroying Leo's knowledge graph</b>: Leo commits to systematically destroying his knowledge graph to provide the audience with an example of the potential transformations. This practice is in line with his advocacy for the necessity of recognizing and questioning personal and societal beliefs, all of which are part of an individual's knowledge graph.
