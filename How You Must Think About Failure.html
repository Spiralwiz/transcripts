Hey, what's up? This is Leo for actualised.org. And today,
I want to cover the topic of how you should
think about failure. Because the way that you're thinking about
failure right now is probably not very resourceful. And I
want to suggest an alternate way really 180 degree shift
in how you look at failure. And so let's go
into this, there's gonna be some good examples here, some
in depth stuff, a lot more is gonna be covered
in the article below. So this issue of failure, right
now, I think, the default way that we grew up
thinking about failure, the way that most people do is
they equate failure with bad, so failure equals bad. And
the alternative model I'm not gonna bury the lede here
is to think that failure equals good, failure is good.
And now it sounds like this is a little bit
of like positive thinking, or just like, What the hell
is this guy talking about? Why it's failure? Good? Isn't
this some just sort of some sort of mental reframe
that you're doing? And in fact, failure is not good?
Isn't that just a way to mask the reality of
situation? And what's interesting here is that you know, me,
I'm not a positive guy, I'm more of a realist,
I tend to think of myself as a realist, and
maybe even a pessimist sometimes. And so for me, it's
important to, to not just brainwash yourself into thinking positively,
but to have that grounded in something. And so the
reason that I'm advocating this viewpoint of failure equals good,
it's actually because I think there's some, some truth behind
it. And in fact, I think that's, that's what the
real case is, is that failure is basically a mechanism
that feeds a lot of the progress in your life
specifically feeds understanding. So let's, let's go into this and
kind of dissect this idea, and and see what are
the pros and cons of, of these two models. And
we're also going to look at some examples. So how
is it the failure is a is a is a
good thing. Failure is good, because it's a way for
you to gain understanding of something. If you think about
it, how do you learn to understand things in the
world, you probably understand your job, you probably understand certain
aspects of relationships, you probably understand things about the world,
how stuff works, maybe understand physics, because you studied in
school, maybe understand biology history. And the reason you understand
these things, I would submit is that you went through
a process of trial and error, and you've had successes
as well as failures. To build that understanding within you.
So what you have to do is you basically have
to create a model a mental model in your head
of how something works. And the way to do that,
the best way to do that is through a combination
of both successes and failures. And when people get fixated
on this idea of only going for the successes, and
judging the failures as bad, and doing everything in their
power to avoid the failures. Really, if you're doing that,
then you're selling yourself short. Because those failures are valuable.
Those failures tell you with certainty as to what doesn't
work. And that can be quite valuable in various different
situations. Now, I'm not saying that you need to focus
on failure to the exclusion of success. But focusing on
success to the exclusion of failure is also backwards, and
actually not very realistic. I think it's natural for us.
The question I have is really, you know, why do
we think this way? Why, why is it that we
naturally tend to think that failure is bad, and success
is good. One theory is that, we do that, because
we've been kind of socially conditioned. So as you're growing
up as a kid, you do something wrong, your parents
smack you across the head, or you're doing something wrong
at school, you get bad grades. So that's like a
feedback mechanism that tells you that you should be succeeding
instead. And basically, anytime you make a mistake, people harp
on you, they criticize you, they judge you for it.
And so over time, you learn just to not make
mistakes, because it's it becomes painful. So I think that
that mechanism is definitely in place. That's like social pressure.
That can be very powerful. But I think that even
more deeply than that, it's that it's within our biology,
to want to be efficient, and to be effective. And
so I think whenever you're undertaking civilization or taking a
new project, and you're doing something new, maybe something outside
of your comfort zone that you're not quite familiar with.
Let's take the example of like starting a business a
good example, if you've never started a business before and
you're starting one up all the sudden, there's a lot
of unknowns, a lot of variables that you're dealing with.
That will have you second guessing yourself, you'll start to
have fears about taking the wrong move. Should I run
this marketing campaign or that one? Should I enter this
market or that one? Which What should my niche be?
Should it be this type of niche or this type
of niche? What if I make a mistake? What if
I choose the wrong niche? What if I invest money
in the wrong One thing, what if I invest my
time in the wrong project? What if I upset this
customer by by doing this? Or what if I upset
this other client by doing that? What if I've said,
my investors, so all these doubts start to go through
your head. And it's very natural, because what you want
to do that natural drive within you is like, you
see, where are you at right now, right now you
don't have a successful business and you're not making money.
So that's like point A, and then there's point B
Off in the distance somewhere that you have in your
mind. And that's like the dream that you have. So
that's like a successful business, let's say, a million dollar
business that's generating income for you. And you're loving working
in and, and you've got customers that are satisfied. So
that's your goal. It's like a to b. And it's
like, how can I get from where I am right
now, directly to B by the shortest possible route. And
that's very natural, right? We want to do that without
really thinking about even why that's the way that we're
thinking. And we think that going the direct route, is
the most efficient way. And it's the most effective way.
And that is what I'm going to call the failure
equals bad way of thinking. Because there if you're, if
you've got this mindset that you've got a couple of
years to develop your business, and you're working towards it.
Anything that you do, that's taking you off track off,
the track of that is something that you're going to
perceive as a failure, and you're going to, you're going
to, you're going to see it as negative, you're gonna
judge it as it's something that is counterproductive to you.
And in reality, though, the picture, the whole picture is
more nuanced than that the failures that you're taking along
along that route, are actually generating a lot of your
ultimate success. And so it's not very empowering to think
of it this way. And it's also not very realistic.
A way that I like to think about it is
that think about reality as being a vast possibility space,
right? So there's all these different actions that you can
take, that will lead to different results. You know, if
you throw up, if you throw up, I throw my
wallet up in the air, gravity's gonna pull it down.
So that action will lead to some sort of, reaction.
If, if I go and I eat unhealthy food, that
action is going to lead to some sort of healthy,
unhealthy reaction where I'm going to gain weight. Or if
I say something mean in a relationship, then there will
be consequences for that. Or if I say something loving
in a relationship, there will be positive consequences for that.
So there's always this vast possibility space out there, as
to what you can do at any particular point, that
will lead you towards a particular goal. And it's not
like any of these goals have any real meaning in
them in and of themselves. It all, it ultimately all
boils down to what do you want. So only in
respect to what you want is there meaning to the
different actions you can take otherwise, you can take any
action be equally happy with it, if you don't have
any particular goal that you're trying to reach. However, just
because you do have a goal does not mean that
you need to plot out just one path to get
there. A lot of times when you're undertaking something new,
quite frankly, you just don't know all the variables involved.
And so instead of going and trying to find that
one route that will get you exactly where you want
to be. What I'm proposing here is a different, a
different really, my totally different mindset about it. Here, what
you do is you, you take the mindset of an
explorer, and what you're doing is you're trying to navigate
this possibility space, and you're trying to see, what is
it that works, and what is it that doesn't work,
and what works in various degrees, because it's not just
that something does work, or it doesn't work, it's usually
not black and white, there's usually degrees to it. And
not only that, there's the further nuances of what happens
when you're doing shifts, how much better off you're going
to be when you understand some of those other routes,
right? If you will, if there's this massive maze in
front of you, and you've only gone down one route
of it, think about all the other opportunities that you're
potentially missing. So that when that goal of yours, all
of a sudden shifts, and now you need to take
your business in another direction. Well, you've already been down
this other route. And so you know, potential pitfalls there.
And now you're better at it, you're better able to
manage it. And what I suggest to you is that
success ultimately boils down to this happening in your life
as a whole isn't what you're doing is you're you're
trying out different pathways through this giant maze, this giant
network of possibilities, and you're learning you're modeling in your
head, what does work and what doesn't work, what's more
effective, what's less effective. And so as you do that,
you develop mastery in in that particular domain, whether it's
your life as a whole, maybe it's one particular aspect
of life, maybe it's with fitness, maybe it's with your
job, maybe was a particular sport that you want to
play and you want to be good at. So whatever
that is, instead of going in there and thinking, okay,
how can I get from A to B, I want
you to go in there and think about, Okay, I'm
gonna take the pressure off of myself a little bit
here, I'm not going to try to be perfect, I'm
not going to try to get to the end. with
utmost efficiency, what I'm gonna try to do is kind
of explore around, you know, I'm going to try some
things that may be a little a little crazy, maybe
some things that are counterintuitive, maybe some things actually have
a probability of high probability of failure. And I'm going
to be okay with that. Because what I'm ultimately interested
in is navigating that whole maze, getting a certain breadth
to my experiences, not just depth, but breadth. And that
breadth will give you more flexibility, and then ultimately, will
lead to success. Because here's the thing, a lot of
times you go into something new, you go down that
route, and if you invest too much energy going down
a certain path, and then that path ends up going,
leading towards a dead end, what's going to happen? Well,
you're gonna be very upset about it. Because you're gonna
perceive that as being a massive failure, now, all of
a sudden, you have to start that whole process over
again. Whereas if you were exploring around, you're not so
invested in the outcome, you're so attached to the outcome,
you don't really care about getting a to b, what
you care about more is like, your goal now is
not getting to point B, your goal now is to
explore this domain within life, and to master that domain.
And I think mastery happens through a lot of failure,
repeated failure. You know, there's a lot of quotes out
there that say, from like, really successful people that say
that a lot of their greatest successes have simply come
out of their greatest failures. Or that they just simply
fail. So many times, they ultimately found that one thing
that did work, you know, the, the, the cliche Thomas
Edison quote about how he had to go through 1000
Different materials for the filament and a light bulb before
he found that one tungsten filament that did work. And
so the idea there was that you don't need to
look at every filament that didn't work, you don't need
to be butthurt about that it didn't work. You can
just say to yourself, Well, I'm just exploring, maybe this
material doesn't work for a light bulb. But maybe you
know what, that material might come in handy. When I'm
designing something else, it will come in handy when I'm
designing some other device. And so when you're doing it
that way, all of a sudden, you're not so desperate
to find the result. Imagine if Edison was just like,
so desperate to get the light bulb to work, that
he would get just totally destroyed every time he would
try that filament. He'd be like, Okay, this is gotta
be the one, right? And then he goes, he tries,
it doesn't work. It's like, dammit. Then he goes out,
he looks for desperately for another material, he tries to
have material and it doesn't work. It's like, dammit, that
doesn't work. And then after that, how long? Can you
keep that up? Can you keep that up for 1000?
iterations, kind of seems like that's not a very productive
way to go about it, right? More productive ways to
just kind of be chill, the less outcome dependent bit
less attached to having it work, and just kind of
explore, you know, well, what are the properties of this
material? What are the unique properties, this material? Oh, I
see, this one has good electrical conductance, and it also
has good heat resistance and other properties. And then what
are the properties this material? And then maybe you compare
them? And you see, well, why does this material have
some different properties in this one? What are what are
the similarities? What are the differences, and so there, you're
building a more robust understanding. And if you're an inventor,
it's pretty clear how that robust understanding will ultimately pay
off. Because even if the filament never works, and let's
say Edison never even got the light bulb to work,
he probably still would have gotten a lot of valuable
traction out of having done all those experiments, and had
all those failures, because he probably applied that knowledge in
other areas, other inventions that he was working on. And
so there you have a reason for why you want
to be developing that robust understanding, right? And that robust
understanding comes from doing things that don't always work. And
sometimes you need that, because the other nice thing about
failure is that it builds emotional leverage. This is a
big one maybe even bigger than everything else we've talked
about so far. Because a lot of how many times
have you tried something even know how it works even
know how to do it, but you just don't have
like that drive that motivation to get it done? You
know, Jim is a classic example or losing weight. Most
people know how to lose weight most people know how
to eat healthy most people know how to exercise it's
just that they don't do it cuz nothing there is
really forcing they don't have enough leverage on themselves. They
don't have the pain of it. So what happens in
that situation is that you're looking for kind of the
optimal quick fix solution. Like maybe you're looking to drop
some weight and so you go and you try some
some kind of crazy diet that promises you a lot
for a little right maybe lose 20 pounds in seven
days diet, you try that one. And so you read
that On some magazine, you try this at work, you
failed, right? And then you go off, you try another
thing, it fails, another thing, it fails, and it keeps
failing, keeps failing, failing, eventually we start to realize is
it's like, oh, wait a minute, the problems a little
bit bigger than I originally thought it was. It wasn't
simply about a diet, there's something else at play here,
there's something about my mentality that's at play, maybe some
beliefs that I have that are working, that I need
to work on and fix those. And the reason that
you start to have those realizations is in, in fact,
because you had those failure, those failures in your past
that now get your brain working, right, your brain tends
to be lazy, doesn't want to work unless it has
to. And so if that seven day 20 pound diet
actually did work, then your brain would never have to
figure out anything else. And your brain would never have
to really go in and dig for deeper, deeper issues
for deeper underlying causes. But since that diet doesn't work,
and you've tried 20 of them, and you've been struggling
for five years, now you're so pissed off about it,
you're so frustrated about it, you're so tired with the
weight, you've been struggling to lose the now it's like,
okay, something's really gonna change this time. And that's usually
when you start to get some real benefits, some real,
some, some real action taking and some some epiphanies and
insights. And that's usually when people start to change their
life around is when they get that emotional leverage. And
so failure can be amazing on that account. So we
already talked about so many different ways that failure can
be can be good for you. And I really want
to emphasize that this is not just like a simple
positivity thing. This is about permanently changing your mindset about
how you think about failure, because even though I'm talking
about all this stuff, and it sounds nice to you
right now, and you're like, Yeah, you know, I probably
should think about failure. He's right. Failure actually has contributed
to a lot of my understanding in life. But even
though I'm telling you all this stuff, it's one thing
to understand that logic is another thing to actually internalize
it. And to operate with this mindset. I know, because
I've tried it, even though I'm talking to you about
it right now, it's much easier for me to tell
you that failure is good. But when I go off
right now, and I go work on my business, or
I go work on my relationships or something like that,
I'm still going to be very much motivated by success,
right? I'm never going to want to go out there
and say, Yeah, you know what, I'm going to just
explore the possibility space in my business here, I can
lose my business. But that doesn't, that doesn't worry me,
I'll just be the Explorer. And, well, I think ultimately,
if you can get to that state of mind, that's
where you want to be. Triggers really getting you there.
So part of it just be getting starting off with
awareness. I've been talking about this explore mindset. And the
reason I'm talking about it, because I do have this
kind of analogy that I use is you can be
an explorer, or you can be the crazed gold miner,
what I call and so let's contrast these cuz I
think it's it's illustrative. Imagine a crazed gold miner first.
So this is someone you might picture from, like, the
1850s, right? during the Gold Rush era, he's heard that
there's gold somewhere in the in the mountains. And so
he approached his life, and he's got these big ambitions,
he thinks he's gonna strike it rich. He's gonna have
a great easy life. He grabs his panties. He sits
and through the mud, trying to get the gold flakes
out, right. And every time he's just so he's so
desperate to get that gold. Everything that shines, every little
sparkle that he sees in his gold pan is like,
Oh, is that a piece of gold? No. Oh, dammit.
And then you're sitting somewhere sitting somewhere? Is that a
piece of gold? Not dammit. And so you're doing this,
this whole, this whole gold miner routine, right? And you
can see kind of the desperation for the outcome there.
So take that example. And now take the kind of
the opposite example of the Explorer. Now when I think
about the Explorer, I like to think about, let's say
someone like Christopher Columbus setting off in the in like
the late 14 1400s, right, he's setting off to explore
new lands, uncharted territory, and I like to think of
him like pulling up his ship and spotting some island
off in the distance there. And then, like telling his
men like, Oh, interesting, we got a new island. Let's
go aboard. Let's go see what's there. And there, it's
not so much that like he wants to conquer this
island, or he's looking for anything specific to get from
this island. It's just like, oh, this is interesting. A
new land. Let's see what kind of creatures there are.
Let's see what kind of trees or let's collect specimens.
Let's just explore. Let's see what kind of let's see
if there any humans here that we can trade with
that sort of thing. Actually, as a side note, that's
actually very incorrect. If you read anything about Christopher Columbus,
he was obsessed with finding a shortcut. ironically finding a
shortcut to the Spice Islands, because there was a problem
where spices were extremely expensive in Europe. And because they
have to travel through a very long trade route, like
the Silk Road, etc, to get into Europe. And so
really, the reason for Columbus's voyage was to find a
shorter route through the sea, so that the Spanish could
have better access to those spices. And so for him,
actually, he was so obsessed with finding spices, that it
actually destroyed his life. And it's probably actually a good
example of how not to live your life has to
be that obsessed about it, because he was so obsessed
about it, that he almost didn't get to really relish
the amazingness of his own discovery, he discovered this amazing
land, but he kind of discounted all of it because
he was so dead set on finding the spice route,
when in fact, the spice route was meaningless, in comparison
to what he ultimately found. There's a whole new continent,
new vegetation, new, new human beings to interact with, to
trade with new areas to expand into. And so the
realities of that situation of this little analogy of the
Explorer is not quite accurate with Columbus. But still I
like to I like that romanticized version of Columbus, or
maybe some other explorer, perhaps that just goes out and
explores for exploring sake. Okay, so so we've got those
two, two distinctions. Now, my question is, which of those?
Do you tend to be more like? Are you like
that crazed gold miner in whatever it is that you're
pursuing? Or are you more like Columbus or some explorer,
that's just exploring for explore sake. And this can be
in your business, this could be in your career, this
can be in any kind of hobby or activity that
you're trying to master and get better at, whether it's
a sport, some sort of craft or an art that
you're doing, it can be in your relationships, it can
be with, with fitness, and nutrition, can be with your
health. So really any aspect of your life and then
of course, your life as a whole as well. So
what I would suggest is that adopting the Explorer mindset
is going to be much more fruitful for you, in
the long run, you're actually going to get more value
out of it. And that's counterintuitive, right? Because you would
think that if you were so focused on the results,
that you would get there faster, and you'd have, you'd
have more. But the problem there, as we already discussed,
there are several problems, there's emotional problems, you might burn
out doing it that way, you're also being very harsh
on yourself. So you're creating a lot of internal resistance
and struggle, over the long run, if you're that, if
you're that kind of blind, and blood thirsty for results.
Whereas with the Explorer mindset, what you get is you
get a lot of benefits. First of all, you get
deep robust understanding, you also get the joy of doing
exploration, which is, I think, will tend to be a
more kind of a, a flowy in the flow in
the moment more present type of activity. And it feeds
into that that natural curiosity that humans have. So just
be naturally curious about what it is that you're trying
to master and get good at, there's that you'll stick
a lot of pressure off yourself, because you don't have
to be perfect anymore. You don't have to get it
right the first time. It gives you a lot of
perseverance. And it gives you the sense that you're going
to succeed no matter what. So you see a lot
of courage. Because your goal now is not to get
one particular facet correct, or one particular path Correct. Your
goal is now to explore and to understand a domain.
And this can be big, I think, especially starting a
business is a really good example. Because, you know, I
started my my first online business when I was like,
I think it was 24. So that was about four
years ago. And I knew nothing really about business. There's
some stuff that I just knew from pop culture and
from some of the books that I read, but I
really didn't know much about business. And I kind of
went in there weighing the whole thing. And I was
I was kind of desperate for results. And I really
wanted stuff to work. And I was really focused on
getting that one business to work. And part of the
problem that I see there is that first of all,
there is a lack of understanding, if you're trying to
go into a new domain, you just don't know what
the right moves are. So you can't be too worried
about making the wrong move. And so that's the problem
with the gold miner mindset is that every move is
either perfect, or it's not. And usually it's the case
that you feel that most of the moves that you're
making are not working. And so what you do is
you agonize about it, like this, this step that I
take get me further to point B No. How about
this one? How about this one? How about this one?
And it's like stuffs not working and so you're butthurt
about it. Whereas, if you're starting a new business, what
you want to do is you actually want to kind
of suss things out Do little tests here and there,
see what does work, see what doesn't work, see what
the opportunities are. Because that's the thing, when you're exploring
a lot of times you discover stuff by accident, through,
let's say, a process of serendipity, where you're just exploring,
you're exploring somewhere charted land, and then all of a
sudden, you discover that there's some precious natural resource there,
maybe, maybe you didn't even know about, right, how many
natural resources existed in America, that were even unheard of,
before, it was fully explored, you know, fruits and vegetables,
and nuts and spices and herbs, that that weren't present
in the old world that were then later exploited, or
new civil of ancient civilizations. So all this kind of
stuff, that there's no way Columbus could have anticipated any
of that. But what is important is that if you're
an explorer, and you're willing to take new information and
new discoveries in, then you can capitalize on those, right?
So if you're starting a new business, and let's say
originally, you have some idea that you're going to start
it this way, and you're gonna go into this aspect
of the business, you're gonna go into this niche, you're
going to, you're going to make your marketing like this,
you go out there, and you actually try it. And
then you realize, whoa, I was totally wrong there. The
markets just not responding. So you got to be you
got to be agile enough to to adjust and say,
Okay, well, the markets not responding to this type of
message. But I'm noticing that it's responding to this little
piece of my message. What if I take that little
piece now and I blow it up, and I make
a whole business around that, that's going to require me
to change everything I've done up to this point. But
if I do that, I'll have something real, something that's
really valuable. And I could have never foreseen that that
connection would have been there. And so you can only
spot that if you've got the Explorer mindset. If you're
very closed minded, and just focused on one thing, then
you're going to tend to only find the things that
validate or invalidate that thing, you're going to miss all
the other opportunities around you. So that is a good
one for business, I think, especially if you're new to
some domain. So if you're new to a sport, if
you're new to a business, if you've never run a
business before, go ahead there and get out there. And
don't be afraid to make the mistakes, because those mistakes
will then inform you what to do in the future.
Also, when you're thinking long term, more of that explorer
mindset, you're gonna be thinking more long term. It's not
just about getting this one business, operating and creating income.
It's more about how do I become a good entrepreneur?
How to become a good businessman? And what does that
mean? Well, a good businessman is not one person that
just started one business, and figured out how to do
something in one particular niche. That's success. But that's a
certain fragile type of success, which I want to contrast
with robust success you get when you actually navigate more
of those pathways, and you get a deeper understanding. So
in the case of business, if I'm a good entrepreneur
and a good businessman, probably what I've done is I've
started multiple businesses. And probably if you look at their
history of serial entrepreneurs that have been very successful, they
usually start off starting businesses that that tank, and they
might start 510 different businesses that just don't work. And
they've tried businesses, this in this type of industry and
that type of industry, they try so many different things,
that they get a good, robust understanding, before they get
their success. And then only then after they have that
understanding, do they find that one route, and then they
really build on that, and then they get something solid?
So that's like a good businessman. And in that case,
that businessman, instead of focusing on getting one business to
work, he should be more thinking about, well, how do
I become a good businessman, that probably means that I
need to be more broad in my, in my, in
my actions, more broad in my way of thinking about
things. And then when he's thinking that way, he's not
so upset with one of his businesses fails, he's not
tearing his hair out, he's not jumping out of the
20 story window. Because he realized that that's a that's
just one piece of the larger puzzle that's like a
battle and a whole war. And one battle is not
necessarily defining the whole war. So seeing the really big
picture can be important there. Whereas if, if you've got
that one person that started a business, and let's say
you started a business, and you know nothing about business,
and you just lucked out, you just happen to luck
out, you chose the right niche. You chose the right
marketing message, you found the right customers, stuff just clicked
into place for you, and bam, you got a nice
business going. And now you're kind of enjoying the fruits
of that labor. That's great. And if you can make
that happen. Awesome. But I think that you'll realize that
even if you get into that position, it's not as
envious as it seems. Because here's the problem is it's
a fragile success. What can happen is that you're going
to be sitting there on top of this thriving business.
But deep down, you're going to know that there was
a pretty big element of luck there for you to
get to where you're at right now. And And deep
down, you know that if this business tanked, you'd be
screwed because you think back and you think at all
the serendipitous events that had to happen for you to
get to where you're at, and maybe some of the
lucky stuff that had to happen. And the fact that
you don't really understand what it takes to create a
business from scratch, in a tough environment, where odds are
against you, in that kind of situation, even if you're
sitting on a good business, you're gonna be afraid that
you're gonna lose it. And that is going to mean
that you're going to be insecure. And it actually will
probably start to lead to behaviors that start to create
a self fulfilling prophecy effect, where you're so worried about
losing your business, that you start behaving in irrational ways
in paranoid ways that actually sabotage the business and RIA
crumbling down. And then once that happens, you're screwed, because
you don't have the knowledge to build a backup, because
you haven't really taken the time to explore the full
possibility space, you've only just explored that one path. And
so you only know one little facet of a very
much larger domain. So think about the kind of success
that you're building in your life, are you building a
fragile kind of success or robust kind of success? Chances
are, if you're very focused on success, and you think
that failure is bad, then you're building something fragile. And
if you're tolerant of failure, and you're willing to accept
this gives you some time to go build it on
a deep understanding a good mental model of of what
you're trying to master, then you're, you're going to be
much more confident, you can be much more grounded, that
success is going to be grounded in something. And you're
always going to know that you can go back and
rebuild it even if something slips up. And you're also
so used to failure, because that's just, that's just your
de facto way that you're that you're operating, that you
fail so many times that really failure is not a
big concern for you. I think a lot of times
when people get into something new, they worry, they have
this fear of making mistakes. So you know, it can
go from simple things that you do in your life
to big things. If you're starting a business, and you
really are worried about failure, then you're you're going to
be second guessing every move that you're making. Because you're
going to wonder, well, if I do this, well, something
horrible happened. If I do that, well, something horrible happened.
If you're even doing something simple, let's say you're just
cooking a meal, and you just got into cooking, and
you want to become a better chef. Oh, one way
to think about it is like, well, I have this
recipe, I want to execute it perfectly. So I don't
burn anything. I want to cut all the all the
vegetables and meat up properly. I want to cook everything
properly, I want to season everything properly. So everything is
just spot on. And then I'm going to deliver this
beautiful dish to somebody, and it's going to be great.
So there's that way. And then there's the other way
where it's like, you know what, I'm just gonna throw
all these ingredients together and just see what happens. You
know, what happens if I bake it at a slightly
higher temperature? What happens if I put some different spice
in there? What happens if I substitute that with this?
And you try it out? And you know what? Maybe
it goes horribly bad. Maybe you come up with something
that's totally inedible. But that's all right. Because you have
to ask yourself, what is the cost there? And what
kind of game are you playing? Are you playing a
short term game or a long term game, because what
ends up happening is if you just make that one
recipe by the book, and all you know how to
do is just make that one recipe, sure, you might
get it right. But you're not going to learn the
deeper skill of cooking, and you're not going to learn
all the principles involved, you're not gonna be able to
dissect that recipe as you would, if you spent your
time experimenting. Because we've spent your time experimenting, you're gonna
start to develop models in your head as to what
works and what doesn't work, what flavor combinations can go
well together, you know, what cooking techniques are the best
for certain types of food and not so good for
others, et cetera, et cetera. And eventually, if you follow
this more experimental route that I'm advocating, you're probably going
to become a really good chef. Whereas if you only
know a couple of recipes, you're going to be quite
limited, even though maybe you're able to pop one or
two out here for some important occasion. So keep that
in mind. And think about how afraid Are you of
making mistakes in your life? And, of course, there is
a caveat here, I don't want to say that you
should always focus on failure, and that any kind of
failure should be equally tolerated. I think there's different types
of failure right? So you have to be smart, and
you have to analyze which failures are low cost, and
high return and which failures are low return, but very
high cost. Let's take an example. Good example. You know,
if we're, if I'm learning to do something in a
computer program, let's say I'm learning Photoshop, if I open
it the first time, there's this tendency to probably be
scared to start drawing on the canvas using different tools
because it's like, well, what if this tool screws up
Yup, I can't reverse it. That's a scenario where you've
got pretty low cost. Worst case scenario, you screw up
a canvas, you can just start a new one, maybe
have a nice picture that you made in the, you're
afraid to use some brush on it, because you think
it's gonna make it ugly. And so maybe you screw
up one canvas, one picture, that is definitely a cost.
But the return, there's so much more, right, by being
able to experiment with different brushes, you're going to, you're
going to learn how they work and the principles behind
them much more quickly. So that's probably a case where
it's totally okay to go out there and make a
bunch of mistakes without worrying that you're making mistakes. And
you know, that probably, I would say, would apply to
cooking as well. If you're cooking a meal, what is
the cost of cooking a real meal? Well, the worst
case scenario with cooking a bad meal is probably that
you're going to, unless you, you make something so horrible
that it poisons somebody, and they have a heart attack
short of that, it's probably going to be that you're
just going to make something inedible, so that doesn't taste
very good. And so that's why maybe you spend 1020
bucks cooking a meal that you're gonna throw in the
garbage can because it's just inedible. Whereas the benefits you're
getting, you're getting all the experience of how cooking works.
So there again, is another case where the, the experience
you're getting, is really worth the cost of losing a
couple of meals here there. How about going and placing
your life savings on a roulette table? Well, that's probably
a case where the cost is not justifying the experience
that you're getting for it. Right, that life savings probably
took you decades to build up, you can do a
lot of good stuff for yourself using that money, you
don't want to go out there and blow it in
one go. Although actually I can make a case for
where that might be useful for some individuals. If you've
got a gambling addiction, then maybe that's actually something that
would be important for you is you might need that
kind of the emotional leverage that comes from having a
catastrophic life failure like that, like losing all your money,
so that you never do it again, when you actually
gain more money in the future might actually be a
really good way to get yourself off on gambling addiction,
not to say that you do that consciously, that tends
to usually happen unconsciously. Because these things are so painful,
we basically don't have the willpower to inflict it on
ourselves. But that's a case where you want to, to
not go for failure, you want to take calculated, calculated
decision to make calculated decisions, and really look at how
damaging is the failure ultimately going to be for you.
In fact, what I'm going to suggest next is that
the ultimate approach is to actually proactively go out there
and look for failure. Now, this can seem a little
bit crazy. But again, keeping in mind that you're looking
for a specific type of strategic failure, you're failing in
special ways that get you a lot of reference experiences
that are very valuable, but don't cost you a lot
in terms of money or energy or time. So we
just talked about I just mentioned reference experiences, this is
an important word because this is really something that really
ties in with this whole notion of failing and getting
understanding what is the reference experience a reference experience is
basically any experience. So any experience qualifies. But a reference
experience is something that's especially poignant, that shows you some
specific aspects of reality that, that you now understand how
it works, because you got that experience. So let's say
you think that gambling isn't very, the is a very
dangerous, so what you go out there, and you think
the gamble is a good way to make money. If
you've got that mindset, and you go out there and
you put your life savings on the roulette table on
black, and it comes out red and you lose all
your money. And then you're just totally emotionally devastated by
that experience. Well, that right? There is a reference experience,
right? Because that's some emotionally charged little fact about the
world that you went through in your past, that now
tells you never to do it again, if you do
that once, chances are, you're probably never going to do
that, again. Some people do, it just depends on how
stubborn you are. Sometimes we have to keep hitting our
head against the wall until we really learned the lesson.
And I would submit to you that most of the
hard won lessons that you have in your own life,
stuff that you that has made you prudent and wise
has come out of reference experiences similar to that maybe
not that severe, although maybe even more severe. So more
severe events might include like an epiphany you have with
a near death experience. Or maybe you had some you
were just very sick. And all of a sudden you
started to rethink how your life was going. Right? So
you got some emotional leverage from that experience. Or maybe
maybe you did something that you deeply regret in a
relationship or something else and all of a sudden you
use that to build up a deeper understanding. To build
up emotional leverage to then basically what you're doing is
you're telling your mind and your body never To to
skew your, your behavior in that direction, it's always going
to skew it the opposite direction. And sometimes it takes
multiple reference experiences to get our behavior to go just
the way we want it. Because sometimes what you'll do
is you get one negative experience here, and then you
swing your pendulum totally to the other side, then you
gotta, then then you start getting problems, because you're swinging
so far to this side, that you decide to swing
at the other side, the wind is coming up, and
let's say we had a thunderstorm coming in. So that's
why we go rustling in the winds. But that is,
that's basically what reference experiences are. And the reason they're
important is that I think that the more reference experiences
you have, the more successful you're going to be in
your life. And of course, this means you want to
get reference experiences that are specific to the thing they
want to get good at, but also reference experiences for
life in general. And the model I'm proposing, here's go
out there and proactively seek reference experiences. So if you
can fail in a way, that will get you a
lot of understanding and not cost you a lot. Go
ahead and do that, you know, if you want to
get good at poker, maybe you should go out there
and, and spend like, set aside $1,000 Go out there
and play a bunch of tournaments fail, but you tend
to lose that $1,000. But then what do you get
that $1,000, you probably going to learn a lot of
valuable knowledge about how to play poker, etc, etc. So
that later in the future, if you ever decide to
play poker, you're much wiser you know, all the pitfalls,
you know, the pains, without having sacrificed too much for
it. Same thing goes with business, try different things in
your business to see what is working and what's not
working. Businesses a little bit trickier, because a lot of
times business can have high risk, high cost, mistakes. So
obviously, you want to try to avoid those as much
as possible. But where you can try to play around
with it get into a playful explorer type of mindset.
And now let's see I have I have all this
stuff talked about down below in the article in more
detail. And I just want to make sure because there's
so much in the article. It's like a 3000 word
article that I covered most of the points here. So
I'm kind of looking at my notes. So I did
cover this idea of failing on purpose, I think it's
hard to actually internalize this mindset. But a few tips
on how to do it, I think what you want
to do is you want to personal develop awareness, you
get that just by watching this video. Once you've got
that awareness. Next time you sit down and you're doing
some sort of task, start to recognize for those moments
where you're afraid to make a decision, or you're afraid
to make a mistake. And when you recognize that, then
try to analyze and really ask yourself, how costly is
this mistake? And if you see that the mistake is
not so costly, then what you got to do is
you got to start reprogramming yourself, you just got to
say, You know what, why don't I go and just
Just try it. So what it's gonna fail, but it
doesn't cost me anything, I'll just learn something, you know,
just for the sake of doing it. And just do
it like that, do it once, then the next day,
do it twice, then do it again and do it
again. And slowly over time, you'll start to internalist internalize
this idea where your mind will start to say, You
know what, I like this explorer mindset, it's fun, I'm
discovering new things, I'm getting a lot more understanding, it's
not as dangerous, I thought it was going to be.
And so that now becomes your, your way of working
through through certain things in the way of understanding of
mastering, that can be a very powerful shift to make
challenging one to make for sure that's something you want
to practice and turn into a habit and be prudent
about which way you use it. And so you don't
make those stupid, very high cost mistakes, right. And one
example of this, that I can, that I can throw
out there, that the way that I used it most
recently is I was going through my coaching program, right?
I went through a life coaching program where it was
like eight months of coaching that I did. And I
would get instruction from from other coaches on how to
coach like in the classroom instruction, and take notes and
lectures and read books, and then I would go out
there and I would have to coach other people. And
I would coach people that were in the program, peers,
etc, my friends, just to really get my skills up.
And when I first started this, and a lot of
other coaches that were in the program with me, there's
this natural tendency to kind of be afraid you're given
different techniques or different given different questions to ask, you
can guide the coaching session in so many different ways.
So when you get on that call, and you've never
coached anyone before and you start off, it's like, well,
what question is the best question to ask. And you
know, you're coming from a good from a good place,
you want to help that person solve their problem. So
you're so focused on solving that problem, that you're not
really focused about learning how to coach, you're more focused
on just getting the results of that short term result
rather than the long term result of becoming a good
coach. And so I noticed this in myself and I
and I thought, You know what, we aren't just training
these are not paying clients. So I do have the
liberty to go out there and try different techniques. And
when I started getting this shift, every time before I
would get on a coaching call, I would tell myself
like, you know what? Don't worry so much about fixing
the guy's problem right now. Why don't you ask them
some questions that you haven't asked before, just to see
if those kinds of questions are effective or not? Why
don't you try this technique that you read from Tony
Robbins? Why don't you try to try this technique that
you think might be effective? Why don't you try this
other technique that you actually have been told not to
use by your instructors? They told you not to use
it. But why don't you do it anyways, just to
prove it to yourself, that it doesn't work. Or maybe
you'll prove that it does work and that they were
wrong. Or maybe you'll just understand why it doesn't work.
And that y is going to then be powerful. And
it's going to help you make other realizations about this
domain of coaching. And so I did, I went through
this process, I gave myself some, some leeway to ask
questions that weren't perfect. And just playing around with things.
And I felt like I started getting into my groove.
And ironically, I probably helped those people more in the
long run. Because with coaching, it's funny, it's like, if
you're, if you're very dead set on getting to some
to some objective, before you even know all the details
along the path, then you're probably going to, you're probably
going to guide the client someplace that's not very organic
for them. And that's not going to work for them,
it's going to look like it's a solution just on
the surface. So it's better to be kind of in
the flow and go with it and try different things.
Get responses, there's always ways to turn things around. If
you ask a bad question, or something doesn't quite resonate
with the client, you can always flip it around. And
there's always another session to, to prove that. So basically,
I went through this process for about eight months. And
ultimately, what happened is that by trying this stuff, and
deliberately failing in certain areas, I developed a really good
understanding, and nice confidence and I solid, stable confidence. So
now when I'm on the phone with somebody, like I'm
excited, I've got all my different resources at hand, I've
already asked all these different questions. So I'm not worried
about asking the wrong question, because I probably already asked
it of somebody, and I know how to flip things
around, I'm not worried about doing anything too wrong. And
ultimately, that that makes it even better, right, that makes
me a better coach. Because now I have that confidence
to bring into it, that confidence transfers onto the client,
my enthusiasm transfers on to the, to the client, all
the different things that all the mistakes I've made in
the past, I've got those recorded in my mind. So
I know not to make those mistakes with this new
client that I have. And so now, I've developed some
sort of proficiency, some sort of mastery in this in
this topic. And and that's what I continue to do.
You know, I'm always learning from new clients, I love
doing that. It's part of why I love coaching is
that not only do I get to help people, but
I get to learn about how to help people, I
get to learn about how to help myself. So it
all comes together. It's just like an awesome synergy. But
that's, that's a really nice example, I think that I
want to share with you. Because think about how that
that kind of approach can work in your life. Where
are you right now really put a lot of pressure
on yourself a lot of force and a lot of
fear to not make mistakes. What would happen if you
just kind of let that go. Take the Explore mindset
and shift from a failure equals bad to a failure
equals good mindset. All right, this is it, Leo signing
