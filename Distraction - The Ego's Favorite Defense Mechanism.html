hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about the egos favorite defense
mechanism distraction [Music] why aren't more people conscious in a
word distraction distraction distraction distraction is such a sneaky phenomenon
it's amazing it will amaze you it will both amaze
you and horrify you once you see the full depth
of it as you get deeper and deeper into this
work and you start to really go inside really work
on yourself man you're in for some rude awakening it
really is a rude awakening now the ego has many
defense mechanisms and why is that the case because they're
needed to keep the illusion of the ego alive now
by ego of course I mean you you are the
ego not some part of you but you the one
that I'm talking to right now the one that I'm
addressing the one that I'm pointing at that you what
that thing is your entire self not a part of
yourself but yourself the very essence of yourself that thing
there that's what I'm pointing to that thing is the
illusion and of course that thing wants to stay alive
if an illusion wants to stay alive it has to
use all sorts of slights of hand to make it
happen you see so even though the ego has many
defense mechanisms one of its strongest ones is distraction because
it's so sneaky it's necessary because if you didn't distract
yourself you would inevitably discover the truth about yourself which
is that there's no you in there and that's unacceptable
to you you see you see the irony here you
see the paradox it's really quite a mindfuck now when
I talk about distraction what do I mean I'm not
just talking about video and Facebook as a distraction of
course those are distractions that many people fall prey to
but to think that I'm merely talking about you clicking
on Facebook and wasting time playing video games and that
that is the distraction that itself is the distraction to
think that that's the distraction you see that's peanuts compared
to the real distraction the real distraction is not that
stuff it's your entire life your entire life everything you're
doing in your life has the big picture goal of
distracting you from discovering existential truth from turning inwards and
seeing what you're really made out of that's what the
business the busyness of life is about I'm talking about
your work your career business pursuing success pursuing money family
relationships friendships socialization talking thinking debating arguing trying to save
the world doing good in the world education politics church
religion technology science these are all distractions see the ego
creates all these things in a sense I this is
just I mean I have to be careful here cuz
I don't want to paint with too broad of a
brush because then people will say that all this is
so ridiculous is so impractical look there are redeeming qualities
to these things I'm not saying they're all totally bad
and that they shouldn't exist I'm just saying that in
the big picture what the ego is doing is it's
using these as human shields to keep you from really
doing the inner work that you got to do to
become conscious in life you see there are very convenient
distractions now people misunderstand this notion of distraction because they
think oh well a distraction is a very frivolous thing
no no no no to have a really high quality
distraction you distract yourself not with a frivolous thing you
distract yourself with the most important thing in the world
things like your career money family talking thinking science politics
religion all these things are held by most human beings
as the most important things in the world I mean
what is more important than that you see and that
is the distraction it's a sleight of hand that the
mind plays with your priorities in life which gets you
to have the wrong priorities in life which gets you
pursuing the wrong things in life that's what I'm talking
about not just video games see it's easy to think
of video games as a distraction of course they are
distraction and many people waste their entire lives or their
entire teenage years or whatever playing thousands of hours of
video games and that's a big problem that keeps a
lot of people from becoming conscious that becomes an addiction
and there are many of these addictions and I've talked
about them in the past I have many episodes where
we've sort of covered this topic but we're hitting it
from different angles because it's really goddamn important I have
an episode called 30 way society you in the ass
that's the chimp episode where I ranted a bit about
the chimp time of society and how society really holds
you back from doing this work so that's an important
episode that ties in with this one if you can
recall I also talked about minimizing your lifestyle in my
lifestyle minimalism episode so you might remember that one overcoming
addictions that's another episode that I have which sort of
dovetails with what I'm talking about here but here I
really want to focus on the distraction so that you
start to notice this it's really beneficial for you to
start to see and become mindful of the distraction that's
going on personally in your life how your mind is
creating the distractions they're always very well justified always always
your worst distractions are the ones that don't seem like
distractions at all that's what's so sneaky about it that
is the sleight of hand which creates the illusion and
then perpetuates the illusion what are you being distracted from
from turning inwards from really facing existential truth and reality
and that's something I've talked about quite a bit in
my absolute infinity episodes and in my enlightenment episodes but
it's not just enlightenment of course you're delaying enlightenment because
that's sort of the culmination of all this but not
just enlightenment but just turning inwards and interests beckoning living
the contemplative sort of lifestyle the way the Greeks talked
about is becoming more conscious about all sorts of facets
of life becoming more conscious about how business works becoming
more conscious about how money works becoming more conscious about
politics about spirituality about your thought process right so there's
a lot of facets in life where you need to
become a lot more conscious not just enlightenment although that's
important and so the distraction is to keep you from
doing that and why is there this distraction why is
there this conspiracy it seems like I'm making a Sally
a conspiracy theory well it's not really conspiracy theory your
mind just has to work this way because it can't
exist otherwise you see your very existence is predicated upon
illusion it's almost as though you were a magician who
whose life depended on him being able to fool himself
into thinking he exists and to do that he has
to be a really good magician now you might say
Leo that's very paradoxical that can't how does that work
if he's the magician creating the magic trick fooling himself
that he doesn't exist but he doesn't actually exist and
he's fooling himself that he does exist doesn't that prove
that he actually exists and the answer is no it
doesn't that's the illusion you can see through that illusion
and that's the thing that requires turning inwards it's it
is it is mind-bending it is paradoxical fundamentally what is
a distraction a distraction works like this we make some
noise over there so that no one looks over here
and then we stall out the clock that's the egos
game here to win the game the ego by which
I mean you you not some part but you you
merely need to stall out the clock so you distract
yourself for 50 60 years of your life and then
by that point you're too old you're too sick you're
too stubborn you're too mentally rigid to care about anything
and then you die and that's the end of the
game and the ego won you won because you persisted
as you that's the game that's being played here all
the mind has to do is just stall out the
clock with distractions see cuz you could easily spend 50
years of your life doing business chasing money chasing women
having children going to school and going on vacations and
playing video games and going to church and saving the
world and doing all this sort of stuff but you
never discover yourself I really want you two to grasp
this let this sink in that 99 not just 99
percent but 99.99999% of all human beings on the earth
die without ever discovering who they actually are that's a
rather shocking statistical fact it's rather outrageous that thousands of
years into human civilization this is still going on you
would think we would have had some made some inroads
over the last two to five thousand yeah I mean
human civilization we think of it as 2,000 years old
but actually it's way older than that big civilizations like
ancient Egypt have been have been running for since five
thousand years ago it's quite amazing and and we're making
new discoveries all the time to keep pushing back the
time where civilizations existed five seven thousand years ago and
even before that really there were cities and this issue
of discovering who you were this issue of enlighten this
issue of consciousness is not a new thing this is
not some new age thing this is the oldest these
are the oldest truths that human beings discovered human beings
discovered this at least ten thousand years ago if not
way before that when we were still living in little
huts and little tribes of 5200 people people knew about
these truths but as civilization became more mainstream and it
really blossomed and ballooned and now we have this population
explosion we think that our technology is making things better
but actually look at the statistics 99.99999% of people even
very educated very intelligent very scientific I mean you name
it people with the highest IQs it doesn't matter none
of these things matter when it comes to discovering the
truth of what reality is they die before they discover
this truth which means that they are defeated by distraction
that's what that means that's why this point is so
damn important it's really worth reflecting on and this point
about distraction I'm talking about it from the very macro
sort of species wide perspective but also we need to
drill it down to your particular path as your self
actualizing which you're gonna start to notice is just how
much distraction there is going on in your life and
how sneaky it is then why it's happening and I
want you to connect what's happening in you and why
it's so difficult to to to see the distraction happening
in you and then to resist it and then to
see that in other people and to see that in
the whole species then you see that oh my god
as as a human species and as the human race
we are just babies in this process see if we
had like 60% of people failing but 40% succeeding in
discovering the truth of who they were then we would
say okay we're making good progress but right now we're
at 99.99999 percent failure rate that's abysmal it's abysmal that
should clue you in into the depth of the self-deception
and the sneakiness and the sleight-of-hand involved just how strong
and powerful of an illusion this is when something is
set to be an illusion don't mistake that to be
some flimsy thing this is a very solid illusion I'm
talking about your entire sense of reality the fact that
you think there is a physical reality that whole notion
is an illusion and the fact that some people think
that out what I'm saying here is somehow controversial or
outrageous it just shows you how deep the illusion goes
and even when you agree with me it doesn't help
you to dispel the illusion the illusion is still there
part of the illusion is agreeing with me it's nodding
your heads and gastly oh yes this is also good
I'm gonna watch more videos and let's keep doing all
this and growing ourselves but see that's the part of
the illusion it's all part of the distraction you've got
to become very vigilant to the tricks that your mind
can play on you there's this notion called the red
herring have you heard this term used before in popular
culture it's an interesting term actually had to look it
up in in the United Kingdom I think it's where
this term sort of originated from is they have actual
herrings that they I mean herrings are our popular food
there they're not popular in the US or other parts
of the world so you got herring up there in
the North right and what they do is they smoke
it and they they salt it and when they do
it gets a sort of a reddish appearance you can
actually Google and see what a red herring looks like
it's pretty interesting it looks very red but the reason
that they call it a red herring and this notion
came about is because the the herring is so smelly
once it's smoked and salted that there's this story that
some guy used the red herring to distract his hounds
from chasing some rabbits with the pungent smell of this
red herring and so that's what the notion red herring
means red herring means it's a distraction it's something that
I flash in your face some sort of flashy object
I flash it over here you get so preoccupied with
looking at that thing that you don't look at the
elephant in the room and that's what happens is that
people go through their whole life very successful people very
intelligent people I mean our universities our top universities are
filled with such people and yet they'd never see the
elephant in the room which is the nature of who
they are and what reality is they miss it because
well one of these distractions is intelligence IQ university credentials
if you're a professor or a scientist people just tend
to assume that oh well that that saves me from
this problem no it doesn't it only makes the problem
worse whenever you think you've avoided the tricks of the
mind watch out that's when the mind has succeeded in
tricking you one of the ultimate examples of a red
herring in this situation is the religion huge red herring
the sneakiness of religion is astounding it's astounding at how
successful religion is at misleading people from discovering the truth
of who they are precisely because the whole function of
religion in a name is to get you to the
truth that's why religion is there that's why I got
created in the first place it wasn't created in the
first place by some woowoo people it was created by
people who discovered the truth but the way that religion
evolved and morphed and was bastardized by the ego to
serve its own ends turned it into the ultimate distraction
trap so that people can go and start doing religion
and they can get really into it and then they
think and they feel as though they actually are getting
to the truth and really they're headed in exactly the
opposite direction you see that's how sneaky this stuff is
just when you think that you have got one up
on your mind your mind has one up on you
it's amazing it's amazing when you start to pull these
layers back in your own psyche and you start to
see this actually at work and then you connect it
to everything that's going on in society and you start
to see what our society really is it's just amazing
if you start to do self inquiry if you start
to get serious about this you start asking yourself questions
like Who am I what am I you start meditating
which you can immediately notice is that even when you
make a little bit of progress maybe even especially when
you make some good progress in this consciousness work you
will fall off track something will come up in your
life something important something will come and distract you and
this is the most amazing phenomenon because it just happens
over and over and over again on this path it's
not that you're gonna get distracted once twice or three
times you're gonna distract it dozens hundreds of times in
this whole process this whole awakening process is you just
constantly being tricked over and over and over again and
seduced and distracted with red herrings away off the path
you have to wonder if 99.99999% of people don't get
to the truth why is that it's because the mechanism
of the mind has so many red herrings to distract
people that it's almost a miracle that anyone gets there
at all it's like you're being asked to walk through
a minefield that's ten miles long and it's just littered
with mines you would be very lucky to come out
alive through ten miles of walking in that minefield see
what happens in the awakening process is that you awaken
by one percent then you fall back down and you
forget then you remember a month later and you awaken
by another 1% then you fall back down backslide and
you forget maybe for a whole year then you remember
you again like oh yeah I used to be awake
and I want to get back to that place and
then you work on yourself you meditate yourself enquire and
you wake up 2% and then you forget something distracts
you society distracts you that's his job that's religions job
that's your careers job is to make you busy to
chase your tail in a circle you just taste it
around chase it around until you're dead that's what it
means to be yourself that's what it means to be
you that's what you are the false you the you
that thinks that it's separate from me thinks that it's
separate from the whole world that one which he'll discovers
that there are infinite distractions in society even if you
just go on a solo meditation retreat when you're outside
of society and you just sit there and now you're
saying okay now I'm gonna meditate or now I'm gonna
self inquire you're still gonna have infinite distractions at your
disposal all the tricks your mind's gonna say oh well
let's go for a walk it's a beautiful day outside
so you'll go for a walk and that'll be your
distraction and then your mind will say oh look at
that cute squirrel that you see on your walk oh
and then you're gonna look at the squirrel and that's
gonna be a distraction see the distractions can be very
micro they can be very macro but they can also
be very micro your thoughts can be a distraction you
might be sitting there you might even spend ten days
all by yourself in a cabin in the woods but
what are you to have there but a cyclone of
thoughts thought after thought after thought each one of those
a distraction and they're so sneaky and they're so juicy
they're so addictive basically your mind will do anything to
avoid looking inwards it has to look outwards that's its
modus operandi then it can function and then it can
survive your very life depends on this you see this
is a high stakes game for you at least you
feel that way until after you awaken once you awaken
and you look back in retrospect then you see oh
my god I see the shame this whole thing but
when you're in the middle of the storm the ego
storm when you're right the eye of the EO storm
it really feels like oh man this is this is
how life is is this just how life is and
it's very scary just to to want to walk out
of it because you are facing your death there your
mind tricks you into chasing after career business success money
family relationships sex reading books preaching to people trying to
save the world arguing criticizing intellectualizing philosophizing educating yourself getting
involved in political debates getting involved with drama with tabloids
with sex with porn I mean like the drugs like
it doesn't end you see how many options society gives
you and the more our society advances the worse this
problem gets it doesn't really get better it gets worse
wait till virtual reality happens right now virtual reality is
still but in 10 20 years when virtual reality gets
good oh boy watch out watch out imagine virtual reality
porn imagine virtual reality Facebook imagine virtual reality internet imagine
virtual reality video games humanity's gonna be really if we
don't if we don't prioritize consciousness above technological growth people
don't realize for example that your entire career could be
one giant defense mechanism one giant distraction or red herring
from discovering the truth your entire career people right now
who are billionaires who have devoted their entire lives to
building corporations and companies and earning lots of money they
don't realize that that is a red herring they missing
the elephant in the room which is truth which is
consciousness which they should be pursuing a great example this
also with careers that are red herrings is a conservative
talk show hosts people like Rush Limbaugh or folks you
see on the Fox News Channel and I'm not saying
liberals are immune to this as well I mean liberals
also fall prey to this but but these conservative talk
show hosts they make their entire careers and lies about
talking and bloviating endlessly about their ideology and that becomes
a whole career for them making are lots of money
like Alex Jones comes my loss of money doing this
your entire career can just suck you into this and
you don't see that you're missing the elephant in the
room and that you're just chasing a red herring and
you those people are gonna die those people will die
not even knowing what they missed they're not even going
to know they're not it's gonna be completely clueless about
what they missed which is the saddest and most tragic
part about this as great as your life might seem
if you're just living it in the ordinary fashion you
cannot even comprehend what it's like to awaken and one
of those amazing things that when you do awaken even
a little bit even just get a glimpse for a
few hours that's good enough to get you to realize
like oh my god I came this close this close
to missing it if not but for a few fortunate
circumstances in my life I would have been just like
everybody else I would have missed it and how sad
that would have been I would have missed the whole
point of life Society is a collective ego distraction that's
its function many of the mechanisms society are designed to
keep your ego perpetually stimulated and chasing its own tails
which is precisely why many Yogi's and monks choose to
go live in caves up in mountain tops or build
mana Terri's far away from society they become ascetics Hermits
recluses and in mainstream society we have a negative stereotype
about this so when I tell people all I want
to go live in a cave sometimes haha I put
that out there as a fantasy of mine and then
people have these negative reactions like Oh leo well if
you're talking about living in a cave that's so far
out there that's so radical that's so anti life it's
so anti what I want my life to be but
have you noticed the knee-jerk reaction that you have against
living on a mountaintop in a cave a lot of
people just have a negative reaction against this and the
reason that is is not because living in a cave
is bad it's because you've been brainwashed by society into
this thing called life life as you know it is
life within mainstream society you don't know any other kind
of life to such a degree that it's ridiculous for
me to even suggest to you that hey maybe your
life would be improved by going living in a cave
now the problem is that as soon as I bring
that up is that even a thought experiment the typical
mind recoils at that notion because it loves all his
creature comforts and it says stuff like well leo are
you really saying that I must go live in a
cave to become enlightened what about Eckhart Tolle what about
somebody else what about this guy here he didn't go
live in a cave he seems to be a normal
guy I'm not saying that you must live in a
cave I'm merely put in putting this out there as
a thought experiment as an illustration to see the extent
of the distractions that are in your life and also
so that you notice some of these negative characterizations that
mainstream society puts into your mind because mainstream society tells
you that if you go outside of mainstream society that
is bad out there it's terrible it's a it's a
wasteland out there you can't be happy without your cell
phone you can't be happy without internet and without porn
and without alcohol without parting without girls without guys without
children without family you can't be happy with any without
any of that stuff you need all that stuff you
see and then you believe it and then now you're
stuck playing this game not realizing that it's a game
also I put this example out there about living in
a cave is because I want you to see that
actually your process of becoming conscious if you are interested
in becoming conscious and also be still staying within mainstream
society that your process will be much more difficult than
it is for Yogi's and monks who go live in
caves it might seem like well the Yogi's and monks
you know they're very hardcore they spend their all all
day meditating and and not eating very much and living
in these very Spartan conditions it seems like torture in
a certain sense yes but also in a certain sense
once you're in that situation and you acclimate to a
little bit and you extricate yourself from the bubble of
mainstream society you're gonna you can experience a flip or
it's actually gonna be the opposite you're gonna notice that
how much more difficult it is to be conscious living
as a householder with a family with a business with
pursuing sex and drugs and partying and all this stuff
that's the really difficult thing is becoming awakened while still
doing all of that it's virtually impossible now I don't
want to say that you need to go and live
in a cave in order to become enlightened or to
become more conscious that's not true it's possible I'm just
saying it's almost impossible and how do I know that
because 99.999% of people are in mainstream society and they
are not conscious and you can see that just by
turning on fox news or any news channel I'm not
saying FoxNews I mean Fox News this is a particularly
good example but even if you turn on CNN and
stuff like that you still see it okay you still
see it people's entire careers on CNN very reasonable people
centrist people they're not particular radical xur right-wingers your left
fringe is very centrist people on CNN their entire careers
are still red herrings as though reporting on the news
is what your life is supposed to be about you
see once you get caught in a cycle of reporting
on the news and getting paid millions of dollars for
it you'll do that for the rest of your life
it's the same as hooking up a rat to a
little morphine injection and giving him the button he's gonna
be pushing that button until he dies you know they
did they've done these experiments in labs where they actually
do this with a rat that rat will push that
button until it kills itself with an overdose and that's
just exactly what's happening with very successful people I'm talking
about the wealthiest the most powerful celebrities businesspeople most intelligent
scientists they're all just rats pushing that button it's quite
remarkable to see this now a very important objection that
comes up here is people people say the following when
they hear this is it well leo it sounds like
you're bad-mouthing family and religion and you're bad-mouthing business and
you're bad-mouthing success and you're bad-mouthing sex and relationships and
you're saying that all this stuff is evil and it's
a sin and now I feel like I'm being moralized
too and that all this stuff is bad don't get
me wrong there is nothing bad at all in the
world nothing is bad that doesn't exist no action is
bad go play video games if you want there's nothing
wrong or bad about playing video games you don't need
to stop doing anything in particular but watch out because
when I say that what's gonna be the most likely
thing you do you're gonna fall back into your or
mainstream cultural habits and conditions and just go about doing
all this stuff unconsciously without seeing the elephant in the
room and you're gonna waste your entire life you're gonna
piss away your entire life if you're not very very
careful right here so even though technically nothing is bad
and nothing is wrong and you can do anything you
want you can go murder people if you want from
an absolute perspective there's nothing wrong with it but from
a practical perspective there's a lot wrong with it because
what you're gonna end up doing is creating a miserable
sort of life you are the one who is paying
the toll for the life that you lead I mean
other people are too if you go around murdering people
of course they suffer but what people don't see is
that you suffer and that you're missing something way bigger
in life you're chasing the really small fish when there's
a whale to be landed land the whale don't lose
sight of the big picture by getting sucked into your
career or into your family or into your relationships or
into sex or into pickup or into Wall Street money
chasing and whatever hobbies of whatever stupid sort you know
collecting a bottle caps or whatever don't get sucked into
this which is not to say you can't do it
if you want to go collect bottle caps coke collect
some bottle caps but just put it in perspective make
that an ancillary aspect of your life the problem happens
when you make it the primary feature of your life
you become a bottle cap collector then you make a
career about bottle cap collecting and you start to spread
bottle cap collecting as an idea throughout society and you
saw it sell of bottle caps and you become a
millionaire and then it seems like you well look I've
a slight no you haven't aced life you got distracted
you lost track of the big picture so I'm not
moralizing to you here I'm not telling you that you
shouldn't do anything you can do whatever you want but
be mindful of the consequences of where that will lead
you your actions have consequences and then you are the
one who mostly pays for those consequences here's a good
metaphor for really illustrating this point imagine you're in Disneyland
and it's fun there you're with your family and your
kids and you're all there together and you're going on
the rides and you're eating the good food and all
the greasy food they got and it's so fun and
exciting and all that's happening it's like your first time
there and then I run up to you and say
hey guys we got to get out of here stop
these rides stop eating this food put all this down
there's a giant hurricane coming giant hurricane is coming and
you listen to me and you're like ok a hurricane
but Leo are you saying are you really saying that
the rides in Disneyland are bad are you saying that
this churro that I'm eating is bad and that my
kids and my family is bad it sounds like you're
you're dismissing this whole thing what's so wrong with going
to Disneyland and enjoy myself leo it's just fun what's
wrong with fun what's wrong with some adventure just relax
man relax don't be so anal about it but you
see of course I'm not telling you that there's anything
wrong with being in Disneyland per se if you want
to go to Disneyland go to Disneyland that's fine enjoy
the rides there enjoy the greasy food whatever enjoy your
family but realize that there's a hurricane coming what is
the hurricane it's the end of your life as you
will die you realize that and it'll come much sooner
than you think and when you're on your deathbed what
are you gonna have to show for it how are
you gonna feel what's your connection to life gonna be
when you're going through that process as your aging your
getting to your 60s and 70s and 80s what's gonna
happen there what's your whole life going to be about
most people when they get to that point if they're
still lucky to have some width left they're gonna realize
that they have been in Disneyland gorging themselves on churros
and riding these rides incessantly to the point where they
just got sick of them and now the hurricane has
come and now they're screwed and what I want you
to realize is that all these rides they are fun
society is an amusement park for the ego as I've
said before but the hurricane is coming and it is
possible to prepare yourself for this hurricane and the way
that you do that is by awakening by doing the
consciousness work by doing all the stuff that I've talked
about and all my other hundreds of videos that's what
this is about getting that ultimate big picture is very
important and making sure to prioritize your ultimate big picture
over everything else is very important if you get it
sort of but then you prioritize it low on your
list like number five number ten you don't got it
to really get what I'm saying here you prioritize this
to number one number two and number three all those
top three slots are filled with this and then everything
else can still happen you can still go to Disneyland
but that's like number ten or number fifteen on your
list in Islam they have a very interesting concept called
forgetfulness which I like do you know why in Islam
they they pray they're supposed to pray five times a
day that's a lot you pray when you wake up
you pray like mid-morning you play in pant pray in
the afternoon you you pray in the evening then you
pray right before you go to bed that's a lot
of brain every single day that's quite a hassle why
they do that the logic of it is is that
if you don't take precautions to think about life and
an existential level or to pray you know if you
don't take those precautions every single minute of the day
you will forget because your mind is that tricky and
it gets that easily distracted so they came up with
five times per day I actually heard a story I
don't know if this is true or not I'm not
a scholar of his law or anything but I heard
a story that originally - to Muhammad when he had
his mist experience with the angel Gabriel that's supposedly how
he how he wrote the Quran is through this sort
of channeling process that he sort of like went up
to Gabriel and asked them okay so what do I
need to do to to be spiritual and somehow he
got the answer that well you need to pray in
this way and you got to wash your hands and
wash your face and you know so that he got
all the kind of the minutia of how to of
how to structure Islam from that and how to structure
his his spiritual practices but the story is from what
I recall is that Gabriel told him something like well
you got to pray like a hundred or thousand times
a day and maja mand with Mohammed like a thousand
times day I can't pray a thousand times it asks
too much I wouldn't have any day left to do
anything else I can't just be praying 24/7 I gotta
like eat and feed my family and you know do
this stuff human beings got to do and so somehow
there was like a negotiation process I don't know this
is actually true or not but this so it's a
nice little story so there's like a negotiation process between
him and Gabriel's like well game is like okay well
a hundred times and moms like now a hundred times
is still too much you can't do a hundred times
it's not practical it's like okay fine let's get it
down to five so eventually they got it down to
five times a day so this this little story I
liked because it just goes to show you that really
you should be doing it a thousand times a day
you should be waking up you should be meditating all
the time you should be mindful all the time you're
taking a you should be mindful taking a shower you
should be mindful brushing your teeth you should be mindful
this is so hard because we forget see the problem
with talking about Islam and so forth and living in
a cave is that people tend to hate religious abstentions
like when they are told no sex no alcohol no
drugs no partying none of the fun stuff and then
they think oh well these religious people they're so uptight
that they're just anti fun they demonize all the all
the cool stuff in life let's see there's really two
different ways or two different kinds of abstention wine cut
one kind of abstinence is when you do it because
you're told to do it from an external authority so
when your Bible tells you no sex no alcohol no
pork no shellfish no drugs no partying and so forth
or when you're you know rabbi tells you this whatever
and then you do the out of obligation that's a
very low consciousness unspiritual way of going about this the
reason that religions and mystical traditions all around the world
have these various abstentions and they're found in all religions
including Christianity Buddhism Hinduism Judaism whatever Islam is because if
you're serious about spirituality like the hardcore mystics were who
ultimately sourced these religions you have to find a way
to work around the distractions of your culture which includes
sex drugs party alcohol so the worst of the distractions
you have to find a way to minimize those and
you see that those distractions are actually they're not just
distractions there are also low consciousness activities which are really
antithetical to pursuing the elephant in the room and therefore
as you become more conscious you will naturally discard these
things you will tend to discard them not entirely not
in a rigid fashion but you'll just gravitate away from
them you're never gonna see them as a sin it's
actually gonna be the opposite you're not gonna see sex
as a sin or alcohols listen nothing is gonna look
like a sin everything is gonna look like beautiful life
but to get to that point you're gonna have to
abstain from stuff because otherwise you're never gonna awaken see
there's a very big difference from looking at the world
from a position of pre awakening versus post awakening a
lot of the mistake that people make when they're thinking
about pursuing consciousness and awakening is they tend to listen
to teachers who already goddamn awake awake as and have
been for forty years like these spiritual masters they listen
to them and they think oh well I'll just do
what they're telling me but that master is talking from
forty years of post awakening not from a pre awakening
perspective from a pre awakening perspective you got to be
working your ass off and abstaining from a lot of
stuff practically to awaken for a post awakening perspective you
can just say oh well you've everything is fine you
can do whatever the you want you don't have to
practice anything you're already enlightened everything is fine there's nothing
to do and nowhere to go that's only from the
post awakening perspective you don't have that luxury when you
ain't awake yet you see so watch out none of
these things are bad that's what makes them so tempting
you can't say that these things are bad I would
actually be untrue so to say that alcohol or sex
or whatever is a sin that's untrue to say you
shouldn't do it that's untrue so in that sense many
secular people are right because a lot of the problem
that secular people have with religious people say well the
religious people believe in all these archaic limitations towards life
and you know what that's so stingy I don't like
that it seems very anti human let's just be cool
and kind of liberal with everything but the problem with
that even though that is a step up from you
know hardcore right-wing radical fundamentalism it's a step up from
that but it's not that high of a step up
because now you're stuck with all the sex alcohol drugs
and partying and all that and now you're so distracted
and chasing so many red herrings that you have fallen
into the trap that the religious hardcore fundamentalist were trying
to save you from now of course their way of
saving you by moralizing to you and demonizing these activities
that was not going to work it doesn't work that's
why we see problems for example in the Catholic Church
where these priests molest and abuse children because they are
told that they can't have a wife they can't have
sex with normal adults so therefore you know that drive
because that drive is not made conscious and it's rejected
and it's demonized as a sin it comes out even
worse as pedophilia so you can't just deny these things
the highest level of abstinence is not abstinence in a
moralistic fashion or an ideological fashion you're not abstain because
you don't agree with it ideologically you're abstaining because you
see that you would rather have the truth than some
some cheap sex just some cheap alcohol or some party
to go to you see you develop a love for
the truth a love for consciousness for being awake such
that you don't want to tarnish it with very low
conscious activities in the same way that right now if
you're going to school and you're earning good grades let's
say or if you're running your own business and you're
earning some good money and you're getting some good progress
from your business you're working on your life purpose maybe
you have a nice family things are going kind of
good for you and your life and now I give
you a heroin needle and I say here's some heroin
injected into your veins a person who has a happy
life overall has stuff going for them they're not gonna
inject that heroin you see why not is it because
the heroin is a sin no simply because they have
some degree of awakeness and they can see that if
I inject this heroin it's just god I'm gonna spiral
downwards it's not a sin there's nothing bad about doing
heroin you can do heroin no problem but there is
a problem in that it'll send you down this spiral
of chasing lower and lower consciousness things and most normal
people realize that which is why they wouldn't even do
heroin if it was sold in their pharmacy but of
course people who don't have a lot going for them
they have nothing to lose so they do heroin and
then they get caught in that trap but now replace
heroin with your family your career the money the sex
and all the stuff that mainstream society tells you is
okay what are the takeaways from this episode very practically
I want you to start to notice all the little
distractions and big distractions that you experience every single day
I want you to look at micro distractions as in
just little things so like when you're sitting down meditate
and then you're distracted by something maybe it starts to
rain while you're meditating and then that becomes a distraction
then you start thinking about the rain okay notice that
ISM as a micro distraction also look out for the
macro distractions macro distractions are things like thinking about having
some children maybe when you shouldn't yet or trying to
maybe you have a little business but now you're trying
to expand it and you're having these dreams about growing
your business bigger and bigger and bigger and now you
might start to notice like oh that whole chain of
never-ending business expansion that might be a macro distraction or
getting caught up in in politics and maybe arguing and
debating and becoming an ideologue and just notice that wait
all this finger-pointing and criticizing and arguing that you might
that be a macro distraction because I seem to be
doing a lot of it just start to notice that
I'm not even saying that you have to abstain from
anything yet I'm just saying start to notice it start
to wash it as it happens that begins the process
of becoming aware as I talked about in my awareness
is your awareness alone is curative episode just by becoming
more mindful of these things the problem will start to
fix itself slowly just slowly by watching it another important
takeaway here is it's okay to get distracted I don't
want you to demonize distraction because what happens you sure
to notice the distraction you see start saying yourself all
man I'm such a bad person I can't meditate I
can't do anything Leo is saying I'm such a and
then you try to feel a little guilty about it
be careful about judging yourself you have to appreciate that
this mechanism of the mind is what allows you to
exist it's a very powerful mechanism your entire life hinges
upon it so it's not gonna get disassembled and you
can struck it easily it's gonna it's gonna employ a
lot of tricks it's gonna take a lot of time
probably years for this whole process to unfold so don't
judge yourself if you make mistakes if you get distracted
even despite your best efforts just realize that really it's
not up to you this is a force of nature
in the same way that if you were in the
middle of a hurricane and you were getting blown over
you wouldn't guilt yourself for that too much you realize
that it's a Ford it's a very powerful force of
nature a hurricane is much more powerful than you are
well this distraction your own mind I'm telling you it's
a more powerful force than a category-5 hurricane it's much
stronger it's much more consistent it'll stay with you for
the rest of your life unless you really make some
some mindful efforts to overcome it the key is to
stay mindful of the mechanism and not let your mind
get turned outward too much just stay mindful if you
can just stay mindful of how this inward outward process
is going it's like some days you're so focused outward
you completely forget about the inward aspect of your life
some days you're focused inward you kind of forget about
the hour sometimes a bit of both right so if
you just kind of start to see this happening throughout
your day throughout your week throughout your life watching that
mechanism a lot will help you to become conscious over
time you'll start to get a sense and a feel
for what's really going on and why it's happening and
actually you start to appreciate the raw power of these
defense mechanisms of the mind appreciate them don't demonize them
don't beat yourself up over falling into them they're very
sneaky traps 99.99% of people in the world are trapped
by them and they will never break free they will
not even break free if you show them this episode
they will still not break free they will not even
break free if you show them all 300 or so
of the episodes that I currently have they will still
not break free in fact the episodes will just become
another distraction for them because it's layer upon layer upon
layer of distraction the distractions are woven into each other
and they happen on the micro and the macro level
and everything in between start appreciating that raw power it's
actually a rather beautiful thing when you see it it's
an ingenious design it's an ingenious design of nature that
our minds work this way start to appreciate that another
take away is to just be mindful of how these
mechanisms are working in society notice the structures that are
built by our society and by our culture and how
they reinforce and play into these traps and that they
make them worse again the mistake here would then be
to demonize society or to demonize other people for inventing
these things but you have to recognize that this is
a much larger force than any one individual or even
any one politician or any one government or any one
culture these forces are much much much larger than that
this is the overarching force of ignorance this whole process
is a process of the universe becoming conscious of itself
and it starts from a position of low consciousness and
moves towards a position of higher consciousness ac it's sort
of an evolutionary process and it's always a struggle and
this is the struggle that you see throughout all of
history throughout all of humanity throughout all of science throughout
all technology throughout all of religion it's this business process
and this process is not a straight linear upward line
like this it's a wavy sort of up and down
and jaggedy sort of thing but overall it's it trends
upwards but it's like like this and you never know
when you're stuck in the bottom here you see it
takes takes thousands of years for this stuff to really
shift so start to notice what society is and remember
that I am not telling you to become a workaholic
I am not telling you to become a moralist I
am not telling you to be religious I am not
telling you to be anal about life and to deny
yourself the pleasures of life the whole point of abstaining
from lower consciousness things is that you can get to
higher consciousness things and then when you're at the very
highest consciousness things and you have your awakening really a
really deep one then everything in life becomes joy and
you're not just cherry-picking the problem with low consciousness stuff
is they have to cherry-pick and all your happiness becomes
contingent on you successfully cherry-picking the right stuff like yeah
if you have heroin to inject into your veins you're
happy otherwise you're not you see that's a very limited
ability to enjoy life your ability to enjoy life at
that point is like this it's tiny whereas as you
become more conscious by abstaining from stuff it might seem
like well but I'm but I'm rejecting life yes at
first it seems that way but then there's a sort
of inversion the thing goes full circle and actually then
everything becomes open to you and then you can just
sit do nothing and it feels like you have heroin
flowing through your veins so in a sense spirituality is
really the most hedonistic way to live but it's a
it's a it's the exact opposite of hedonism especially when
you're trying to get it going see this tricks a
lot of people because this is very counterintuitive it's like
you seem like it seems like you're going one direction
but you're going the opposite that tends to be how
the mind works it works in 180 degree reversals like
that of course I'm not immune to any of this
I have a lot of distractions in my life and
one of my macro distractions is actualized org actualize that
really is a huge distraction for me I still think
it's important and I have reasons for why I'm doing
it and I'm not sure where it's gonna go in
the future maybe it'll stop at some point maybe it
won't I don't know it might evolve I might quit
eventually at some point I mean totally at some point
but uh but I recognize that it's a distraction a
distraction isn't necessarily mean you need to quit it watch
it become conscious of it and watch out that actualize
that org doesn't become a distraction for you that's also
very easy because on the one hand you do need
the theory the theory is very important you also need
the motivation you do need someone to inspire you and
to help wake you up every single week there are
important functions there that actualize energy serving but also it
could easily be overused I hear about some people watching
all my episodes three times over and over and over
again that's probably too much probably too much don't turn
this into a philosophical mental masturbation exercise but then again
if you need to do that then do it you
have to figure that out there's a flying balancing act
here and like I talked about in my balancing episode
the importance of balance and personal development no one can
tell you what the right balance is for you that's
part of this whole growth process is discovering what that
balance is you don't even know what that balances until
you roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty
all right that's it I'm done here please remember to
click that like button for me and come check out
actualize that or work my website right here I have
some resources for you there the forum which can be
a distraction but it can also have some valuable content
on there and some motivation and some help my blog
the life purpose course the book list and I want
to release more content in the future that's gonna be
exclusively available there so stick with me for more you
