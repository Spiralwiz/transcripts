hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to stop being
a victim part two one of my most popular videos
is called how to stop being a victim and I
think it's one of the most foundational episodes that I've
ever done and so what I wanted to do here
is I wanted to continue that discussion because I think
it helps a lot of people to understand what it
is exactly that gets you stuck into victim mindsets so
what I'd like you to do for this episode is
I'd like you to select one area in your life
where you are stuck and you feel like a victim
so there's a lot of areas but let me that
are possible for you to select but let me give
you some hints here as to how to find this
what I mean by being a victim is when you
start thinking like this I can't it's impossible it just
won't work in this situation I've already tried everything I
can it's just not gonna happen there's no way it's
gonna work I don't know how my genetics aren't gonna
allow me my life situation is just such that I
can't do it you know my boss is holding me
back my husband is holding me back my girlfriend is
holding me back my children are eating up all my
time there's not enough time in the day I don't
have enough money these sorts of reasons right so where
in your life do you feel like it's like you're
really stuck and you're stuck because of some kind of
outer circumstances that are really holding you back and this
could be with your health could be with your fitness
could be with your diet could be with your money
situation with your relationships with your marriage with your children
could be with your career could be in business right
so go ahead right now take a few moments and
select such an area you do have one of these
areas doesn't matter if you're a total victim in life
or you have a you know a very specific place
in your life where you act like a victim but
most people have such a place okay so you found
that good now keep that in mind as I'm going
to be talking here and telling you a little bit
about victim mindset so an interesting thing that I was
thinking about recently is what makes a victim a victim
what makes a victim a victim and it's really sad
to me when I see people who are stuck in
victim mindsets it's really sad to me and I'll talk
about why towards the episode but what makes a victim
a victim is this and it's a very profound thing
a victim thinks that the external world is a greater
obstacle to him than he is to himself did you
get that this is very profound let me say it
again a victim is a victim because he thinks that
the external world is a greater obstacle to him than
he is to himself it's critical that you grasp this
is such a deep insight you are the only obstacle
that's what I'm telling you there are no other obstacles
but you anything that you think is an external obstacle
such as lack of money or lack of time or
that boss that's holding you back or that spouse that's
holding you back or the world being unfair or anything
like this that that's an illusion it's your mind that's
the Stickle always this is always the case this is
one of the most like bedrock foundational principles of all
self-development is to realize this that what I'm saying is
true now the problem of course is that if you're
a victim you don't believe me and when I tell
you this your mind comes up with all sorts of
objections and logic and counter examples which you believe are
convincing and refute what I'm saying but that's not the
case and I want to show this to you I
want to sort of convince you of it that's the
whole point of this episode this is very basic stuff
all I need you to do is just to grasp
this but see there's different levels at which you can
grasp this truth there's kind of the surface level of
just hearing me say it and understanding it intellectually then
there's there kind of secondary a little bit deeper intermediate
level of grasping it where you actually kind of like
get a little bit convinced of what I'm saying and
then there's a really deep level of grasping this when
you actually see how this is true and why it's
true and you actually see it working in your own
life and you see it working in the lives of
everyone around you and you just recognize it as a
general principle of life so you know we started the
top and we kind of work our way down deeper
and deeper and deeper so that's what this is all
about now when I say that your mind is the
obstacle and the only obstacle I'm not just saying that
well the solution to all your problems is positive thinking
so don't misunderstand me that's not what I'm saying your
mind is the obstacle again in many different deep ways
so there's layers to which your mind is the obstacle
there's the surface level of like oh I'm just not
thinking positive enough but then there's much deeper layers and
ways in which the mind is the obstacle and a
lot of what I do with the various videos I
release is I talk about the deeper and deeper and
more subtle ways in which your mind is the obstacle
but then when people hear that they often leave me
comments sinks in like Oh leo what you're talking about
is so philosophical so abstract is so theoretical it doesn't
apply in my life so why should I even listen
to this stuff you know but we got to start
somewhere so let's start here see victims don't realize that
the mind is the only obstacle they don't actually grasp
this they don't see all the ramifications that such a
statement has there's a failure in a victim to appreciate
the possibility of self-deception and how much their own mind
is deceiving them that's just not something I see victims
taking very seriously if you're wise you take the possibility
of self-deception very seriously it's one of the biggest dangers
in life that you have to be guarding against and
keeping yourself vigilant against instead of worrying about things like
your boss holding you back or enemies that you have
or business competitors out there or the bad economy or
something about your spouse holding you back or maybe your
genetics like you weren't born beautiful or you weren't born
confident or you're you didn't have good parents you don't
have a good upbringing or you know you weren't born
with the best genes or whatever situation you find yourself
in life is just kind of a crappy situation instead
of worrying about all that kind of stuff which we
might gloss and call that all that the external world
what you should actually be worrying about is the following
your mental filters your attitude your limiting beliefs your judgments
unquestioned assumptions you have about reality your lack of introspection
visualization or the images that you run through your mind
what those are you should be worried about your monkey
mind and how it chatters and prattles on and on
and on without stopping without any control you should be
concerned about your model of reality as a whole you
should be concerned about your emotional reactions and how your
thoughts and your beliefs are charged by emotional reactions and
judgments you should be concerned about what you view as
right and wrong and good and evil so basically the
self constructed model of morality that you have you should
be concerned about the habits that you cultivate or lack
thereof you should be concerned about your self talk how
do you talk to yourself what words do you use
when you talk to yourself and what's the tone of
the language you use when you talk to yourself and
the fact that this self talk is largely subconscious outside
of your everyday awareness you should be concerned about awareness
and consciousness and how little mindfulness you have and you
should be very concerned about ego and the effects of
ego on your relationship to other people the outer world
and to yourself that's the stuff you should really be
concerned about but as a victim you tend to discount
all this stuff you don't spend much time thinking strategizing
and even worrying about this you spend most of your
time worrying about the external world rather than the internal
world or another way I like to put it is
that you spend too much time worrying about physics versus
psychology you see ah the external world that's like the
physical world you're worrying about physical obstacles the internal world
that's the psychological world you're worried about the internal obstacles
your own mind in other words right that's the internal
world one deep thing you fail to realize is that
reality or what you call the external world is actually
a projection of your internal world and you don't acknowledge
just how much external reality is warped by your psychology
see for the victim and this is really twisted this
is what makes victim thinking so difficult to extricate yourself
from is because if you are a victim with regards
to some facet of life or to all of life
then as a victim part of your internal world or
your psychology has a belief in it that says something
along the following how I think about the world is
not that significant reality just basically is what it is
the physical world is what it is and I've got
real problems Leo I've got real problems to deal with
my problems are real so you have some kind of
belief system like that going on inside you and when
you believe something like that you're really stuck because a
first of all that's totally false so you're just flat-out
wrong it's a false belief that you have because how
you think is extremely significant and reality is not just
what it appears to be reality is just not physical
and your problems are not just real-world physical problems so
like I said firstly you're just flat-out wrong but secondly
when you believe this notice how ingeniously deceptive this is
it's deceptive to the point of beauty it's beautiful how
deceptive your own mind is and how it deceives you
notice that when you believe that your thoughts are not
that significant then that means you're not going to take
any actions to introspect and think about your thoughts you're
not going to be reflective you see your attention is
always going to be pointed out there at the external
world and it's never gonna want to turn in on
itself and to really investigate itself and that's what victims
tend to do the reason the victims say stuck is
because he doesn't or she doesn't look inside to see
how these quote-unquote real problems are actually being created by
the victims mind by your beliefs by your attitude by
your perspective the reality is is that there are no
real problems problems are not things that exist in the
external world even though it seems that way what a
problem is is a problem is a feature of the
mind a problem whatever problem a financial problem a family
problem a relationship problem a business problem you know all
this kind of stuff these problems they are projections of
your mind because it's you who attributes meaning to situations
in the external world and then who has goals and
objectives and wants to accomplish things right and all those
things are parameters of the self of your mind of
how you hold yourself relative to reality there is no
problem without the mind in fact not only that but
the problem has to be actively created your mind actually
has to burn calories to create problems it's kind of
cool to think of it that way like a problem
has to be sustained it has to be fed actively
this is an active process a problem you could almost
think of it like a a creature living inside your
head right like you have a little rodent in there
a little guinea pig and you're feeding it all the
time but you're not aware of the fact that you're
feeding this problem it doesn't seem that way doesn't seem
like your money problem could be a little guinea pig
living inside your head it seems like the money problem
is out there or a relationship problem or a marriage
problem or whatever your problem is it's very critical that
you grasp this like very critical that's all I want
you to do from this episode I don't want you
to particularly take any kind of action you don't need
to go out there and do anything I'm not telling
you need to leave your relationship or you need to
stop worrying about your money or you need to stop
paying your mortgage I'm not saying to do any of
that stuff I'm just saying grasp what I'm telling you
at a deeper level see the ramifications of what I'm
saying and how it's true in your life you have
to recognize that you are creating these problems and until
you do recognize and become conscious of the fact that
you're creating these problems then you're not going to be
able to ever let them go you see you're not
really self actualizing until you grasp what I'm telling you
right now this is so foundational so foundational until you
grasp what I'm telling you your world will appear hostile
to you the world will appeal on will appear unfair
pressing and cruel and that's how most victims feel about
the world or if you don't feel that way about
all of life and the whole world then you feel
that way about this specific area where you're having your
victim mentality maybe you feel like when it comes to
genetics and to your heredity you were dealt an unfair
hand and that because of that the world is hostile
unfair depressing and cruel or maybe you feel like at
work because your boss has more power than you you
feel like work life or business you might feel like
business is hostile unfair depressing and cruel or maybe with
relationships you feel that way like you keep trying to
get into a relationship maybe you're a woman you keep
trying to get into a relationship with it with a
good guy you just want to marry a good guy
but every new boyfriend you keep getting into a relationship
with it just goes bad after a few months every
single time and you just have this pattern you can't
stop this pattern you don't know why and it feels
like well this is how guys are this is how
relationships are relationships are hostile unfair depressing and cruel and
this is just a situation that you're not going to
be able to solve but that's not true you're creating
that and how exactly you're creating that that will take
you some time to realize that will probably take you
months and years to realize how you're creating it and
the reason it'll take you so long is largely because
you're unconscious and you're resisting what I'm telling you here
and you're resisting becoming conscious this is kind of the
beginning of the becoming more conscious process but there's a
lot more work you have to do I have many
more advanced videos that will show you how to do
the deeper work but before you can really sink your
teeth into those and grasp those you first have to
grasp what I'm telling you here what's really sad to
me is when I see people that don't grasp what
I'm saying here and then it becomes almost impossible to
help you becomes impossible for me to help you becomes
impossible for your friends or your family to help you
you really become stuck because every avenue of a solution
that comes your way will be denied by your mind
because your mind is searching for the answers in the
wrong place let's do a thought experiment imagine for a
minute that the inner world is all that matters in
life so this would be pretty much the exact opposite
of what you currently believe because current you currently basically
believe that the outer world is all that really matters
in life and that the inner world is not very
significant so let's flip that around and just as a
thought experiment consider what I'm telling you that the inner
world is all that matters now if that were the
case if that were true then that means that changing
things in the outer world wouldn't work right it wouldn't
really matter because by definition we said that the inner
world is all that matters so you can change stuff
on the outer world but is going to be just
like window dressing it's not going to be significant and
any problem you try to fix in the outer world
is not going to get fixed it's going to keep
recurring right over and over and over again and you're
just going to become more and more and more frustrated
and it's going to really feel like this is an
insoluble problem it's impossible to solve this problem so are
you imagining that okay good now what's funny is that
didn't we just described exactly the situation in which you
find yourself being a victim isn't that exactly what your
situation is like right now you keep changing the outer
world or at least you try and the problem just
keeps repeating over and over and over and over and
over again with slight variation but basically it just keeps
repeating over and over again if you're honest isn't that
your situation so shouldn't that inform you or clue you
in to the fact that it's the inner world that
matters because if you don't change the inner world if
you don't correct problems there they will keep being projected
out into the outer world it's almost like if you're
at a movie and you're watching a favorite movie of
yours at the theater with the old-fashioned time projectors and
then you see a blip like a smudge on the
screen and what you do is you walk up to
the screen you try to clean it up but it
doesn't clean up the smudge doesn't clean up because the
smudge is like a dust particle on the lens of
the projector which then gets projected onto the screen so
you can clean the screen all you want but if
you really want to remove the smudge you have to
go clean the lens back there you have to turn
kind of inward the eye has to start to look
at itself so to speak see and that's what I'm
telling you to do here see uh-uh you should not
worry so much about the outer world you should not
fear the outer world you should fear yourself more than
any outer world problem you are the thing you need
to fear your mind you have to recognize is not
your friend stop gullibly believing your mind that needs to
stop that's what's led you to here the reason you're
stuck is because you've been gullibly believing yourself and the
self is a tricky bastard it's not something you should
believe stop allowing your mind to frame control you see
what your mind will do frame control you from know
this concept of frame control it's kind of like your
mind frames every situation in life it almost sets the
foundations it sets the parameters it kind of sets the
reference point relative to which you judge everything else and
usually you're not conscious of how for example people frame
control you marketers and advertisers frame control you when they
show you a commercial and for example they they're advertising
some alcohol and they put a sexy woman next to
the beer bottle and she's smiling and your mind just
looks at that says oh yeah it's a sexy beautiful
woman drinking some alcohol that seems normal but then your
mind has recognized how you're being frame controlled in that
situation right your brain is already looking at these images
and associating a smile with something positive and that's being
associated with the alcohol the particulars beer and then that
all sinks is your mind completely below the radar of
awareness and that's how the advertisers have frame controlled you
in this situation or another way that an advertiser can
frame control you is for example when they when they
want to tell you like the price of the product
you're about to buy and let's say the price the
product costs $100 but they want the price of $100
and $100 that can be a lot of money for
some people depending on the product so what they want
to do is they want to make the hundred dollars
look like it's really not that much so how do
you do that well first by saying that the product
actually costs $500 so that's why you ever see on
advertisements on TV where they say oh this product costs
$500 and we're slashing it off to 400 and we're
slashing that off for 300 and we're slashing that off
to 200 and then by the time to get to
100 your mind is like oh 100 a hundred is
like so cheap compared to 500 so that's just a
very classic sleazy marketing tactic but see your own mind
does this to you too especially in those situations where
you feel like a victim your beliefs about reality are
very distorted as a victim and you need to start
to take your beliefs very seriously the whole process of
belief creation that you go through you to start to
really look into that take that process very seriously when
you start to acknowledge everything that I'm telling you here
once you actually grasp it and you really acknowledge it
then what will happen is that all the sudden the
following things will start to become relevant to you psychology
philosophy contemplation meditation mindfulness non-duality intuition wisdom and truth these
things right now if you're a victim to the extent
that you are a victim these things are not important
to you if you listen to a video or you
read an article online about any of these topics that
I just mentioned it's going to seem like it's kind
of abstract it's going to seem like it doesn't really
relate to your problem it doesn't really address the practical
burning issue in your life but as soon as you
grasp what I'm telling you all the sudden a very
important shift will happen in you all the sudden you'll
start to take everything I just said much more seriously
psychology philosophy contemplation meditation mindfulness non-duality intuition wisdom truth all
these things will become very relevant to you you'll become
very fascinated you'll become a student of these things these
things are going to be like the most burning issues
in your mind they'll become paramount and only then can
you really get the value out of my videos that
you should be a day only then until then you're
just going to be skimming the surface you're going to
be kind of like looking for little practical tidbits of
advice here and there but you're going to be missing
all the juicy meat that I'm sharing with you and
then I'm going to share even more in the future
so take some time to just to contemplate all this
time I'm laying some heavy stuff on you here heavy
stuff to help you do this let me give you
an exercise so this is not just mental masturbation here's
the exercise pull out a piece of paper and write
down some notes here as I give you this exercise
firstly what I want you to do is I want
you to select one area in your life where you
are a victim be specific about it write it down
to the top of the page then what I want
you to do is I want you to write down
all your justifications for why you can't change in this
area for why it's impossible and also for why it's
not your fault okay then I want you to identify
how the problem seems like it's an external problem then
what I want you to do is to identify how
the problem is actually an internal problem it's going to
seem external but actually it's internal so I want you
to to find that contrast find how your mind is
hiding from you the fact that this is actually an
internal problem watch out for justifying that the problem is
external rather than internal you're going to have all sorts
of justifications and you're probably gonna want to dispute what
I'm saying here and maybe you even agreed with everything
I said up to this point in theory but then
when it comes to actually your specific problem you're going
to disagree with me you're going to say no Leo
you know in this situation for me for this problem
you don't understand I mean Leo how could you understand
my problems I mean you don't understand what I'm deal
with in life my problem here this particular problem this
is a real external problem so watch out for that
kind of justification that your mind does right and then
what I want you to do is I want you
to ask this following question how am i creating the
obstacle how am i creating the obstacle and then ask
yourself another question what am i avoiding by creating this
obstacle what am i avoiding by creating this obstacle and
then finally ask yourself the last question which is what
must I believe to be a victim what must I
believe to be a victim it's a pretty complex exercise
so you might want to go back and rewind and
listen to all these and take notes on it write
down all these questions and all these steps in this
exercise but man if you do this you're going to
get a lot of insight into everything I talked about
in this episode and you're going to see exactly how
it applies to your particular situation and hopefully that will
be the beginning of your mind grasping what I was
talking about and then we can continue our work in
the future with more all right that's it I'm out
