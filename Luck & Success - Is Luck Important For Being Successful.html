hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video we're gonna take a look at an interesting question
how important is luck in becoming successful luck and success
these two things a lot of times we believe go
hand in hand if you read stories of people who
are extraordinarily successful rich people politicians visionaries throughout history inventors
stuff like that one of the things you tend to
see if you read a lot of biographies one of
the things you see is that some of these people
had some that like extraordinary circumstances happen in life they
were they were born in a very particular time in
a particular country in a particular circumstance that was just
very very unique and we tend to think to ourselves
like well I don't have those same circumstances I'm not
as lucky as some of these other people are so
I can't be as successful as some of these people
are and I used to fall into this trap myself
too in fact when I was in college I wanted
to become an aerospace engineer that's when I just started
college that's that was my first major and so I
was studying really hard I was really serious about it
and I was a good student so for me the
vision was not just an aerospace engineer but I wanted
to work like on something important inside of aerospace so
I thought well wouldn't be cool we're probably gonna be
going to to Mars or some other planets in the
solar system over the next 20 or 30 or 40
years of my lifetime so I thought that would be
cool to participate in that so I want to be
someone who's working on that kind of project and even
though I had this vision one of the immediate thoughts
that came to me is like oh but wait what
are the chances that I'll actually be able to work
on a project like that that seems like a pretty
rare opportunity and one of the things I remember I
was talking to my dad and I said well I
want to work for NASA the project like going to
Mars maybe build some sort of rocket ship to do
that and then I said to him but like what
are the chances that I'll get hired to work at
NASA on this project and I told them probably like
one of the thousand I mean I don't know how
many engineers apply to NASA for those kinds of positions
I never actually researched it but in my mind I
was saying I'm probably like one in a thousand or
one in a hundred but you know those are pretty
bad odds why would I put all this work and
effort building myself as an engineer to get all these
card classes and then developing myself even further why would
I do all that if I only had one in
a thousand chance or one a hundred chance to work
on my dream career in my dream project and so
that got me a little bummed out but he told
me he told me no you don't even worry about
that if you want to work on that project you'll
be able to make it happen and so I just
kind of took him on his word and then I
continued with that eventually I ended up switching out of
aerospace engineering went into something else but the point here
being is that I think that this is something that
we all go through especially when we try to pursue
our life purpose whenever you identify for yourself what that
dream of yours is maybe it's starting some sort of
business very ambitious maybe taking your career in some very
ambitious direction you have this idea but then your mind
it plays tricks on you and the first thing it
says is it says that wait a minute what is
the chance that this is actually gonna happen can it
actually happen and if you're particularly ambitious and your life
purpose is taking you into a particularly ambitious trajectory in
your life you have a really big dream then this
is gonna worry you this is gonna bother you and
honestly if you have a dream such as becoming a
millionaire or a billionaire or becoming like an astronaut the
President of the United States or maybe you want to
become like a best-selling author selling tens of millions of
books or maybe you want to become a movie star
so these kinds of positions these tend to be limited
in rare positions and if you just want to become
a doctor there's millions of doctors you can become a
doctor pretty much no problem your guarantee that if you
go and study at being a doctor you'll become a
doctor not not I mean it's it's difficult work but
there's like a certain guarantee in doing that whereas if
you want to become an astronaut it's a little bit
different because you can go and train to become an
astronaut but there's literally only so many astronauts I don't
know how many there are maybe 50 maybe a hundred
of them at any given point there's not that many
of them so what are the chances that you're actually
gonna get out to fly out into space probably not
that great also you know something like becoming present in
the United States let's say or president of your country
there's only one of those maybe throughout your entire lifetime
there will be five or ten of those at most
so that means that your chances are are like you
got to take one of those slots and you're competing
against potentially millions of people so your odds are very
very low in these kinds of positions you might say
the same thing of becoming a movie star or a
really really successful entrepreneur to become a millionaire one of
the odds of that probably like one in a million
or maybe one in a hundred thousand if you just
take like ordinary statistics so when you're up against these
kinds of obstacles it looks grim it looks like why
go out there and take on this risk it seems
too risky and when I was when I was younger
before I started doing personal development this always bothered me
this idea of the odds the odds are always against
me and in my back of my mind I would
all be seeing it oh man the odds the odds
are so so terrible so terrible against my success so
let's take a look luck and success actually what you're
going to discover if you do personal development is you're
going to discover that luck is not that important to
being successful and I'm gonna tell you why exactly right
here luck for the average person tends to average out
so I thought I think of luck as positive luck
and negative luck so positive luck would be something like
let's say you receive $3,000 tax refund that you didn't
expect in the mail you just get a $3,000 check
like man that's nice that year I got an extra
three grand so that's like really good luck you're gonna
tell yourself so let's say you get that you get
that one year the next year usually this stuff averages
out so what's gonna happen is maybe something that's gonna
happen to you like a kitchen fire your kitchen gets
is on fire you got some kitchen damages you didn't
have to spend a thousand dollars to repair it so
maybe one year you earned $1,000 or $3,000 the next
year it might cost you a couple thousand dollars to
repair some some damage that happened because of some accident
and so I tend to believe and I like this
mindset this mindset that luck averages out the positive and
the negative now of course there are extraordinarily lucky people
people who win lotteries and people who have like amazing
stuff happened to them in their business career etc and
then of course you've also got people who are extremely
unlucky plus a negative luck maybe they get on to
a horrible car accident maybe their house burned down maybe
they got some sort of debilitating disease cancer this kind
of stuff so there's no denying that of course there's
these extremes but I think that you don't want to
plan your life as though these extremes are gonna happen
to you because honestly what happens to the average person
the most likely thing that's gonna happen to you in
your life is that you're probably gonna live for a
good 60 or 70 years and if you're gonna die
of something it's probably going to be of obesity heart
disease or cancer or you know some sort of disease
that happens much later in life not early in life
and if you're gonna have catastrophes in your life they're
gonna be minor catastrophes not major catastrophes so sure I
think the average person has good luck a couple of
years in their whole life like really really good luck
and sometimes they have really bad luck but these are
not like the most catastrophic and extreme sorts of good
and bad luck and they tend to average out so
I think this idea that you need to worry about
luck is it you just don't need to worry about
it very much is it gonna tend to average out
for your whole life and so the mindset that I
want you to adopt is that you're just average you're
the average person they're gonna live an average life you're
gonna have average luck now this might seem kind of
depressing but actually this is a really positive thing because
if you have average luck what does that mean that
means that your success is just grounded in your work
and in your effort it's not grounded in being lucky
it's not grounded in going to some sort of extraordinary
job interview and then happening to land that job it's
not grounded in you sitting in some cafe somewhere and
then some movie director accidentally spot to you and thinks
that you'd be perfect for the new next blockbuster movie
and then you get this amazing role just by accident
by fluke luck like even though this stuff might happen
it's not a good idea to plan for it's bad
strategy basically if you're gonna be planning for a military
campaign let's say in fighting a major war it would
be reckless of the general who's leading that campaign to
say well you know what we're just gonna expect really
good luck on the battlefield or also it wouldn't be
very prudent for him to say well what if everything
goes horribly wrong and horribly against us and then plan
his strategy based on the worst possible odds it would
be bad in both cases he'd want to kind of
go down the middle of the road anticipating that he'd
have average luck on the battlefield and so he's gonna
plan according to average luck and then if if that
doesn't go his way then he'll he'll kind of adapt
on the fly so that's what I want you to
assume here and the nice thing about this is that
this forces you to adopt this mastery mindset the mastery
mindset is that you can really work to master something
in your life and this has been shown by lots
of research that they've done on all the really successful
people alive most successful people they don't get successful by
luck by accident people like Mozart and Tiger Woods and
the best Hollywood actors that you know and the most
successful business people like Steve Jobs and and Bill Gates
and Warren Buffett like these types of people they're not
just lucky and you might say well but what about
Bill Gates Bill Gates was born in a very particular
time in history right at this perfect time where by
the time he was growing up he had all this
experience with computers and he was able to start Microsoft
just at that perfect window of opportunity where you could
still create an operating system that could become a monopoly
that's basically the manasa what Microsoft is now it's a
monopoly on operating systems and you can't just go and
start a new operating system nowadays to be very difficult
because the market is totally overcrowded and when I read
business books when I was younger this one of the
things that worried me is I was thinking myself but
like all these amazing business people it seems like they
all capitalized on these very rare opportunities that no longer
exist for me nowadays I can't create a new operating
system it doesn't work nowadays I can't create a new
Google it wouldn't work because that market is saturated so
what am I to do how am I going to
make my success the thing here is that it's not
just that these people who are lucky yes these people
had opportunities that they really seized on and they made
the most of them and I'm going to talk about
that later in the video it's about seizing on opportunities
I think that's really important when you seize an opportunity
it makes it look as though you were extraordinary lucky
but that's not really the case you prepared for it
so all these amazing people that I talked about and
and anyone else that you can bring to mind it's
not that they just fell into it they don't fall
into success they work really really hard and then they
capitalize on those opportunities and that's the opportunity here for
you is to do that by committing to investing lots
of lots of time and effort in training yourself to
become really really skilled in something that's what life purpose
for me is about it's about finding that one thing
that you're going to spend 10,000 hours twenty thousand hours
of your life doing because as you do that you
become so proficient so expert at it that luck tends
to come your way it tends to draw it in
you become more capable than anyone else around you to
seize on those amazing opportunities and that's what you're going
to find with people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett
and Steve Jobs and amazing musicians and composers and movie
stars is that yes they might have had those amazing
opportunities but really they worked hard on themselves in order
to seize those opportunities and they didn't just do it
once but they did it repeatedly right otherwise they kind
of become a one-hit wonder and then we hear that
one amazing song or that one amazing business but then
we forget about that person the people that we really
remember aren't the one-hit wonders they're the really consistent geniuses
in their field and the way to do that is
not through luck that's through hardcore practice and adopting this
mastery mindset there is something to be said about the
fact that there are certain situations and scenarios in life
that aren't really suited to this so for example winning
the lottery or winning a giant poker tournament or going
on a contest like American Idol and being the one
out of all the millions of people that compete there
from the very beginning of this ages all the way
up to the to the very to the very end
to be like one of the million person that wins
American Idol or some other kind of rare position like
this see putting yourself in those situations you got to
be smart about that you don't want to do that
I see that a lot of people are like eager
to jump on board with that so there's a difference
between something I call one Avenue versus a million avenues
so for example with American Idol if your dream is
to become successful and to become recognized through American Idol
that's like one Avenue right you've got only one way
to succeed at that so you've got this amazing ambitious
goal and you might say well that's my dream goal
that's my passion and so I would say go follow
your passion but then what happens is that you go
follow your passion then you fail catastrophically because the problem
is that yes you have this passion and that's the
good part but you were foolish and naive in the
way you pursued it basically you chose a passion that
can only be achieved and arrived at through one Avenue
that limits your chances so see passion alone isn't enough
to make you succeed you have to also be strategic
and smart about how you kind of position and pursue
that passion the ledge s'matter here so what's the alternative
to the one path well the alternative to the one
path is to have a goal that has many paths
the more paths the better because that allows you to
kind of skirt obstacles as they inevitably come up so
for example if you just set the goal for yourself
to become a millionaire now even though the odds of
becoming a millionaire maybe one in a hundred thousand or
one on a million it doesn't really matter because you
can easily easily beat those odds with the term the
determination you're going to put forward and also because becoming
a millionaire that's a million paths strategy there's a million
avenues for becoming a millionaire literally there's a million different
types of businesses you could start there's probably even hundreds
of ways of becoming a millionaire even within one particular
niche in the market so let's say you wanted to
become a millionaire in the fast food industry well there's
probably at least a hundred different ways that you can
do that and that's what you want you want the
opportunities you want the avenues there's not just one way
something where there's only one way that's really really limiting
you and setting you up for long term failure so
try to avoid out of your life if you have
a big dream make sure that there's plenty of different
ways you can go about it and don't be so
narrow-minded that you have these blinders on your and you
say yourself well I want this dream here and I
want it this way my way and no other way
because what that does is that limits you it limits
your creativity and also one of the things you notice
about some of these most successful people like Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs and stuff these people they themselves couldn't
exactly predict if you asked them at the beginning of
their careers they couldn't tell you how they're gonna get
to where they want to get to okay Steve Jobs
when he started he didn't know that he was going
to be making iPhones or iPads like there's no way
he could have conceived that 30 years ago and when
Bill Gates started he didn't know that he would be
running this billion-dollar company that had a monopoly on operating
systems he just knew that he went into computers and
then something started coming out of that because he was
able to improvise and work on the fly and also
he wasn't like dead-set on just making one thing work
he would have been comfortable with anything working within that
you know within that area of that domain that he
wanted to master in business so this is what tends
to happen is that you don't always know where life
will take you and you have to be willing to
adapt and be flexible in your approach that doesn't mean
that you don't have a really ambitious goal you can't
have a very ambitious goal just be open to other
possibilities and in fact a lot of times what happens
is that this isn't a bad thing this is a
good thing because you might have one ambitious goal and
then as you're pursuing you might say well maybe this
thing is going to fail it's not going to work
but then you see even a more ambitious goal then
you go for that and you end up even better
than you originally planned but at the beginning you could
never foresee that that new thing would open up for
you and this is especially true for example in business
is especially true if you're doing something on the cutting
edge so if you're on the cutting edge of art
if you're on the cutting edge of music if you're
not on the cutting edge of technology in business then
you just like can't foresee this stuff and you have
to be comfortable with being uncertain and still going forward
and still being passion about this there's this mindset difference
that I see between successful people and unsuccessful people really
successful people they are creators less successful people are competitors
competitors put themselves in these kind of scenarios in life
where they have to compete other people in order to
win so for example perfect example this is American Idol
American Idol is all about competition that means that you
can't really create much within American Idol sure you're creating
let's say your song and you're creating your dance moves
and you're creating the way that you're you're singing it
in your style yes that's the creative part but in
the end yes you're creating all that stuff but then
your creativity has to go head-to-head with somebody else's creativity
and only one of you is gonna win just because
of the artificial way in that in the in which
this contest is kind of designed so when you put
yourself in that kind of scenario where only one person
will win out of hundreds or millions then like you're
setting you're really limiting your art whereas if you just
for example go into business for yourself and you're open
about the different possibilities of your business maybe you're even
open to going into one industry than switching industries when
you see that there's something better out there than this
original industry that you started with in that scenario it's
not this win-lose situation you're not necessarily competing and now
you might say but leo in business there's a lot
of competition and that's true businesses do compete but it's
not the same kind of rigged contest scenario which is
much more limited like American Idol because in the end
in business you can actually create so much value you
can create a new brand you can create a new
technology which isn't necessarily gonna steal business from other people
it can it can actually create new customers it create
new entire markets and industries and so there's like the
pie isn't limited it's not like you're just taking one
piece of the pie you're growing the pie and that's
the difference between this creator and competitor mindset I think
that's very important not to be a creator in life
because when you make yourself a creator that makes you
very anxious and makes you very stressed all the time
because you're constantly looking over your shoulder and I I
encountered this problem with my first business I was in
a business where I wasn't able to be a creator
I had to compete because we were competing for live
literally limited slots on on search engines so our business
was trying to rank websites really high on search engines
through internet marketing now when you're doing that there's only
so many positions on the search result pages on Google
for example so there's only ten slots on the first
page and really the top three slots are the most
important so if you don't hit those one of those
top three slots on a Google page who ever which
everybody is of course trying to hit all your competitors
then you're not gonna be making any money you're not
gonna be successful so this stressed me a lot because
I felt like I was competing against everybody else and
I wasn't just able to focus on creating the stuff
that I wanted which is very different than what I'm
doing right now what I'm doing right now I don't
feel like I have to compete so much there's still
an element of competition there's other people on YouTube who
are making self-help videos there's a million self-help authors out
there so I'm going to gets them to some extent
but it's not the same because I feel like I'm
kind of growing the pie with my videos with my
business and it's much like it's much more satisfying less
stressful because I know that I can actually kind of
grow a new niche a new industry like grow new
customers just through my passion through my style that wouldn't
have existed otherwise and that's how you have to try
and position yourself so I think this is a good
discussion a good discussion if you really want to start
to pursue your life purpose you're not really sure how
you're afraid to do it and you have some of
these limiting beliefs this is one of the limiting beliefs
that I have this thing between luck this difference between
luck and success and my ultimate message here is just
that you want to really take ownership here stop giving
your power away to other people other businesses your employers
because the strategy that I pursue nowadays in my life
is trying to remove as much randomness as I can
I don't want a strategy for my life where I'm
relying on luck that's why I don't think care about
things like lottery I don't care about things like gambling
I don't really care about going into business right to
compete head-to-head really hard with somebody I don't care about
entering some sort of contest where I'm gonna get a
bunch of freebies if I win because this stuck to
me it's just like noise it's so much better to
just focus on creating the thing that you want being
really certain about what you're going for and then just
give it your all I think that that's your best
chance of success and you know what along that way
what's gonna happens you're gonna see opportunities as you're working
really hard on yourself to create this amazing thing that's
independent of any opportunities that come you're just working on
it that's great now an opportunity comes by let's say
a couple of years later you're on you're on this
narrow road you see this amazing opportunity you can ask
yourself do I want to seize it is it a
good opportunity when you see it it's a great opportunity
you have the skills because you've been working so hard
on this business that you're trying to master you've got
the skills so now you could tap into this opportunity
and maybe it's gonna be good maybe it's gonna fail
if it fails you can get back on track if
it doesn't then you're on on your path to success
now your track might shift a little bit but you're
still going going ahead and you're still being creative and
so I think that this is ultimately the the approach
that you want to take with your success and what
you're gonna find I think it's really amazing when you
buckle down and you work on improving yourself building up
your inner resources doing personal development also working on mastering
your career or whatever business you're in when you're doing
that opportunities almost magically that thing that they say about
Law of Attraction just stuff like starts coming to you
when you're really focused and you know what you want
in life well that's very true and I don't think
that this is some sort of magical superstitious kind of
thing it's just simply that when you're very prepared you're
able to see opportunities and seize opportunities opportunities are around
us everywhere despite what it might seem I know when
I started with my business I thought man like there's
so little opportunities nowadays compared to what there was before
but actually that's not true at all that's a limiting
belief it's just that you have to have a certain
lens that you're looking through to spot the opportunities once
you get the right lenses in your own mind we're
talking about beliefs and mindsets once you get those correct
lenses and part of that comes with doing lots of
training and knowing exactly what you want very long-term in
your life then you start to see all the little
opportunities that are everywhere and in fact what's gonna happen
there's gonna be way more opportunities that you have then
you have time to seize so you're gonna be left
with a quality problem which is cherry picking the best
of the best of the best of those opportunities and
only taking that one or two opportunities per year and
really seizing on it and that's a really great position
to be in in life so that's my message to
you train yourself hard don't worry about luck and opportunities
will come and you can be successful even when the
odds are really really against you because even though your
chances are becoming a millionaire might be one enough in
a million that's not actually the case when you put
hard work into your goal just because you set the
mission of becoming a millionaire already that puts you in
the top 1% of all the people that are out
there because the average person has never set that vision
for himself not seriously they just wish about it they
wish about being written about being rich but they're not
really serious and determined about it so just by setting
that intention already you're in the top 1% and then
if you go and you pick a particular industry where
you want to start a business and you start finding
business mentors reading business books you start playing around and
tinkering and starting your own little businesses that already puts
you in the next one percent of the one percent
that you're already in so already you're cutting out another
99 out of a hundred people by doing that and
so as you go and you invest more and more
and more time and effort and intelligence and so what
you're doing with your business the odds all the sudden
they really really improve in your favor and the more
and more you work the better the better the odds
get and by that point it's no matter luck it's
all about the effort that you've put in and every
successful person even though they acknowledge all the amazing opportunities
and amazing people that came along in their life in
the back of their mind I think they also are
very proud about how much effort they put forward because
when you do something like that like you start an
amazing business or you just like kick ass in your
career what you discover is that man like I have
to work so hard to make it happen there's no
luck involved it's really really hard work every day I
have to get up and I have to struggle struggle
struggle stay very very focused on my objectives and when
I do that I see that success comes to me
and when I don't do that I fall off track
I see that no amount of luck can ever help
me so when you finally do achieve that amazing objective
of yours and you reach those dreams you're gonna feel
really good inside because it wasn't by sheer luck that
you did it you did it by all the preparation
and hard work alright this is Leo I'm signing off

you need to master your life just like the mindset
we talked about here you know success versus luck how
important is it what are the little nuances that you
need to know in order to overcome these doubts that
you have in yourself that's what I find is that
the fears and the doubts that we have our mindsets
hold us back the most from creating that extraordinary life
that we want whether it's with career business finances relationships
all that stuff so for me finding these mindsets and
really understanding them is so fascinating and I think that
