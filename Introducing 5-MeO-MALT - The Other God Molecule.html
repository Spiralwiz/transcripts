[Music] warning this episode discusses a new little-known research chemical
in the psychedelic class that can potentially be more dangerous
and more risky than even classical ordinary psychedelics so on
top of all of the dangers that exist with ordinary
psychedelics like mushrooms lsd and dmt when you're getting into
research chemicals which is what this chemical is then there
can be potentially additional risks and dangers do not do
research chemicals unless you are mature and you understand exactly
what you're doing this video is for educational purposes only
i'm really excited to finally be sharing with you a
new psychedelic substance that i've discovered which is as powerful
if not more powerful than 5-meo dmt and that substance
is 5-meo malt 5-meo m-a-l-t so i'll be discussing all
the nuances of this substance how it feels how it
works how it compares to other psychedelics and how you
can use it to grow yourself massively how you can
awaken yourself and realize god and all that stuff we'll
get into that in a minute but before we get
into that a few disclaimers and notes so first of
all make sure you stick around to the end of
the episode where after i'm done discussing the substance i
will be making a sort of an announcement into a
shift in trajectory of actualization teachings so stay for that
and of course the next point is the disclaimer the
disclaimer is that this is a very powerful psychedelic as
powerful as the most powerful psychedelics it's very easy to
overdo and overuse this psychedelic because it's very potent at
low doses and so if you misuse this psychedelic i'm
warning you you can injure yourself psychologically physically you could
even kill yourself if you're screwing around and you don't
know what you're doing so the responsibility is on you
if you're going to use this substance to use it
very carefully and to follow all the safety protocols and
guidelines that i've outlined in the past about how to
use psychedelics and you want to be even more careful
because this substance doesn't have a lot of trip reports
on it not a lot of people have used it
so it's it's a relatively new substance and therefore you
should be even more cautious about it than your classical
psychedelics like mushrooms and lsd and dmd now when i
say i've discovered the substance of course i didn't invent
it i'm not a chemist or anything i when i
say i discovered it i'm not saying i'm the first
person who's ever used it what i'm claiming just is
that i've discovered it for myself is what i mean
every psychedelic you sort of have to discover for yourself
it's true power and potential some psychedelics are duds and
others turn out to be amazing so for me i
discovered how amazing this substance is and and its potential
in spiritual growth that's that's why i care about it
so much and so um also it took me by
surprise so much because the few trip reports that do
exist about it on the internet they don't [Music] they
don't showcase or highlight the power of this substance and
so you might easily overlook this substance if you're just
reading the few trip reports that exist and there's there's
honestly very very few trip reports so it is something
quite new and uh and most psychonauts even most serious
psychonauts don't know about it and they're missing out on
it and so i feel like it's my duty to
share this information with the world that i've discovered um
i i make no special claims over this substance i'm
just saying i discovered it for myself and i'm talking
about it because it's not very popular nobody really knows
about it nobody understands what this can do for mankind
or for your own spiritual growth so that's why we
got to talk about it and we got to hype
it up a little bit so here we are all
right so what is this substance 5 meo malt well
of course structurally it's quite similar to 5 meo dmt
although there are other substances that are structurally similar to
five amino dmt which do not produce the same kind
of radical effects that five amino dmt produces so what's
special about fibonameo dmt is that it's not full of
a lot of visuals it doesn't produce a lot of
weird hallucinations and twisted visions and things like that that
you might get on mushrooms or on lsd it's just
pure non-duality pure infinity pure consciousness pure absolute truth pure
god realization that's what's remarkable about five meow dmt it
has very few visuals to it and it just takes
you straight to what spirituality is really about it's the
heart the core of spirituality you might say and it's
it's very radical in how directly it deconstructs your ego
mind and takes you straight to universal consciousness well that's
5 meow dmt and 5a mule malt has all those
same characteristics but in a different flavor in a different
flavor how would i describe this different flavor it's it's
tricky you know the first time i did it i
actually vaped it and i almost did it sort of
by accident by which i mean i was i was
vaping a lot of dmt at the time and exploring
the dmt space and that was amazing for me um
but then i decided to like compare what it's like
to vape dmt to something to something else so i
put a little bit just a tiny tiny like a
a few grains a five-millimeter malt into a into a
pipe and vaped it and i was just expecting some
threshold effects you know something interesting i i wasn't i
wasn't ready to do some deep trip and then of
course it took me by surprise it was it's so
powerful at such low doses um relative to normal dmt
that uh it it it gave me a really powerful
sort of god realization god awakening trip uh it hits
you like a sledgehammer within 30 seconds within 60 seconds
you're there and it was beautiful it was amazing it
had a different feel to it the way i would
describe the feel is that it's got this sort of
um the visuals on it are mild it's not like
dmt it's more like five meow dmd very mild visuals
at least for me i don't know how it is
for you but for me very mild visuals but it's
got more color and more flavor than just five meow
dmt uh for me it's got this magenta tint to
it that is very beautiful it's got these almost like
neon like colors but they're they're faint in there and
the gradual there's not a lot of um there's not
a lot of fractal geometry like you would get on
nndmd um but what's most remarkable about it is to
me how holistic it is and how stable it is
in allowing the mind to expand into god consciousness and
stay there for a good well if you're vaping it
it'll only last maybe 20 minutes or so 20-30 minutes
but if you're plugging it which i'll be talking about
here in a minute then the trip will last 90
minutes to even two hours so it's slightly longer lasting
i would say than five and meow dmt and for
me one of the metrics that i use to gauge
and compare different psychedelics i was thinking about what kind
of metrics we can use i sort of developed this
axis or this metric of uh holism and also stability
some psychedelics most psychedelics what they do is they actually
allow the mind to to to think chains of thoughts
that are much more elevated and beyond the typical types
of thoughts that you can think in your sober sort
of normie state the chains can be longer and they
can also be deeper and and like at a higher
dimension and they can be more holistic so what i
mean by longer chains of thinking is that ordinarily if
you're if i ask you to contemplate about something you
can sit there and contemplate and you can maybe run
a chain of thought for 5 seconds or 10 seconds
or 20 seconds and then it'll peter out and it'll
veer off into some other direction in your mind it's
it's very add like and it's not able to just
focus and like a laser on some contemplation topic for
five or ten minutes and so because of this you
have actually difficulty penetrating with your mind into any kind
of existential questions so this is one of the reasons
that you struggle to actually understand some of the advanced
things that i talk about is because you actually need
a very very stable mind that can penetrate through into
some contemplative question very deeply and uh ordinary human physiology
neurophysiology simply doesn't allow that in most cases it needs
to be trained up that's the point of meditation and
concentration practices but anyways so psychedelics elevate your mind's capacity
to do that and some psychedelics can just extend the
chains of your thoughts other psychedelics will both expand the
chains the length of them and also the breadth of
them how much you can integrate at once your thoughts
become sort of multi-dimensional and multi-threaded multi-faceted think of it's
almost like going from a single core cpu to a
multi-core hyper-threaded cpu it sort of feels like that and
and then some psychedelics will twist your thoughts around like
mushrooms and lsd your thoughts can get very loopy and
twisty and it can also be actually difficult to stay
like on a mushroom trip it can be difficult to
stay on a single topic for too long because your
mind weaves around and then you get lost in all
sorts of uh tangents and then this could actually veer
off into a bad trip and that's not very useful
for the kind of work that we're trying to do
here with five meow malt what's so remarkable about it
is how stable it is you can go into a
god realization state and you can stay in that state
for 30 60 90 minutes and you can just probe
into it and you can very deeply introspect about every
aspect of yourself as god and how you are constructing
reality dreaming up the entire thing and so i've had
some ridiculously powerful god realizations on five of me and
malt it's it's hard to say per se that they
are more powerful than 5mm gmt i mean i've had
some crazy god realizations on five of my dmt2 but
what five of you a malt allows me to do
um is that it it feels more gentle and it
takes me into that space and allows me to explore
that space a little bit a little bit more practically
than i can on five mil dmt with five dmt
it sort of just blasts you into infinity if you
take a lot of it just kind of blasts you
in there it can be so shocking it's difficult for
the mind to even kind of understand what's going on
and integrate it whereas with five of your malt it's
it's a little bit less of a blast although you
could certainly blast yourself with with any psychedelic but it's
a little bit it's a little bit less like just
pure intensity and it's a little bit more uh holistic
and kind of comprehensive and it allows you to actually
deeply introspect and to see in real time how you're
constructing all of reality which we've talked about in the
past uh how you're dreaming up your parents how you're
constructing your own birth how you're dreaming up science how
you're dreaming up logic and mathematics how you're dreaming up
other people and it's ridiculously profound in that respect you
can you can go so deep into the actual mechanics
of how you're constructing reality that this is what allows
you to truly see what's really going on even if
you've had some god realization or some awakenings on other
psychedelics that doesn't really mean you understand the actual mechanism
by which god is dreaming up this dream you probably
still don't understand that it took me many many many
trips to understand that and i had to use various
substances to access that from different places and accessing that
is easier on some substances than others so for me
fibromyalgia malt is remarkable in its ability to allow me
to do that the other benefit that i've noticed from
fibromyalgia malt is that meow dmt has a pretty strong
body load for most people including for me it's rather
uncomfortable especially when you're first coming up on it it
can be rather uncomfortable it can make you nauseous i've
come to points where i i was almost on the
brink of throwing up on 5mm dmt and those first
like 15 minutes going into a trip are rather uncomfortable
it your body starts to feel kind of weird and
i've i've seen other people do five million dmt and
their body reacts really badly like they're vomiting their their
body gets all twisted up and it's very uncomfortable they
have weird sort of tensions in their body that they're
trying to work through and that prevents them from actually
accessing the deeper metaphysical existential aspects that we really care
about the contemplative work that i care about and so
for me five mule mult has a it still has
a body load but it's a much more comfortable more
manageable body load it feels less nauseous now again i'm
only speaking from my my own direct experiences here remember
that this substance is rather new and there's not a
lot of reports from other people so how it affects
you or the majority of people i don't know i
can only speak to myself and how it affects me
and i am more sensitive to psychedelics than most people
and psychedelics do affect me differently than they do some
people and also you have to understand that i've done
hundreds of trips already on other substances and i've done
a lot of inner work on myself so the way
that a psychedelic affects me is probably not the way
that it would have affected me five years ago for
example so i'm sort of an advanced stage whereas if
you're a newbie it might affect you differently just because
you're a newbie and you have to spend years working
up to get to the point that i'm talking about
so don't expect that this to be like a magic
pill that solves all the stuff for you you have
to understand that i've done years of of inner work
both outside of psychedelics but then also inside of psychedelics
right and that does matter and having breakthroughs on five
amio dmt for example changes the characteristics of all other
psychedelics like mushrooms lsd and so forth and so of
course i would assume that it also changes the characteristics
of 5mu malt too so just keep these complications in
mind this is all a lot more nuanced and tricky
than it seems there's no simple answers here but anyways
i really like the fact that it has a lower
body load it's more comfortable and i think for for
many people if it works the way it does for
me for you then you'll enjoy that aspect of it
as well this means that you can focus more on
contemplation rather than dealing with all sorts of body discomforts
now as far as how can you administer this substance
to yourself well i've tried it two ways i've tried
it vaped and i've tried it plugged so plugged means
rectally that is my favorite way to to take psychedelics
through plugging and the good news is that it works
amazing through plugging just like five million dmt works amazing
through plugging so that's the method that i recommend you
can of course vape it the problem is that it's
extremely potent and that you're very likely to overdose or
to blast yourself in a way that you're not going
to be able to handle the trip and therefore increasing
the likelihood of a bad trip so i recommend that
you don't vape also vaping is not good for your
lungs so avoid vaping substances if you have other methods
plugging is going to be much better so i recommend
you plug it i have actually a video on my
blog an old video that i released which demonstrates the
plugging technique so if you want you can google for
that and find it on my blog and so basically
you can you can plug it or vape it very
much the same as 5meodmt the dosages are roughly the
same so if you're going to be vaping it i
would recommend starting with a dosage that's very low like
five milligrams and then gradually working your way up even
10 milligrams is going to be very powerful dose and
then 15 will probably be stratospheric and then as far
as plugging goes i would recommend starting with a 10
milligram dose that's going to be a solid trip for
me 10 milligrams is a solid breakthrough trip and then
you can increase it to 15 20. the most i've
done i would say is maybe 22 milligrams or so
that's a crazy deep trip now of course like i
said i'm more sensitive to psychedelics than most people i
would say i'm twice to three times more sensitive which
means that if for me 10 milligrams is a solid
trip for the average person i would expect that 10
milligrams is just going to be maybe a threshold dose
plugged and therefore you might need to go up to
20 or 30 milligrams just to get a a solid
trip and then if you want a really powerful trip
you might need to go to 40 or 50. i
don't know you that's something you're gonna have to test
and figure out for yourself of course it's always better
to start low than it is to start high because
especially with something this powerful you want to make sure
you go very very gradually and you don't assume anything
start at five milligrams start at 10 milligrams don't start
any higher and just see how your body handles it
see if you have any allergic reactions see if it
produces any kind of weird sensations in you see if
it feels healthy to you or it feels toxic to
you and then proceed based upon that feedback now the
beautiful thing about fibromyalgia malt is that it has no
tolerance just like 5mm dmt so you can basically do
dose it as much as you want although of course
that presents a serious potential for abuse if you dose
it too much i recommend you don't do this substance
more than once a week um and i don't recommend
you do it multiple times a day or multiple days
in a row for long periods of time because this
will turn into an addiction it'll turn into a crutch
and you will start to unravel your mind and your
reality and you will you will potentially develop mental disorders
and you'll just lose grounding in your own life and
you might start to act out in unhealthy ways with
your relationships with your career with your job with your
money and things like this and you might get yourself
into trouble so be very careful about that but if
you want you can dose it as much as you
want basically and you're not gonna have tolerance to it
so that's nice that means that if you need to
for whatever work you're doing and you need to go
back in for a second trip or you feel like
your first trip wasn't enough you got to go a
little higher you can do that you can do that
quickly which is really nice this is definitely not a
recreational psychedelic this is not something you do at a
party around a bunch of people in a loud setting
this is something you have to do with a serious
spiritual intent because you're going to be coming face to
face with god here this will take you to infinity
this will take you to god realization this will show
you that everything is an infinite hallucination absolute hallucination absolutely
everything you will discover that everything you thought was real
is unreal science math logic reason language society humanity the
earth history even leo you'll even realize that leo is
something you're imagining everything is imagination infinite imagination now of
course there's a powerful love component here as well absolute
love infinite love if you want to discover the love
of god this is how you do it at least
that's how it affects me again i don't really know
how it'll affect you for example for me nndmt affects
me very differently than it does most people i don't
get a lot of colorful visuals and crazy fractals and
aliens and dmt aliens and dwarves and things like this
on ndmt it also takes me just to infinity it's
got a little more color to it than five amio
but still uh it affects me pretty differently so i
don't know how five mu mult will affect you that's
something you have to test out and research and we
just don't have the data on that we don't have
good scientific data as to like well is it gonna
affect the majority of people the way it affects me
maybe or maybe only a minority maybe for the majority
of people it'll be a dud i don't know that's
something you'll have to test we're on the cutting edge
here of scientific research this is a research chemical and
so the only way we're going to know is by
by doing this research this is how it's done this
is how all science cutting edge science is done somebody
has to do it and there's risks associated with that
so understand that about the legality of this substance you're
wondering leo is this substance legal in my country well
i have an audience all around the world so literally
people from every country in the world watch these videos
i don't know what country you're from you have to
check the laws and check check the situation there what
the opportunities and the potential risks are i'm not giving
you any kind of legal advice in fact i would
say be very cautious about the legalities of these kinds
of substances do your research understand what the penalties are
for breaking the rules um and see what's possible this
substance is not known to to most people but on
the other hand countries do have various kinds of analog
laws and some countries ban the entire class of psychedelics
and that might fall that this family of mult might
fall into that category so do that research for yourself
this is not legal advice this is just general information
about this substance and then what you do with it
that's that's on you take responsibility for that make sure
you you consider the dangers and the risks and the
risks are not just mental and physical there are legal
risks and other things like this that you need to
take into consideration but also consider the possibility that you
can find countries where this is not illegal and where
you can do this legally so consider traveling to one
of those countries if you want to do it legally
right people oftentimes make excuses like oh leo but psychedelics
are illegal i don't want to do anything illegal well
psychedelics there are many different kinds of psychedelics and not
all of them are illegal in every place so sometimes
it's just as simple as taking a a car ride
or a train ride or a plane ride to a
place where it's legal and you might say oh leo
but that that's too much hassle it's less hassle than
spending 10 years in meditation struggling and struggling and still
never realizing that you're god so don't be don't be
afraid to travel to a place where these things are
legal and then do it legally what else is there
to say about five of you malt i mean there's
not much to say i recommend you try it what
can i say it's it's ridiculously powerful it's amazing i've
had very deep mystical experiences on it that allowed me
to introspect into the very mechanics of how my mind
constructs all of reality it's very very shocking very radical
beware it's very solipsistic if you're scared of solipsism the
substance is not for you if you want to maintain
the illusion of other people this substance is not for
you if you want to maintain various illusions about your
gurus and and your notions of enlightenment the substance is
not for you it'll blast away all your ideas of
enlightenment awakening all the stuff that gurus have taught you
all that stuff uh is nonsense compared to what this
substance will show you now you might say leo but
it sounds rather similar to five meow dmt so is
there any point in me trying five meal malt if
i can just do five million dmt to which the
answer is you won't really know until you try it
for me there was enormous value in trying it even
after i've tried five meow dmt many times now if
you can't access five emul malt because it's not available
in your area or whatever and all you can access
is 5mm dmt i mean don't be bummed out that's
still an amazing substance you're not missing very much um
and even if you can't access fibermeo dmt and you
can just access lsd or mushrooms or regular dmt i
mean that those are still amazing substances and you can
use them to access similar places i'm not saying that
5mu mult will allow you to access things that you
could never access any other way you can certainly access
the same basic insights and states of consciousness through other
substances and even perhaps through yoga or meditation if you
do it very seriously but for me i found enormous
value in exploring different substances and comparing them to each
other and it's like having different tools in your toolbox
you could use a flathead screwdriver to to unscrew most
screws but it's nice to have a variety different screwdrivers
for all the different possible screws there are there's a
nicer fit there and you get to you just get
more efficiency that way um so don't don't feel upset
that you can't access fibromyalgia mult i mean see what's
see what's possible see what's available but if you can't
that's fine there's many other psychedelics you could access that
will also produce incredible trips mystical experiences results breakthroughs god
realizations and so forth um don't fall into this trap
of thinking that there's one ultimate psychedelic it doesn't work
that way it's like different flavors of ice cream there's
no one ultimate flavor of ice cream there's different ones
taste the whole rainbow explore the fields see what's possible
see how it affects you what you'll discover is that
psychedelics probably affect you in a unique way that's different
than me and other people around you your friends and
so you're really not going to know what you're missing
until you just go and explore and try stuff out
now of course exploration can be dangerous and risky and
so you need to be cognizant and you've got to
be cognizant of those risks and decide for yourself whether
you're willing to take those risks life is all about
taking strategic risks now some people say well but leo
you keep having these awakenings and you say that it's
deeper and deeper and deeper how can they all be
deeper and then how do you know that your latest
one is the deepest and how do you know that
your latest one is the is the truest one again
uh the trips don't contradict themselves it's all about a
convergence it's about a deepening in the same basic truth
the basic truth we're talking about here is oneness god
love infinity consciousness nonduality that's the basic truth none of
that changes you can just explore that truth from different
angles and perspectives and different flavors and you can grasp
it at different levels of holism and then you can
integrate it deeper and deeper into your own life and
you can see how this truth plays out across your
life in ever deeper and more comprehensive ways that's what
we're talking about here so it's not that five-meal mult
contradicts five amino dmt and then i have to sit
here now and decide which one to trust no they're
both pointing to the same truth the same basic truth
is being talked about let's see is there anything else
that i want to say about fabio malt before i
move on to some points about actualized um i mean
you just got to basically try to see how amazing
it is it is basically like magic it works like
magic it's like a [ __ ] miracle it's a
miracle that this substance exists and that substances like it
exists and that such things are possible it's a miracle
you're not going to believe what this will do to
your consciousness this will take you to levels of consciousness
that you will never ever ever reach through meditation or
yoga unless perhaps you're going to devote your entire life
to living in a cave and meditating for 20 years
you're never going to reach these levels of consciousness and
even if you do meditate in a cave for 20
years there's no guarantee you will reach this depth of
consciousness with this substance you can understand everything that i
teach all of my most advanced teachings you can understand
all of it will make perfect sense you can understand
where reality came from why it exists who created it
what is god what is love what is truth what
is consciousness what is existence where um where it all
came from why it's here what the purpose of life
is what the ego is what the self is what
all the gurus and teachers are talking about what nonduality
is this is the highest truth and it's so crystal
clear but you're probably gonna have to work with it
for a while to get to that crystal clarity don't
expect to get to that crystal clarity with a couple
of trips because you're gonna have a lot of baggage
psychological baggage and false beliefs you have to bust through
and deconstruct all of materialism all of science all of
your attachments and ideas even your ideas about enlightenment and
awakening and stuff you've heard from eckhart tolle and from
other teachers you have to even deconstruct all of that
to get to the ultimate crystal clear understanding of what
you are and what god is uh i should make
a note here about any bad trips that i've had
i've never had a bad trip on five meal malt
i've taken it i would say maybe 10 times which
is not that much but in those 10 times i've
never had a bad trip now of course understand that
that doesn't mean that you won't have a bad trip
i would say that the majority of people if you
give a normie five emulate malt and you just blast
him with it he's gonna have a bad drip because
he's not prepared he doesn't have the foundation laid down
for understanding the radical insights that will come to him
so but if you work your way gradually up and
then you do the work that i talk about and
teach to actualize that organ for me it's a very
benevolent positive substance i don't feel that my mind goes
out of control on this substance i don't experience any
kind of dangerous loss of bodily coordination on this substance
although of course that could happen if you take too
much of it and and in general it feels quite
safe in that it doesn't distort the visual field very
much so you're still very much in control of your
body you can still see and function although you can
have such deep states of infinite consciousness that you won't
really be able to walk around very much but that's
that you also have to be careful about the purity
of the substance one of the ways in which i
judge the purity of a substance is by its color
the closer to white that it is or a little
bit off-white then i trust the substance more you can
find very pure formulations of 5-meo dmt now with fibromyalgia
mult the substances that i've seen of it are quite
a dark brown color which does make me a little
bit suspicious you know what is that dark brown is
that is that the natural color of that chemical it
could be or it could be impurities and if it's
impurities that's not that's not a good thing um and
so it still works i've used quite a dark brown
and almost looks like brown sugar that's the kind of
consistency of five meal malt that i've used i believe
the version that i use is an hcl salt version
you could probably find in a free base version now
you can plug the freebase just as easily as you
can plug the assault version it's not going to make
a difference other than that freebase is actually a little
bit more potent freebase you should expect it to be
10 to 20 percent more potent than salt version and
it'll dissolve it'll be more difficult to dissolve you'll have
to use a little bit more vinegar to dissolve it
um but you can still plug that and you can
also vape the salt version so i vaped the salt
version the hcl and it vapes fine although not it
doesn't vape as cleanly as as the freebase would so
depending on what you want to do you find the
right version for you and be careful about impurities so
if the substance is darker color then my rule of
thumb is that if a chemical is darker in color
it's not as white then i would dose it extra
low and just make sure that your body is not
having any kind of allergic reactions to the impurities and
that your body feels good and comfortable nothing nothing's being
damaged and you you can feel that if something is
is being damaged there in most cases and then you
can ramp up higher anything else about 5mm mult um
i am really excited to get feedback from you guys
if some of you are going to try it uh
come post your trip reports we're going to start a
mega thread for five mil mult trip reports on actualize.org
the forum come to the forum post your trip reports
i'm interested in gathering data about your experiences i want
to know how profound they were or how much of
a dud they were any bad trips you've had uh
how it compares to other psychedelics you've taken this is
this is basically the beginnings of scientific research that's being
done on this substance and in the future some scientists
might actually look at that mega thread and use some
of those stories and trip reports to base their research
upon in the future and in the future the potential
of this substance is to transform mankind awaken mankind maybe
this substance can be used for healing the way that
mdma is used for example for healing ptsd or for
uh helping people in in depression healing depression anxiety other
things like that i definitely see huge therapeutic potential for
this substance the love the profound love that you experience
on this substance can have powerful therapeutic effects and the
the the capacity to introspect into your own psyche and
to to observe your own ego from sort of an
outside perspective all of this can be very powerful for
dissolving dysfunctional psychological tendencies that you might have but the
research on that of course is still decades away all
right so that's that uh if you're going to try
this substance again be very careful and understand the risks
that you're taking on when you do that for me
personally i have not felt that this substance is toxic
or damaging to my body uh it feels rather pleasant
and um for me i don't feel like it's it's
that dangerous there are other psychedelics that i've tried that
that feel way more dangerous and toxic than five a
meal malt but then again i'm very careful and responsible
about how to use these substances and i'm me i'm
not you so i can't tell you how this is
going to affect you that's something you'd have to figure
out for yourself nobody can tell you all right so
that's five of you malt now as far as the
announcement about actualize.org going forward so it's become clear to
me that i'm really dissatisfied with the way that mainstream
teachers talk about non-duality god love awakening enlightenment all of
these things i'm really dissatisfied the more the more i
understand what god is the more dissatisfied i become with
the way that mainstream teachers teach these things the more
dissatisfied i become with with methods like meditation yoga and
so forth and while i'm not saying that there's no
value there at all there's still value there and i'm
not saying you should stop doing your yoga or your
meditation but going forward what i'm going to be leaning
on is psychedelic awakening i've done a lot of introspection
and what i've come to is that for me the
things that i like to teach the very deep existential
insights into the nature of self other love god truth
consciousness existence science and all these sorts of things to
really understand what i'm talking about the bottom line is
that you have to use psychedelics and if you're not
using psychedelics you're simply wasting time that's just the truth
of it you're wasting a lot of time i spend
so much time on the forum and in the comments
sections and even when i do interviews or podcasts with
other folk trying to explain my world view and trying
to explain how how god works how awakening works how
love works we spend so much time discussing in circles
all of these these topics and people just repeatedly ask
like leo is solipsism true tell me or leo what
about how can everything be love tell me explain it
to me or leah what about god you know does
god work this way or that way what about the
afterlife is there is there an afterlife or not what
about death leo what is death explain that to me
and i've explained all these things in prior episodes the
problem is is that i can explain these things to
you for hours and hours and hours for years and
you still won't have a [ __ ] clue what
i'm talking about that's the problem and i really don't
like that so going forward i'm going to be leaning
more on psychedelics as a teaching tool to me it's
a teaching tool this is the most direct way that
i've discovered and i've tried different ways all sorts of
different ways to access these insights and to understand what
reality is and what i've discovered through my own experience
is that psychedelics are the most powerful way to do
that they are not the only way you don't have
to do them if you don't want to i'm not
forcing you to do them but they are the most
direct way that i know that exists that's just the
bottom line of it you can quibble about how oh
leo but but it's it's a shortcut or it's not
it's not genuine because you know if you were genuine
about it you would just meditate all day and like
this sort of stuff you can make these sorts of
arguments but the but the bottom line is that these
these arguments simply aren't factually correct they're not factually correct
the majority of mankind is not going to be able
to understand the things that i teach without psychedelics that's
just a fact there are some exceptionally gifted spiritually talented
people who do exist but these people they don't really
need my help explaining very much because these people are
already talented in what they're doing in their meditation and
spiritual practices they could even have spontaneous awakenings and so
forth and for them it's easy this work is very
easy but but that that's a i would say that's
one percent of the population the other 99 are not
going to understand and in fact it's a deep disservice
to those other 99 percent when those one percent pretend
as though the other 99 percent are going to access
the deepest understandings through some simple meditation practice or some
simple self-inquiry practice it's simply not going to happen and
so if you've been following that idea that oh i
just i'm just going to meditate for 30 or 60
minutes a day i'm going to do a little self-inquiry
here and there and i'm going to i'm going to
reach god i'm here to tell you that you're fooling
yourself you're not going to reach god that way chances
are you're not it's more true to say that you're
not than it is to say that you are those
people who say oh well leo sure they can sure
they can less than one percent can the other 99
can't which means it's actually more true to say that
they can't than that they can if one percent can
that's almost as though nobody can the problem is that
you're in denial about it and your teachers and your
gurus are not being honest with you they are misleading
you so what i'm concerned about is i don't want
you the average spiritual seeker to waste 10 or 20
years of your life pursuing god and 10 20 years
from now you still don't have a clue what god
is to me this is a ridiculous failure on behalf
of teachers why waste all of that time all of
that mental energy why rack your mind trying to understand
these things when you can take a psychedelic like five
a meal malt and within 15 to 30 minutes you
will understand directly you don't need a book you don't
need a guru you don't need a teacher you don't
even need leo you don't even need actualize.org all you
need is the psychedelic and careful protocols and a genuine
desire to understand and a very open mind now if
you don't have the desire you don't have an open
mind then it's not going to work if you abuse
it it's not going to work but if you use
it responsibly carefully deliberately with the right intentions it's gonna
work and you're gonna have profound epiphanies that you yourself
will understand you couldn't have had any other way this
will save you years and decades in your spiritual work
now of course whenever i say this people misunderstand and
they think that i'm saying that this is the only
way you should use the only method the only tool
i'm not saying that i still recommend you maintain a
meditation practice a yoga practice if you want to do
self-inquiry do that if you want to build up your
concentration skills and access various various guyanas and and this
this kind of stuff by all means practice and do
all that but you're not going to use those to
get the deepest understanding of god you're just not it's
not going to work and in fact you're going to
fool yourself very very likely you're going to fool and
deceive yourself in following those other paths because the bottom
line is that the thing that is preventing you from
understanding reality at the deepest levels is simply the inadequate
state of consciousness that you're occupying right now the baseline
normie state of human consciousness is simply insufficient to understand
how all of reality is constructed using god's mind you
can't understand that from that state of consciousness and meditation
is not going to be sufficient enough to boost your
consciousness high enough to understand that now you can use
it to boost yourself a bit and that's great but
you're not going to get the deepest understanding you're not
going to get the holistic under the the most holistic
understanding you're not going to be able to really integrate
every piece and every facet of everything to get to
get the full realization of what god and what love
and what existence is and to me that's the greatest
shame and so going forward i'm going to lean on
psychedelics as a tool more and i don't mean for
myself because i don't really even need psychedelics anymore i
figured it out um i don't i don't really need
them anymore i mean for you for those of you
who still haven't figured it out and have a long
ways to go for you psychedelics are just the most
powerful tool and i have to be honest in telling
you that i can't sit up here and lie to
you that you'll get there through meditation when you probably
won't and now you might say well leo but i
don't do anything illegal i don't want to get myself
into trouble okay fine but there are ways to do
psychedelics that are not illegal you can travel to different
countries different cities you can find psychedelics that are even
in your area that are not illegal it's going to
take more work it's going to cost you something but
you know what meditating for 10 years that's a lot
of work too that also costs you something going to
retreats that cost you something buying book after book after
rook that costs you something everything has a cost an
energy cost a money cost a time cost at the
very least you could travel to south america and do
an ayahuasca ceremony you might say oh yeah that's such
a pain in the ass it's gonna cost me a
thousand dollars for the plane ticket and then maybe another
thousand dollars for the retreat that's two thousand dollars and
then i'm gonna have to take a week off of
work that's a week lost right there and then it's
a it's a pain in the ass to fly over
there is that even worth it it is if you
have a breakthrough into god realization for two thousand dollars
that's a bargain that's a bargain and that's not the
only way to do it you could find various kinds
of retreats and other psychedelics that are available closer to
you where you don't even need to travel that far
you just have to explore the possibilities do your research
so most people have more options than they understand if
you're serious about this work and you don't take psychedelics
seriously then you're not serious about this work and be
careful dabbling in psychedelics thinking that just by doing a
couple of trips now you understand how it all works
and that you you've gotten the message and now it's
time to hang up the phone no you haven't gotten
the message you really haven't gotten the message you haven't
understood how deep the rabbit hole goes so keep exploring
and going deeper and deeper so so anyways now you
understand my position um i know i'm going to get
a lot of flack for this people are going to
criticize me like oh leo um you're just stuck on
psychedelics and blah blah blah i've heard this a million
times so i don't i don't give a [ __
] about that anymore um you're not going to dissuade
me from from my position so if you don't like
this approach if you don't like the idea of psychedelic
awakening if you think awakening is something different than psychedelics
if you think awakening isn't possible through psychedelics if you
think that awakening um that the real awakening is the
meditative one and then the psychedelic awakening is the fake
awakening if these are your positions then i don't i
don't even want to talk to you i don't care
right like you don't understand what you're talking about that's
just the bottom line and if that's your position then
just unfollow me stop watching me i don't i don't
care do your own thing do it your way i'm
not telling you how to do your spirituality but i
will teach spirituality in a certain specific way and i
do have biases and in how i teach these things
and so if you don't resonate with my style and
if my biases upset you and you think that it's
it's dangerous or wrong or bad uh just go do
it your way i don't care how you do it
right but i do have to teach in a way
that is in alignment with the deepest things that i've
realized and that i know and in the ways that
i feel are going to be most helpful to the
majority of people out there and so what i've concluded
is that this is the way this is the way
we're actually not going to awaken the majority of mankind
through any kind of meditative retreats or self-inquiry it's not
going to work if that would have worked it would
have already happened hundreds of years ago so it's not
going to happen that's a dead end uh but we
can awaken a lot more of mankind through through the
responsible exploration of these incredible substances and then the discovery
of even more powerful and more amazing substances in the
future because the whole field of psychedelics is still in
its infancy and the kind of chemicals that will be
discovered 50 years from now 100 years from now and
their potential to transform mankind to heal mankind spiritually psychologically
physically from addictions and from anxiety and ptsd and from
their egoic delusions that potential is enormous but it comes
with risks it's not foolproof just like no spiritual technique
or path is foolproof so make sure that if you're
going to do this you do it carefully and if
you're going to do this do not give psychedelics and
do not give 5meo malt a bad name that's the
most disrespectful thing you can do with my work and
the deepest things that i share with you you see
i could be charging thousands of dollars to share these
insights with you i don't i release them for free
i could put up pay walls i don't for the
most part i put out some of my best deepest
stuff for free because i wanted to percolate through the
culture to me that's more important than putting it behind
a paywall because for me this is about a larger
impact having a larger impact on mankind that cannot be
had behind a paywall even though i would personally benefit
from putting it behind a paywall so since i'm going
out of my way to share these profound insights with
you and these methods and techniques that i'm discovering what
i expect from you in return as payment is respect
for the insights and the techniques don't make a mockery
of this work don't abuse this work don't give it
a bad name and a bad reputation by doing crazy
stupid things that's like me giving you a gift and
then you slapping me in the face that's what that
is like so don't be that [ __ ] respect
the substance respect this work do it carefully do it
with love and respect and consciousness and understand that it's
not just about you it's also about the reputation and
the image of psychedelics as a whole field and also
specifically five meal malt that itself will have its own
reputation you see and right now we're going to be
building that reputation what is that reputation going to be
that's going to depend upon you and how you act
and how you behave with this substance and if you
act irresponsible like a child then don't be surprised when
the rest of society cracks down bans this stuff or
demonizes it because you're giving them a good reason to
demonize it because you're using it like a devil so
understand the greater collective responsibility that you have you don't
just have a personal responsibility here to not harm yourself
obviously you have that responsibility but you also have a
responsibility to your family to your friends and to society
at large to give this incredible miraculous substance the right
image and reputation because there are thousands and millions of
people even who could be benefited by five meal malt
but they never will be because you and others like
you have abused this like devils use it to do
stupid things like running around naked on the streets yelling
like a madman or using it in other kinds of
dangerous ways where you hurt harm yourself or harm others
after a bunch of you have done that then see
what you've done the worst thing you've done is that
it's not that you've hurt me it's that you've hurt
thousands and millions of other potential people who could have
benefited from this substance who never will people who are
suffering with mental illnesses who could have been cured people
who are struggling with their spiritual work and practices people
who are stuck in their ego people who are considering
suicide people who who have ptsd and other sorts of
dysfunctions who could have been cured and healed by this
powerful amazing miraculous substance but they never will be because
of the devilish ways in which you've acted and now
which has resulted in a stigma around this substance so
please take both personal and collective responsibility here and this
is how we move mankind forward this is how we
awaken the world you
