hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about stress management all right
let's talk about how to manage your stress stress management
Wow I mean so many of us are stressed these
days and we're stressed about all sorts of things how
do we bring that stress under control wouldn't it be
nice to create a life that is stress-free that gives
you peace of mind and a stability and a equanimity
equanimity meaning calmness of mind evenness of mind that can
last out throughout the whole day no matter what happens
no matter what the circumstances are you can still remain
calm how do we go about creating that let's actually
dig in and take a look at what stress really
is how its created what areas in your life are
most affected by it and then give you some solutions
for how to tackle this problem at the root at
the core all right so stress I mean none of
us like to feel stressed but so many of us
today are overwhelmed for various reasons either relationships have a
stressed or Money has a stressed or lack of time
and work has a stressed or other areas in our
lives but those three I would say are the pillars
but let's take a look let's take a look at
what stress is what is going on when you're stressed
well it's a chemical response isn't it it's a series
of emotional responses within your body but also a series
of thoughts that are going on at the same time
that's ultimately what stress is if you actually do in
an introspection into your own consciousness when you are stressed
and you just observe yourself that's what you going to
find is you're going to find that you have thoughts
that are coming up and you're going to have emotions
that are coming up and probably those two are going
to be intermingling together and that intermingling is is fairly
complex so your thoughts will be creating negative emotions and
then your negative emotions will also be creating negative thoughts
and it creates this downward negative Erol where these two
forces kind of feed into each other and they create
this perfect storm this perfect storm of in your mind
which then gets you all anxious and stressed out about
whatever it is that you're stressed out about so that's
what's going on now it's important to wonder is stress
an internal condition or is it an external condition where
is it going on really think about this don't listen
to what you've been told in popular culture or what
you've read it some book or what some guru told
you listen to yourself listen to your own experience your
own consciousness when you are stressed is that because your
life is going to hell externally you're not getting what
you want out there and that's why your life is
stressful or is your life stressful because of what's going
on in here well if you do some introspection and
you do it very honestly with yourself what you're going
to find is that even though it seems like the
problem is out there in the external world actually the
problem is in here the stress is coming up and
being created in here it's always operating on the inside
right in your internal reality not in the external reality
and so this being the case it's important because some
people will will project the problem out into the external
world that's our gut reaction that's what we do is
we tend to say well you know that person she's
got me stressed my boss he's got me stressed or
my kids have me stressed out to hell or the
lack of money that I have I can't pay the
bills that's stressing me out my business problems bad clients
stuff going wrong legal issues that's stressing me out externals
see the problem with that is that if if you
project everything out there then you're really leaving yourself powerless
you're a victim in this situation you're not taking responsibility
if you don't take responsibility I mean you can choose
to do that but then you're going to you're going
to stay stuck in the situation and you're going to
let things keep stressing you out and that's probably one
of the reasons why you're so overwhelmed right now if
you are if you're very stressed right now in your
life and you're watching this video hoping for some relief
well the first thing I got to tell you is
that probably the reason you're so stressed is because you're
blaming everything outside of you for your stress right now
that doesn't mean that certain situations aren't inherently more stress
causing than others but still like look at this one
person will go into a work situation and have the
boss yell at them and he'll be completely stressed or
maybe he has a presentation that has to get to
the company and he'll just be stressed out of his
mind he won't sleep that whole night he'll worry he'll
wake up in the morning he'll have problem he'll run
to the bathroom couple times because his stomach is upset
and he won't be able to eat and by the
time he gets to work he's such a nervous wreck
he's biting his nails and all this is going on
right so he's getting stressed because of the presentation that
he has to give to his boss and to the
company so that's one person but you can also take
another person put him in the exact same situation and
he will sleep like a baby he won't even think
about the presentation and he'll just walk in there and
he'll do whatever he needs to do so what's the
difference there the difference is not the situation it's the
same situation the same boss the exact same company the
exact same presentation that needs to be given the exact
same stakes are on the line maybe millions of dollars
are on the line but one person will be a
nervous wreck another person will be completely calm cool and
a cucumber what's the difference well the difference is what's
going on here right it's about the attitudes it's also
about the experiences that you cultivate it's the self mastery
that you have it's the emotional control that you can
develop its various techniques that you might have to manage
your stress it's the way that you're thinking very very
critical the way that you're thinking so the way a
calm person thinks is very different than the way anxious
person thinks their thought patterns are completely different their view
of life is completely different their visualization of situations is
very different so it's important start to recognize this right
and this is not some contrived situation you can even
do this little experiment with your own self so you
might say well Leo how can you compare two people
I mean sure one person he just might be maybe
he grew up better maybe his his father didn't beat
him and this person he grew up with a shitty
childhood and of course he stressed so isn't that it's
not natural but look you can do it with yourself
find a situation in life that used to stress you
out like hell but now if you put yourself back
into that same situation it's going to be like wow
you're going to you're going to laugh you're honestly going
to laugh because you're going to be back in that
situation and it's going to be laughable to you that
you were ever stressed about it I mean think of
a situation like that maybe it's a first date do
you remember how nervous you were when you were dating
for the first time or the first few times every
time you sat down you're so nervous with that that
girl with that boy now when you do it if
you've dated you know dozens of people now you do
it and it's like it's like nothing you don't even
think about it do you remember the first time that
you ever wrote an email how stressed out you were
about writing an email just like a simple email you
might sit for at the computer typing up an email
to some you know some company or maybe some resume
that you're sending out and maybe this is the first
time that you started using the computer and using using
email you did that and like you would spend 60
minutes you would spend 90 minutes crafting an email and
it was just a four line email how stressed and
nervous you were about that now what does it take
you to to write an email you just bam shoot
it off you don't even think about it it's full
of typos inside you don't care see what what changed
in those situations what changed was your psychology changed your
experiences developed you matured you developed some self-control you also
develop detachment from that situation and you became at ease
and so you're not stressed by it anymore so all
that's showing you is that it's internal right I need
to prove to you that it's internal you need to
prove it to yourself because as long as you believe
it's out there you're always going to be a you're
always gonna be a victim you're all going to be
stuck so that's a very important distinction it seems external
very very deceptive think and look at how deceptive your
mind is here alright so common sources of stress I
would say they are the following money lack of time
and relationship problems this is the mud these these three
are the mother of all stresses and what I want
to do here is I want to give you some
some practical things you can do to start to fix
stress in each one of these situations because I coach
a lot of people that will come to me with
stress around one of these areas and then we do
a lot of coaching and invariably stuff tends to happen
and I see kind of the actions that people start
to take and so you start to see kind of
patterns emerge so these are some of the patterns that
I've seen emerge now ultimately because we have been talking
about the inner outer world distinction here and we've been
talking about the fact that stress is internal ultimately to
deal with stress on a long-term basis then you need
to start to cultivate more positive attitude start to drop
the negative thinking do things like that and the best
way to do that is to do deep personal development
all the videos and I'm releasing to you guys I
have a lot of videos that talk about the inner
psychology of things right so definitely start to check those
out and start to learn from those but here's something
a little more practical a little more immediate more like
action based so money a lot of people are stressed
over money they don't have enough of it they're fighting
for it they're struggling with it they can't pay the
bills etc etc etc how do you overcome this stress
look ultimately I am about fixing your life so I
master my internals and then I master my externals as
well and sometimes it goes the other way around where
I'm asked for my externals first and then the internals
will come up to it you know I'll develop that
over time because sometimes the internals take a little bit
longer to develop so for example the action that you
should be taking with your money if you're having money
problems at your job what's the solution it's obvious you
know it but you don't want to take responsibility but
what is it get a better job alright do what
it takes do the hard work it takes to get
a better job to earn more money get an education
go get some extra training go send out 20 resumes
go spend a couple hours polishing up your resume go
get some recommendations so that your resume looks better build
a portfolio you know whatever you got to do get
a better job the money then is not a problem
it's a kind of stress you anymore it's not going
to be the end of your stress but it's going
to be a solution to this nagging stress and this
nagging external circumstance that you're having all the time which
is a job that maybe is paying you little so
you're always struggling so fix that don't ignore it fix
it okay the next one is lack of time so
many else are strapped for time we feel like we
need more than 24 hours in a day to get
everything done and our work and our boss is driving
us nuts so how do we deal with this here's
the ultimate solution the ultimate solution is you got to
slow down all right you might be taking on too
much stuff slow down look for ways to slow down
I'm not saying this in some nebulous way I'm saying
it very practically look for ways to slow yourself down
look for ways to reduce your task list talk to
your boss ask them if you can do less because
you're feeling overwhelmed if you're working for yourself and you're
self-employed and you've got this whole laundry list of things
that you should have done two years ago and you're
catching up for it look start cutting stuff back you
have to start slowing down cutting stuff back giving yourself
more time more room to grow in your life a
lot of times we want to accomplish everything in six
months all our goals in six months it doesn't work
that way what you'll usually find is that in those
six months you'll accomplish only a small percentage of your
goals and then you'll even build up more goals so
now you've got the goals that you didn't do plus
the new goals that you've created so now you've got
even more to do so it's more and more and
more and more you got to start to slow down
give yourself more time be more patient with the whole
process and you guys should be very very ruthless with
your cutting you have to be very ruthless editor of
your own life start cutting out the stuff that is
not essential to your life I have another video called
time management you might want to search for that which
covers that topic really well about how to get more
time in your schedule right and you want to focus
you want to pick one task that you have on
your list and focus on it don't worry about the
whole list looking at that whole list just making you
more and more stressed you got to focus in right
that's what's creating overwhelm for you is when you're not
focused and you're distracted and you feel like you have
to just like touch one thing then touch another thing
to touch another thing not get anything done do everything
half-ass it's making you feel bad it's making you feel
miserable about the quality of work you're putting out and
basically what it's doing is it's May you multitask and
as you're multitasking you're driving yourself nuts you're driving yourself
frantic and stressed you want a single task focus on
a single task get that task accomplished that move on
to the next one and do it at a pace
where you're comfortable where you're it's sustainable you can sustain
that over a long period of time and put into
place whatever circumstance you need in your life to do
that okay the next one is relationships this is such
a big one this one has even further sub components
to it so relationships I would say that there are
three sub components of relationships people have stress in relationships
in the following areas with family people have massive stress
with their intimate relationships with their girlfriend their boyfriend or
their spouse in a marriage and then people have tension
at work coworkers or boss employee relationships or business partners
so these are the three areas of relationships where you
could be having massive stress so let's take a look
at each one of those and give you some options
about what kind of actions he could be taking ultimately
the mother of all solutions for relationships are the following
make sure that you're not doing this number one stop
blaming other people for your relationship problems this is this
is so difficult to admit to yourself but you have
to admit to yourself and take responsibility for all your
bad stressful relationships you are responsible for them that doesn't
mean the other person isn't doing something they should be
doing but that means that you are responsible you are
responsible for being in that situation you're responsible for putting
yourself in that situation you're responsible for allowing that situation
to continue I'm not blaming you I'm saying you're responsible
I'm saying you have control over the situation of power
there do not make yourself a victim by blaming the
other person this applies to family this applies to intimate
relationships supplies to quarters I don't care how bad it
is I don't care if you're your wife or your
husband is abusing you I don't care if someone in
your family is abusing you or if you're really getting
mistreated at work it doesn't matter that's irrelevant what matters
that you take responsibility the reason that you keep getting
mistreated and keep maybe even getting physically abused is because
you fall into this victim mode and you blame the
other person that that blame game has to stop so
that's number one number is that you have to stop
trying to control people that's the other huge mistake people
make is they try to control other people look you
can control yourself you can control external circumstances in your
life you know you can set up a nice house
and you can build a nice garden and you can
start a family but you cannot control people don't do
this it doesn't matter where don't control people at work
don't try to control people in your family don't try
to control your kids or your parents uh-huh don't do
that stop playing that game don't try to control your
spouse or your girlfriend or your boyfriend when you try
to control people when you try to manipulate them when
you try to get them to do the things that
you want them to do you're playing a losing game
it's going to make you so stressed so frustrated because
you're giving all of your power away all of your
power is going away when you do that okay so
here are some little solutions action items that you can
do with regard to relationships first of all with family
with family the solution is if you've got someone that's
really bothering in your family focus on yourself focus on
your own direction in life all right forget about forget
about the family for a second focus on your own
direction what are your own priorities your own values focus
on that focus on what you want to create all
right in intimate relationships what are some action items that
you could take one is you can be more loving
I mean that's the point of an intimate relationship if
you can't do that then you should break up so
these are the two items you're either going to make
a choice between being more loving and accepting of that
person or if you can't do that and you think
that the relationship is just totally soured it's not healthy
then break it off have the courage to break it
off I know it can be tough have the courage
to break it off because it's getting dysfunctional so one
of the two and now with co-workers what can you
do with coworkers again you've got two options here really
one is to focus on your own direction stop paying
attention to what they're doing stop paying attention to what
they're telling you focus on what you know is right
what you should be doing at work and just focus
in on that right put your nose to the grindstone
that's one option the other option is to to quit
if you really find that you're a toxic work environment
and your boss or an employee of yours or maybe
even a bunch of people are colluding against you and
you're having office politic problems and you keep getting embroiled
in that all the time and it's causing a lot
of stress for you I mean you got to be
honest with yourself maybe it's the environment that you're in
you you could be in a toxic company you could
be in a toxic division you could be around toxic
people and those people might not be healthy for you
in the long run especially psychologically so get yourself out
of that situation why are you staying there why you
staying there all right so those are some of the
action items that you can be taking with family intimate
relationships and co-workers now I'm going to give you the
mother of all solutions the absolute route of how to
manage your stress ready for it we've already touched on
it with the family it's grounding yourself in yourself this
is what has to happen the reason your stress is
because you're so worried about what's happening out in the
external world you have to ground yourself back in to
your own values your own principles that's why I talk
about values identification it's so important having a life purpose
is so important if you have a life purpose oh
man it's really hard to get stressed it's very easy
for example for me now to manage some of my
stresses and I do have a lot of stresses but
now that I'm very in touch with my life purpose
I know exactly where I'm going you know if a
stress is distracting me sometimes I will get distracted I
might spend a whole day stressing about something but you
know what the next day I'll reground myself because every
day I bring myself back to my purpose I do
this very consciously so I know that you know when
something is distracting me maybe someone says something nasty to
me or so they didn't go quite the way I
wanted to in my business it doesn't matter because ultimately
I'm looking 20 years down the road at what I'm
doing with my life what I'm creating with my life
I'm focusing on what I'm creating and people can tell
me whatever they want they can dissuade me in whatever
ways circumstance is going to come in people could come
and you know steal my money or whatever and those
could all be bad situations but still there's a calmness
that I get from knowing that I have a direction
and then I'm going to do whatever it takes to
get to where I want to go I'm on a
path I'm on a mission I'm on a hero's journey
that's what you need to be on if you've got
that in your life a lot of the stress is
going to melt away for you it's going to be
a lot easier for you to manage your stress and
a lot of the other more advanced stress management techniques
that I have will well kind of what they'll do
is they'll kind of attached to this backbone right they
give it as building a building this giant skeleton you
have the backbone which is your your life purpose and
then on to what you would attach these little other
techniques and together you can create this very robust robust
skeleton otherwise what you've got if you're just using a
little technique here or there those techniques are not going
to go with the route of it the route of
it is that you're not a creator in your life
and so you're letting other people come in there and
and do whatever they want with you and you just
kind of go along with the with the flow you're
like a leaf blown in the wind and you blow
in whatever direction wind blows that's not how you create
a successful life gotta have a life purpose if you're
interested in more about life purpose either hit me up
for coaching that's my forte that's what I coach people
on but also check out a lot of the other
videos I have about life purpose that can give you
some insights about how to figure that out for yourself
so that's it that's how to manage your stress if
you follow these principles then you will find your stress
dropping significantly go ahead post me your comments down below
