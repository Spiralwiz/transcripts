            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/3Z4D-gBLT-Y' target='_blank'>What Is Goodness - Good & Morality Fully Explained</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Goodness is absolute and not solely a human quality</b>: Goodness is not just a human invention or quality and it is not purely a relative concept. There is such a thing as an absolute good that transcends the relative good and bad that people normally refer to. It is possible to become directly conscious of what goodness entails, it's not an ideology, belief, or speculation. 
</li><li><b>Reality as the manifestation of absolute good</b>: Even though reality is widely seen as neutral, Leo argues that physical reality is actually the embodiment or material realization of absolute good. What is perceived as bad is the outcome of judgments projected onto it by humans, based on survival biases and attachments. Things perceived as good or bad are also influenced by this same bias.
</li><li><b>The relationship between goodness and consciousness</b>: Goodness is deeply tied to consciousness; when expanded, consciousness becomes so holistic and integrated that it gains a meta-awareness of reality as a whole. From this absolute point of view, everything is perceived as absolute good - good as a deep existential facet of the ultimate truth of what consciousness is.
</li><li><b>Understanding of goodness by spiritual teachings and science</b>: Many spiritual teachings don't explain what goodness is possibly because these teachers aren't directly conscious of absolute good. The scientific paradigm also fails to provide a clear definition of goodness as it assumes that reality must be neutral and regards the notion of absolute goodness as metaphysical or wishful thinking.
</li><li><b>The true embodiment of reality serving ultimate good</b>: If an entity had unlimited power to create any kind of reality, the one serving the highest good is one that gives an infinite number of beings the opportunity to experience and discover the infinite goodness of consciousness for themselves. This reality does actually exist and it is indeed the universe we inhabit. 
</li><li><b>The misconception of infinite goodness</b>: Our limited consciousness and biases tend to corrupt the understanding of infinite goodness. We mistakenly assume that a universe of absolute good should serve our selfish needs and desires, oblivious to the fact that reality is selfless and doesn't favor any individual.
</li><li><b>Ultimate goodness requires self-sacrifice</b>: Accepting that experiences we often label as bad (due to selfish interests and limited consciousness) might actually be absolute good demands a great deal of self-sacrifice. Additionally, pursuing a fully conscious understanding of this kind of goodness requires choosing it willingly without any coercion or ulterior motives. 
</li><li><b>Nature of God and creation of the universe</b>: Leo explains that God, being selfless and infinitely good, created a universe that is the embodiment of absolute goodness. This universe is a configuration that could not be better. However, human beings, limited by their self-centeredness and lack of consciousness, often perceive this universe as flawed and full of evil. 
</li><li><b>Understanding absolute goodness</b>: Improving our lives greatly depends on understanding goodness as absolute and all-encompassing, as well as acknowledging our imperfect comprehension of it. This involves surrendering our biases and expanding our consciousness instead of projecting judgements onto reality. God aims for humans to realize this infinite goodness, which consequently improves their lives. Nonetheless, such improvement doesn't just revolve around personal advancement but also contributes towards the realization of the collective good. 
</li><li><b>Goodness is its own reward</b>: Goodness holds a special position not because of what it leads to or produces, but due to what it inherently is. It is the ultimate goal, unlike other things such as money which can be used for good or bad. This avows that the pursuit of goodness is its own end, and it does not need to serve any other purpose beyond itself.
</li><li><b>Concept of Absolute Goodness</b>: In his discussion, Leo Gura expounds on how physical reality is a manifestation of absolute good, opposing the conception of reality as neutral. He proposes that our judgments about good and bad situations are sown within our own perceptions and thought processes. The idea of bad events or things are reflections of our views rather than the absolute truth of the universe. He delves further into the concept of goodness, describing it as synonymous with existence and a deep existential facet of ultimate truth and consciousness itself. 
</li><li><b>The Universe as a Perfect Judge</b>: The universe, like a perfect judge, is completely impartial, treating all beings and creatures equally without any bias or privilege. It doesn't prioritize or favor anyone, building a tangled rapport with individuals who may perceive its 'judgements' as unfair, especially when outcomes dont favor them due to their inherent selfishness.
</li><li><b>Our Perspective on Goodness</b>: The primary challenge lies in our limited perspective of assessing the goodness of the universe. We misunderstand or misjudge its actions based on our self-centred views or experiences rather than acknowledging that the universe is actually inherently, infinitely good. Gura argues that to fully realize the infinite goodness of the universe, one needs a level of consciousness that's infinite, recognizing that non-goodness is not a fault of the universe but our perception problem.
</li><li><b>Freedom and Goodness</b>: To enable the individual to reach this state of absolute goodness, one must consciously choose to be good without coercion. Coerced goodness is not morally sound as it revolves around fear and self-preservation rather than selflessness. Genuine goodness comes from the joy of being good, with the desire to be good surpassing all other drives, needs, or priorities. 
</li><li><b>Goodness and God</b>: Leo Gura highlights that for the infinite being/god, goodness is self-justifying, self-reinforcing, and tautological. Stemming from such realization, the perspective on goodness shifts from being something one ought to strive for to something that fundamentally exists as the structure of reality and true consciousness. He ties goodness directly with the concept of infinity, implying that the existence of anything outside or beyond this framework of goodness is impossible. 
</li><li><b>The Role of Consciousness</b>: Higher or expanded consciousness has a significant role in gaining the meta-awareness required to recognize the neutrality of the universe in its complete goodness. It allows individuals to move beyond their personal biases, facilitating a realization of the absolute goodness that lies underneath all existence, ultimately steering one's life choices towards this path of goodness.
</li><li><b>God's Consciousness and Neutrality</b>: God's consciousness is explained as pure, uncorrupted by biases, and neutral. It accepts and embraces all forms of existence, considering those as parts of the entire universal consciousness. Every form or aspect of reality isn't judged, but merely allowed to exist as part of the ultimate good.
</li><li><b>Egotistical Perception of God</b>: The egotistical interpretation of God as a choosy creator is dismissed as a childish notion. Contrarily, God is identified as an impersonal entity, a field of infinite consciousness that provides rise to everything.
</li><li><b>solution to the Problem of Evil</b>: The problem of evil is proposed to be overcome not by removing evil elements but by embracing and understanding them with depth. The negativities viewed as evil are recognized as products of biases and lack of consciousness. Once understanding and acceptance occur, these evils cease to be perceived as such.
</li><li><b>Impact of Personal Hurt on Perception of Good and Evil</b>: Perception of good and evil is described as being significantly influenced by personal experiences and hurt. What is held as evil are the entities that yield personal harm. As a result, it is difficult for individuals deeply wounded or hurt by a particular ideology or group of people to view them as part of the ultimate good.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self Bias in Understanding Reality</b>: The lack of an understanding of self-bias is identified as an obstacle in perceiving reality clearly. Perception of reality is distorted by self bias, leading to an inability to comprehend absolute good.
</li><li><b>Introduction of Absolute Good</b>: Absolute good is introduced as infinite due to God's infinite selflessness. Absolute neutrality does not only result in neutrality, but devolves into absolute good. The universe is morbidly neutral, but neutrality for the sage or awakened one manifests as absolute good, providing an infinitely good feeling.
</li><li><b>God's Nature</b>: God, being the highest authority, is not bound by any rules or moral standards, as any rule it abides by is self-created. Leo posits that God is not evil because being infinitely conscious and utterly intelligent, it chooses goodness without motive or gain. This contrasts with human behavior, where selfish behaviors stem from a desire for personal benefit.
</li><li><b>Stages of Moral Development</b>: Leo Gura breaks down morality into several stages of human development. In the earliest stage, morality is based on punishment and reward, where children are taught to follow rules through physical discipline. In the next stage, morality is dictated by societal conformity and the fear of disapproval from one's peer group. This is prevalent in many religious and conformist societies. Finally, higher levels of morality are found in those who base their actions on broader guiding principles rather than rigid rules. 
</li><li><b>True Morality and Consciousness</b>: True morality is defined by consciousness and one's level of cognitive development, including a genuine understanding of the relativity of reality. The ability to acknowledge multiple perspectives and worldviews without judgment is hallmark of genuinely moral individuals. This flexibility, open-mindedness and lack of self-bias allows individuals to make morally relevant decisions that benefit the universe as a whole.
</li><li><b>Challenges to Achieving Godlike Morality</b>: Personal attachments, biases and selfish considerations hinder individuals from achieving this level of morality. Personal development towards godlike morality involves removal of self-bias and extending one's perspective to encompass the entire universe. The ultimate aim is to act for the advancement of the universe at large.
</li><li><b>God's Morality</b>: In Leo's view, God's morality stems from its neutrality, selflessness, and infinite consciousness. Gods goodness is chosen without self-bias or personal gain, demonstrating a level of morality that humans should aspire to. Ultimately, being infinitely conscious and selfless, God's actions contribute to the progression of the universe. 
</li><li><b>Implementation of Moral Values</b>: For humans to achieve godlike morality, they must rid themselves of personal biases and attachments. This would require embracing a perspective that goes beyond personal affiliations and views reality in more holistic terms.
</li><li><b>Transcendent Morality and Perception of Goodness</b>: Transcendent morality refers to a morality that goes beyond societal norms and rules; it avoids judgement of others regardless of their actions, making it perceived as immoral or amoral to those with lower consciousness. People with lower consciousness or development may perceive true goodness as evil because they define ultimate good based on their biases and survival. The capacity to see good in others is directly proportional to one's level of consciousness. The higher the consciousness, the more goodness one is able to perceive in others and everything in existence.
</li><li><b>The Good Life and Human Beings</b>: The definition of a good life for human beings is to realize absolute good and work to embody it. In essence, this means becoming as close to God or as godlike as possible. However, before endeavoring to embody goodness, one must first become directly conscious of absolute good. The only way to achieve this is through conscious awareness. It's not sufficient to merely accept someone else's word about it. An individual must personally experience absolute goodness to validate its existence.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic Impulse to Be Good</b>: There's an inherent impulse within human beings to be good  to help others regardless of any expectation of reward or recognition. This genuine goodness, if felt universally, would reveal the godlike nature of human beings.
</li><li><b>Obstacles to Genuine Goodness</b>: The expression of genuine goodness is often obscured or forgotten due to life's complexities and survival demands (e.g., earning a living, raising children, etc.). These daily chores and challenges can make people lose touch with their impulse towards goodness, turning their life into a mechanical process bereft of godlike qualities of goodness. It is important to reconnect with the innate impulse towards goodness and make it the guiding force in one's life. 
</li><li><b>Evolving Towards Goodness</b>: Embracing the concept of goodness means navigating the complexities of life while also mindfully working to align impulses, thoughts, and actions with goodness. This journey progresses gradually, starting from small actions to eventually building a life dedicated to being infinitely good.
</li><li><b>Physical reality serving ultimate good</b>: Physical reality is a manifestation of absolute good that offers infinite beings the opportunity to discover the infinite goodness of consciousness. It is referred to as the ultimate good as there can only ever be one reality and hence, one point of goodness. 
</li><li><b>Influence of biased views and projections</b>: Our understanding of absolute good is often clouded by personal experiences, selfish needs, and biases. This is demonstrated in our tendency to project what we perceive as good and bad onto reality and judge based on that particular viewpoint. This projection often leads to misunderstanding and distorted perception of reality as a whole.
</li><li><b>The role of fear and courage</b>: Fear can preclude living a fulfilling life and recognizing one's true purpose. It can lead to individuals making decisions that are not aligned with their innate impulse to pursue and manifest goodness. Courage is needed to overcome such fears and to lay the foundation for a life based on goodness. 
</li><li><b>Deeper understanding of goodness</b>: Goodness can be understood as embodying godlike qualities such as truth, honesty, integrity, selflessness and love among others. It means acting out of selflessness and sacrificing self-interests to work for the benefit of all. Such qualities, when exhibited, make individuals appear exceptional and offer hope and inspiration to others. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in embracing goodness</b>: Embracing absolute goodness and shedding ingrained selfishness is a demanding task that requires conscious participation and surrender. This is difficult due to humans' inherent survival instincts shaped by years of evolution. However, harnessing this difficulty allows individuals to align their lives more deeply with goodness and contribute to their overall life fulfillment and purpose.
</li><li><b>Becoming godlike and the risks involved</b>: Aspiring towards godliness runs the risk of individuals adopting a persona of selflessness without actually practicing it. They may talk about love and goodness, but ultimately, they're governed by their ego and personal interests. This misrepresents and dilutes the true essence of selflessness. 
</li><li><b>God-like qualities and new understanding of "good" people</b>: When we refer to someone as good, we generally mean that they embody godlike qualities. These qualitiestruth, honesty, didacticism, non-judgement, acceptance, etc.offer hope to the world and are somewhat rare. This interpretation also highlights that everyone has the potential to embody these qualities, thereby allowing the alignment with goodness in one's life.
</li><li><b>Danger of adopting selflessness as an ego persona</b>: The danger of adopting selflessness as an ego persona without sufficient consciousness and attachment detachment is discussed. This is problematic and detracts from the true embodiment of selflessness, which stems from an increase in consciousness and the surrender of biases and survival attachments.
</li><li><b>On Traps and Misconceptions in Pursuit of Goodness</b>: There are various misconceptions people fall into while striving for goodness. One is taking on a persona of self-sacrifice to the point of depletion or remaining in abusive relationships. This self-sacrifice is mistaken as good, whereas, in reality, it decreases ones capacity to genuinely serve others. True self-sacrifice is demonstrated through confronting fear, as exemplified by leaving abusive situations, prioritizing ones well-being, and adhering to one's values.
</li><li><b>On True Love and Strength</b>: True love breeds courage and does not allow one to be trampled upon. One must prioritize one's own dignity and self-worth while serving others, maintaining boundaries and refusing to tolerate abuse. Living a good life involves exuding a level of strength and staying away from moral weakness.
</li><li><b>Core Qualities for Achieving Goodness</b>: Achieving genuine goodness requires prioritizing truth, consciousness, and understanding relativity. Honesty and integrity form the foundation of truth, and the pursuit of truth should be an individuals highest priority. Goodness can't be faked or achieved merely by adhering to beliefs or ideologies; consciousness is indispensable. Appreciating the relativity of all perspectives, including ones own, is key. Being good involves maintaining neutrality and impartiality as a judge would, operating unclouded by individual biases. It is about extending genuine concern for all, rather than a select few. 
</li><li><b>Striving for Goodness</b>: Being good involves a lifelong journey that includes shedding biases and striving for a comprehensive understanding. There's no quick path to embracing goodness by watching a few videos or reading a few books; it requires earnest, continuous effort. The journey to embodying goodness is filled with pitfalls that may hinder progress. Additionally, it requires making difficult decisions and sacrifices.
</li><li><b>The Connection between Love and Goodness</b>: Good and love are similar facets of awakening. Both can be realized independently or in combination, but as consciousness lowers, they fragment and split apart into different aspects. While the terms serve different functions in daily language, they ultimately equate to each other at their core levels. Goodness symbolizes an honest signal that cannot be faked, and love represents the same absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Differentiating between Real Goodness and the Guise of Goodness</b>: Leo warns about people who might misinterpret his teachings and adopt a persona of selflessness instead of genuinely practicing it. He clarifies that he does not recommend staying in abusive relationships under the guise of self-sacrifice. It's necessary to assert boundaries and not tolerate abusive behavior in the pursuit of goodness.
</li><li><b>Postscript</b>: The ultimate goal should be the realization of one's infinite goodness - a process that may take years and demand self-sacrifice, courage, and rejection of comfort for higher consciousness. While acting good involves challenging, fundamental shifts in actions and viewpoints, it's worth the spiritual reward. It's important to note that one can only be as good as one is conscious, and a true understanding of relativity is crucial to that progression. The journey towards goodness is a continuous process, and while it involves numerous challenges, it is deeply enriching.
</li><li><b>Total concern for all</b>: Leo Gura elaborates on the importance of showing concern and care for all beings equally, stating that anything less than total concern for everything leads to evil. He criticizes those who may prefer the welfare of their nation over others, arguing that a godlike goodness has no such preferences and its concern is universal.
</li><li><b>Constant evaluation of judgments and biases</b>: It is mentioned how constant judgment of everything around us can hinder us from being truly good. Leo acknowledges that he himself hasn't completely overcome all biases or judgments. Only to say that he understands how to overcome them and how to be truly good.
</li><li><b>Understanding 'goodness' and living it</b>: Leo Gura states that understanding what 'goodness' means and applying it in real life are two different things. He notes that even though he has reached a conceptual understanding of 'goodness', he has not yet fully lived in alignment with it, stating it could take him another decade or more to embody completely.
</li><li><b>Godlike goodness is difficult to practice</b>: Leo emphasizes the difficulty in actually living a life characterized by godlike goodness, even after understanding what it entails. He suggests that striving for this level of goodness can lead to feelings of guilt and depression as individuals constantly recognize their own shortcomings.
</li><li><b>Devoting your life to the highest goodness</b>: Leo Gura advises his listeners to devote their lives to actualizing the highest form of goodness. He mentions that this involves difficult actions and most people shy away from doing so because they are uncomfortable. 
</li><li><b>Traps in the journey to godlike goodness</b>: Leo discusses the traps that exist in the journey to achieving godlike goodness. These traps, such as getting overly neurotic about being good, could potentially lead people astray from achieving their ultimate goal.
</li><li><b>Practical application and philosophical contemplation</b>: Towards the end of the dialogue, Leo Gura encourages listeners to keep an open mind and find a path that resonates with them, suggesting that his teachings might be too abstract for those seeking a more utilitarian approach. Nevertheless, he assures them that he will share more practical topics in the future, supplementing the philosophical ones.
