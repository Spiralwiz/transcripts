            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6tLZ2a1uafk' target='_blank'>Understanding Default Positions</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Default Positions</b>: Leo presents his concept of default positions, which are unconscious, unacknowledged beliefs or perspectives people hold without realizing they are beliefs. These are foundational and recur in various aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Questioning Positions</b>: Disputes the idea that some positions deserve a default status, meaning they are somehow obviously more true than others and require less evidence.
</li><li><b>Atheism as a Default Position</b>: Leo argues that atheists, who often say they hold no position, actually maintain a belief that there is no God, which is indeed a position. He differentiates between holding no position in theory and an actual position reflected in one's emotions and attitudes.
</li><li><b>Agnosticism as a Position</b>: Similarly, agnostics also hold a position, as they show preference or disbelief towards certain religious concepts, despite claiming they don't know for certain.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and the Perception of Reality</b>: Another example of a default position lies in people's attitudes towards psychedelics. Those who haven't tried psychedelics assume their current reality is the only 'actual' reality, discounting the possibility that psychedelics might offer access to a deeper reality. 
</li><li><b>Religion, Science and Culture's Single Perspective</b>: Discusses how various areas of life promote a single perspective and default positions to control people's thinking. Examples include the belief in absolute time, the conservation of energy and Occam's razor principle.
</li><li><b>Unquestioned Social Norms as Default Positions</b>: Discusses how people often hold unquestioned default positions on aspects of life such as consciousness being located in the brain, physical pain being inherently bad, free will, and various mainstream cultural norms. 
</li><li><b>Understanding One's True Beliefs</b>: Emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's true beliefs rather than depending on intellectual debates. Urges viewers to be aware of their positions and to understand that they affect both their theoretical understandings and practical, everyday lives. 
</li><li><b>Reality as an Illusion and Unlimited Possibilities</b>: Suggests that reality is often seen as consisting of separate, discrete objects, but this is just one perspective. Multiple perspectives can offer insight into infinite possibilities. 
</li><li><b>Self-Deception</b>: Launches a discussion on the danger of self-deception that people, especially highly intelligent ones, can fall into. Advises viewers to recognize their perspectives as just that, not absolute truths, and to avoid giving their beliefs special statuses.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Observation</b>: Advises viewers to be skeptical of ideologies that restrict them from observing and understanding themselves and their lives fully. Informs them about his resources that offer integrated understandings of life. 
</li><li><b>Aiming For a Comprehensive Understanding of Life</b>: Encourages viewers to aim for a comprehensive understanding of life and promises more foundational building blocks in future discussions.
</li><li><b>Default positions and Self-awareness</b>: False assumptions or default positions can lead to significant misunderstandings and learning mistakes. Lack of self-awareness regarding these positions may prevent individuals from recognizing they are operating under a default perspective, leading to potential issues in their understanding of life and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and Default Positions</b>: Leo converses with his mother about the use of psychedelics and the common default position people take that their current reality is the only reality. She is hesitant about using them as she believes that her current reality isn't a hallucination, a misconception Leo challenges. He suggests that psychedelics have the potential to reveal a deeper layer of reality, opening ones mind to new perspectives and experiences.
</li><li><b>Death as a Default Position</b>: Leo discusses the default position most people hold about death  that it's inevitable and probably negative. He highlights that people have both theoretical and practical beliefs about death, and their emotional reactions towards death-related circumstances expose these beliefs. However, he argues that considering death as an event with absolute certainty is a false default position. 
</li><li><b>The Conceptualization of Death</b>: Leo pushes the argument further, stating that the notion of death is a specific perspective that people hold. Most commonly, people consider death as a certainty rather than a belief or perspective. He emphasizes that death is not an absolute truth, therefore the tendency to perceive death as an undeniable fact is incorrect and misleading.
</li><li><b>Belief in Rationality and Discrete Realities</b>: Leo discusses additional default positions people hold, including the belief that everything in the universe is rational and that reality is made up of discrete, separate entities. He also mentions the belief in absolute time and the conservation of energy as common default perspectives. Leo notes that holding only one perspective as the reality due to lack of contrasting viewpoints can limit one's perception of the world.
</li><li><b>Questioning Default Positions</b>: Leo emphasizes that these default positions are not inherently accurate or valid. They should be questioned and examined for their verity. He offers examples such as skepticism, the belief that consciousness resides in the brain, physical pain is inherently bad, and the idea of free will. These positions are often accepted as facts, affecting individuals' perceptions and behaviors which may lead to entrenched misconceptions about reality, self, and life.
</li><li><b>Introspection about superiority of humanity and societal norms</b>: Leo Gura questions common societal beliefs and default positions such as the assumption that humanity is highly evolved, society is healthy, and the need to conform to cultural norms like getting married. He emphasizes that society may not be as healthy as we tend to believe and illustrates how the illusion can be challenging to see past, given we are components of the same societal system.
</li><li><b>Scrutiny of assumptions about happiness</b>: Leo Gura scrutinizes the common belief that happiness is derived externally. He parallels this with the conventional understanding of gravity always pointing downward, which, like the notion of happiness, turns out to be a simplified understanding that fails to capture the full complexity.
</li><li><b>Assumptions about depression</b>: Leo Gura examines beliefs about depression, challenging the common perspective that depression is a default state or happens to people passively. He proposes that depression is actively maintained and, if perpetually managed effectively, peace and bliss would instead be our default states.
</li><li><b>Impacts of mental "virus"</b>: Gura draws a parallel between inherent beliefs and viruses, suggesting that our deepest, unconscious beliefs may act defensively and go unnoticed like a virus. He mentions scenarios in which practiced beliefs differ from held beliefs in theory, implying a disconnect.
</li><li><b>Importance of empirical investigation</b>: He highlights the necessity of empirical investigation of all positions and beliefs to avoid potentially disastrous outcomes. He notes that everything considered as a 'given' should be empirically scrutinized.
</li><li><b>Reality's struggle with self-consciousness</b>: Leo Gura discusses the struggle reality faces in becoming self-conscious and the difficulty in recognizing and questioning our own underlying beliefs because we stand on them. This situation creates a blind spot for introspection and understanding of one's positions.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Unnoticed Default Positions</b>: Leo notes that when humans, as complex organisms, aren't self-aware, they risk creating disasters and problems both individually and collectively. Default positions contribute to this because they enable the mind to create a conceptual construct, without acknowledging it as such, which eventually becomes so real it's regarded as inherent to reality. This inability or unwillingness to accept these constructs as mere constructs blinds people to the significance and influence of these default positions. 
</li><li><b>Deception through Default Positions</b>: Leo talks about how default positions play a significant role in self-deception. Constructs created by the mind without being acknowledged as such become so real that they are perceived as reality. This leads to projections and the creation of fantasies that are regarded as real. Leo points to depression and nihilism as examples of constructs that individuals often fail to acknowledge and actively maintain, thinking of them as natural states rather than created realities.
</li><li><b>Reality Creation through Illusion</b>: In explaining the intricate relation between illusion and reality, Leo suggests that the fabric of reality itself is illusion. An illusion may seem real, and in being perceived as such, the illusion becomes a part of one's reality. This conversion of illusion into reality is what continually creates reality itself, leading to the construction of perspectives that are defended as truth, further perpetuating self-deception.
</li><li><b>Challenges in acknowledging Default Positions</b>: Leo emphasizes that the acknowledgment of default positions as positions, rather than absolutes, demands improved self-awareness, honesty, and objectivity. People, especially highly intelligent individuals, often fall into the hubris of assuming that they already understand this concept and engage in self-deception instead of making conscious efforts to gain higher levels of self-awareness.
</li><li><b>Turning Relativism to Absolutism</b>: Even as many might think that all positions are relative, this mindset can lead to the realization of absolutes. Leo explains that shifting from the dogmatic paradigm to a non-duality paradigm does not mean everything is open to speculation, rather it allows one to arrive at absolute truths that differ entirely from relative dogmas.
</li><li><b>Potential of Observation</b>: Leo advises listeners to distrust ideologies that limit their ability to observe. Observation, he states, is the key to raising awareness, and many human beings often refuse to engage in observation because it threatens their established beliefs and their survival. This unwillingness to observe realities contrary to established beliefs invariably leads to problems.
</li><li><b>Continuous Learning and Integration</b>: Leo encourages viewers to continuously engage with his materials to ensure complete understanding and an integrated perspective of life. He addresses the overlapping concepts in his different videos as necessary for emphasizing core topics while also providing new and foundational topics. This approach is aimed towards equipping and guiding the viewer in assembling a big picture understanding of themselves and life as a whole.
