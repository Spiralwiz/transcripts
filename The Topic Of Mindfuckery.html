hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about the topic of mind
[ __ ] [Music] you a major theme of life
is the mindfuck and I want to spend some time
talking about this because this is one of the most
remarkable things you'll discover in your life is that life
is a giant mindfuck and that there are so many
mind [ __ ] to be had in life and
a lot of people what they do is they spend
their lives running away from the mind [ __ ]
and this just screws them all up and if you're
gonna be a real student of this work you're gonna
be encountering a lot of mind [ __ ] along
the way so this is something I want to really
highlight underscore emphasize for you on this journey that you
should be kind of like looking out for them expecting
them to come now what is a mind [ __
] a mind [ __ ] is a surprise a
shocking reversal like the plot twist in a movie or
a giant Epiphany this realization that you had something totally
wrong or when you see something in a new light
and everything you knew before becomes recontextualized it's the Fight
Club moment it's amazing to me that this is just
a facet of life in a facet of reality a
facet of what it means to be human is to
encounter these mind [ __ ] and we have been
encountering them as humanity for a long time all throughout
history if you study the history of a philosophy the
history of science the history of religion the history of
just cultures and societies and governments you see humans coping
and struggling to understand what reality is whether it's the
Copernican revolution or discovering the new world the Americas and
and dealing with all the ramifications of that and just
how big of a shift that is in worldview for
people when you discover there's this whole new half of
the globe that we didn't even know existed or whether
it's the Einsteinian revolution and that means for space-time and
for quantum mechanics right so just all these mind [
__ ] you find it in science and philosophy and
throughout human culture but why do mind [ __ ]
happen why should reality be surprising well fundamentally you've got
to understand what a mindfuck is fundamentally the way you
get mindfuck is you have some expectations or know just
about how reality should be like this and then you
live your life this way thing that this is how
reality is and then one day out of the blue
you don't expect it something changes you run into some
new fact that flips that on its head and perhaps
reverses it 180 degrees and that's such a big shock
because all your expectations have been crushed they've been undermined
and from this happens the surprise but what sort of
adds insult to injury is that a lot of people
go through life not expecting that mind [ __ ]
are possible and so they get a double dose of
mind [ __ ] it's like not only do they
get surprised but then they get surprised that they got
surprised and a lot of people then kind of like
run away from it or they deny it or they
resist it and then that creates problems really what you
want to do you want to open yourself up to
the mind flux and a good way to do that
is just to to talk about this topic and to
think about why it exists there's a slew of reasons
for why mind [ __ ] happen but perhaps most
fundamentally it's because reality is so massive see when humanity
came into existence it didn't know what it was doing
here where it came from imagine being a caveman or
a Neanderthal a hundred thousand years ago like you had
no clue about anything about anything even the most obvious
things like you had no idea about anything you're totally
in and yet you had to survive in a very
brutal world much more brutal than today you had a
much tougher survival challenge than you have today and so
at this as you're trying to survive in this rural
world running away from alligators and snakes and spiders and
and lions and all this sort of stuff trying to
hunt for food and gather berries and not kill yourself
as you're trying to do all that you're also at
the same time wondering like what the hell am I
doing here if you guys like there was a time
where the first human had to have to have that
thought like what the hell is this like animals don't
ask themselves that question they just kind of go along
with the flow but at some point in human history
this happened whether it was the Neanderthals or even before
that we're not sure but you got to figure somebody
was the first to have that idea and even that
already was a mindfuck but see the problem here is
in my point is that reality is so massive but
we come into the world so totally ignorant of anything
that we don't even know that we're ignorant and what
we do is we just make kind of assumptions we
make tentative hypotheses about how the world works and we
just kind of like scrape by we make the best
of it that we can but then we kind of
get caught up in the complacency of that and we
think ok we basically got reality figured out after you
live for 10 20 years you kind of think like
you got to figure it out but do you really
a lot of times you don't see what we see
throughout history is that mankind has consistently underestimated reality its
scope and size its depth its complexity its non-linearity and
this is what produces mind [ __ ] because fundamentally
what you're trying to do is you're trying to take
all of Rihanna this massive thing billions and billions and
billions of galaxies and star systems and planets and animals
and species and plants and stuff in the world you're
trying to take all this and you're trying to distill
it down and and stuff it inside your skull basically
to make sense of it so of course it sort
of makes sense from the very beginning you should sort
of expect that ah that's that's gonna be tough to
do to take such a large thing and put it
into such a small thing and that's not even taking
into account that maybe this thing isn't just large but
maybe it's infinite and if it's infinite then that's like
a whole nother level of largeness so as large as
you maybe thought the universe was if you start to
now think of it as actually infinite and you realize
the full consequences of that it really becomes remarkable how
can you possibly stuff that into your skull that whole
thing and make sense of it in a way where
nothing surprises you anymore so what I'm saying here in
this episode is that mind [ __ ] are an
essential component of reality they're like woven into the fabric
of reality surprise and mystery and these shocking sort of
fightclub moments this is what it means for consciousness to
become self-aware is it becomes aware of how goddamn huge
it is and how remarkable it is how intricate it
is how complex it is in all the ways in
which it functions it's really humbling to realize that you
even if you are like a billionaire a richard branson
type person and you travel all around the world and
you you go to all the countries visit all the
cultures eat all the food read all the books do
all this sort of stuff that even if you do
all of that you will live a very rich life
for a good 70 years you will still only be
exposed to Oh point zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent of all
of reality really much less than that much much less
that's that's that's being generous that's a generous estimate right
there so you you take this into account and then
you of course you you have to realize like yeah
of course there's gonna be mind [ __ ] because
I'm only exposed to such a small slim of what
reality has to offer and that's something that we don't
appreciate I mean it's an obvious point but somehow humanity
as a species as a culture and as an individual
you just you ignore all this simply because you're going
about living your everyday life and for the purposes of
living your everyday life you don't need to to bother
remembering that you only know a tiny tiny fraction of
what there is to know and what there is to
see and the reason that's important and this is something
that a lot of people misunderstand and why they get
so mind-fucked is that they underestimate the extent to which
new information can undermine and reverse existing information this is
a remarkable point about epistemology in the workings of the
human mind that I see almost everybody miss miss appreciating
under appreciating let's say I see religious people under appreciating
this I also see scientific and rational people under appreciating
this see never never underestimate how much reality can [
__ ] you over because reality is much bigger than
you it's got way more sleep tricks up its sleeve
than you do and what people underestimate is that they
think that well yeah we've got some facts and information
let's say from science in some field biology physics whatever
or outside of science as well religion whatever whatever your
field is whatever you think you know but then what
you don't understand is that new information that can come
to light can be such that it can it can
recontextualize that information that you have whatever model or theory
you have it can recontextualize that and that recontextualization when
you put something into a different context that can completely
alter the facts or the information that you previously had
not just a little bit but entirely it can either
make the information you had before the model you had
before it can make it completely incorrect it can make
it completely irrelevant and or it can actually flip it
inside out such that the truth is the exact opposite
of what you thought it was and this is something
people don't understand people tend to just assume that oh
new information will just accrete and it will be a
gradual just kind of building up evolutionary process of kind
of gradualism we're like well yeah we've got science we've
got physics surely oh it's not perfect we're just gonna
kind of like keep adding to it some details some
fine-tuning and overall we're kind of kind of like build
on top of what we already have and what I'm
saying is know if you expect that you're gonna get
mind [ __ ] what I'm saying is that what
you should really expect other instead is you should expect
radical shifts in contexts in the future you can't exactly
predict when it'll happen but you could predict that it
probably will happen people routinely underestimate how much context can
alter content how much perspective matters how much holism matters
and just how radical of an undermining is possible we
see this throughout the history of human knowledge we stayed
in philosophy we see it in science we see it
in religion we see it everywhere else we see it
in politics for example and you probably have examples from
your own life when you were a kid when you're
a teenager you have some view of the world which
was one way and now it's probably completely the exact
opposite because something shifted there but when you were a
kid you couldn't even anticipate that and in fact you
were very adamant that no your position will never change
that you're totally right and then that might happen even
again as you get older see people under appreciate this
so other reasons for why these mind [ __ ]
happen is because a key feature of ignorance is that
it doesn't know that it's ignorant it's got this very
interesting property so when you're ignorant you're really double damaged
by it because not only are you ignorant but you
don't even know that you're ignorant so you act as
though you know everything and this is something that I've
been observing in myself and other people it's really fascinating
to me to observe how this ignorance works it's like
this double blindness you're blind and you don't know that
you're blind and then this this is not a trivial
point this really makes the problem a lot worse because
if people at least became conscious that they were ignorant
that would be a substantial leap forward in consciousness that
wouldn't solve all the problems but that would be a
big step towards that because that would open the doors
for a possibility of improvement cuz when you're ignorant you
can say okay I'm ignorant I know I'm ignorant I
got a lot to learn let me now make some
plans for how to learn and correct my ignorance but
most people are so ignorant that they're not even going
to do that see they're gonna be very adamant that
they're right and I'm gonna be so convinced by that
they might even have you convinced that they're right because
you as the one who knows he's ignorant will say
well yeah maybe maybe I am ignorant maybe they have
a good point I don't know everything but see they're
gonna act like they know everything and so they're gonna
have this sort of false confidence that might convince you
another reason these mind [ __ ] happen is because
we are so self-involved when it comes to life our
number one priority is our own life our self the
ego our self agenda that is like one direction that
we go to and then the truth that's something else
entirely we'd like to tell ourselves that these things coincide
but actually it turns out they're in the opposite direction
and when that ends up being the case and you're
always pursuing your self agenda at the cost of the
truth then really what's happening is you're pursuing falsehood at
the cost of the truth and of course what is
a mindfuck but the realization that a falsehood is false
and actually the truth is something totally different so people
sometimes ask well leo why is truth important why should
I pursue the truth for truth sake well if you
don't expect to get mind-fucked see because the more you
pursue your own self agenda and the less you care
about the truth the greater the gap becomes between what
you think is right and what's actually right and the
bigger that gap is well the greater the fall as
they say see see how the higher the distance the
greater the fall and there's something even much deeper about
that which we can say which is that it's almost
like the very cost of existence itself is predicated predicated
upon a lie and in that sense just to come
into existence is already to be set up for a
mindfuck because there's a lot of assumptions that are needed
to bootstrap the self to bootstrap you into being that's
that's a tricky strange loopy sort of process and you
have to just assume a lot of stuff and when
you're a kid and you're just kind of like going
through school you're learning stuff you're learning how to function
in society you're making mistakes then you're also learning very
quickly but still you have a lot of assumptions that
you make and these assumptions are just like heuristic rules
of thumb that you create just in order to get
by in the world and there's nothing wrong with that
in fact that's necessary that's the only way you can
become a self a healthy decent functioning self but the
problem with that is that then people just tend to
assume like well hey it worked for me it works
Leo it works so what's the problem but see yeah
it works but it only works in a very limited
context then when you have bigger questions about life when
you want to know what existence is what reality is
and stuff like that I mean you want to really
correct some of the problems well you have to go
reevaluate your assumptions but then a lot of people just
forget that those assumptions were ever made in the first
place so it's okay to make assumptions but you have
to make a mental note of like hi I made
an assumption back there 10 years ago and I've been
sort of living based off that assumption building on top
of it but you know what that assumption could have
been wrong so that's okay you can make provisional assumptions
and hypotheses but you have to remember to go back
sometime maybe ten years later go back or rethink that
assumption maybe something has changed so all these factors lead
to a sort of false sense of complacency taking things
for granted and when you do that that's when you
really set yourself up and also I should add that
your state of consciousness your ordinary state of consciousness and
the ordinary average state of conscious that human beings have
this thing is tuned for survival and utility it's highly
pragmatic it's always thinking about the past and the future
it's very future or as it's always planning thinking scheming
manipulating it's always doing this you're living in this kind
of conceptual state of consciousness you don't even realize it
until you have ever exited and experienced some non-ordinary states
of consciousness that this is the case but this ordinary
state of consciousness that most human beings consider life this
this is one of our biggest blind spots sets up
us up for a huge mindfuck because we just completely
take it for granted that this is just what life
is is this one particular slice of consciousness but there
are other other states of consciousness which are radically different
and lead to very different experiences of life another reason
that these mind [ __ ] happen is that the
mind loves certainty it hates uncertainty and so when faced
with uncertainty what the mind will do is it'll fudge
the uncertainty and it will quickly confabulate some kind of
story or pseudo knowledge and then convinced itself that now
it's certain and of course that sets you up for
a mind flock because in fact you're not certain but
you think you are the mind also loves narratives so
what the mind will do is it'll cherry-pick evidence to
fit its narratives and of course its narratives fit its
own agenda and so these narratives are built but then
these narratives oftentimes have very little to do with actual
reality or with truth and then at sets us up
for a mindfuck see the mind is very tricky it's
a trickster and therefore you need to start to expect
that your own mind is your own greatest enemy and
that it has a lot of tricks up its sleeve
more than you do way more than you do it's
a lot trickier than you it is you but it
also tricks you that's what's so loopy about it now
how does a mindfuck happen well it happens through a
lot of different things it happens here's sort of a
list of where you can spot mind [ __ ]
you can spot it whenever you're acting arrogant or feeling
superior arrogance is huge and one of the reasons that
the ancients the Greeks and Romans they talked about hubris
and arrogance this was a big theme for them precisely
because arrogance leads to disaster leads to blunder leads to
destruction leads to chaos and the reason that happens is
through these mind folks because arrogance gets you believing that
you're going in the right direction we're actually going the
wrong direction ignorant sui vol Reddy talked about ignorance is
ignorant of itself and therefore these mind [ __ ]
happen another reason that it happens is under estimating phal
ability people underestimate just how fallible they can be people
convince themselves that they're certain and right by coming up
with fancy theories and rationalizations and justifications and they say
well but look he the logic of here's the statistics
here's the proof so we come up with all this
stuff and we build a rock-solid case but what we
forget is that even if you have the perfect proof
your proof could always be wrong in some place see
even if you're the best logician in the world you
could still be wrong you could still be fallible and
people people lose sight of that and as soon as
you start under estimating your ability to be fallible or
some experts or some scientists ability to be fallible you're
setting yourself up for a mindfuck anywhere that you're feeling
certain very certain about something very confident you set yourself
up for a mindfuck any assumption that you take for
granted you set yourself up for a mindfuck anything you
think is self-evident or obvious you're setting yourself up anything
you know or think you know based on belief or
hearsay hearing it from somebody else that always sets you
up for a mindfuck because in fact you don't know
whether what they're telling you is true it might feel
true but you don't really know that's the problem with
hearsay anytime that you're relying on Authority that you just
blindly trust you're setting yourself up for a mindfuck this
is a huge category of mind folks right here and
by authority I mean stuff like do you trust your
education system do you trust your professor do you trust
science do you trust your culture do you trust your
government do you trust the Bible do you trust the
Koran do you trust some textbook that you read do
you trust doctors do you trust a PhD do you
trust a person on television do you trust a celebrity
or an actor do you trust a guru a yogi
these are all authorities and if you're a serious seeker
of truth you realize just how big of a problem
Authority possesses and that you can't basically trust anybody including
me by the way you can't trust me either or
if you do watch out you might be setting yourself
up for a mindfuck you also set your from mine
[ __ ] any place that you don't have direct
experience of a thing anywhere where you have a vested
interest you set yourself up for a mindfuck why is
that because the problem with having a vested interest is
this problem between serving yourself agenda versus the truth see
if you have a self if you have a vested
interest in something you really need it to come out
some way like I really need my business to succeed
in order to pay the bills so my kids don't
starve and my wife doesn't divorce me if that's your
mentality then do you care about the truth in that
situation see no you don't you're gonna do whatever you
got to do to feed your kids because in your
mind that's the most important thing right there and the
truth has taken a lower priority and so see the
vested interest has divorced you from truth and now you
have set yourself up for mindfuck anywhere where a context
is ignored or underappreciated you set yourself up for a
mindfuck anytime that you're doing analysis or you're fragmenting reality
and you're working within a very narrow specialized field on
a very small thing and you put your blinders on
you say well I'm not gonna care about other fields
other disciplines or how this fits is a larger picture
I don't care about any of that I'm just gonna
work on my little field anytime you do that you
set yourself up for mindfuck because reality happens to be
holistic and like I said before whatever results you get
in your little field they're gonna depend on the larger
context and if you ignore that then your results could
lead you to believe one thing which is exactly the
opposite of what the larger context will reveal and that's
how a lot of scientists screw themselves over because they
become hyper specialized which is why if you want to
be a sage if you want wisdom in your life
if you want to be an extraordinary human being and
live up to your full potential as a human being
you need big-picture thinking you got to be careful about
not getting lost in the weeds anywhere where perspective is
poo-pooed or mind as pooh-poohed or underestimated you set yourself
up for a mindfuck what do i mean by this
well a lot of people think that well it's just
the facts léo reality just has some hard facts that's
why we have science we crunch the numbers here's what
is real here's what's not real we know the facts
we know the numbers and perspective mind these things these
are very subjective hippy new-age type of notions these don't
matter what matters is the hard stuff be hard-nosed but
see that's also just a perspective that's what you don't
realize that's also just one function of mind perspective is
much more important than people realize mind is much more
important people say stuff like well Leo I just want
like to build up my life have a good career
a good family make a killing in the stock market
have sex with with hot people all this material tangible
stuff this has nothing to do with perspective or mind
this is tangible stuff I either have a million dollars
in my bank account or I don't it's not a
matter of perspective when you take that kind of attitude
you set yourself up for mindfuck life is much more
perspective dependent than you have ever thought possible and that
in and of itself that lesson to learn that lesson
it's not enough to here for me you're gonna have
to experience a mindfuck to learn that lesson that lesson
in of itself is a big mindfuck that's a that's
a paradigm shift for a lot of people and any
time that you make appeals to this is just how
reality is that sets you up for a mindfuck so
what I want to do is I want to give
you a list of what I came up with a
round twenty or so of some of the top mind
flux that you will encounter in your life there we
go you think you're the body one day you will
discover that that's not true and that will be a
huge mind [ __ ] you think reality is real
and one day you will discover in a rude awakening
that that's not the case you think truth is logical
and that it conforms to your rational principles you will
be shocked to discover how wrong you are you think
materialism is correct you will be shocked one day to
discover how wrong you are you think religion is just
superstition and myth you will be shocked one day to
discover just how wrong you are you think your favourite
ideology is correct I don't care what it is liberalism
conservativism libertarianism and a million other ideologies that you have
well one day you will be shocked to learn how
wrong you've been you think your thoughts are trustworthy and
that you can rely on your skepticism in your own
mind and one day you'll be shocked to learn how
wrong you are you think that society and culture is
healthy and in that it has your best interest at
heart one day you'll be shocked to learn how wrong
you are you think success is equivalent to happiness one
day you will be shocked to learn how wrong you
are you think evolution is random it happens through a
random process of atoms or molecules mixing around through random
mutation one day you will be shocked to learn how
wrong you are you think science has no blind spots
and that science leads you to the truth one day
you'll be shocked to learn how wrong you are you
think the 21st century is advanced that we are out
of the our cages one day you will be shocked
to learn how wrong you are you think that what
school taught you is correct one day you will be
shocked to learn how wrong you are you think history
is objective and that the history that you read in
the history books that you see on TV that's how
actually stuff happened oh you're in for a very rude
awakening there you think that death is real one day
you will learn that it's not you think evil exists
you learn that that's not the case you think that
you're a good guy that you're the hero of your
journey a hero of your story one day you will
be shocked to learn just how evil you are you
think that other people hold you back from getting the
success you want in life well one day you'll learn
that it was all just you holding yourself back you
think your problems are material like you need more money
you need more sex you need a bigger house you
need a better car if only you had a better
job if only you had a hotter spouse if only
had better children if only they went to better schools
if only your business earned a little bit more money
then everything would be going great all your problems would
be fixed well one day you will experience the mindfuck
that shows you otherwise you think your fears are real
your fear of death your fear of poverty your fear
of not being loved your fear of being abandoned your
fear of being cheated on your fear of getting violence
perpetrated upon you by some terrorists or some criminal well
one day you'll discover just how wrong you are that's
the list and by no means is that the end
of the list that's sort of the beginning of the
list I don't have time to go into just how
all those things are the opposite of what you think
they are I've touched on those issues in the past
in certain episodes and I'll touch more about those in
the future in certain episodes I want to give you
a high-level overview here without going into the details fools
believe appearances whereas the wise know that appearances are very
deceptive and can't be trusted here are the lessons from
this episode that I want you to take away never
merely accept appearances realize that a basic fundamental principle of
life is that life works through deception and through illusion
as it must and through this realization you should start
to expect that it will mindfuck you in many many
different ways not just in one way many ways there's
some epic mind [ __ ] out there there's some
smaller ones that you will experience always investigate deeper wonder
what am i taking for granted wonder what am i
assuming in this situation develop a love for being mind
[ __ ] you should expect to be mind [
__ ] but that's not enough learn to love it
be curious about it so many people are led in
the wrong direction in life because they somehow think that
a mindfuck is a wrong thing that it's bad that
it's negative somehow that reality can't be paradoxical that it
can't be [ __ ] up or weird that it
can't be absurd drop all those expectations if you think
reality can't be weird and absurd beyond anything you can
possibly imagine you're gonna be mind [ __ ] so
start to love this I think that's one of the
things that I stumbled upon early in life and one
of the strengths I had in this work is that
I just sort of assumed I always assumed that reality
was a mindfuck and I actually enjoyed that aspect of
reality and actually I actively went and sought out those
mind folks and that's what led me to where I
am today so that's another thing that I'll share with
you as a lesson is go and proactively seek them
out always be kind of wondering to yourself where could
a mindfuck be lurking behind what corner where would it
be best hidden what I tend to find is that
the places that people never look that's where the mind
[ __ ] love to hide the most of course
so it's actually very easy to start to suss out
the mind [ __ ] because all mind [ __
] are is just like reverse psychology they're the exact
opposite of what you would think it's this constant theme
of counterintuitive nough stretching over again and again in all
these episodes I keep giving advice and lessons and they're
always counterintuitive everything is backwards and that's how it is
you have to approach life as though everything was backwards
it's like a reverse psychology game if you do the
opposite of everything you wanted to do you will basically
become the most conscious and greatest human being imaginable I
mean that's a very general rule of thumb you can't
apply that perfectly to all situations but as a general
theme that's how I approach my life is I try
to do like everything backwards everything opposite and the more
I do that the better things are and the more
I go with the herd the more I do the
stuff that my culture tells me to do that I'm
expected to do the stuff that seems intuitive the stuff
that seems easy the worst my life goes the more
hollow and meaning meaningless it is and the more similar
it is to everybody else because I become just like
the herd and of course that makes perfect sense you
do what the herd does you're gonna go in the
same direction that the herd goes and the herd is
walking straight off a cliff and they're all gonna be
mine [ __ ] in the end the biggest mindfuck
comes when you think there can be no more mind
[ __ ] it's when you think you're fully enlightened
that's when you're in front mind [ __ ] it's
when you think that oh surely I can't be mind
[ __ ] anymore I've been mind [ __ ]
so much already that's when you set yourself up for
an even bigger mind [ __ ] see because you
could just constantly keep under estimating the scope of reality
start to think of reality as being infinitely broad infinitely
deep infinite calm infinitely complex infinitely nonlinear and then you
start to develop the sort of humility about your entire
worldview and your approach to reality and how you think
about reality what you believe about reality and and then
that puts you into a better place and this is
not to say that mind [ __ ] are something
you should like strive to prevent like I said before
mind folks are a good thing in my mind I
like mind [ __ ] I like getting mind [
__ ] to me it's cool that's why psychedelics are
so cool cuz that's the surest way to mind [
__ ] yourself right there and then you know that's
why a lot of people don't enjoy psychedelics or they
have these bad trips or they have a profound deep
trip but then they can't integrate it because they just
want their life to not be a mindfuck but you
know what reality is a mindfuck so the only way
your life cannot be a mindfuck when reality is a
mindfuck is for you to live in a perpetual delusion
when you think you've got it you don't got it
when you think you're right you're wrong when you think
you're good you're bad what do you think your lightened
your not enlightened when you think yourself actualized you're not
self actualized everything's backwards that's the nature of the mind
that's the nature of reality learn to love it and
go on this journey and then you will really savor
these mind [ __ ] you'll savor them you'll appreciate
them these mind [ __ ] rather than being bad
trips or bad revelations these will be the most beautiful
experiences in your life alright that's it I'm done here
