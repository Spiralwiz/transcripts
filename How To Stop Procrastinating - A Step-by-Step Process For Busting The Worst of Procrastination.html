hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment we are going to talk about how
to stop procrastinating all right this is a big one
so we're going to get into really what procrastination is
on a deep level and I'm going to give you
some techniques and some practical methods that you can use
right now to bust through whatever is that you're procrastinating
on so I'm sure you have got one specific thing
in mind right now that you have been procrastinating on
I know I have stuff that I procrastinate on this
has been a challenge for me personally in many areas
of my life from my business to my work to
to gym to nutrition so all this stuff you know
we can all procrastinate on it and we all do
it to some degree for some of us it's actually
very very crippling and I've had areas in my life
where it has been very crippling very damaging to my
results and very wasteful of my time and just wasteful
of how I feel too I tend to find that
procrastination totally robs you of your mood and your excitement
and just the joy of life and your happiness so
we're going to get all that taken care of hopefully
in the next 15 minutes all right so how to
stop procrastination bottom line is that the cure for procrastination
and I know you do not want to hear this
the cure for procrastination is action the way that you
cure procrastination is to act in spite of the resistance
that you have the fear that you have the negative
feelings that you have about not doing that thing and
the more you procrastinate as I'm sure you have experienced
personally then the worse it gets but if you break
that cycle then it really does break and things start
to go smoothly for you of course you know that's
easier said than done so we're going to go into
a little bit more depth on how to do this
first of all let's understand what procrastination is procrastination is
more technically I I call it resistance it's resistance to
things and resistance can literally be created towards anything you
got to understand that as bad as it feels to
be procrastinating on whatever it is that you're procrastinating on
and you might feel like ah this is such a
painful thing I don't want to do it it's so
it's going to be so uncomfortable it's going to be
so scary it's going be so tedious it's going to
be so boring it's gonna be so monotonous it's going
to be so emotional it's going to be so negative
whatever is your reason for resisting it you can understand
that that resistance is created within you it's not really
in the activity itself and so here's what you got
to understand about resistance is that resistance is created any
time you make an activity should a must or a
need so whenever you tell yourself this is something you
have to do this is something you must do this
is something you should do then the resistance starts building
up inside of you because your mind naturally tends to
not want to do the things that it's told to
do it tends to just resist and rebel even when
the thing that it's being told to do is good
for it right so maybe going to the gym you
know that going to the gym is good for you
but you just start to build a resistance because you
start painting these negative movies in your mind about well
if I have to go to the gym that means
I have to get off my my couch then I
have to put on my shoes then I got to
get in my car it's cold outside I got to
change clothes then I got to go I got to
work out I got to get sweaty that's so uncomfortable
then I got a like push it hard on the
treadmill then I got to push the weights really hard
then I'm gonna come home all exhausted and I'm gonna
be sweaty and sticky I'm gonna have to go take
a shower and I just don't want to do all
that I'm feeling tired right so it's just like negative
movie that you build up in your head and then
of course when you paint that then you don't want
to do it and on the other hand there's that
other part of your mindset as well you have to
do it you promised yourself that you would do it
this is a must you must go to the gym
and so you're in this tension you're in this conflict
and it's creating a lot of pain for you and
a lot of times what happens is that you you
simply say you know what I know that I must
but this is just too painful so I won't and
that's what happens that's because you're creating it too much
of a need they're too much of a need so
what you have to really start to learn to do
is to instead of saying that you should or that
you must do it tell yourself that you know what
I don't really need to do it I could do
it so whenever you're procrastinating on right now tell yourself
no you know you don't you don't have to do
it strictly speaking no one's holding a gun to your
head you have choice here you have free choice so
yes even though you understand that it's important to go
to the gym for your health you don't have to
go to the gym you could not go yes there's
going to be natural consequences there but just allow yourself
to get into into that possibility of choices that you
have choices here you don't have to do your taxes
you don't have to have that conversation at work you
don't have to go in there and give that speech
you don't have to go in and ask your client
for more money you don't have to go and make
more sales you don't technically have to go and pay
the bills you don't have to now in a lot
of those cases it would be nice to but just
let yourself get a little bit of release and a
little bit of space in seeing that you do have
choice that doesn't mean that you're not going to have
some negative consequences but just accept that you have choices
in your life and that you could be doing these
things versus you should be doing them that's going to
give you a little bit of relief next is really
allow the feeling of resistance a lot of times when
we're feeling resistance and we're procrastinating the thing that really
is hurting us the most is that feeling that feeling
in our body of being resistant to something it's like
this this tension there and I feel so bad what
you want to do is instead of resisting that resistance
just let yourself feel it allow yourself to feel it
right just like take a couple of deep breaths and
just watch yourself feeling that resistance just by doing that
and allow yourself to feel it you're going to start
to to turn it around and flip it around because
once you stop running away from it it's actually not
as bad as it as you make it out to
be in your mind your movie tends to be much
worse than the reality on the ground it's usually not
as bad in fact doing your taxes as you think
it is it's not as bad going to the gym
as you make it out to be it's not as
bad having that conversation with someone as you think it
is it's usually very catastrophize and exaggerated in your mind
so just kind of allow yourself to feel that resistance
that's going to start you on your way alright the
next thing I'm going to give you is I'm going
to give you a little technique which is a quick
version of the Sedona Method which is very powerful powerful
way to release emotions especially negative emotions that you can
use to unblock yourself from resistance so here's how Sedona
method works and I have other videos that you want
to check out search for them on Sedona Method so
you can find those on actualised organ Sedona Method basically
works like this whatever feeling you have there's like a
three or four step process here so first is your
in some sort of bad mood you're in some sort
of bad feeling and here it's resistance you're procrastinating so
you're resisting let's say going to the gym the first
question that you're asked yourself is you say can I
just allow myself to feel this without running away from
it without resisting it can I just allow myself to
feel this feeling and sure enough you just kind of
allow yourself to feel it okay and you just kind
of let it well up inside of you let yourself
really feel it in your body so once you've got
that you're feeling this resistance to going to the gym
now what you want to do is you want to
ask yourself and you ask yourself silently could I let
this go could I let this feeling go and then
answer you answer yes or no and you can answer
either yes or no if you feel extremely resistant and
you really feel like you can't let it go then
say no if you feel like you can let it
go say yes so could you let it go in
theory let's say yes I could let it go in
theory then you move on to the next question would
you let it go if you can let it go
and you said that you could then would you let
it go and again answer as yes or no would
you want to let it go if you could just
answer yes or no so let's say okay yes I
would let it go if I could then move on
to the third question the last question which is when
would you let it go if you could and again
let's say okay well if I could let it go
and I chose to let it go then I would
want to let it go right now and that's it
you went through the Sedona Method and what you do
is you do that a couple of times you cycle
through it three or four times each time letting that
feeling well up inside of you and then asking yourself
those questions which you'll find even though this seems very
silly and simplistic is that this is an extremely effective
method for dissipating emotions and especially resistance if you run
this method on whatever resistance you have right now to
any problem in your life I guarantee you that you'll
get rid of it within four to ten iterations if
it's a very very strong resistance probably will take ten
iterations of that questioning process if it's a mild resistance
you can probably get rid of it within three or
four iterations so this will only take you five or
ten minutes so extremely effective technique don't dismiss the don't
dismiss it just because of its simplicity all right the
next thing that I'm going to the next technique I'm
going to give you is kind of the reverse of
Sedona and this is a positive Sedona method so here
we were working on letting go of a negative emotion
and now I'm going to ask you to accept a
positive emotion and that is ask yourself this question could
you allow yourself to get excited about this ask yourself
that is it possible for you to get excited about
this activity so going to the gym doing your taxes
having that conversation or anything else is it possible to
get excited just ask yourself and think about it and
answer yes or no and what you'll find is that
yeah there is some way for you get excited come
up with one way what's one little thing you can
do that will make it exciting for you maybe it's
you can get excited about going to the gym and
listening to some nice music while you're there or maybe
you can get excited about having this conversation and in
that conversation maybe sing something positive to the person even
though the conversations generally you think is going to go
negatively say give them a compliment that could be something
that you can get excited about or maybe doing these
taxes you can get excited about something within that tax
process maybe you can get excited about getting a refund
maybe you can get excited about finally having this off
your plate right something find a little thing that you
can get excited about and just feel it let yourself
feel that you're going to start to feel that the
resistance will dissipate as the excitement comes into play the
next thing I want you to do is if you're
really serious about getting rid of this resistance after this
video is done take five to ten minutes sit down
in a quiet place and you're gonna do a visualization
of yourself doing this activity this is huge if you
do this visualization I can almost guarantee that you're going
to bust through the resistance so just sit down close
your eyes put a timer on and visualize yourself doing
the activity especially the beginning part of it the starting
of it so visualize yourself getting off the couch putting
on your tennis shoes changing your clothes getting your car
driving to the gym and getting on that first exercise
whatever that is for you visualize that in vivid detail
and try to visuals visualize yourself being excited about it
you know force that excitement picture yourself being excited what
did it feel like when you were doing that for
the first time works you excited when you went to
the gym for the first time you probably were right
that's why you went and do that with anything else
do that with your taxes picture yourself sitting down at
the computer logging into your accounting software or however you
do it or calling up your your accountant or going
into the accountant office driving in there pulling out the
paperwork going through all the files and starting your taxes
because starting is the hardest part once you begin you're
like you're done it's the starting that's the hard part
the rest of it you're in flow it's easy it
comes naturally so picture yourself visualize for five or ten
minutes getting in to the action really getting into it
and feeling excited about that okay and the final point
that I'm going to make here as we're getting off
the topic of procrastination is I want you to become
a watcher I want you to become an observer of
your procrastination in action without trying to change so what
our natural tendency is is that when we procrastinate we
tend to resist the procrastination because we tend to say
well I shouldn't be procrastinating this is bad I should
change it but then you say to yourself well but
it's so painful I can't change it I'm stuck in
this rut I'm sucking the spiral and it just takes
you lower and lower and lower and lower instead what
I want you to do is when you notice yourself
going down that spirals I want you to just kind
of take a few deep breaths pause and kind of
step outside yourself imagine yourself stepping outside and just kind
of looking at yourself becoming the watcher the observer and
just notice and allow yourself to procrastinate as you're watching
so just allow yourself for example to lie there on
the couch watching television and just observe yourself doing that
and observe yourself procrastinating and not going to the gym
when you know you should and just observe that what
you'll find is as you become the watcher and as
you become conscious of your procrastination your resistance to the
procrastination a lot of it is going to dissipate and
you're going to find yourself just spontaneously getting off the
couch and doing the thing that you want to be
doing the thing that you know is good for you
because when you're consciously aware of something you're not going
to be self sabotaging self-sabotage only happens unconsciously so really
that spotlight of attention of awareness is a subtle but
a very big a very big factor in busting through
that resistance and a procrastination that you've got and then
the last point I'm going to make is baby step
it start small if you've got some sort of big
project to do if you've got a whole book to
write if you've got a big business proposal to create
if you've got a massive presentation a plan if you've
got a lot of tax accounting paperwork to go through
just take that baby step after you've done these visualizations
and you've done this Sedona Method go out there and
take the first little baby step don't even tell yourself
that you gonna do it all just say you know
what I'm going to go to the gym and I'm
just going to go and do one exercise I'm going
to do I'm just going to do one rep I'm
going to do one rep of that bicep curl I'm
going to do just five minutes of the treadmill just
five minutes of the treadmill that I'm going to go
so baby step it and allow yourself to do that
if you need to maybe that first day that you
start your gym regimen again you know just allow yourself
to go to the gym and literally spend five minutes
on that treadmill and do one rep of a bicep
curl and then go back home give yourself that break
and if you're starting your taxes and you're sitting down
to do them allow yourself to just do ten minutes
of tax work and then go back to watching television
that's it start small baby step it then the next
day do another five minutes next day do another five
minutes same thing if you're procrastinating on writing a book
