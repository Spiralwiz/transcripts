hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're doing the enlightenment FAQ part two this is
one part in a multiple part series where I am
answering the most common questions that people have about spiritual
enlightenment so this is part two of the series go
ahead and watch part one of mine Lyman FAQ those
will be some of the preliminary questions and this continues
from that part and we're going to answer a lot
of pretty basic and fundamental questions that are going to
help you to get your mind wrapped around what spiritual
I'm it actually is and disabuse you of some of
the myths and caricatures and bad assumptions and fears that
you might have about pursuing this for real in your
own life so let's go ahead and get started one
really important question is what are the benefits of enlightenment
and it's not quite obvious at first blush what the
benefits are because if you're gonna pursue in Lima you're
gonna invest a lot of time and energy into it
it seems like you would want to do it because
there's some gain for you right what's the value to
you well actually in my first enlightenment video the spiritual
I'm an introduction video spiritual enlightenment intro that's what it's
called there I talked about many of the benefits so
I have a whole list of them there let me
just briefly summarize what the benefits are the real benefits
of enlightenment are that you break free of your mental
prison that you stop being a slave to your thoughts
into your emotions and that you really get a really
deep meaningful tranquility in your life which is something you've
been searching for your whole life without really realizing it
and here you're gonna actually be able to experience this
tranquility regardless of external circumstances so how cool would it
be for you to stay calm and even keeled no
matter what was happening in your life whether good stuff
was happening to you or bad stuff whether you lost
your job or whether you lost a family member or
whether something didn't go the way that you wanted to
go or whether you weren't making the money you wanted
to make whether you didn't get accepted into college or
whether you didn't get that dream career you wanted or
whatever how cool would it be if you could keep
your cool and stay tranquil and calm throughout that without
getting all crazy agitator the way you do now without
having these fits of drama without having these relationship problems
without having these career problems without engaging in all this
neurotic thinking and monkey chatter without getting swept up by
your emotions without having fits of Rage without being frustrated
and annoyed all the time without being lonely and sad
without getting depressed how cool would that be well that's
the primary reason I think that most people pursue enlightenment
one of the other benefits is that you get a
deeper understanding of reality and truth so if for you
truth is a value and you really like understanding what
the hell is going on here in this universe well
understanding how your consciousness works is like the the key
that unlocks at all so it's another really amazing benefit
now it's important to understand here that it's not like
you're going to be ecstatically happy now all the time
in your life and it's not the case that if
you're enlightened that you never have a you know a
moment of sadness or a moment of loneliness or an
emotion of frustration or anger annoyance you can have these
emotions but your relationship to these emotions changes completely so
that these emotions no longer become a source of suffering
but they just become another experience not really any worse
or any better than any other experience and so you
can live your life really truly free without any kind
of obligations another really cool benefit which I talked about
my other video is that you get relief from your
self-image problems and self-image problems are things like shyness lack
of confidence low self-esteem worrying about how you look worrying
about what people think of you trying to impress people
trying to live up to certain people's expectations right that's
a huge category of problems in almost every person's life
so how cool would it be to just wipe all
that away to make it completely irrelevant well you can
do that by getting rid of the self next question
so Leo does this mean that I'll have complete control
of my emotions once I'm enlightened this is a very
interesting question because again let's go back to the truth
here that we're talking about which is the truth of
no self there is no self there is no you
so who is gonna have complete control over his or
her emotions nobody so if you think this is going
to give you control of your emotions then I got
some bad news you have zero control over your emotions
because you do not exist paradoxically encounter intuitively once you
surrender yourself to this fact what happens is that you
get complete peace and calm with your emotions and so
what you get is you get kind of a pseudo
control you get the appearance of control it's as though
you have total control but in fact you have zero
control very paradoxical but also very cool and fascinating how
can this be well the biggest problem and the biggest
reason that you need control over your emotions the reason
that you want control over your emotions is because right
now you're a slave to your emotions so once you
free yourself and you realize that there is no you
who's actually experiencing emotions and there is no you to
control emotions what happens that you just become calm and
cool with whatever emotion is happening it's not the case
that with enlightenment you become emotionless you will have emotions
there will be plenty of emotions in your life but
your relationship to these emotions will change completely and so
people looking at you from the outside will think that
you have complete control over your emotions or if not
complete then you know a lot more than the average
person but in reality what's gonna be happening on the
inside is that you're gonna realize that there is no
me who's experiencing emotions and so therefore everything's cool no
need to get my panties in a twist the way
that other people do the reason that other people suffer
commotion so much is because they believe that there's a
them inside who's being threatened by the external world once
that notion is removed then life flows very very smoothly
next question but Leo what if I'm already happy in
my life so you're telling me that I should pursue
enlightened because it's gonna give me this peace and tranquility
and happiness that I can't get otherwise but I've already
have you have a good life I have a good
family I got a good relationship I got it good
career I've worked real hard on these things I've put
them all together you know I'm happy with my my
health and my fitness and all this stuff well another
bill another bitter pill for you is that actually you're
not happy what you're doing is you're lying to yourself
and you're saying that you're happy but in fact you're
not why is this happening how could this be the
case well the first thing you got to realize is
that even if you're happy right now in the moment
maybe your career and your relationship and everything else in
your life just has come together right now and in
this moment and maybe for the next couple of months
things are gonna be going great and you'll be happy
but see your happiness is contingent upon external circumstance so
if we remove your relationship if we give you a
divorce and if we have you go to the doctor's
office and get some bad health news and if we
have you lose your job and if we have you
lose some money in the stock market right and if
we have you break your leg or whatever all of
a sudden you're not going to be happy you're gonna
be very very miserable and so your happiness is extremely
contingent so you gotta be very careful here about saying
that you're happy because actually whenever someone says this they're
lying to themselves how could I know this I can
know this for a fact because it's not possible to
actually be truly happy without being enlightened so unless you're
enlightened you can't be happy it's not possible it's just
psychologically impossible why because there's a falsehood that you're living
you're telling yourself that you exist when in fact you
don't so happiness is not possible under this paradigm it's
just not and that's actually reflected in your whole history
of existence for your entire life from the point where
you were born to the point where you're gonna die
or from you know today to the point where you
are living now you've never been able to have consistent
true happiness what you've had is you had this rollercoaster
ride right for this very reason is because external circumstances
change all the time so when someone tells me that
they're happy what that is in my mind is like
imagine that someone has tripped and fallen off a cliff
and he's falling to the ground to the jagged rocks
down below and it's like a 5,000 foot drop and
as he's falling he looks at me and he says
look Leo I'm happy look flying it's fun it's fun
to be flying through the air I'm so happy right
now well yes you're happy right now if we take
one snapshot but how happy are you gonna be five
minutes later they're not going to be very happy so
that's basically your current condition in life right now what
you might do to yourself is you might trick your
something you might say to yourself well Leo why don't
I just keep putting more and more good things in
place in my life until everything is perfectly in place
why don't I go just earn lots of money and
then basically everything will be figured out if I own
up a hundred million dollars then it's like no one
can touch me but see that's a that's a delusion
even in that situation you're still not going to be
happy because even if you have 100 million dollars and
you can become quote-unquote untouchable by society you have all
this power and you're able to do whatever you want
in the end you're still gonna have to face disease
and loneliness and uni and everyone dies you'd have to
face death so in the end your life is gonna
end in misery no matter how happy you think that
you are right now so really you're not happy and
even if you think that you're happy right now in
the moment like your life right now is all put
together I Got News for you even there you're lying
to yourself because even if you say that you have
a great relationship and a great career and great health
that's not actually what's happening in your life on a
minute-to-minute hour to hour basis what's happening even if you
have all that stuff in place is that your mind
is driving you nuts you're literally insane in your mind
you're having insane thoughts you're you're sabotaging yourself you're getting
angry at people inside you're getting jealous you're having fear
even if you have everything put together even if you
have a million a hundred million dollars you still have
the fear of losing 100 million dollars you have the
fear of losing your beautiful relationship or losing your kids
or losing your health or losing your life or whatever
else so it's not possible for you to be happy
because you actually believe that if you lose these things
you will be unhappy and so therefore it's not possible
to be happy with that kind of paradigm in place
so you have to get very aware of how the
mind tricks you into a false sense of happiness so
one of the ways that we do enlightenment work is
we first start to realize that oh wait a minute
wait a minute I'm lying to myself all the time
about how well this paradigm this ago with paradigm is
working for me the ego keeps telling me that it's
working well and that I should continue using this paradigm
but if I look really carefully I can actually see
that this paradigm is rotten it's not working if I'm
very honest next question should I stop pursuing my goals
in career in my relationships with my health with my
hobbies should I stop those things and this depends it
depends on why you're pursuing these things so just because
you are pursuing enlightenment or you become enlightened does not
mean that you no longer have any relationships or that
your health now doesn't matter or that you don't need
to have any hobbies or that you don't need to
go to work and have a decent career it doesn't
mean these things again enlightenment is an inner knowing and
a realization it's not any lifestyle per se and it's
not any particular external situation so if you really authentically
want a relationship be in a relationship and if you
authentically want good health go get good health and if
you you know want to live in a house and
be able to pay your electricity bill then you should
probably have a job and if you enjoy some particular
hobby like you like playing basketball on the weekend or
you like sailing or surfing or whatever you know those
are probably fine hobbies the problem here though is that
a lot of people have goals in their career in
their relationships and their health and in their hobbies that
our egoic goals what this means is that you're pursuing
this goal because you think that this goal will make
you truly happy and so you're like kind of like
an addict you're a career addict your relationship addict you're
a health and fitness junkie you're an addict with your
hobbies and you think that that's gonna be your salvation
so if you're pursuing goals for those reasons then those
are the wrong reasons and those you should probably stop
why because you're not going to really make you happy
for one and two because they're an opportunity cost they're
taking away time from your ability to find what will
truly make you happy which is doing the inner mental
development so everyone's gonna have to judge for themselves you
know which goals are authentic and which are not authentic
and this is a very tricky process you don't really
know which goals in your life are authentic and which
ones aren't you might tell yourself that going to the
gym is an authentic goal of yours but you might
discover that actually Oh upon loss of deep reflection the
only reason I'm going to the gym is because I
want my girlfriend to think that I'm hot and that's
because I have this need for upholding my self-image that
I'm this hot ripped dude and that authentically if I
wasn't trying to uphold this self-image of being this hot
rip dude then I probably don't need to go to
the gym so much right that might be just one
example there next question Leo isn't enlightenment dangerous the stuff
you're telling us here isn't it dangerous couldn't it be
kind of eroding the foundations of a happy healthy normal
life well the only danger really is the current it
go up paradigm that you're living under all the evils
in the world where do you think they come from
they don't come from enlightened people they come from selfish
people they come from the egoic paradigm your paradigm and
if you think that somehow you're above Vigo of paradigm
but you're still living the go paradigm you're kidding yourself
so if you think that you're not capable of crime
and theft and rape and murder and genocide and bigotry
and racism and getting angry at people and violence of
different sorts and whatever else all you know all the
things that you think are evil in life if you
think that you're not capable of that well newsflash the
only reason you think that is because right now you're
sitting in a cushy position in life where you're not
being threatened as soon as your ego is threatened sufficiently
you will resort to all those evils all those evils
you think that you wouldn't do well you would do
them under the right circumstances why because fundamentally you believe
that you exist and that you need to be protected
and defended so how do we overcome this by removing
the notion that you exist and that you need to
be defended in fact there is nothing that needs defending
this can be difficult to appreciate right and it can
seem dangerous and threatening to be talking about this because
what we're doing is we're kind of destroying a lot
of your worldviews and a lot of traditional cultural assumptions
and we're destroying a lot of beliefs in this inquiry
it can seem like we're doing a negative process here
by destroying stuff as though this destruction of mental concepts
in your mind is somehow you know eroding the moral
fabric of your being and it's gonna lead to some
sort of nihilism or something like that or it's gonna
make you antisocial or it's gonna turn you into a
serial murderer or someone who's insane in fact know all
of those bad things that's ego paradigm run amok that's
who you presently are but you're just kind of masking
it the Enlightenment paradigm this frees you up from all
that this makes you the least dangerous to yourself and
to everyone around you to society because when you have
nothing to defend and protect you have no need to
go out and hurt people and you have no need
to to commit suicide or to do any of the
other kind of stuff that you would consider you know
dangerous people who are insane or like serial killers stuff
like that these people have monkey chatter in their mind
all the time this is the exact opposite of enlightenment
enlightenment is the silencing of the monkey chatter when the
monkey shredders silenced when you're perfectly calm and present and
happy in the moment who are you gonna bother there's
no one to bother what's the danger there is no
more danger everything is perfectly fine you can easily discover
this in meditation when you're meditating and you're very focused
you can see that this is just a totally peaceful
very innocuous innocent state it's not a dangerous state it's
an innocent state what's telling you that it's dangerous is
the ego why because this is how the ego defends
itself this is a defense mechanism so watch out for
that trap next question Leo isn't enlightenment only for radical
people a certain very small segment of the population and
the answer is no enlightenment is perhaps one of the
most universal things that I've discovered that people ought to
pursue right I can't come up here and say you
must go get married or you must go get a
job that will earn you six figures or you must
go learn how to scuba dive right because those are
all you know particular things that some people might like
and some people might not like actually I feel very
comfortable coming up here and saying you no matter who
you are no matter what culture you live in no
matter what your religion no matter what your scientific background
matter if you're old or if you're young no matter
how much money you make no matter what your family
situation is you should become enlightened now why because this
is one of the most fundamental truths of your existence
is understanding your true nature what is your true nature
your true nature is not what you've been told by
Society your true nature is not this entity that you
think that you are this body or this mind your
true nature is actually nothingness that's your true nature but
you need to go discover this and everyone can discover
anyone with you no normal mental health can discover this
with a normal brain can discover this and everyone should
discover this because if everyone discovered this society would be
treinta completely transformed this would be the biggest shift that
human civilization has experienced in all of its history this
would be more important than the invention of the atomic
bomb or electricity or the computer or the internet or
anything else that we've invented this would be more powerful
because this would change your orientation and the whole world's
orientation towards life this would give you the happiness and
the peace that you really really want so this is
not for radical people if you want to live to
your full potential and if you want to be happy
and peaceful and if you want to know the truth
of your being on a profound level then this is
for you this is not just for monks this is
not just for some crazy hardcore self-help junkies like you
might think I am this is a very desirable thing
because one thing that you can find universally across all
cultures all peoples is that they have monkey chatter in
their mind and they drive themselves crazy with it and
they have emotional neurotic problems and because of this they
can't be happy and everyone basically wants to be happy
the only reason you do anything in your life and
the only reason anyone else does anything in their lives
is because they believe it will make them happy of
course the problem is that most of stuff you do
and most of other people do are not going to
make them happy but they don't realize it yet and
they don't really want to admit this fact so because
kind of happiness is the objective of life this is
for everyone next question leo when I become a tree-hugging
hippy slacker if I start going down this path of
spirituality and enlightenment well you know I'm sensitive to that
myself I don't really identify with hippy new-age thinking in
fact I don't like that subculture I don't really see
myself as a hippy or a tree hugger or whatever
and I don't consider myself a slacker I'm like a
productive person I actually want to go and achieve stuff
in my life but this is a stereotype right this
is a stereotype and in fact hippy tree huggers are
not enlightened slackers are not enlightened if you actually go
and meet a real enlightened person you'll see that they're
not a tree-hugging hippy slacker these people are productive when
they want to be these people are not just coming
up with some new-age theories and singing Kumbaya and going
to some you know retreat in the woods or going
out hugging trees or saving the whales that's not what
in line people generally do so this subculture even though
it seems like it's all spiritual actually it's kind of
like a false spirituality which is actually one of the
things that I don't like about hippies is that I
feel like they're in congruent they live their life in
congruently so you know if a hippie was really living
congruently they would become enlightened and then what would counter-intuitively
happen is that they would drop a lot other hippy
ways because hippies are kind of reacting against a certain
element of society and so what this essence creates another
element and this creates a philosophy and a mindset and
belief systems in a worldview what we're talking about with
enlightenment is wiping that whole thing clean wiping that slate
off clean so that you don't have any of those
you know cultural reactions and you don't have these beliefs
and worldviews it's just calm peaceful neutral so don't worry
about becoming a hippie slacker next question leo but I
enjoy stuff like sex and alcohol and drugs and food
and I enjoy going to work I don't want to
give this up in fact I refuse to give this
stuff this stuff up if the cost of becoming enlightened
is to give all this stuff up then I don't
want to become enlightened it doesn't make sense it's not
worth it the answer to this objection is that none
of these things in and of themselves is wrong or
bad or evil or even anti spiritual or in any
way incompatible with enlightenment again enlightenment is not a particular
lifestyle it's an understanding and realization so after enlightenment you
can still have sex in fact your sex will become
amazing if you choose to have it you can still
consume alcohol and in fact you could appreciate out the
home or you could consume drugs and you will appreciate
drugs more and you're less likely to get addicted to
them you can eat great food and you will appreciate
that food more than you've ever had why because you're
able to stay focused in the moment and you're able
to get rid of the monkey chatter you can go
to work and perform amazingly at work again why because
you no longer worry and doubt and have fear and
need to protect your ego and need to look after
yourself image and you need to think about money and
all this kind of stuff you can just focus I'm
doing great work and you could be more creative too
in your work so none of these things need to
be given up now maybe you will give some of
this stuff up right now if you're a drug addict
probably you'll give that up if you become enlightened if
you're a glutton and you use food as a crutch
and as a source of excitement and stimulation in your
life well maybe you'll stop doing that after you become
enlightened if right now you're a workaholic and the reason
you're workaholic is because you feel like your life is
pointless if you're not a workaholic well maybe you'll stop
being a workaholic and right now if you're addicted to
sex and you want sex all the time or love
in a relationship because you feel like that completes you
and you're basically again addicted to it well maybe you'll
give that up to what enlightenment basically does is it
unhooks you from needing these things so if you engage
in these things in the future you're gonna do it
consciously deliberately because you actually want it and you're gonna
be able to appreciate it much more than you've ever
had an ability to in the past so you don't
really need to give these things up and in fact
sex will continue I don't really recommend that you do
alcohol and drugs those aren't really healthy but you're still
gonna eat and you can go and eat good food
I think you should still work and make a living
in life because you know you need money and resources
to to live in life so those things will still
stay in place most likely in your life the next
question is Balea what about specifically sex alcohol and drugs
aren't these things bad aren't these things evil and what
about for example making money isn't that bad too so
if I become spiritual enlightened will I no longer be
able to engage in these activities well the first question
is why are you so attached to engaging in these
activities right it's for egoic reasons and even if you
think these things are evil you still probably have a
hidden urge to do it you have to really hold
yourself back and maybe you guilt yourself for having some
sex or for doing some drugs when you shouldn't have
or having a drink when you shouldn't have or you
know swindling someone out of some money when you shouldn't
have the fact is that none of these things again
are bad in and of themselves there's nothing wrong with
sex there's nothing evil about sex there's nothing even wrong
with drugs per se there's nothing wrong with alcohol and
there's nothing wrong with making money and in fact I'm
gonna make a really blanket statement which is kind of
outrageous there's nothing wrong with any action that you choose
to do at all there's nothing wrong with any action
the question is why are you doing it what's the
motivation behind it it's always about the motivation when you
get the motivation right when you remove the ego and
you act selflessly without addiction or cleanness then you can
engage in these things and they will be of value
in your life and they won't have all the negative
repercussions that these things generally have you can use drugs
and alcohol in moderation and it'll be fine you could
have amazing enlightened sex you can still make lots of
money after being enlightened if you feel like that's something
that's you know or thuing so don't don't worry about
losing that stuff don't cling to it next question I've
had an Enlightenment experience using drugs or meditation people use
mushrooms or DMT or there's a bunch of other different
types of hallucinogenic type drugs that can induce enlightenment like
experiences and then also people go out and meditate at
retreats and stuff like and do guided meditations and claimed
to have enlightenment experiences so the question is Leo isn't
that it isn't that what you're talking about this is
the truth of no self right well enlightenment is kind
of tricky because what happens when you get on this
journey is that you start to have little think of
it like the clouds on a very cloudy day and
the Sun beams aren't breaking through the clouds but then
all of a sudden the clouds just kind of open
up and there's a little beam of light going right
through the clouds that's kinda like a little moment of
enlightenment but then quickly the clouds come back and close
up and then the light beam goes away so one
of the frustrating things on this journey is that you're
gonna have like many brief tiny fleeting moments of no
self maybe for five seconds here for one second there
for a whole hour here maybe for a whole day
but they're all going to escape you you're not going
to be able to hold on to it what this
is is this is a it's like an expansion of
consciousness your consciousness kind of dilates like a lens on
a camera right kind of zooms in and out well
when the lens dilates up you get this all expansion
and but then it closes back down and falls into
its default state so what I'm really interested here is
not in a temporary expansion of your consciousness I mean
that's cool and if you can get that that's great
but I'm more interested in a permanent removing of the
clouds what I really mean when I say enlightenment is
the clouds are completely gone and you've just got light
shining all the time and you're not trying anymore you're
not holding on to something you're not struggling to make
it work you don't even have to meditate anymore you're
permanently enlightened this is possible this is a real state
thousands of people have achieved this state so it can
be done any normal human being as far as we
know can do it with enough work but it takes
quite a bit of work in Maya Ridge video I
said it takes about a thousand hours I should kind
of like a ballpark you know a thousand hours of
work maybe more maybe less so generally speaking a drug
will never give you permanent enlightenment I don't really know
of any people who have become permanently enlightened off of
drugs the best the drug can do is give you
a little brief a couple of hours of enlightenment light
experience so it's not really helpful meditation meditation is more
helpful meditation is very good I recommend you start doing
a lot of meditation and if you're starting to experience
more and more enlightenment like experiences with meditation that's great
but don't just stop because you think you've made it
you haven't made it yet so keep meditating until you
get the real permanent deal and don't assume that just
because you've had a little experience with drugs or a
little experience of meditation that you know what enlightenment is
gonna be like because I'm guessing it'll probably turn out
very different than you expect in the end the next
question Leah what about my friends and family after enlightenment
what's gonna happen to them so the reason people ask
this question is because friends and family are very important
for many people a top value for many people is
family and of course people worry about well if I
become enlightened well I would just like abandon my family
now well I abandoned my friends what's gonna happen there
am I not gonna care about them anymore because I'm
so detached from everything and the answer is that again
it all depends a lot of people have very dysfunctional
family than friends so if you're hanging around you know
in a gang got a bunch of horrible friends and
then you become enlightened yeah you'll probably abandon those friends
because they weren't very healthy and now you guys don't
have much in common but there's nothing again inherently wrong
with family or with friends so if you've got a
good family and your family brings you authentic joy and
if you've got good friends and they bring you authentic
joy then you'll probably keep them and in fact your
relationships with them will improve because a lot of people
have dysfunctional family and friends not because those people are
dysfunctional but it's more because you have buttons that those
people push and it's because your ego is involved in
these relationships when you take the ego out of the
relationships even if you have you know a dysfunctional family
member or one dysfunctional friend it's not gonna bother you
anymore you're gonna be able to have compassion for them
and be kind to them you're not gonna need to
be mean to them also if you're in some sort
of relationship with someone one of the things an alignment
will do is it'll make you independent of that relationship
so if the relationship serves you you'll stay in the
relationship if the relationship becomes toxic or it stops serving
you you're not gonna have any hesitation walking away from
that relationship now some needy people will latch on to
this point and say well Leo this makes me some
cold-hearted monster I don't want to become this way see
actually right now the way that you're living is very
unhealthy if you live this way this is what neediness
does it produces a toxic attachment so the toxic attachments
that you might have now those will be cut but
that's something that you want that's a really good thing
it's not a bad thing in general I think that
your friends and your relationship will be significantly amplified and
improved with enlightenment next question Leo what about love how
does love plain to all this love is a really
deep concept which I want to shoot a whole video
on at some point when I uh when I'm ready
to talk about it but the thing I'll say about
love here is that what you call love right now
is not true love you don't really have an experience
of true love what you have is you have a
go at glove and a lot of people hate to
hear it put this way but this is true it's
another bitter pill to swallow what you call love now
whether it's Eve in your most sacred relationship or even
with a relationship that you consider just like a blood
bond like with your family with your children with your
mother or father this is still a Goa Club you
love those people but you only really love them on
your terms and so what this usually means is that
you try to change those people you try to manipulate
those people in subtle ways to make sure that you're
getting the love that you want it's a selfish love
yes you love them but really the reason you love
them is because it serves you in some sneaky underhanded
way that you don't like to admit if you want
real true love what you have to do is you
have to break down the ego without the ego you
can love everything as much as you right now love
yourself imagine how kind you would be to your family
your friends and your intimate partner and even people in
general if you honestly believed that this body here is
not separate from that body over there that there literally
one in the same thing that they're all one thing
this is the true meaning of the Golden Rule right
you know the golden rule the golden rule says do
unto others as you would do onto yourself well you
can't do that when you actually believe that you are
here and everyone else is separate in out there you
can only truly live the golden rule when you actually
believe that I'm here and I'm there and I'm there
and I'm everywhere so I treat everything as though it's
me and so I'm kind and compassionate and loving towards
everything so that's what real love is almost no one
knows this practically because of their unenlightened state so if
you really care about true love well you should definitely
want to become enlightened next question leo you're talking about
all this stuff and I've just been doing regular personal
development I've been following your regular videos and now this
is all very confusing for me and this is creating
a lot of doubts in me about my life and
my goals and my ambitions and maybe even my relationships
and maybe even in my business a lot of doubts
now I used to be very confident and I was
you know getting more and more confidence I was watching
your videos and now it seems like you you've cut
the legs out from under me well yeah in a
sense that's exactly what we're doing here right because enlightenment
is not about building up more of your ego is
about cutting out the ego and this is gonna feel
threatening it's gonna feel emotionally disturbing to you it's not
going to be pleasant this is why so few people
are enlightened is because this is not a pleasant process
this is a scary process one of the things that
your mind wants at all times is certainty and clarity
certainty and clarity your mind hates being confused and uncertain
it hates to doubt itself but you need to get
comfortable with uncertainty because what enlightenment is in linemen is
not ultimate certainty it's actually getting comfortable with ultimate uncertainty
it's not about clinging to some truth it's actually about
realizing that the truth is that there's nothing to cling
to and that there is no truth the truth of
no truth again very paradoxical and fascinating how this works
so if you're doubting yourself good I want you to
be doubting yourself stop trying to be certain all the
time the problem with most people is that they're too
certain and that they're too afraid of getting confused once
in a while and that they're too afraid of questioning
their own worldviews this is good stuff this is what
an intelligent open-minded intellectually honest being does is purposefully put
himself into situations where he doubts himself because he knows
that this is healthy this is building him up not
tearing him down next question leo isn't it better to
hold off on this enlightenment journey until I'm older so
like right now I'm in my 20s or in my
30s wouldn't it be better to just spend the first
half of my life doing all this cool fun stuff
putting my life together building a business having sex and
going to relationships and all this stuff traveling the world
and then when I'm like 50 or 60 or 70
when I'm retired then I can do this in live
and stuff and the answer is no right you're procrastinating
your ego is procrastinating why is it not better to
put it off well because what do you want in
your life do you want happiness or do you want
suffering that's the fundamental question if you want happiness and
peace then you want enlightenment soon or not later why
would you put off a great thing we've talked about
all these cool benefits that you get why would you
want to put that off right the longer you put
it off basically the more suffering you're gonna have in
your life so it's like you're saying okay Leo wouldn't
it be better to spend the next 20 years suffering
and then only when I retire I'll finally be happy
that's basically what you're saying the truth is that your
life will be so much more rewarding and fulfilling and
better if you become enlightened sooner rather than later in
fact one of the things that many people report after
becoming enlightened is that this is the most positive experience
that's ever happened to them in their lives and that
they're sad that it didn't happen earlier they wish that
it happened earlier in their life you know some people
become enlightened in their 40s and their 50s but then
they have very bad experiences in their 20s and 30s
because they're just emotionally all over the place there's monkey
chatter going around right this goes back to the earlier
question of are you truly happy and the answer is
that you're not so don't put off true happiness for
another ten years go get it now the next objection
someone might say something like this alright Leo I've heard
on enough of this nonsense [ __ ] all this
nonsense I'm just gonna go and have my normal life
I just want to live a normal life and you
know what if you want to do that go ahead
and do that I'm not here to really force you
to do anything that you don't want to do and
in fact no one can force you to become enlightened
you're gonna have to work really really really hard at
it one or two of my videos isn't gonna do
it so if you really feel that way go off
and do it but realize that the reality of what
you're saying there is that you're closing your mind down
you don't want to do a self honest inquiry you're
being lazy you don't want to really put the work
and effort into this process realize also that you're committing
yourself to a life of suffering mental and emotional suffering
realize also that your life is gonna end in a
very bitter way no matter how successful you are in
the end you're gonna die and you're gonna have diseases
you're gonna have bad relationship all this I was gonna
happen is going to disturb you a lot it's going
to distribute a lot right so this thing that you
call a normal life well normal is a very bad
standard the normal life is really a crazy dysfunctional life
even what you call a normal successful life that's still
a very dysfunctional neurotic miserable life so if you're not
buying into all this stuff and I think it's silly
anything it's nonsense you think it's religion and mysticism and
whatever and you think it's all hippy [ __ ]
it can seem that way on the surface when you
first start right what you're really saying when you say
this is that you're at the lower stages of your
development and that you haven't gone to the higher stages
yet so maybe you need to go off and just
you know do some stupid stuff in your life waste
10 20 years and get yourself to the point where
psych finally you say oh okay this is not working
let me now swing my pendulum towards the spiritual end
and that might be a necessary step for you right
so then you know go do that if you need
to but hopefully you could have the wisdom to short-circuit
all that nonsense save yourself a couple of decades and
get to a good life not a normal life but
a good life much sooner than you think is possible
next question but Leo are you yourself not enlightened and
if you're not how can you be talking about all
this enlightenment stuff aren't you being a hypocrite how do
you actually know what if you're wrong on this the
answer is that I'm not enlightened right now but I've
been on this journey now for mmm about two years
really heavy for one year and the reason that I
feel like I can talk about this stuff I don't
feel fully qualified to like be your guru and tell
you all the stuff about enlightenment because I still have
a lot to learn right and for myself I'm very
humble with myself about what I think I know about
enlightenment even though it might sound like I'm up here
and I'm being very confident and I'm telling you all
this stuff as those you know set in stone in
fact it's not set in stone there's stuff that I
get wrong there's mistakes I can make there's revisions that
I'm always making my mind there's a lot that I'm
learning and this is gonna continue even after enlightenment because
enlightenment is a long journey even after enlightenment there's still
more to to discover about consciousness but the reason that
I feel like I have some valuable information to give
you here is because I've gone through the initial early
stages the fight the resistance to this idea of enlightenment
like said the journey is like this progression right this
expansion of consciousness this growing this development now I'm still
early enough in the process that I'm no master and
there are many people out there that are you know
much more enlightened than I am and know this stuff
much better but I think one of the benefits that
I can give to you is that actually I'm like
a normal person that you can identify with right I'm
not some hippie I'm not some spiritual guru I'm not
some Indian yogi who you know meditates in the woods
for 10 hours a day I'm not a Buddhist monk
I'm not the Dalai Lama I'm not some religious leader
and I'm not some Zen master and in a sense
you might say well those people are you know more
knowledgeable about this stuff yes but also you know those
people bring their own perspective to it and that perspective
is probably very incongruent with the way that you presently
live your life you probably live a much more normal
kind of social existence the kind of existence that I
live and you probably resonate with the fact that someone
is going through this journey and the fact is that
I am like three steps ahead of you right so
I can point you to the traps that are going
to be there so I know for example a lot
of these questions so a lot of these questions in
FAQ that I'm answering these are all questions that I
had to struggle through so when you're struggling through them
I have to struggle through them too it's not like
this was all easy for me and I just knew
it all every one of these questions I struggled through
and some of these I still struggle with so it's
not like I'm here just making this stuff up what's
really fascinating about personal development is that when you start
growing and going up in this in this chain of
you know this staircase ladder that you're going up and
you're ascending to higher levels and you're transcending and releasing
old levels is that once you move to the next
level all the other levels suddenly make so much sense
and it's so clear to you when you look backwards
on your life and the lives of people around you
who haven't advanced yet you know why they're stuck and
so for me that's that's clear with with a lot
of you who are just kind of starting this journey
now if you're very advanced then maybe you want to
go to some a very advanced teacher but if you're
starting off and also you like the kind of uttering
no-nonsense non-mystical non-religious somewhat of a logical and scientific approach
to enlightenment that can be rare to find in teachers
so that's personally kind of like my own bias my
own perspective that I'm bringing to it so that might
resonate with you more than it does then other teachers
might resonate with you and ask for this objection that
I might be wrong about this whole thing well you
know an intelligent person has to always leave open the
possibility that he might be wrong about any thing he
says or anything he believes or anything he he advocates
gives advice to other people on so I always leave
the possibilities open that I could be wrong in any
of my videos I don't like come out there and
say it every time but I always leave that possibility
open in my mind and I'm always revising my worldview
right I'm always growing there's videos that I've shot six
months ago a year ago that now in my mind
like I've advanced so much further that it really in
my mind I need to go and reshoot those videos
one of the problems I have with YouTube is that
they don't allow me to actually replace old videos I
have to like reupload a whole new video and then
you know that creates duplicate video so there's like I've
kind of a problem there but if I could I
would actually go back and reshoot many of my older
videos so that they're now they're more accurate more true
than they were six months ago even one month ago
right so I'm growing all the time and the same
is true with indictment videos so if you really want
to kind of like stay on the cutting edge then
keep watching the newer videos because they're becoming more and
more accurate not perfectly accurate and yes I could be
technically wrong about this enlightenment as I could be with
any advice that I give you whenever I'm talking about
an online meant topic and you know what the same
is true for anyone that you listen to know no
matter who you listen to whether it's a scientist a
religious person the Dalai Lama or the Buddha himself or
whatever they could always be wrong so that's just a
fact of life and a fact of communication so we
have to deal with that right I don't want you
to just like believe me on blind faith here that's
not what I'm asking you to do I'm asking you
to use your own intelligence your own rational faculties to
think about all this stuff very critically but also very
self Ilana slate not just with monkey chatter and ego
defenses and to start to piece it together yourself and
actually go out and prove it to yourself this is
not a belief system here this is not a philosophy
this is something that you go out and you actually
achieve you achieve it and that's how you know that
it's real so if I do end up being wrong
about this I'll be sure to tell you if that's
the that's the best promise that I can make you
on this point all right so that's all the questions
for now I'm gonna have another part to this series
