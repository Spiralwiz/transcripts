understanding libertarianism and freedom this episode is going to be
an advanced deconstruction of the ideology of libertarianism and that
is a very important first point is that libertarianism is
an ideology and it suffers from many of the same
problems that any ideology suffers from we'll be talking about
that a lot more as we go here warning to
any of you libertarians in the audience this is going
to hurt your ideology will get savaged and completely destroyed
here but there is a silver lining in that if
you stop being ideological just stop and decide to actually
think through your worldview with an open mind and this
takes a lot of open-mindedness to understand some of the
advanced points that I'll be presenting here this will transform
you it will not only transform your ideas naive ideas
about community society and government and politics but perhaps even
more importantly than that it will transform your view of
mankind and your relationship and role within humanity and society
because your current worldview you're a libertarian worldview is holding
you back from a deeper understanding of reality and achieving
higher levels of development for yourself personally so this issue
goes please understand it goes way beyond politics I've spent
a few years now studying carefully especially American politics studying
all the stuff that's been going on trying to dissect
and deconstruct it from a from a sort of a
higher perspective mmm from an existential metaphysical epistemological perspective to
see what what the confusion is about and I've watched
a lot of debates about with libertarians arguing for their
worldview I've listened to many many many of their points
and over the time as I was listening to it
I was compiling a list of all the errors that
they're making metaphysically epistemologically spiritually and so forth which is
creating problems in their worldview that's getting I'm stuck and
so this is a this is a very popular ideology
that's in vogue these days you just absorb it from
your culture if you grew up in America or other
places like that and you don't know that you've absorbed
this ideology becomes like a virus that gets lodged in
your mind and it starts to metastasize like a cancer
and it creates a lot of collective problems but it
also holds you back personally individually so we'll be addressing
all of that my critiques here of libertarianism I want
to understand they're not coming from an ideological place the
way that many critiques that you might find on YouTube
are this is a very sophisticated analysis it's going to
be bringing in advanced concepts from various fields from spirituality
to non duality to metaphysics to epistemology to moral philosophy
and so forth you probably have not heard this level
of depth of analysis about libertarianism or even society or
government ever in your life and you probably won't find
it anywhere else on YouTube or on the Internet so
just you know appreciate what's what's here if you can
stick with me for the next two hours your whole
view of reality will change if you're a libertarian so
let's begin at the very beginning let's kind of ground
our conversation here what are we talking about what is
libertarianism here's a quote to get us started from Wikipedia
quote libertarianism is a political philosophy and movement that upholds
Liberty as a core principle libertarians seek to maximize political
freedom and autonomy emphasizing individualism freedom of choice and voluntary
Association libertarians share a skepticism of Authority and state power
but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to
the existing economic and political systems and quote that's a
very good starting point of course it's rather vague but
we get to see a little bit of what what's
going on here and of course it's important to to
note that not all libertarians are the same there's there's
diversity in their perspectives some are really anti-government Celler only
mildly anti-government so we'll be covering the full range he
but even though libertarians especially like to cite that all
my libertarianism is different from some other libertarianism maybe it's
not so different there are some core pillars that I've
identified by listening to a lot of libertarians debate and
argue their points which sort of form the core or
the heart of their worldview so here are these pillars
most libertarians believe whether explicitly but especially implicitly that freedom
is an absolute good they sort of treat freedom as
the ultimate goal to maximize freedom at all cost they
also generally tend to think that taxation is immoral or
they just say outright a taxation is theft they also
are big on personal responsibility fundamentally they believe that personal
responsibility is what will solve most of society's problems and
that if something is wrong in society it's usually because
there's a lack of personal responsibility people make bad choices
and then of course yeah they have to they have
to reap what they sow and live with their consequences
so for example a libertarian might believe that well did
you get cancer but you didn't have health insurance in
America for example well whose whose fault is that is
that our entire collective systems fault the government's fault or
is it your fault for not getting a good job
with health insurance that covered you because you should have
you should have foreseen that you would might have gotten
cancer and so therefore it's your fault and so tough
tough luck if you get cancer you don't have health
insurance yeah you might die but that's because you didn't
take personal responsibility and that's correct that's how society should
work that's what they believe they also tend to believe
that individualism is good while collectivism is bad it's all
about individual freedom individual responsibility individual rights individualism and that
if we're selling any of that out to collectivism that's
somehow wrong it is an infringement upon my individual freedoms
who are you to tell me that I'm supposed to
sacrifice for some collective when really we're all just individuals
they also tend to believe that the free market this
very special notion in their worldview called the free market
it plays a pivotal role in their worldview they believe
that this will solve all of social problems or most
social problems can be solved by the free market so
if we just stop interfering with the free market which
is what they think government is doing if we just
stop interfering and we let the free market play out
naturally without any manipulation then that will result in the
best possible society the least oppression and the most freedom
for everybody and the most moral outcome they believe that
this special term they like to use monopoly of force
or the use of force is inherently immoral monopoly of
force here means that well basically your government has a
monopoly of force in the sense that they control the
military they control the police and they will use these
physical instruments of force to coerce you to follow the
laws to pay the taxes and so forth and since
really as an individual we can't fight against that in
a certain sense we've been enslaved by our government by
this idea of monopoly of force and the libertarian views
such as they have a view like this where they
say that any situation in which you come to me
and you try to force me to do something as
inherently immoral like if I have a farm and you
come to my farm you try to force me to
give you give you half of my crop as tax
or you try to take part of my plot of
land for yourself you know something like this like you
try to steal something from my property you try to
maybe rape my children this would be a use of
force is inherently immoral and shouldn't exist libertarians generally speaking
are very moralistic they tend to have a strong sense
of morality and their sense of morality is not relativistic
but Objectivist in the sense that they think that there
are clear rights and wrongs in the world that are
inherently part of I guess the fabric of the universe
where things like war theft maybe genocide slavery rape these
are immoral and absolute wrongs that these are universals we'll
talk a lot more about that in a moment they
also have a strong notion of natural rights and personal
property rights they tend to believe that these are just
inherent like when mankind was living in the pre civilization
era hmm in a more simpler time people had personal
property rights and those could be respected basically generally speaking
we could know you know this is my plot of
land that's your plot of land and there are certain
natural rights that we have for example the natural life
the right to life the natural right to not get
tortured the natural right to be able to raise a
family and to not get you know our house robbed
and these sorts of things they tend to believe that
regulations are bad because they infringe upon freedom and that
society will be better by removing all these needless bureaucratic
regulations that are just getting so overblown today with big
government speaking of which they generally think that small government
is better than big government and so anything big government
they basically don't like because fundamentally they think like this
government can get very corrupt and the bigger the government
gets the more corrupt it gets so of course we
want to reduce that to make it smaller they tend
to really be champions of free speech and they tend
to want unlimited free speech as much as possible the
less regulation the better because supposedly the idea is that
it's okay to have unlimited free speech because we've got
a marketplace this free more of ideas and philosophies and
so what will happen is just naturally people will come
out into the public forum they will discuss various philosophies
and belief systems and eventually the best ones through some
evolutionary market process will win out and all the bad
ones will wither on the vine and in general I've
noticed that libertarians tend to be very principled and idealistic
and moreso principled than philosophical than they are utilitarian or
pragmatic so rather than asking the question of like okay
how do we create the best government and then try
to get find some answers by like reading some books
or actually doing some some tests in the real world
that sort of stuff rather than doing that they tend
to adopt ideals and principles of freedom and morality and
so forth and then they kind of recent backwards from
that to say okay so if that is the ultimate
objective those are the ultimate principles that's my worldview then
what kind of government will that sort of result in
that fits my ideals that's how that they did I
think so those are the core principles we'll be addressing
all of these in great detail but I guess it
should go without saying but these principles are the whole
the whole world view it's a world view of libertarianism
is immature it's juvenile it's naive it's arrogant it's entitled
it's a historical it's utopian it's self biased its ideological
it's got an inherent masculine bias to it which is
why you don't find as many female libertarians as male
libertarians and usually these male libertarians also tend to be
sort of on the younger side they tend to be
white more than minorities and there's there's important reasons for
that which we'll get to and fundamentally libertarians sin to
be selfish there's a fundamental profound misunderstanding of how government
society and community works which is what we'll be discussing
today so if you're not a libertarian this is still
very valuable for you because actually what we're talking about
here is not libertarianism per se we're talking about a
deep understanding of what community is what is community what
makes community work at this this seems like a sort
of a simple question but it's not so simple at
all it's very complicated it's very counterintuitive it's tricky so
we have to be very open minded about investigating how
community works we can't come into this saying like well
I already know how it all works no how does
it really work what are all the nuances and I
guess to reach a hand out to you libertarians because
I empathize with you you know sometimes I'm kind of
snarky and I will talk [ __ ] about your
worldview but on the other hand I understand where you're
coming from I totally understand your worldview I understand its
appeal given your stage of development and consciousness and you
know I understand that because when I was maybe 15
or 18 years old and that in that range late
high school early college I had a libertarian streak to
me as well I was very rebellious very independence didn't
like to follow Authority why don't you just be left
alone didn't really care about collectivist issues or you know
community resource I think I was just sort of a
loner doing my own thing and I just kind of
wanted wanted a political philosophy that just reflected my sort
of sense of individuality in the world like don't don't
intrude on what I'm doing let let everybody just do
what they want to do what's wrong with that but
I quickly I quickly outgrew that worldview once I started
to you know study deeper these issues and it might
surprise you but ironically if you know they have that
political compass where they have like two axes one going
up and down one going left and right one of
the axes represents basically authoritarianism versus libertarianism and then the
other axis represents what does it represent I forget is
it like economic values or some like that anyways so
on on that compass I took the test not that
long ago and I came out my my libertarian score
is very high now of course that's sort of a
different different definition of what libertarian means but like in
general I'm very Pro individual freedoms that's very so I'm
not completely discounting that and I'm not some authoritarian here
who's sitting here arguing for some tyrannical or a monarch
achill style of government I think that for example what's
what's going on in China and in Russia sort of
the dictatorial and authoritarian tendencies in those countries and in
Brazil and other places around the world right now that
that's a very problematic and it's unsustainable so that's not
what I'm out arguing for so just be careful not
to immediately dismiss my critiques simply because you feel threatened
that this you know contradicts your worldview and also I
should point out that many of the points that I'll
be making here will also apply to anarchism that's also
a that's also one of those ideologies that can be
aligned with libertarianism or it can be separate you know
it varies their right-wing versions of anarchism their left-wing versions
of anarchism but anarchists are also generally sort of on
this idea that well if we just if if we
get rid of the state if we minimize the government
then we can live in a more in a more
sort of peaceful flat hierarchy community which will be more
like in in tune with nature and all this sort
of stuff oh yeah I remembered so on that political
compass up and down was like libertarianism and then left
and right was actually yeah just left left and right
whether you're liberal or conservative so I I've use just
to be clear I'm very liberal and I'm also very
libertarian both I fall into that quadrant but anyways here
we go so point number one and this is perhaps
the most important point and this is actually something that
you will benefit from even if you have no interest
in politics or libertarianism is freedom what is freedom libertarians
fundamentally misunderstand freedom and not just libertarians but many others
as well fundamentally misunderstand freedom freedom you need to understand
this is now we're getting to the actual metaphysics of
freedom this is deep stuff right off the bat so
brace yourself the metaphysics of freedom see most people have
never actually bothered to sit down and to contemplate and
think deeply about what freedom is what they've done is
they've gotten some ideas from external sources some viruses that
are done suck in their minds an ideology about freedom
and they have developed a sort of myth of what
freedom is true freedom is an extremely radical thing and
it is not some absolute good at least not from
the perspective of a life form or an individual human
what is freedom in its most abstract sense its complete
lack of limitation of any kind going even further when
we get to the actual substance of reality itself to
the sort of to the molecular level you might say
freedom at this level is actually it's a freedom from
form even so what I'm saying is that to be
totally free you have to be completely unlimited in every
possible way you can't be any particular way that's the
cost there's an existential trade-off here between degrees of freedom
and having any kind of material concrete existence whatsoever think
about this for a cat to be a cat it
has to be a cat and it can't be a
dog or a lion or a human or a kangaroo
or an alien or a rock or a tree or
something else you might say well Gallio that's obvious so
what yeah wait a minute really think this through not
so what what that means is is that if you
want to incarnate as a cat you're committed to the
limitations of that form so cat has four legs the
cat has a certain size it has a tail it
has eyes it has ears all of these are limitations
there of course there are also possibilities because the ears
can pick up certain sounds the eyes can pick up
certain frequencies of light radiation the legs can allow the
cat to jump to certain heights the tail can allow
it to you know balance while it's running and many
other things like this so there's always trade-offs though when
you have a form a particular form of a cat
a cat can't fly a cat can't dive underwater a
cat can't do calculus there's a million things that a
cat can't do and yet of course you can you
can say well let's remove some of those restrictions okay
well we'll remove some of those restrictions and we'll turn
the cat into a human okay so now it seems
like well does that give to the cat more ability
if it's a human now well of course if you
turn a cat into a human now you completely forget
that it was even a cat it's just a human
okay it's a human but then human has its own
limitations a human can't jump as high as a cat
human doesn't have fur so it gets called more easily
outside in the winter time than a cat would a
human can't meow like a cat a human doesn't have
a sensitive smell as a cat maybe not as sensitive
ears as a cat and many other things but of
course humans have many other great opportunities we might have
better color vision we have bigger brains we can do
math we can do all sorts of interesting things that
cats can't do so who's better is a human better
than cat well of course not it's their different trade-offs
here so what I want you to notice that every
form has its own trade-offs and you know a form
is anything it doesn't have to be an animal doesn't
have to be a sentient being it could be a
rock it can be a tree it could be a
car it doesn't matter but whatever it is it's got
its limits now you say okay but I want freedom
I want total freedom because this is what the libertarian
is sort of fooling himself into thinking that he wants
total absolute freedom because absolute freedom is an absolute good
well but do you realize what that means absolute freedom
means that you have no form whatsoever because if you're
a cat you're limited if you're a human you're limited
if you're a rock you're limited if you're a car
you're limited if you're the earth you're limited if you're
the entire universe you're still limited the only truly unlimited
thing is emptiness or form I mean emptiness or formlessness
this is otherwise known as pure consciousness or infinity absolute
infinity such a thing does exist believe it or not
in fact it is the thing which is aware of
everything in your experience it is your ultimate fundamental nature
but this is not conducive to survival as a living
being when we're talking about the domain of politics we're
talking about survival community is about collective survival and your
individual life is about individual survival these are relative concerns
which are separate from from the absolute at least for
the sake of our discussion here so what needs to
be understood about freedom is that freedom will kill you
if you get it in the absolute form if you
could press a button right now and this button will
give you absolute freedom and you are stupid enough to
press that button you have to realize you're gonna be
dead you're gonna be gone you're gonna you're gonna turn
into a into a cloud of vapor and even that
will dematerialize and it'll just you'll be pure nothing there
will be nothing left there will not be society there
will not be your body don't that be your mind
there will not be a planet there will not be
a universe there will be nothing that's absolute freedom now
if you want something to exist something material then we're
gonna talk about limitation and now everything that we're talking
about is gonna be within the domain of limitation the
only question will be what kind of limitations what are
the trade-offs and consequences of different choices in limitation that
we decide upon so if you want to exist as
a human you're committing yourself to a certain set of
limitations if you want to live in a certain society
that allows for certain things to happen like it has
roads it has bridges it has an electrical grid those
are all limitations and we have to to work with
those limitations so see freedom is very counterintuitive deeply counterintuitive
because when you allow for total freedom let's now talk
about not in the absolute sense but total freedom within
within the limited material world and we're gonna be talking
about here planet Earth and the humans that live on
it so let's let's rewind the clock to maybe ten
or a hundred thousand years ago where most humans were
just living out in the forests in the wilderness by
themselves in small tribes and you say okay yeah they
were free everybody was free back then that's sort of
the myth of freedom but again be very careful here
what freedom means in this context is that when you
have freedom freedom doesn't just mean that you're gonna get
all the good stuff that you want freedom means that
others are also free to do what they want to
do so you see the problem here we have different
agents in the world we have you we have me
we have others they're all agents all these agents humans
they have their own ideas opinions world views and they
have their own survival needs they're surviving in different ways
depending on what they need for their survival now of
course we share certain things in common like food water
air that we need and so forth but even with
food you know we have different we have different needs
as far as what kind of food we need certain
people will dive with certain kind of food that others
won't so when you have all these different agents here
is sort of the crux of the problem of government
is how do you get all these agents to work
together peacefully so that it doesn't turn into total barbarism
and devilry how because each one of them has their
own opinion about how they should live their life and
how others should live their life see it's not just
that I have my own opinions about how I should
live my life no no it goes way beyond beyond
that I have opinions about how my children should live
their life I have opinions about how my family should
live their by life I have opinions about how women
should live their life how men should live their life
how gay people should live their life or maybe they
shouldn't even exist maybe that's my opinion how black people
should live their life or white people or what Asian
people or whatever and so see it's not it's not
just that we're we're just you know controlling our own
behavior but then we have expectations for how we want
others to behave as well and we try to boss
them around and when they don't behave the way we
want them to be was hey stop you're not doing
what I want you to do but you see the
problem we're already starting getting to the problem of relativity
which we'll be discussing in great detail in a minute
here but uh the the relativity here is that I
want you to do things my way and you want
me to do things your way so how do we
adjudicate which way things should be done who's to say
which is the right way to do things this is
precisely why libertarians need to rely very strongly on a
notion of objective morality they need that notion so they
can appeal to it to say I leo yes maybe
you're right but there's this universal overarching set of mortals
that all of us generally agree to and should obey
such as don't kill other people with unless it's in
self-defense don't don't take any aggressive action don't force people
to do things don't steal their property don't rape their
children and so forth we can all agree on that
that's kind of how they think but the problem of
course is that we can't agree on that if we
could agree on that then government would be so easy
and then libertarians might be right then we could live
in a very flat hierarchy with the little government and
things would work pretty well because we all are on
the same page but we're not all on the same
page that's the problem and we'll get into that in
a minute here in more detail the morality and the
relativity of how this works because I know you libertarians
are really really sensitive about this point when I bring
up and start to question your moral system the objectivity
of it and start to imply that morality might be
relativistic this this is a no-go zone for you because
this is this is the attacking the very heart and
foundation of your worldview and so you're gonna be extremely
resistant to what I'm saying here just I urge you
to keep an open mind because you are wrong about
this and if you just keep an open mind I
will be able to show you why you're wrong you
are wrong but in the mean time you're not gonna
want to hear it so just be careful how your
mom your own mind kind of has its biases and
preferences and discounts what I say so here's what you
got I've said about freedom freedom is the freedom to
oppress people that's what freedom means if I am totally
free that means I am free to kill you to
enslave you to steal your stuff to rape you did
you genocide on your people and to do whatever I
want that's freedom be careful here because your mind is
gonna want to deny this because your mind has construed
freedom as something that's good and positive it's an absolute
good so now when I tell you that freedom also
includes the freedom to oppress others now you're you're caught
in this cognitive dissonance situation where on the one hand
you know freedom is an absolute good but on the
other hand here I am telling you that all this
bad stuff comes from freedom how can this be so
surely Leo must be wrong because freedom is an absolute
good we've all been taught that right well here's where
you have to stop parroting what you've been taught and
you have to start to question ideas in your mind
where do they come from are they really true is
freedom really an absolute good if you contemplate just even
for a little bit about freedom it's quite obvious it's
obvious as day that true freedom means not just my
freedom to do good stuff like raise a family and
run a business and have a farm and own property
know this it means oppression I get to oppress you
I get to enslave you of course so do you
to me I'm not saying that I'm the only one
who has these freedoms if we're talking about true freedom
that means I have this freedom and you have this
freedom so then you see the problem who's gonna win
out are my freedoms gonna trump your freedoms or are
your freedoms gonna trump my freedoms what happens when two
different agents sentient agents with different survival agendas different world
views come together and now they're in conflict because their
freedoms are now interpenetrating and interfering with one another how
is that situation going to be handled that's what I
really want to press Q to contemplate as a libertarian
those are the really tricky edge cases upon which all
of government is built it's easy to talk about absolute
freedom when people are living far away from each other
somewhere in the rural countryside where each one of us
has a you know 100 acre plantation we raise our
family on it we rarely see other people we don't
have neighbors or if we do have neighbors our neighbors
look like us same race say same ethnicity same general
worldview same moral system same religion same ethical code all
this sorts of stuff and we get along and there's
basic trade and this sort of stuff happens and it's
sort of peaceful you kind of imagine this sort of
you know ideal ik mode of human existence but anywhere
in the history of mankind where there was such a
mode of existence there was also oppression there was also
those people who didn't agree with those moral systems there
were people who are different from outside who might want
to come in and pillage your farmland take your land
take your crops take your children take your wife rape
them enslave them force you to work for them tax
you every every season and so on and now here
for the libertarian says well leo of course I'm not
stupid I understand that of course human history had a
lot of this kind of oppressiveness in it which is
precisely why we as libertarians believe that that's immoral and
that's wrong and that that that that violates Leo that
violates the libertarian philosophy so what are you talking about
what I'm talking about is that you yourself don't understand
the consequences of your philosophy you have a roast colored
glass view of your own philosophy you don't you haven't
actually thought through the consequences what I'm describing to you
now is libertarian and inaction because if we have a
bunch of farmers just living you know we have a
thousand farmers living across a giant plot of land and
they all are able to get along peacefully and they're
all able to divide the land equally and stay off
each other's property and respect each other's rights and so
forth this is sort of what you invent envisioned as
a libertarian but then what happens think of this what
happens with would one of those gets a little bit
more ambition a little bit of ego and says hmm
you know why am i toiling away in the fields
of my little farm for 10 20 30 years until
I die you know working from dawn until dusk on
these crops and barely scraping by barely making a living
why am I doing this when what I could do
is I could go to my friends to five of
my neighboring farmer friends and we will create a collective
a syndicate or a cabal we will create a syndicate
or will form a pact where we agree that we're
gonna be working together to conquer all the other farmers
and if we succeed in this they will all be
working for us and we won't have to farm another
day in our life we'll just be collecting dividends we'll
also gather the most beautiful women to get as our
concubines and wives and other resources that are available out
there will pillage them and steal them or will will
find some way to squeeze those who are less powerful
than us because you know how can one individual farmer
fight against five other farmers who have formed a collective
against him the only way is if he is exceedingly
rich and wealthy already such that he maybe he can
hire some mercenary army to defend him but if that's
not available or he's not that rich then the his
only other option is to also form a collective so
I form a collective here with five farmers he now
has to form a collective of ten farmers to overpower
these five farmers and then who's gonna win out well
now it's an arms race whoever stronger faster more ruthless
more vicious all of this that I'm describing is happening
within a free marketplace there's nobody saying any rules there's
no government here it's just individual people farmers so if
farmers decide they want to call coordinate as a group
nothing is stopping them who's gonna stop them and after
all is it morally wrong for five farmers to come
together start to coordinate towards some larger goal or some
some larger project maybe at first this starts off as
just a knot not a vicious campaign of domination and
you know war learning and marauding but if it could
start off is like the five five farmers come together
and they just want to build some more advanced irrigation
system that will benefit all those five farmers well okay
what's wrong with that are you gonna prevent them from
doing that as a libertarian now of course you're gonna
allow that there's nothing to prevent it so of course
you're going to and of course they will do it
because when humans come together and work in a coordinated
way they can accomplish amazing things that enhance their survival
it's not simply that if you take five farmers and
combine them together that they will produce the same amount
of crop output as they would as five individuals there's
gonna be a cumulus Hort of a cumulative geometric effect
if we get five farmers together and they start to
coordinate all their labor together then they might be able
to put out 10 times more crop yield than they
would if they worked individually because they build some roads
irrigation canals they can share technology they can share in
all sorts of knowledge and wisdom about how to do
this they can start to specialize in different roles cradle
you no city or little town and then they're much
more effective and so of course the free market will
drive towards that but as soon as that happens notice
what happens now this little town has flourished of five
farmers let's it's little village they've built up their irrigation
canals their roads and all the sorts of great stuff
and they've gotten wealthy and they've built a lot of
wealth they have fabulous farms fabulous crops beautiful houses that
they've built up through all this labor all the other
farmers who did not coordinate now they look at those
farmers and say oh wow look at that there's so
much wealth over there there's beautiful people there's resources there's
animals there's crops there's labor there's roads and canals wow
that's amazing we want that for ourselves but of course
people are inherently lazy and selfish so while some of
them might coordinate and then build one of those for
themselves from scratch that takes a lot of work it's
a lot easier for them to coordinate together build a
military come attack these guys who are completely defenseless and
just steal all their stuff and so that's exactly what
happens and notice that that is the free market daddy
is true freedom don't deny that you're gonna want to
say that no Leo that that goes against my morals
your morals don't mean [ __ ] to those people
who have different morals that's what you need to get
through your thick skull other people don't live by your
morals it's not good enough when a serial killer comes
to kidnap your children - for you to tell him
oh well but what about my what about our morals
what about what about the individual right to life and
to happen and what about you know the the fact
that use of force against others is inherently immoral the
serial killers give [ __ ] you gonna kidnap and
rape your children and slit their throats that's what a
serial killer does that's the reality that we're dealing with
when we're trying to construct a community see we're not
dealing with angels here we're dealing with selfish selfish ruthlessly
selfish people and by the way you as a libertarian
don't think you're above this somehow like I'm saying that
all the libertarians are up here they have these great
morals and they're good people and angels and then there's
all the devil's and serial killers and rapists over here
and now the problem the problem really is that the
libertarians need to somehow you know teach the devil's how
to rise to their level no no no it's way
worse than that what I'm telling you is that you
as a libertarian the hypocrisy of your position is that
actually you yourself are a selfish [ __ ] devil
yeah you don't admit it you only think you're an
angel actually the way that you behave is very very
selfishly and much of what you call freedom is really
just a mask and nothing more than a facade that
you put up to avoid reflecting on your own selfishness
the whole concept of freedom is not really about freedom
for everybody in some Galit aryan sense even though you
like to paint it that way in practice what freedom
means for you is freedom for you to do exactly
the [ __ ] that you think you want to
do that fits your survival agenda that's really what you
mean when you say freedom as a libertarian you don't
really give a [ __ ] about the freedom of
others you care about your own freedom and when push
comes to shove you are going to do what is
necessary to increase your own freedom at the cost of
others that's what you do that's what egos do and
we'll be talking a lot more a lot more about
egos here in a moment so see this idea that
freedom is an absolute good is is complete nonsense in
the concept of in the context of forming a society
but really talking about is making strategic choices about certain
limitations and restrictions and regulations such that we reduce the
horror of unlimited freedom unlimited freedom is what exists in
the animal kingdom if you want the closest thing to
a free market place go to the jungle there's your
free market place there's no government there's no rules but
also notice there's no morality and it's vicious as [
__ ] in the absence of laws and cultural norms
which is really what you mean by morality in the
absence of these which had to be invented and developed
in the absence of these you have how do you
arbitrate between the survival agenda of two different organisms you
have let's say you have a snake and you have
a mouse in the jungle the mouse has its own
survival agenda it wants to you know raise its family
and do my stuff congregate with other mice and find
Mao Mao's food and so forth and then the snake
needs to live and for that it needs to eat
mice and it wants to reproduce so you see we
have a conflict of interest here conflict of agendas so
who's gonna win how is that decided it's not decided
through morals it's not decided through ethics it's not decided
by some government power it's only decided between the two
of them by seeing who can overpower who or who
can outsmart who if the mouse is clever enough to
you know spot the snake and not even approach the
snake then the snake will starve to death and if
the mouse is stupid enough and careless enough to walk
by a snake and the snake strikes it and eats
it then the mouse and his family dies it's not
good it's not bad it's not evil it's not immoral
it's the free market that's freedom the problem though is
that it's extremely vicious who on earth would want to
live in that kind of environment on the one hand
it seems kind of cool like total freedom I'm just
gonna you know I'm in the jungle there's no government
nobody's taxing me about anything I don't have to like
fill out my you know annual tax forms you know
how annoying that is I don't have to follow any
kind of regulations I can do whatever I want yes
but so can anybody else and therein lies the problem
because you can't even imagine the sort of horrors that
somebody else might do to you in order to gain
us advice ERV ival advantage for themselves their family and
their children you can't even imagine the horrors and it's
because of this that libertarian societies do not exist libertarianism
is an a historical philosophy there has not been a
single libertarian government that has survived I mean maybe they
existed but if they did they didn't last very long
and you won't find much evidence of it in history
books they don't exist because they can't exist because nobody
wants to live in that kind of society in a
sense libertarianism was our starting point as a civilization if
you rewind the clock a hundred thousand years before there
were cities maybe even before there were proper towns and
even villages where it was really really simple just like
you know caveman days small small small tribes that's probably
the closest thing you'll get to libertarianism but but there
was there was clan warfare tribal warfare it wasn't all
sweet and idyllic it was bloody one tribe would fight
other tribe if you've read any anthropological or historical documentation
about how tribes live actually not as sympathised idealized romanticized
version but how tribes actually live they're extremely territorial they're
violent they've got weapons bows and arrows and clubs and
things like that and they will fight ruthlessly with neighboring
tribes and they will hold grudges against neighboring tribes for
generations and hundreds of years they will kidnap each other's
children and wives they will seek revenge and retribution because
there will be blood feuds between these different tribes you
know maybe 20 years ago you kidnapped my daughter so
then you know I've been biding my time then my
ancestors will come and they will kill your grandmother as
retribution for you know for you kidnapping my daughter and
so forth this is very normal stuff this is business
as usual for tribes so you can see it's it's
a it's a ruthless existence because there is no higher
moderating power there's nobody you can go to to to
say like all well but that tribe you know they
kidnapped my daughter and that's that's wrong so we should
you know stop them from doing that in the future
because I have other daughters I don't want them to
get hurt to see normally in an advanced society you
would go to a police or you would go to
some courts and they would adjudicate these things for you
and they would step in on your behalf and they
would stop any sort of shenanigans from happening they would
stop people from stealing your property and invading you and
and whatever else but for that to happen that requires
restriction regulation requires monopoly of force because here the state
in this case has a military they have a police
they have a court system all of this stuff this
is a monopoly of force so what we've done in
advanced societies if we've actually relinquished certain freedoms that we
used to have so that we can get a more
peaceful ordered cohesive society it's sort of like we come
together and we agree like let's say in warfare you
know it's interesting that you might think of warfare is
the the perfect example of unregulated activity you know is
ruthless people just slaughtering and kill each other indiscriminately but
in the advanced society we actually have rules for warfare
that we've agreed to there are certain like Geneva Convention
protocols and rules that had treaties that have been signed
against using nuclear weapons against using chemical weapons biological weapons
mustard gas and even certain kind of bullets are banned
from use on the on the battlefield because there are
certain bullets these days that are just like especially inflict
a lot of suffering I don't know what they're called
hollow points or whatever another bullet expert but but there
are there are certain munitions certain kinds of explosives certain
kinds of like napalm and stuff that just is just
horrific beyond simply you know getting the normal sort of
evils of the battlefield these are like an additional layer
so my point is is that we have we have
come together and because we've had centuries of ruthless war
where people were getting napalmed and tortured and you know
getting shot with crazy ammunition that you know maimed them
and just destroyed everything and you know gas and biological
weapons all this or stuff and even nuclear weapons we've
had all this we've seen the horrors of it and
collectively we've come together as as enemies as opposite sides
we've come together and we said okay I know I
hate you and I know you hate me but at
least together even though we hate each other and even
though we know we're gonna go to war sometime in
the future nevertheless can you and I agree that we're
not going to use nuclear weapons okay can we agree
that we're not gonna use napalm against each other okay
can we agree that we're not gonna torture each other's
you know captive prison okay so at least we can
agree on that and that will at least mitigate some
of the horror of survival but this requires agreement and
then furthermore how do you enforce the agreement if one
side decides to cheat what happens if we agree to
this but then secretly I'm torturing your prisoners when I
capture them well you see the only solution to that
is for you to start torturing my prisoners because that
lets me get a taste for how bad it is
and then and then we can come back to the
table because you know if I'm torturing yours and you're
torturing mine we can come back to the table maybe
in ten years and begin to be okay we've both
tortured enough of each other's prisoners can we agree to
stop but then you tell me well how can we
agree if we agreed last time ten years ago but
you cheated and what am I gonna say I'm gonna
said well yeah I did I cheated or I'm gonna
deny it see but at some point we have to
get to a point where we can come together and
and coordinate and not cheat on each other that's difficult
to do this is the problem of government in a
nutshell but you see what's happening here you think that
freedom is this absolute good but notice what's happening if
we come together and we sit down at a negotiating
table and we agreed to to restrict nuclear weapons napalm
and mustard gas and whatever else bad bullets and so
forth we are restricting freedom that's not freedom that's regulation
that's restriction that's limitation and in this situation it's a
good it's a net positive it allows for peace it
reduces suffering so this example alone completely throws throws a
wrench in the works of libertarian philosophy this is just
one example now you need to extrapolate this example out
into all these different forms it doesn't just happen with
you know with arms deals at the negotiating table between
nations this happens all across society all across community we
create strategic restrictions and limitations and regulations otherwise known as
laws so that we can adhere to those laws and
these laws are designed not to take away our freedom
nobody sits down to design a law and says well
you know I have too much freedom on my hands
let me create a law that will take it away
from me no nobody says that what happens is that
we start from a position where we have so much
freedom that all sorts of chaos and devilry runs rampant
we we feel it so much it hurts us so
deeply when it when it touches our own family our
own children our own health our own lives our own
communities our own nation's get destroyed and savaged and you
know genocide happens we experienced all this slavery we experience
all that and we say okay enough I'm [ __
] sick of it I am willing to surrender some
of this freedom for a couple of laws that will
just tell people like don't enslave others don't rape others
don't use mustard gas etc so you would actually be
insane and suicidal not to accept some of these restrictions
literally it's suicide not to accept these restrictions because the
odds that you'll get killed from a lack of restrictions
are very high you see one of the problems that
libertarians face is that libertarianism is a new philosophy this
is not some philosophy that existed a hundred thousand years
ago or ten thousand years ago or even a thousand
years ago or even a hundred years ago libertarianism is
like 70 years old 80 years old I don't know
it basically started with iron Rand this is a philosophy
that originated as a reaction to things that were happening
in society back then during iron rands time it's already
built upon a deep deep deep foundation of civilization and
government that works and that creates relative peace and security
for people the mistake that libertarians make is that they
don't think deeply enough through history they don't kind of
like connect the dots to see that we had to
build ourselves up massively we have to build up all
this bureaucracy and infrastructure to get to the point we're
at today where now you have the luxury of sitting
in your own house as an individual ranting and raving
on some online forum about how you need more freedom
and how the government is taking away your freedom and
how taxation is theft and all this sorts of stuff
you have no idea what survival is really like a
thousand or 2,000 years ago before serious government you had
no idea of the horrors and evils that existed so
in a sense the libertarian is taking for granted so
much the libertarian is taking for granted all of the
luxuries and benefits that the restriction regulation and laws and
monopoly of force have provided to him and it is
usually a him if you were to start life over
again and you were given a choice before you incarnated
into this world between living in a totally free society
where anything goes and you're completely free and then you're
living like a caveman or you live in today's society
with Internet airplanes nightclubs hotels air travel space travel video
games you know the internet movies and all this sorts
of stuff but you're very restricted you have to pay
taxes you have to file government forms you have to
go to the DMV get a driver's license before you
drive on the road and you have to you know
pay taxes for your for your car every year and
you gotta get a smog check you know there's regulations
on the pollution that your car can can create he's
allowed to create you got to you know pay fines
if your car is polluting too much and you gotta
you got to follow orders of police if they stop
you you know if you're driving too fast on the
road police will stop you you have to you have
to then pay them money so if you had a
choice between which one you would want to live in
you would always choose this one always always if you
knew the horrors of this one over here you would
always choose this and that is why there are no
libertarian societies and there they're basically never will be because
everyone always chooses this because when they choose this out
of if out of stupidity they do choose this they
they suffer from it so quickly that they quickly revert
back and then they turn this into this they create
it because of how horrible this is but there's a
trap here is that once your ancestors worked really hard
to move us away from the evils that existed in
total freedom in the free market they move us to
a restricted market to regulation into laws they built that
up and then generations and thousands of years passed and
then children are born into this environment now they take
it for granted see this is what you are doing
as a libertarian you're taking forget because you're sitting on
this privileged position with all the luxuries that have been
created by the structure of government and regulation and law
and all this monopoly force you are you're at the
same type of hypocrisy of it is that you're you're
benefiting from all the fruits of that without realizing that
the fruits came from those structures and yet what you're
trying to do now is you're trying to undermine and
destroy those structures by trying to deregulate everything and to
say the taxation is theft and you know you're trying
to get back to this place but you're you're so
stupid you don't understand what you're actually doing it what
the consequences of that will be and then you're frustrated
why everybody around you isn't on board with you why
the government isn't you know full of libertarians well the
reason it isn't is because it doesn't work the people
don't want it even if you were able to you
know seize control of the government with some radical libertarians
and you were trying to like make this libertarian worldview
a reality you would quickly get overthrown and killed by
your fellow citizens because once they got a taste of
the consequences of your policies and deregulation and lack of
laws that would be so threatening to the survival their
children and their family that they would kill you they
would rather kill you than follow you into hell this
hell of absolute freedom see most people fortunately are not
so ideological as to just want absolute freedom as an
absolutely good most people what they want is they want
security they want their survival needs met they want luxuries
like entertainment travel cars roads the internet and so forth
and the only way you can get these things is
through a highly coordinated regulated carefully ordered infrastructure bureaucracy which
orders the actions of thousands and millions of individual agents
such that they can live peacefully together so that they
can co-exist got that we still haven't even scratched the
surface of this and there's so much more that needs
to be said what you need to understand is that
oppression is relative to identity there is no such thing
as oppression in the absolute sense what qualifies as oppression
is relative to what you identify as so for example
if you identify as a white southerner in the colonial
times 200 years ago you have a big flat plantation
you have a certain worldview of your race as being
superior and part of your survival agenda is that you
need to you know your plantations managed and you sure
as hell are not gonna do it in the hot
Sun so you import some slaves to do it for
you do you as the slave owner consider yourself as
oppressing the slaves of course not of course not now
you might say well but the slave owners are just
in denial everybody knows that slavery is wrong and oppressive
no that's where you're wrong that's the whole problem is
that everybody does not know and does not agree that
slavery is wrong and oppressive to the extent that they
do that's simply because we've built up the infrastructure and
a consensus and a legal system in a bureaucratic system
which in an education system which teaches people that slavery
is wrong and bad and you shouldn't do it because
there's suffering that comes from and it's oppressive and all
this this requires an education system hires a culture that
teaches that this culture did not exist 200 years ago
the culture of 200 years ago you know 200 years
it's not a long time the culture of 200 years
ago mostly considered slavery as natural even god-ordained you could
go and find ministers and preachers that would talk about
how God gifted the white man to rule over all
the colored you know the lesser colored people in the
animals and so forth you can find this now you
said well that they were diluted no no no you
are diluted you are deluded for thinking that slavery is
some sort of absolute evil it's not remember total freedom
means you can enslave people really think about this 2,000
years ago the idea that slavery was inherently wrong did
not exist it did not exist like really it did
not exist and when I say that I don't just
mean like oh well it didn't exist and the people
were idiots and they just didn't understand morality and now
we've got to the point where now we understand morality
we of course we understand that it's wrong and it
always was wrong no it never was wrong and it
isn't wrong now this is just a cultural norm there
is nothing that is stopping slavery other than the cultural
norms and infrastructure and bureaucratic institutions that we have put
in place to stop it that's it and of course
also there is this as part of the norms is
there's a culture there's a cultural consensus we're together today
in 21st century society if you're living in a developed
part of the world all of us agree that slavery
is wrong that's not because it is wrong that's because
we've seen the evils of allowing it and we've realized
yeah it weighs heavy on our conscience even at some
point the slave owners had to say like man like
whipping these slaves doesn't feel so good and my fellow
white people start to judge me for it you know
like the northern the northerners who don't have slaves they
start to judge the southerners who do and then that
doesn't feel good to the southerners now there's a war
of course that's a civil war no no show you
oppression is relative to your identity there is no such
thing as absolute oppression what counts is oppression is relative
to your survival agenda what you want out of life
and people have different notions of what oppression is to
somebody to a libertarian for example given your worldview you
feel that taxation is oppression but to most of us
we don't feel that because we realize that yes taxation
is a bit of a pain in the ass nobody
really likes to pay taxes but also how much sure
individual understands that yes of course I don't enjoy paying
taxes but it's not like this money is being stolen
from me per se this is money that I'm in
a sense donating to create a better society because roads
don't build themselves militaries don't fund themselves various other kinds
of government programs don't fund themselves space travel doesn't fund
itself now I hear you libertarians trying to make an
argument at all well but if we just let businesses
do it then it can it can like Elan musk
built SpaceX and that leo that's a that disproves your
whole point because the private business can do it the
only reason Ellen musk was able to build SpaceX was
because because we have 10,000 years of [ __ ]
bureaucracy and infrastructure that have been developed built through bloody
Wars hundreds of millions of people were killed raped enslaved
burned and tortured at the [ __ ] stake for
10,000 years to get us to this point where Ellen
Musk can now build a rocket to send some [
__ ] up into space if you don't see that
connection there you're not using your head properly there cannot
be space travel without complex bureaucracy and regulation military court
systems police fire departments education systems university systems all funded
by taxpayer money I am not saying that it's impossible
to have private space travel of course it's possible in
the future we're gonna have a lot more of it
but recognize don't be so [ __ ] arrogant as
to take for granted the foundation upon which it is
built that allows for it you know here's a very
simple example for you and I really encourage you libertarians
who want to debate me and argue with me here
to stop being philosophical for a moment and actually take
a look at concrete examples of how stuff happens in
society because it'll quickly disabuse you of many of your
mythical notions about how government works for example SpaceX SpaceX
cannot exist without Wall Street impossible now you might say
but Leo SpaceX is not even traded on Wall Street
it's a private company so why is Wall Street relevant
here at all because how did L on Musk fun
SpaceX the only way he was able to fund it
is by the billions of dollars that he got from
the sale of PayPal how was PayPal sold it was
built up to go to IPO and to go on
Wall Street and the only reason Ellen must got billions
of dollars for it is because eventually they knew that
this company would end up on Wall Street where billions
of dollars more even than that you know tens of
billions would be generated and so based on that they
gave him a few billion of his own and then
based on that he founded SpaceX now you might wonder
well so what Wall Street okay a big deal right
but Wall Street cannot exist without government regulation do you
know the kind of [ __ ] that would happen
on Wall Street if there was no government regulation no
laws against insider trading go read the history of stock
markets and the kind of [ __ ] that happened
on stock in stock markets hundreds of years ago even
just fifty years ago before all this regulation was passed
there's massive regulation on Wall Street and it's not nearly
enough there's still so many problems and there's so much
corruption on Wall Street but if you think that Wall
Street would work better with less regulation your honor your
smoke and crack stocks need to be heavily regulated because
there's so much value to be gained from manipulating and
lying to the public you can publish fake press releases
you can you can manipulate your own stock prices you
can you can create fake companies and sell those stocks
you know do pump and dump schemes and all sorts
of scams like you could scam people out of billions
of dollars without proper regulation restriction and if you think
that that situation can be managed simply by an appeal
to moral principles and by an appeal to personal property
rights and an appeal to like well don't just don't
like don't be a dick on Wall Street like how
are you gonna regulate Wall Street the wolves on Wall
Street how you gonna regulate them government Sal monopoly of
force is how there needs to be a military there
needs to be a police force there needs to be
a court system there needs to be a legislature which
passes the laws there needs to be regulating agencies like
the SEC and so forth which go after these Wall
Street wolves keep them in check if you think Wall
Street is bad now you have no idea how bad
it would be without any of this infrastructure it just
it couldn't exist it literally could not exist so think
really hard about what freedom really means I want you
to see that unlimited freedom is actually highly threatening to
life and to self and that really the ego yourself
your own organism hates freedom you hate freedom even if
you have an ideology where you say you love freedom
actually you hate freedom because when you truly experience the
effects of freedom on you if someone comes and rapes
your children that's freedom and when you experience that you
will hate freedom you will understand the problem with freedom
unlimited freedom and you will wish that there was some
someone you could go to someone you could cry to
who could help you in that situation and from this
government is born see it's not rocket science it's pretty
common-sense stuff without government you would have enslavement you know
that slavery existed in basically all parts of the world
and in all societies for thousands of years only recently
in the most developed societies with the most regulations the
biggest government's only recently in the last couple hundred years
have we been able to outlaw slavery why is that
precisely because we had built up so much infrastructure to
get to the point where we could do it so
if you think that you're gonna you're gonna roll back
government to some sort of more simplified form especially some
of you anarchists you're literally you're trying to literally roll
back evolution to go back to an earlier stage in
which enslavement was the norm in which genocide was the
norm do you understand that that's what you're actually proposing
when you propose your anarchist ideas I mean of course
you're in denial about it you're not gonna admit to
what you're doing cuz you you haven't connected the dots
that's why in this whole conversation I'm trying to guide
you through the nitty-gritty like pathways of your own thoughts
so you can see how your own thinking leads to
absurdities and to all sorts of evil here's another example
I want to run by you here's a claim radical
claim says libertarians often like to argue that roads for
example which are public in most places that roads can
be privatized with no problem private roads they they exist
we have toll roads so why couldn't all roads be
taller and then we could save on taxes and then
that would be more freedom well let's take a look
at that here's my claim for you I really challenge
you to think about this my claim is that it's
impossible for a road to exist at all without a
government there cannot be a road without a government let's
think this through so imagine we're again we roll back
the clock 2,000 years or even maybe 5,000 years to
a place where there were no roads yet there were
no cities yet it was just little individual farmers living
and surviving by themselves was it with no government yet
so they decided on the road okay how do you
build a road let's say we want to build a
decent side of a hundred miles of road it's not
gonna be concrete but it's just gonna be like a
100 miles of road sort of a Roman style Road
let's say that's a pretty big project how do you
build it he's a farmer gonna be able to build
it no impossible he's his family gonna build a buildin
impossible our five farmers gonna be able to build it
impossible five farmers and their families cannot build 100-mile Road
nor do they even have a reason for building 100-mile
Road why would they where they gonna go to um
you need a much larger group of people you probably
need at least a city or town of a thousand
or 10,000 to build such a road so assuming we've
got these people they build this road okay but this
road can only exist if it's maintained so now they're
committed to maintaining it this road can only exist if
it's defended against others who would come and want to
destroy the road so let's say our group our town
about ten thousand people decide to build our road you
know horizontally east to west 100 miles and then some
other group neighbouring group decides to build a different road
which goes north to south and intersects with our road
so what's gonna happen at that intersection of roads how
is that traffic going to be managed maybe we could
just come together and agree on it but what if
we have a differ of opinion what if I say
that all my road going north south is more important
than your road going east-west what happens well battle happens
see how are you going to adjudicate that with your
libertarian philosophy of no monopoly of force and just respecting
individual property rights so see a little cherry would probably
say something like well the first town who builds the
road horizontally east-west they get the first dibs on the
property rights so once you build a road this way
now you can't build a road the other way because
it interferes with property rights so now what what the
other people have to do is they have to if
these people build around this way these will have to
build a road that goes around like this but this
is a pure absurdity you see nobody's gonna be [
__ ] building a road that goes around they're just
gonna go straight through and they're gonna dominate whatever's in
between there's gonna be a battle because it's easier it's
actually more energy efficient to just have a battle than
build a road that's twice as long that goes around
and after all why should the first people get the
rights where does it say where you show me where
there's a rule in the universe that says that if
I build a road this way that other people now
are not allowed to build a road that way through
my road where does it say that it doesn't say
that anywhere it only exists in your mind you see
that's the problem with you libertarians you have a strong
sense of morality and then you expect everybody else to
adhere to your morality which of course is not real
life real life is the exact opposite of that everybody
else has their own sense of morality which will conflict
with yours because in truth your morality is not some
objective Universal thing it is deeply selfish your morality is
that which serves your survival and survival of your family
and the survival of your ideology your morality is not
some you know god-given thing you invented your morality morality
is a social invention which has been invented by communities
to help them to co-exist and coordinate peacefully with each
other without killing all of each other that's the function
of morality it's a practical thing so let's say getting
back to the road example let's say let's ignore the
second road let's just say we have the original Road
so simplify it so we have the original Road going
going east-west it's a hundred miles they built it they
have to defend it they have to maintain it this
takes energy this takes a force you need a police
force to police this road what happens if someone let's
say throws a giant rock in the middle of the
road someone has to come and clear it out there
also needs to be a punishment for doing this because
some people might want to blockade the road see some
people because this road now once the road is built
it's valuable and presumably that's why you built it in
the first place it allows you to travel faster allows
you to access points that you couldn't access before so
it has value now that it has value you see
people get clever the ego gets clever it wants to
exploit all the value that exists so some small band
of people decide ah this road is valuable what if
we blockade the road then we can prevent troops from
going from one part of the countryside to the other
that will give us some survival advantage let's blockade the
road so you got to prevent them from doing that
some police have to stop them that means it has
to be patrols along this road now you would say
oh but but leo that that that's a violation of
property rights because hey if you're if you're putting rocks
on my road then you're violating my property rights and
that's immoral but who gives a [ __ ] at
this stage of human development nobody cares about what's immoral
what they care about is survival if it's gonna save
someone's life or allow them to feed their children to
place boulders in the middle of your road they will
do it or they can set up a little a
little Tollbooth of their own you see I can get
a couple of my guys so big guys I hire
them they get their their their guns and their machetes
and we set up a little toll booth at some
point in the road everybody comes through they have to
pay us you know a third of the goods that
they're carrying or we cut their heads off that will
inevitably happen unless there's some mechanism to prevent it don't
you dare think that human goodness alone will prevent that
from happening no there needs to be a enforcement of
it and then that enforcement itself who's gonna who's gonna
control whether the enforcement is fair or not you see
what happens if the if the troops who are patrolling
the police let's say who are patrolling that road making
sure that it doesn't get too you know hijacked or
blockaded or you know something else bad happens on it
um who's gonna police them cuz what if they got
have hand what if they themselves decide to AH we
can set up our own toll booth on the road
and charge everybody cuz we're the police we got even
more power than those bandits they can do that see
so there needs to be an even higher agency above
the police that police is the police either a military
or a court system or an independent agency or internal
affairs Department of the police that reviews the police and
so on that routes out corruption and all sorts of
possibilities for devilry and selfishness because it will exist because
humans are selfish so my point here being I hope
you can see is that there cannot exist a road
without a government you might say well what about toll
roads yes you can have toll roads within the ecosystem
that has been built by thousands of years of government
every toll road that exists on the planet only exists
because there is a government that allows it to exist
can you see that the government is doing so much
that is sort of the function of the government the
government sets up a almost transparent like background infrastructure which
then allows a lot of cool things to be built
on top of it for example there cannot be commercial
jet airplane travel without government without significant bureaucracy and regulation
airplanes are dangerous things they need to be highly regulated
they need to be built to specifications as we've seen
for example with the recent Boeing is that 737 max
I believe it is that was the you know the
poorly constructed jetliner that you know resulted in a couple
of fatal catastrophe you know crashes they had to halt
the entire production of this airplane line why because it
was poorly built improperly regulated and properly inspected and the
only reason at this that these planes were pulled from
service was because there is I don't know what is
it called the Federal Aviation Association FAA something like that
right that that regulates all these airplanes like there are
such strict regulations on not just the construction of airplanes
but even the interiors of airplanes how many seats you
can have how close the seats can be to each
other how far away the windows are how the air
conditioning works how many computer systems are on there built
for redundancies in case one of them breaks the other
one can take over help like that is super regulated
why because it has to be for people to feel
secure flying on an airplane now you might say well
but this is this is such a restriction I just
want to Leo why why am I being prohibited why
is the big government prohibiting me from starting my own
airplane company and just building whatever kind of [ __
] planes I want I want to be able to
build a plane with no windows and no seats or
with no redundancies I just want to build whatever I
want to build why can't I do that because we've
done that in the past and we've realized the horrors
of it it was so bad that we create an
entire agency that is watching and regulating these airline companies
like a hawk and still it's not good enough to
ensure the kind of security we want from these airplanes
you see and just to have a plane fly from
one part of the world to other part of the
world you need to build runways giant runways these runways
can only exist because they're supported defended policed by the
local governments there so that's required but more so even
more beyond that it's not just to have two runways
around the world these are different countries different cultures different
ethnicities different religions they need to all coordinate together at
a global scale to allow planes to travel on a
daily basis from one to the other without conflict and
problem what happens if one plane flies over some other
country that country shoots it down you would say oh
but that's a that's a you know oppression nobody gives
a [ __ ] they will shoot down your plane
unless we have had some treaties at an international level
where we agree that if you're gonna use my airspace
you're gonna fly over my airspace then you better pay
me some some amount of money because you're using my
airspace and whatever and you know these agreements were reached
these agreements can only be reached through massive bureaucracy infrastructure
government and regulation this cannot happen with small government you
can't do this in some anarchist commune you see when
you're living in some manner anarchist commune you're basically a
farmer that's all you've got is you've got farming you've
got nothing else you have no internet no smartphones no
cars no computers no entertainment you lose all this amazing
stuff so what I want you to see is that
the history of human civilization is us through an evolutionary
process of trial and error carefully selecting various restrictions of
course we disagree about up upon which restrictions and laws
and regulations are good but we go through some battle
and we find those restrictions which restrict the free market
precisely because we don't want a free market it restricts
the free market and creates a better society in which
actually we don't have less freedom we have more freedom
how is it that we have more freedom because we've
sacrificed certain freedoms that weren't really relevant to us or
weren't really beneficial to us we surrender those in order
to attain higher freedoms which actually we do care about
so for example I am happy to sacrifice my freedom
to rape people if that means that I will then
what I'll get for it is I will get the
security of knowing that my children won't be raped I
will happily give up that freedom now of course if
you're a rapist you disagree with me because you get
a kick outta raping people and maybe you don't have
children so for you see that that's not a good
deal for you you want to be able to rape
with impunity but most people would rather give up rape
and slavery and genocide and racism and some of this
kind of nasty stuff would give the freedom of that
up so that we can have a society where where
we can have like a city with technology and where
people get along with each other you know they have
different religions different ethnicities different cultures and they can all
be a melting pot get along each other there's not
you know race Wars between them there's not genocides going
on none of that stuff because we've surrendered that and
we've gotten something better for it consider this ask yourself
this question is there more freedom in the countryside rural
countryside or there's just like a little village and nothing
to do or is there more freedom in New York
City there's actually more freedom in New York City because
in the countryside there are so few options sure in
the countryside if you're all alone let's say you're out
in the middle of the desert all by yourself yeah
you've got total freedom do whatever you want you can
take a [ __ ] you can do whatever you
want do it but notice you'll get you'll get bored
very quickly why do you get bored because you're just
sitting there by yourself there's nothing to do there's nobody
to talk to there's no cars there's no planes there's
no internet there's nothing cool there's no food you're gonna
die out there so you would happily sacrifice being in
the middle of the desert by yourself to go to
a village in the village there's more stuff to do
there's people there's town there's a there's pubs there's farms
there's food there's a little bit of entertainment you can
find there's maybe some internet you know whatever um there's
others you can marry have children with they'd have sex
with cool stuff fun right great there's alcohol great that's
fun look at how much freedom you gained by giving
up the desert for the village because the whole point
at the village we can come together we can build
something extraordinary together that we couldn't have built by ourselves
in the alone in the desert you can't really create
something as cool as pub or a constant music concert
or a computer but in a village we come together
we can create something cool like a pub or a
saloon that's easy to do in a village most villagers
have one of those we can start to brew alcohol
have fun at night after we work but now you'll
go to New York City look at all the opportunity
or city that you can do you can visit museums
look at art you can go to the park you
can you can fly a hot-air balloon you can fly
a helicopter you can go on the boat you can
see a Statue of Liberty you can go on skyscrapers
and you can go to Wall Street and you can
earn money and you could have sex and there's hookers
and there's drugs and there's entertainment and there's porn and
there's like anything you want you can find in New
York City basically if it exists it exists in New
York City but the cost of living in New York
City is that you have to surrender freedoms you're I'm
sorry you're not allowed to go in the middle of
the street in Manhattan and take a [ __ ]
sorry you're not allowed to do that sorry you're not
allowed to just like walk down the street with an
ak-47 it's just start pulling the trigger you could do
that in the desert sorry I can't do that in
your city because it's more complex it's more dense there's
a lot of agents going around we need order in
a giant city in a giant city we got what
like 5 10 million people living there something like that
they need much much more regulation so they don't step
on each other's toes we'd sophisticated court systems which will
adjudicate disputes between different companies different agencies different people whereas
for example in a village you don't need a fancy
court system in a village you got like your local
judge you just you just come to him you maybe
even know where he lives you can knock on his
door two neighbors have a dispute you can just come
knock on the door of the sheriff or something the
sheriff will listen to it and then he'll just render
his verdict and then you guys will just you know
adjudicated that way in a sort of simple way you
can't do that in a giant highly complex system like
a city so this idea of the free market this
needs to be deconstructed the free market is a myth
it has never ever existed never existed even if you
roll back the clock and you go back to ancient
Rome or ancient Egypt there was no free market the
market is always controlled and manipulated by various agents who
are making up the market always there's always manipulation of
the market why because every agent in the market when
they are free by definition they are free to pursue
their own selfish agenda without restriction and so they do
because they're selfish so in a free market if I
can manipulate something if I can manipulate the price if
I can manipulate the supply or the demand if I
can you know create a counterfeit product I'm gonna put
it out there that's gonna be part of the free
market but we don't like that see you don't want
a market in which there's counterfeit products and scams and
you know pump and dump schemes and all sorts of
bamboozlement going on you want a fair market not a
free market a fair market and the way you get
a fair market was a lot of regulation a fair
market is the opposite of a free market here's what
libertarians fundamentally misunderstand about free markets free markets inherently become
corrupt because the people who are constituting the market are
themselves corrupt and so that corruption will spill over into
the free market if you have a market with a
lot of distributed individuals what's going to inevitably happen is
that those individuals will clump together and coordinate and cooperate
to create corporations tribes groups syndicates cabal's and mafias why
do they do that because that allows them first of
all they have the freedom to do it because it's
a free market second of all because it allows them
to gain to get an advantage in the market every
corporation these days does this every corporation Christ a game
they're part of the market to gain some sort of
advantage over all the others all the other players in
the market how do they do that by buying up
other companies coordinating with them price-fixing and all sorts of
other shady stuff that they could do and in fact
if there was less regulation doesn't happen today but if
there was less regulation a corporation could actually hire their
own military a mercenary group to take out other corporation
and they would gladly do so you think that if
for example Microsoft had the freedom to hire its own
militia that it wouldn't hire one and then go and
take out Apple or Google through physical force by just
like bombing their headquarters of course they would of course
they would and the reason they would is because if
they didn't even if they were assuming they were good
enough and kind enough and you know sweet angels that
they would that they would be above such such barbarity
well if they didn't do it another corporation would see
out of the thousands of corporation that there are there's
gonna be at least a handful that are corrupt enough
that are willing to hire a militia if they're allowed
to and go bomb the headquarters of other corporations and
you know what that that would be a very effective
strategy because it's gonna work a lot better than building
your own company it's very difficult to build a company
like Apple but you know it's pretty easy if I
if I have enough money I could just I could
literally just like raise an army of 10,000 people and
hire some demolition experts and we could destroy every campus
that Apple Apple has I'm easy easy so um so
you see that's the problem with your free market that
has to be stopped you have to stop groups of
people from creating syndicates and mafias which try to abuse
everybody else and bully them and this is the history
of mankind if there's one thing you learn from the
history of mankind is mankind is a highly social species
that creates syndicates in ever-larger hierarchies which then go on
to monopolize and to bully everybody else until eventually they
dominate the entire field if they're allowed to and this
by the way is exactly how government was created in
the first place where did government come from you see
here's here's the whole absurdity of libertarianism is that libertarianism
draws a very sharp dualistic line between the private sector
and the public sector is as if these two things
are unrelated or inherently different they aren't the way that
the public sector came about at all in the first
place because it didn't exist at some point like a
hundred thousand years ago it didn't exist there were no
States and governments a hundred thousand years ago there were
only little villages and tribes but what happened is like
I said these villages and tribes they they came together
they unified because it gave them a survival advantage they
kept doing that at higher and higher orders mafias syndicates
were built city-states were built city-states combined together into nation-states
nation-states combined it combined together into big treaties and alliances
international alliances like NATO and so on the Axis and
Allies powers and World War two so forth so and
then all of this all of this occurred and then
we got this is how we got the state government
various love of state government it came from the private
sector initially it was private in essence what happened was
that some it wasn't called a corporation back then but
some group of marauders came together they created a syndicate
which is effectively a corporation without the legal paperwork they
created a syndicate this syndicate was like a corporation private
corporation and it started taking over more and more land
more and more territory more and more tribes and people
and then that was a tyranny that corporation or that
syndicate turned into a tyranny an authoritarian dictatorship and then
through thousands of years of public pleading and protests and
revolutions what happened was that our ancestors fought with these
private syndicates to seize power away from them because the
power was centralized in an authoritarian pyramid like structure and
all the power went to the king or to the
mob boss of that syndicate those people were overthrown and
eventually democratic norms started to take hold and we got
the right to vote and now it was no longer
tenable for some one guy at the top to call
all the shots for his lifetime now he had to
actually take into consideration the needs of the citizens and
the elites and the legislators and so forth this is
the history basically of Western Europe over the last two
thousand years until we got to the point where we
got a solid democracy going which is what most of
Europe and America is these days pretty pretty solid democracy
where we elect leaders term limits all the sorts of
stuff so see what happened was here's what libertarians understand
is that we started with a free market we started
with a true free market but that was so horrible
that over time the free market was monopolized and dominated
by by a few ruthless and bloody syndicates which then
turned into dictatorships and monarchies which later were then revolutionized
and smoothened out and kind of mollified because that too
was so brutal and evil that that didn't work so
we had to we had to take power back from
the from the top of the Monopoly and distribute it
back down to the people which made life better for
most people raised their living conditions made them less oppressed
now the king couldn't just you know willy-nilly execute somebody
he had to ask a court there has to be
a crime it has to be proven in court the
sorts of stuff so we had the free market ten
thousand years ago it was [ __ ] and now
we got something much better we got a fair market
it's not perfect it's not perfectly fair there's still a
lot of corruption and stuff we need to fix it
we can work on it it can get a lot
better but you should be very grateful that we have
what we have and the only reason we have what
we have is because we have taxation none of this
stuff is possible without taxation so with libertarians make this
claim this this absurd claim that taxation is theft and
the reason they make this claim is because they say
well the government has a monopoly of force which isn't
fair it's not fair for government a monopoly force so
why should they be able to force me to pay
some amount of money that I didn't agree to pay
yeah sorry buddy you live in a community what you
don't understand what you need to get through your thick
skull is that you are part of a [ __
] community you are not an individual forget this myth
of the individual there never was such a thing it's
pure hogwash this romanticized naive notion that if we roll
back the clock and we go back a thousand years
or ten thousand years 100,000 years that people were living
as rugged individuals like the sort of you know the
John Wayne Mad Max character who's like just he you
know he's walking through the desert he walks into town
he's just like this individual he's by himself you know
he he doesn't rely on anybody this sort of guy
you think like that's how people lived ten thousand years
ago no 10,000 years ago human life was far more
collectivist than it is now far more you had no
individual rights basically it wasn't even such a notion of
individualism when you lived in a tribal culture and there
are still cultures like this around in many parts of
the world in third-world countries you'll find these tribal cultures
in these tribes like in like Papa New Guinea someplace
or in the Amazon or in Africa and Indonesia Middle
East in the Middle East still very tribal than the
least yeah you know you find these tribes when you're
living in a small tribe of a hundred people your
life is completely wedded to that tribe why because you
can't survive without it an individual human cannot survive in
the wilderness it's impossible get this really get this because
you have this code a modern notion of like well
but there are shows you know leo what about those
survival shows on the you know Discovery Channel something we're
like one dude is living out in Alaska in the
middle of nowhere by himself he's been living there for
three years he seems to be doing good he's happy
you know he's hunting moose and and and you know
and you know living and up there fishing and nobody's
bothering him and it's all nice and peaceful and like
look it works no this is a this is a
fantasy it doesn't work first of all what you got
to realize is that the only reason that person is
able to live in that wilderness in Alaska for three
even for a year is because he has supplies that
were manufactured by a giant government or at least enabled
by a giant government those people in those survival shows
they need rifles they need bullets and ammunition that needs
to be constantly resupplied they need fishing gear they need
hooks they need fishing line they need matches and camp
starter kits and Flint's and the tents and you know
whatever else shovels into axes and knives bottles none of
this is possible by yourself you know one of the
things I find most outrageous about some of these survival
shows you know I love to watch some of those
survivor show so I was like you know Bear Grylls
or survivor man you watch some of those or like
you know yeah below zero the Alaska wilderness survival show
like they're really interesting and worthwhile to watch because it
gets you a little bit of sense of you know
what survival really was like for our ancestors but still
it doesn't get you a true sense of it because
usually when they throw some like Bear Grylls guy into
into a wilderness he's got a [ __ ] knife
with him and then he's doing all this stuff with
the knife you know he's he's making himself a spear
and he's making a bow and air and making some
fishing hooks from like bow and carving it with a
knife and I'm like yeah but where the [ __
] are you gonna get a knife in the wilderness
that's like you I mean you might as well just
Bear Grylls might as well just walk into a jungle
with an ak-47 it would be as realistic as walking
into a jungle with a knife your ancestors didn't have
an eyes well I'm talking about like a steel [
__ ] you know high-quality like Rambo knife the kind
that usually Bear Grylls will carry into the into the
jungle know at best your ancestors had like rocks and
stuff so it was even more difficult than it seems
in those shows and anyways you know those people they
usually live there in the wilderness for a few years
then they come back to civilization they don't live there
for their entire lifetime it would be virtually impossible to
come back every year to resupply they need to get
stuff drop shipped into them medical supplies like I was
watching some of those shows there was some lady on
one of these shows she was like out in the
wilderness and then she was she was driving her snowmobile
and then the snowmobile tipped over and it fell on
her and it like broke her leg or something like
that and the only reason she survived was because she
was able to crawl back to her technologically advanced pace
which had internet she was able to get her like
satellite phone call like some medical center that was 500
miles away in Alaska and get like a helicopter or
a plane a bush plane to fly in and to
you know rescue her then she get to go to
a hospital with professional doctors the only reason that's possible
is because of the giant government that's there so you
get this false sense with these survival shows you get
this false sense of individualism that you can just kind
of like live out there on your own or some
of these you know doomsday prepper people who think that
all I'm gonna build my own bomb bunker I'm gonna
stock it with supplies canned goods and MREs and stuff
and I'm just gonna like live there by myself then
when the bombs go off I'll just be there and
then you know I'll survive it all and I'll come
out and I'll be able to you know I'll be
able to make it my family and I we're gonna
be the smart ones we're gonna be able to make
it no you won't there's a nuclear a true nuclear
war you're not going to be able to make it
if there's a serious collapse of civilization you're not going
to be able to make it because everything will devolve
into complete barbarism and your supplies they'll run out how
long have I mean even if you have the best
stockpile supplies it'll be a year or two at most
you'll run out of your supplies and food and water
what were you gonna do were you gonna go get
it you have to go fight for it and other
people will be fighting for it you see so in
tribal cultures like in the Amazon they live very communally
and collectively in a sense it's it's pure of communism
you don't have the freedom to say like oh well
in a society like you're in a tribe and you're
like ah [ __ ] the tribe I'm not gonna
do what you guys want me to do I'm just
gonna be an individual I don't want to if don't
infringe on my personal rights you expect me to come
do something for you like go on a hunt with
you or go marry that person over there or like
you know do whatever the tribe is gonna do fight
some tribal war for you no I'm not gonna do
I'm just gonna be myself they'll [ __ ] kill
you cuz you're a traitor to the tribe you can't
survive in those situations if everybody in the tribe behave
like a libertarian the tribe wouldn't exist it would all
go extinct which is why there are no libertarians and
tribes even just the idea of that if you go
to the Amazon or into Africa or to Indonesia you
find a tribe you get a translator and then you
explain the libertarian ideology to those tribes people they will
[ __ ] laugh maybe this will this will be
the funniest thing they have ever heard you tell them
that there are these people who are who live who
think that they can be individuals and have individual rights
they don't have to make any sacrifices for the community
these people will laugh because you can't survive that way
the only way you can survive that way is if
you're living in a in the luxury of a modern
gigantic multi million citizen nation which allows you to have
the freedom of having your own individual house on your
own plot of land by yourself somewhere maybe in the
wilderness and then you yeah you can do that while
you drive the to Costco or to Walmart to pick
up supplies to fuel that and you have electricity you
know supply there you have solar panels all that stuff
and then yeah then you can live off the grid
like that and still you're still highly dependent on the
grid see so the irony is that libertarian ideology is
only made possible by all of the things that libertarians
are opposed to there there actually would not exist a
libertarian ideology unless there was a monopoly a force and
a giant bloated government and bureaucracy that allowed for it
because you can't even have an education system without that
you see just to be able to be intelligent enough
to do philosophy to be able to write books to
philosophize about moral principles this already requires an education system
universities schools and so on which don't exist without taxation
how could there be people who would read ayan rands
books if there wasn't a public education system you see
how absurd the position is this sort of I and
Randy in position of like well we're all individuals and
taxation is is wrong and collectivism is wrong yeah but
the only reason that today 99% of people are literate
is because of public education which is directly funded by
taxation and which is a collectivist endeavor school is a
collective institution and its function is collectivist the reason we
have schools the reason people are made literate is because
that's helpful to the entire community that we're a part
of when our community is made up of a bunch
of illiterate morons who can't add one plus one together
or who can't read a basic book we all suffer
for that this is fundamentally what many libertarians understand because
they're so bought into this philosophy of individualism that they
that they they treat individualism as an absolute good and
they treat communalism as an absolute bad or collectivism as
an absolute bad this is this is so misguided it's
so dysfunctional it's so unhealthy for you because it makes
you like a cancer within your own community we humans
are highly social communal species we can only survive as
a community there was never a time in human history
not even a million years ago where there weren't even
barely humans but there were our ape ancestors there even
back then individual Apes didn't survive only in a community
go look at how chimpanzees survive only in a community
there's not a lot of individual rights and freedoms in
a chimpanzee troop there's actually order and hierarchy precisely because
it's necessary there are certain implicit rules that need to
be followed certain laws if you will which make that
troop function it's a communal endeavor so it's very important
you start to acknowledge that to yourself that you're part
of a community and this community it has its pros
and cons stop looking at a community as just all
the negative stuff that's I think what a lot of
libertarians and some conservatives who are very certainly individualistic minded
they did they tend to forget how much benefit the
community gives them what it allows that couldn't otherwise be
possible and also there's there's a joy to being part
of a community a community gives you a sense of
a larger meaning you could you know there's something you
can work towards there's a perhaps a sense of national
pride although that's problematic because it's internationalism they're gonna be
tribal pride of course that consistent to tribalism but uh
but still there's a healthy form of national pride that
you can have you can have a pride in humanity
you can you can you know have a career that
you work towards you know helping mankind to achieve a
certain goal we can work together towards amazing things but
only if we're willing to make certain sacrifices and part
of the challenge of being born into the 21st century
into this sort of advanced state of society relative to
where it was let's say a hundred thousand years ago
part of the challenge is that you weren't really given
an option you were just born into this world and
you were immediately thrown into a collective highly collective situation
and you were forced as a child as a little
baby you were forced to deal with it you were
forced to learn how to communicate with others how to
have respect not be rude to others how to have
manners how to have etiquette how to have what we
call morals how to you know enforce your own boundaries
but also not let others step over your boundaries how
to be able to play with with friends and how
to work with coworkers and bosses and all this stuff
and it's it's very challenging it can be very frustrating
and hey you know I'm a very individualistic minded person
I don't like to be really big part of collective
so much but but look we have no choice we
have no choice you are part of a collective no
matter what the only question is are you going to
be conscious of how collectives work are you going to
to make smart intelligent choices are you going to be
okay with certain restrictions because we're gonna be making restrictions
no matter what restrictions and laws and regulations will get
made the only question is what kind will they be
and will they get us a net positive or a
net negative regulation is not an absolute good or an
absolute bad it depends what kind it is there are
certainly bad regulations and there's good regulations and usually it's
a mixed bag usually every law or regulation has an
upside and a downside so it's not so simple it's
like oh this is a great law it's perfect no
there's always trade-offs we can always make more laws we
can refine our laws to be the more nuanced and
better to better fit our you know situation in our
situation is always evolving new technology new cultural standards and
more people and so that everything is changing just think
about this let's say you get your wish let's say
you have total freedom that you want as a libertarian
what's gonna happen or as an anarchist what's gonna happen
well for a while there will be a flat hierarchy
everyone will just be doing their own thing then people
start to fight with each other because they will come
together they will clash but there's gonna be nobody to
adjudicate the clash because there's no higher court to appeal
to no higher authority so people will start to make
themselves their own authorities and so as that happens people
will sort of form syndicates and kvass they will form
factions that oppose each other one faction will be Christians
one will be Jews one will be Hindus one will
be Buddhists one will be Muslims you know one will
be liberals will be conservatives one will be this one
will be that one will be in this kind of
corporation one will be another kind of corporation and then
all of them will start to fight with each other
and try to oppress with each other because they're all
trying to get to the top to make sure that
they aren't bullied by the others and the treating us
of the situation is that if even if your moral
enough not to bully others that's not going to be
good enough because there will always be others who will
not be that way and they will want to bully
you and bully others and so they will just drive
you into extinction it's survival of the fittest is basic
evolution here we're talking about so what are you gonna
do you can't stop people from organizing into syndicates and
factions from an anarchic position of total freedom so what
the anarchist and the libertarians understand is that if you
get what you want you will then go through a
cycle of hundreds or thousands of years and then eventually
you'll come back to exactly where we are today that's
where we find ourselves today because anarchy is inherently unstable
and in a sense unnatural reality is ordering itself at
ever higher levels of organization and for that restriction and
regulation is necessary and there's no way you're gonna stop
it so give up your quixotic desire for some sort
of anarchic state of total freedom where we all live
communally in peace with one another no no everything is
constantly evolving into higher and higher orders of complexity the
solution to this problem is to start to unify those
factions together and to get them to see a common
good and a common goal that we can all rally
around together that doesn't mean that all of them will
completely merge and lose all their individualism they can still
maintain individuality but as a collective and we agree to
certain rules that we're all going to follow and not
cheat because that's gonna benefit all of us if none
of us cheat and then we put into place some
institutions and organizations that help to make sure that people
aren't cheating each other that they're staying true to their
original commitments to community because it's for the greater good
of us all so here's the paradox is that the
big government that libertarians rail against is actually the direct
result of a true free market that's what the libertarian
does not understand the free market allows for oppression and
domination and as that happens it becomes so ugly that
people realize that we don't really want a free market
what we want is a fair regulated market and so
they create that but it's the libertarians who don't see
that they're in denial about it because they have this
myth of the free market being able to solve all
of mankind's problems being an absolute good no that's not
true it's just not true thank you through so big
oppressive government actually comes from the private sector if you
don't have a big government with a military and a
monopoly of force what's gonna happen is that one of
the private entities or factions will become that by monopolizing
the entire market and then crowning itself King and that's
how you get a state government with a monopoly of
force you might say this is a bad thing it's
actually not a bad thing because that King will not
be stable either because it's too brutal and it will
it'll actually eventually get democratized and then we'll get the
right to vote and then more democracy will come and
then eventually this what used to be this private sector
which was purely authoritarian now becomes distributed democracy it gets
softened it becomes less brutal and actually it's quite nice
it works quite well sure you got to pay your
taxes but hey that's a small small price to pay
to make sure that your government protects you from being
invaded raped and pillaged by a neighboring country a neighboring
militia a neighboring tribe or another syndicate of some sort
you see thing that libertarians understand is that by deregulating
the government the federal government in in America for example
what you're doing is you're actually opening you're creating a
power vacuum you're weakening the central authority which is the
referee the function of a democratic government is to act
as the referee to create an ecosystem where all players
are playing fairly and aren't pressing and exploiting each other
when you reduce the power of the referee and his
rules which he has set for that to happen what
that allows you you remove the regulations that allows every
private player to exploit without restriction and to seek to
overthrow the referee see every giant corporation seeks a monopoly
whether it's Microsoft Apple Google Facebook Amazon and oil companies
and so forth what's the only thing that's stopping them
you might say well it's the free market no it's
actually not the free market it's the government it's the
it's the monopoly of force it's government regulation because what
would inevitably happen if there was no serious government regulation
against monopolies and in other ways what would happen is
that one of these giant companies like Amazon would eventually
get the bright idea to hire their own militia and
to take over all the other governments all the other
companies by force because it would be profitable to them
to do so and then eventually to undermine and take
over the entire government so that they could cram themselves
King and if they ever succeeded in doing that which
maybe they could if they if we weaken the federal
government enough they actually could succeed in doing that I
don't really expect that some serious possibility but in theory
is possible but if that ever was to happen notice
what would happen we would go back to the place
where we had tyrants and kings so it would be
another cycle of hundreds or thousands of years before we
we we democratized what we would now call Amazon Amazon
would eventually through revolution and protests and so forth would
have to become democratized and it would just become exactly
what we have today you see the problem with the
corporation is that it's inherently authoritarian the guy who owns
it the people who own the stocks they call all
the shots everybody else is just they're their slave or
their employee in a sense sure you could leave the
corporation go to different corporations but the nice thing about
a democratic government is that you get a vote everybody
gets a vote theoretically I mean it's not perfect we
have problems with voting they're not perfect but it means
we have gerrymandering and so forth we can make voting
more fair but still it's way better like you don't
have any say as to the direction of Amazon and
what Amazon does but you do have some say as
to what the American government does more so than Amazon
that's why the American government is actually less oppressive and
less problematic than something like Amazon the only reason Amazon
isn't so bad perhaps in your mind is simply because
they haven't really gotten to the size of the American
government remember bending over is a massive thing so basically
what we need if we want a good society a
fair peaceful society we need some sort of benevolent overarching
force which is serving as a neutral referee for all
the independent agents making sure that they play nice it's
sort of like the parents watching over their kids in
the sandbox yes the parents set limitations on what the
kids can do you can't just you know hit another
kid with a pail full of sand in the face
can't do that sorry yeah it restricts your freedom but
you know what else that it buys you it buys
you the ability to have a nice time with friends
in the sandbox build sandcastles without having some [ __
] come and destroy it that's literally it that's what
we're talking about because the military fundamentally cannot be privatized
because if it were that would be a dictatorship basically
in effect or a tyranny the federal government is non-negotiable
so either you're gonna have a strong federal government which
is democratic or you're gonna have essentially a private government
which is going to be ownership of the military military
dictatorship you can have one or the other and the
military in case you haven't understood is socialism and collectivism
this is what's so funny about conservatives and right-wingers who
think that socialism is some absolute wrong or evil dude
the history of mankind is a history of community and
socialization we come together and we work together to protect
ourselves and to do better for ourselves to build a
better future and community for ourselves that is the essence
basically of socialism in a sense every society is socialistic
and the military is highly highly socialized although actually right
now there's a problem the American government is actually starting
to privatize the military as if that's a good idea
see the more you privatize the military the more corporations
are playing a role in the military the more the
corporations financial interests are what is guiding the direction of
the entire u.s. foreign military policy that leads us into
terrible wars and all sorts of other things so stop
Eamonn izing collectivism also stop straw banning collectivism it might
sound like I'm sitting here and arguing for some super
communist state of super collectivism some sort of hive mind
Borg a collective no I'm not arguing for that at
all I'm saying that what we have right now America
right now is collectivist already America hundred years ago you
know whenever you thought America was great it was what
1950s or the 1900s or the 1800s whenever you thought
America was great it was already highly collectivist then you
just don't realize you know on a minute because you
made some boogey man out of collectivism libertarians tend to
think that private police private fire departments private roads private
courts private education private prisons not only would they work
but they would be preferable to public versions of this
this is absurd absurd absurd absurd if you go to
third-world countries what you see is actually you see the
effects of sort of privatization in these various areas like
the police or education or prisons or courts this is
actually known as corruption see what libertarians fundamentally misunderstand is
that the nature of what corruption is libertarians him to
think that big government is more corrupt than little government
this is actually the opposite of the case if you
study the literature if you study how governments grow development
evolve which you realize that the smaller the government local
government has more corruption not less because it's less accountable
because it's smaller it's easier to corrupt it's much easier
to corrupt one sheriff or one judge in a small
thousand person town in the middle of nowhere it's much
harder to corrupt some judge or sheriff in a giant
city like New York City because they have internal affairs
departments they have regulators looking over them they have other
judges other police people it wouldn't even be that advantageous
to bribe or corrupt a single judge or a single
sheriff in New York City because you you wouldn't even
know whether that judge or that sheriff would be even
looking over your case whereas in a small town there's
probably only one judge one sheriff you know exactly who
you need to bribe in countries that are less developed
like India Russia Brazil China the Philippines elsewhere corruption is
rampant the reason it's rampant is because the very nature
of humans when they're tribal the closer you get you
roll back the more you roll back the clock the
closer you get to our original tribal roots in tribes
corruption is it's just the norm what corruption basically is
is it's cronyism its favoritism so for example if I'm
if I'm the chief of my tribe and you come
to me and you want something for me we can
make a deal together you can offer me something I
can offer you something I can make you a deal
you don't want to refuse that sort of stuff this
kind of mafia stuff where did the mafia come from
it comes from Italy rural parts of Italy which were
basically kind of tribalistic they weren't very develop there wasn't
much regulation and everybody was sort of creating a little
family so my family that's literally what corruption is is
when you treat some small segment of the population as
your family and everybody else as external so you can
exploit the external ones for the benefit of the internal
ones that's fundamentally what corruption is it's favoritism it's playing
favorites it's a lack of neutrality it's selfish bias survival
and in places where regulation is lacking like in Russia
India China Brazil elsewhere corruption is rampant and it's horrible
it's horrible in Russia for example police will just stop
you on the street and the only reason they stopped
you is because they're expecting a bribe you just bribed
them with cash and they keep driving this is standard
practice in Russia at least when I was there some
10 or 15 years ago last time I was there
I'm standard practice I'm pretty sure it's still that way
today and it's that way in in most countries in
most third-world countries you can't start a business unless you
bribe some official impossible impossible to maintain your business you
might say oh but leave these all these problems only
get worse with bigger government no that's where you're wrong
they get better with bigger government because there's more regulation
more oversight more transparency more infrastructure and bureaucracy gets created
you [ __ ] libertarians with your bureaucracy you've got
this attitude of Antibes you're actually you you think you're
actually is a bad thing bureaucracies not a bad thing
you need to study what a bureaucracy is and why
it exists bureaucracy was invented to eliminate corruption the reason
is so rigid the reason when you go into the
DMV and there's a certain protocol that you have to
follow the sand and lie and wait for a ticket
that you know the clerk has to help you they
have to like do things in this sort of very
rigid way is because that's how you eliminate corruption if
it was just willy nilly if you could just kind
of go to the DMV maybe slip the guy a
you know 50 bucks to put you forward in line
and then you know you pay about you slip another
hundred bucks to get you a the kind of driver's
license you want put put the kind of age you
want on it and so forth happens in most other
countries around the world it's it's it's it's horribly inefficient
and it harms the entire community it's like an internal
friction if we think of of a society or a
community as as a fluid you know in physics fluid
fluids have a property called viscosity different kinds of viscosity
high viscosity means it's very thick fluid like honey or
oil and then low viscosity is like water it's very
thin so the ideal community would have low viscosity where
everything is functioning smoothly without a lot of energy lost
to friction but in a in a small when the
government is small there's more corruption and that corruption eats
up a lot of resources because everybody's cheating everybody else
basically with this corruption everybody's playing favorites trying to get
for themselves in doing that by being so selfish we
end up hurting everybody collectively but to solve that we
need more regulation not less we need bigger government not
smaller another thing that libertarians fundamentally misunderstand is the function
of the ego mind and selfishness the libertarian takes selfishness
totally for granted the libertarian does not understand how selfish
humans are how blind they are to their own selfishness
and how exploitative the human mind will be the human
mind will exploit any system in the free market any
without any moral qualms if a system can be exploited
it will be exploited so for you libertarians that the
challenge for you is to think through your policies and
the system you want to construct and to don't ask
how would a decent person operate in the system ask
how would the most narcissistic bloodthirsty ruthless sociopathic psychopathic selfish
person egotistical person how would that person operate and this
is how would he explain your system that's the real
problem if you don't create a system which keeps those
people in check they will monopolize the entire system and
they will become tyrants do not assume that just because
you're good just because you're living up to your libertarian
moral standards and that you treat people nicely and that
you would never do such a thing that there aren't
egos in the world who would there are millions of
them who would libertarians fundamentally misunderstand relativity I have a
whole episode called relativity understanding relativity part 1 I'm gonna
release a part 2 as well in the future relativity
just basically means that everything in a sense is relative
to something else there's no absolute good or bad good
and bad is relative to your identity and your survival
agenda go check out my episodes called understanding survival part
1 part 2 which explain this the relativity of survival
in enormous detail very important you will transform your whole
life by watching those two episodes if you're a libertarian
yeah so I hate to break it to you but
there's no such thing as good and bad they don't
exist this is all an invention of your own mind
they've never existed good and bad are simply what your
ego thinks is good and bad for its survival good
and bad is socially and mentally constructed natural law does
not exist natural rights do not exist property rights do
not exist these are all human inventions they all have
to be invented and they all had to be codified
into an infrastructure part of which is culture which is
why you have these in the first place the reason
you as a libertarian think that there are such things
as natural laws and actual rights and property rides and
good and bad and morality and all this the reason
you think that is simply because this was programmed to
you by the infrastructure the software of your community that's
why you think that and in and because of that
you think it's objective you think it existed all the
time or that it exists somewhere outside of the human
mind it doesn't and what's worse is that every community
has their own set of natural laws and natural rights
and property rights and good and bad what they consider
those things now of course you could make the case
that well allele every society on the planet believes that
murder is wrong or that rape is wrong actually that's
not true every the more true statement is that every
Society of the plan to come it's murder in different
ways and then they just rationalize it and justify it
as whether it's okay or not okay in different ways
see this is all highly relative is giving a criminal
the death penalty like it's giving a drug addict or
not not drugging it but is giving a drug trafficker
the death penalty as they do in China is that
good or is that bad is that morally right or
wrong is that fair or unfair whatever idea you have
it's completely relative there is no way that it actually
is it is how you think it is and unless
you think that it is that way it isn't any
way at all that's what relativity means you know it's
it's funny to me of course if you're a strong
libertarian or gonna deny this but just consider the following
point in science in the most hard-core of scientific disciplines
in physics science has long ago proven and accepted as
consensus that physical space and time itself are relative this
was demonstrated by people like liveness in terms of the
relativity of space and Albert Einstein in terms of the
relativity of time despite this most people still our culture
by large doesn't appreciate the significance of the relativity of
these two things space and time so think about this
physical space and time are [ __ ] relative and
yet you somehow think that your human idea of good
and bad and moral and immoral that this is not
relative but absolute come on get real you're so full
of [ __ ] really appreciate what Einstein discovered time
physical time the [ __ ] clock that is sitting
on your wall or on your wrist is relative yeah
so your entire moral system is completely arbitrary and relative
and it's worse than arbitrary it's completely selfish it's completely
corrupted and self biased by your selfish agenda and the
only way we fix that is through better infrastructure the
next thing that libertarians really get wrong is they they
fundamentally misunderstand the complexity and scale of reality and commune
I'm into said community of community they take complexity and
scale for granted many of these libertarians are anarchists they
will reason about their political ideas and policies using this
various kind of simplistic notion like well there's two farmers
living out in the woods and then like one farmer
comes to the other farmer steals his land and like
this very simple low scale it's a scale we're talking
about you know a hundred people at a scale of
hundred people there's a lot of stuff that works on
a scale of a hundred people or a thousand people
that does not work at a scale of a million
or a billion or eight billion people and the complexity
that exists in these simplistic examples of like oh well
yeah some farmers is building a road and then his
neighbor comes by and they get into an argument and
they settle the argument blah blah blah blah blah this
is this is not the complex that you have society
in the 21st century we're talking about gigantic bureaucracies organizations
within organizations within organizations we're talking about thousands millions of
regulations we're talking about multiple levels of policing and enforcement
and regulation and you might say well this is yeah
this is all bad stuff no it's not bad stuff
this is absolutely critical the reason this much layer is
necessary is because it's complex reality is complex our society
is so complex in a little village you don't have
a lot of complexity there aren't cars and motorcycles and
airplanes and you know prisons and internet providers there aren't
all this complex stuff the more our society grows the
more complex our community becomes the more complex our government
needs to be to properly regulate it it's actually similar
to writing software code a complex operating system has many
many layers within it of regulation you can't just have
some software app that you load onto onto a Mac
or onto a Windows machine and this app just has
total freedom to do whatever the [ __ ] it
wants it doesn't have access to just all parts of
RAM and all parts of the CPU and all the
bios and all that stuff no it's highly highly restricted
because the potential for abuse is enormous if you give
that kind of power or freedom freedom's a better word
that kind of freedom to an app which is why
Microsoft patches Windows like every single week they're patching windows
they're just patching and patching and every this is the
bane of every software company in the world is they
just they keep patching [ __ ] non-stop they have
to keep patching [ __ ] why do they issue
all these patches because they're constant being exploited by hackers
the function of a good operating system is precisely that
it sets rules and regulations for what your apps can
do this restricts the freedom of the app but also
it creates for a more stable ecosystem when you allow
any app to do whatever it wants in an operating
system the opera system gives you the blue screen of
death everyday which used to happen a lot and something
like Windows 95 if you remember those days and then
Microsoft made their systems more complex they started to separate
various layers of the BIOS and the software curtain up
OS kernel and all this this herd is a separate
compartmentalize everything draw borders around every app restrict what any
app can possibly do such that now Windows is pretty
damn stable I can run Windows for like a month
and not experience a crash why because of all these
restrictions that Microsoft has thankfully put in place I don't
want to be working on Windows 95 even though Windows
95 was probably a lot freer you could run it
right like any kind of virus you wanted for Windows
95 hijack the entire system you see as software gets
more complicated as hackers get more complicated Microsoft has to
get more complicated with its code in a sense government
has to get more complicated Microsoft is to substitute for
government here they have to get more complicated with their
regulations become more restrictive but don't try to think of
this as some authoritarian scheme it's not it doesn't have
to be it doesn't have to be a tyranny don't
straw me on this libertarians lack systemic thinking go check
out my episode called system's thinking right it's called an
intro to systems thinking to be exact which goes into
a lot of depth on system singing which I can't
explain here but fundamentally you know because the libertarian is
just thinking from his own selfish point of view and
kind of what's good for him and what he thinks
is right his own personal philosophy he's not thinking about
like how different people have different philosophies different worldviews not
everyone is a libertarian not everyone has the same moral
system there's complex systems that work within society they're there
for a reason a lot of times they work in
counterintuitive ways where you think you're gonna you know you're
gonna make something better but it ends up backfiring make
something worse the one of the secrets to or one
of the principles of systems thing is that before you
start to change a system you have to go observe
the system and study the counterintuitive ways in which it
works which is exactly what a libertarian does not do
for example libertarians not gonna go study a system like
Social Security or some health care system of the government
to really think about how that system works and what
benefits it provides what limitations it has and so for
what the trade-offs are how to maybe improve the system
liberal care doesn't care about celebrity and just has this
dumb ideological position of like well more complexity more government
bad more regulation bad less regulation good small government good
like this is this is grossly inadequate to deal with
the complexities of a modern civilization ah cracy is absolutely
necessary at mass scale scale is the crucial thing here
the dynamics completely change what works at a tribe of
a thousand people is not going to work in New
York City you need completely new solutions so your simplistic
libertarian and inner and artistic examples they just don't fly
it might work in the countryside with a hundred people
but it ain't going to work in the cities and
societies we live in today libertarians also don't understand whole
lawns I'll have a video on Holland's in the future
but what Holland's mean is that all of reality is
man of whole ons a whole on as a whole
in a part simultaneously everything in reality is about the
whole and a part so for example you could say
my body is a whole you can say it's a
human called leo okay here it is it's a whole
on it's made of parts parts like organs heart kidneys
liver etc so I have organs each of those organs
has sub parts you know the hearts the liver has
its own individual parts each of those parts has its
own parts which are individual cells each cell has individual
parts which are organelles all of those organelles are made
up of smaller parts called proteins those are made of
amino acids those made of smaller parts called what what
I mean I mean you ask this minute like carbon
and nitrogen that kind of stuff basically atoms or molecules
of stuff organic molecules those are made of atoms then
atoms are made out of subatomic particles protons electrons quarks
and and down and down and goes and up and
up it goes you know Leo is part of something
bigger part of a the planet part of the community
part of a lot part of the universe these are
all whole ons but you might say that's obvious but
but what's not so obvious is that there's a trade-off
every hole on in the universe is very delicately balancing
the trade-off between its own individuality or autonomy as they
call it and community so you see the cells that
make up my face right now on the one hand
they have a certain amount of autonomy they're able to
do their own thing every cell in my face has
its own individual ability to open eye on channels allow
certain chemicals and materials to come in certain to come
out it can you know replicate it can heal itself
repair itself and so forth every cell has that in
the entire body a trillion trillions of these cells that's
pretty amazing but at the same time every cell is
part of a larger whole and working to towards a
larger goal beyond itself so if a cell just really
nearly decides it like hey I'm gonna do whatever the
[ __ ] I want I'm not gonna be a
part of this collective community called Leo I'll just do
whatever the [ __ ] I want I know you
know what I want I just want to reproduce I
don't give a [ __ ] about these other cells
I'm just gonna multiply as much as I want you
know that's called cancer that's cancer in order for some
larger order thing to emerge which is called a human
being sitting here speaking to you every cell in this
body of a trillion cells has to coordinate with each
other I mean this is this is staggering it's staggering
when you think about this the scope of reality is
[ __ ] staggering is just a single human being
in a giant universe of trillions of other beings it's
staggering what my body is doing right now just to
deliver these words to you you're you should have be
having chills running up your spine right now as you're
realizing what I'm telling you because it's so profound every
cell is coordinated and playing part it's giving up its
individual freedoms to be part of a larger community which
is the organs that are making up my body which
then also give up their own individual autonomy no my
heart can't just do whatever the [ __ ] it
wants it can't beat at a certain rate that it
might want to it has to beat at the rate
it needs to in order for my mouth to move
my mouth muscles need to coordinate with my brain need
to coordinate with my hands all this my eyes all
of it needs to coordinate together to be able to
produce something like this conversation that we're having right now
and the only way that's possible is because there is
an exquisite balance between autonomy and community happening at the
entire scale of reality at every level of hold on
get that this is this is so fundamental and yet
this is exactly what libertarians don't understand because libertarians they
create this false choice as though autonomy is good and
community is bad and surrendering any kind of autonomy for
the sake of some higher good that this is somehow
terrible it's not terrible this is what creates your body
literally you are made out of the thing which is
contradicting your entire libertarian worldview you the thing you think
is an individual is actually a community of a trillion
cells working together selflessly sacrificing so that you can be
there spouting your [ __ ] libertarian ideology that's how
[ __ ] delusional you are how ignorant you are
of what's really going on you're like a tiny speck
with an agile ocean and you think that you are
the whole ocean no your ass tiny little speck community
requires sacrifice reality is constantly evolution is constantly pushing reality
to create more complex life forms more complex communities and
social institutions and there's no end to this it's gonna
keep happening so get rid of this fantasy that we're
gonna at some point a thousand years humans are gonna
be living as that you know in some bucolic pastoral
setting in the grass somewhere on a farm this is
not gonna happen in a thousand years humans will probably
all be interconnected in some borg hive mind [ __
] collective you will just be able to you're born
you're instantly plugged into the [ __ ] matrix in
that matrix you have unlimited [ __ ] power you
can just basically be in a virtual world of your
own creation you can create whatever virtual world you want
you can you can have family you can have sex
you can do whatever you want and it'll be as
good or better than physical reality that's probably what we're
heading to in the very long term we're heading to
ridiculously uncomfortable levels of collectivism now we don't have to
really worry about that too much in practice because we're
gonna be dead by then so it's not going to
be a problem but society is constantly battling itself over
higher and higher orders of collectivism like if you just
rewind the clock 200 years go back to the Revolutionary
War before the United States was a federal single Union
every colony the 13 original colonies it was just a
Federation of you know colonies every colony wanted to maintain
its autonomy and every you can actually go back and
read the writings of our founding fathers many of them
argued that we shouldn't even have a United States they
argued that the whole point was to have the autonomy
of the individual colonies and that that was the right
way basically they were taking the libertarian position and but
then other of our founding fathers they had more vision
and they were able to see that no we will
be stronger because we have enemies we have France we
have Germany we have other Russia enemies from around you
know who can dominate us we're gonna be better off
if we unite as a as the United States and
so they pushed for it there was a lot of
resistance there's a lot of you know nail uh teeth
pulling basically a lot of teeth had to be pulled
to get this to happen because again the the reasoning
was very much the libertarian one the people who were
against the United States who wanted just the colonies they
basically argued that they don't want to be taxed it
was a sort of an anti taxation argument and they
don't want to give up their individual sovereignty yes colonies
to some tyrannical government but of course now 200 years
later it's obvious to us that the United States is
much stronger and better as a as a Union than
it is as an individual 50 countries or colony see
the advantage of a union is that it it works
more smoothly on the insides you don't have to fight
yourself if we had if every state in the Union
all 50 of them was its own country you would
have to have its own military its own bigger I
mean they already do have their own governments but their
governments would have to be bigger because they'd have to
manage military they have to manage all sorts of internal
affairs stuff and there'd be a lot more overhead there
it would be highly inefficient and on top of all
that these states would all fight with each other what
prevents California from new king New York City have you
thought about that think about that you've probably never thought
about that in your entire life have you I would
submit to you that the only thing that prevents that
is the fact that we're a union and we have
a larger organization that coordinates these things creates a unified
sense of identity between us such that we don't even
recognize a need to want to bomb a neighboring city
because we see that city as being part of who
we are but when it comes to Russia now there's
something else we can nuke them or when it comes
to you know North Korea we could nuke them because
they have they're not they're not part of us they're
not part of our collective so a lot of energy
is wasted by fighting between small parts which is why
unification happened in the be in the first place with
with human cities and towns and so forth they became
more efficient and more powerful less wasteful of energy when
they weren't constantly fighting with each other can you imagine
if every city in the United States had his own
militia the way that cities had to 3000 years ago
during the Roman times every city had a perimeter wall
built around it with its own militia can you imagine
how inefficient this would be how restrictive this would be
you couldn't just get in a car and travel across
the country to a nice road trip stay in a
motel go to New York go to Boston go to
Canada drive up there and you couldn't do this this
freedom is only afforded by the fact that we were
united under one power which has a monopoly of force
a monopoly of force is absolutely necessary because the whole
point the reason that a community can have peaceful cooperation
is because we come together in a community and then
we say okay obviously I can't be my own policeman
because I'm selfish I could be corrupt if everybody was
their own policeman in a small community everyone would have
a gun everybody would shoot everybody else as soon as
they felt that they were wronged but the problem is
that people are selfish and biased so you can't trust
people to carry out their own justice so when we
come together to come because it's too violent I mean
you can do it there are communities like that but
it turns into gangs of New York so to make
that work we come together and we say okay I'm
gonna give up my gun you're gonna give up your
gun I'm gonna give up my right to kill your
children you're gonna give up your right to kill your
my children I'm gonna go up my right to steal
from you you're gonna give up your right to steal
from me and we're gonna live peacefully together and we're
gonna trade and do nice things that we all agree
are decent and fine but if any one of us
cheats or violates that then we all agreed that we're
gonna go to this person here who is the judge
or the King whatever he's gonna look at our case
he's gonna be neutral and unbiased or he's not gonna
be corrupted by any one of us he's gonna be
incorruptible he's not gonna take bribes from us he's gonna
be an independent power he's gonna look over us and
he will determine who is in the right who was
in the wrong who violated the rules that we all
agree to and wrote down on this giant piece of
paper the Constitution or whatever he's gonna look at that
check it and then he's gonna issue a verdict and
he's gonna say I was right and you're wrong and
then if you're wrong you have to pay me restitution
and if you refuse he has police he will send
to take it from you or the his bank will
seize money from your bank and so forth put a
lien on your property sell your property to pay for
my needs whatever is how peace is created when you
don't have this kind of court system in place with
a monopoly of force that means that force is divided
if there are two different judges we can go to
if I can go to this judge or that judge
this one's more favorable to me I can bribe him
you could bribed that one then this one has its
own army that one has its own army now we're
gonna have a a war you see so there has
to be one Authority because if there's two authorities those
two authorities will clash with each other now of course
can the judge get corrupted of course he can but
that's still far preferable to having individuals carry out their
justice themselves and you know what happens in society or
community where justice is not fairly carried out in a
neutral impartial manner what happens that people take justice into
their own hands so for example if we're living in
a community where there is not an impartial authority arbiter
who can issue fair judgments and also enforce those judgements
it's not enough just to issue them he has to
enforce them there has to be teeth because if you've
wronged me and the judge issues that verdict that now
you have to pay me restitution but he has no
teeth to enforce it that means I will not feel
like I've been compensated and I will feel outraged rightly
so because maybe you stole something from me maybe you
killed a relative of mine i need compensation for that
and if that guy cannot enforce the compensation that i
feel i am owed and that most of us agree
is you know the rules that we agreed to live
by i am going to say [ __ ] this
community [ __ ] this society i'm taking this into
my own hands I'm gonna go get a knife I'm
gonna go to his house I'm gonna slit throat of
his children that's how this is settled this is not
I'm not funny I'm not kidding this is how it
is settled in imprimatur primitive governments there are many places
around the world where this is how it's settled these
are places which don't have quality court systems or maybe
no court systems at all and you can't have a
core system without a monopoly force and you can't have
a court system without regulations without bureaucracy and big government
when you call big government by the way small government
versus big government's another thing that's completely relative this is
something conservatives understand totally relative what is small government I
mean there's there's really no such thing you might call
the United States right now a big government but I
guarantee you in a thousand years what we have today
will look like tiny government and you might say that
well the America that existed three hundred years ago right
around the revolution that was small government now as those
were the good old days where small government was the
thing no but the people who lived in that time
they thought that was too big of a government there
were people alive that time who were complaining about the
government being too big back then there were people who
were alive a thousand years ago complaining that even their
little city-state was too big of a government they wanted
more freedom there's always people who [ __ ] and
moan about wanting more freedom of course there are it's
tempting to to wanna [ __ ] and moan because
it's very easy to to overlook what the relinquishing of
that freedom really Bayou Soaker it actually is not a
function of size corruption is a function of the level
of consciousness and selfishness and fear of the individual members
who make up the society the less developed people are
the less infrastructure there is the more corruption there will
be libertarians also fundamentally misunderstand the notion of responsibility and
this is one of the core pillars of their whole
philosophy in fact I want to quote here one of
the early libertarians Nathaniel Branden who otherwise I actually respect
he he wrote some great books and he did some
great work on self-esteem he wrote the six pillars of
self-esteem book you might have heard me talk about a
while back great book but he was a libertarian which
is a problem he was also a husband he was
married to Iran actually so that's where he picked up
his his libertarian mind virus but here's what he says
about libertarianism he says quote the libertarian mentality is a
non entitlement mentality the libertarian mentality presupposes a person's willingness
to accept responsibility for his or her own existence and
quote I watched a talk of Nathaniel Branden where he
gave this quote and he was talking about how the
whole problem with people today is that they don't take
responsibility enough individual responsibility and that's that's where a libertarian
income comes in but this is this is to completely
misunderstand human psychology the ego mind fundamentally wants to avoid
responsibility people are not responsible that's the whole problem if
people were responsible if people were angels if people were
moral as you expect them to be then we wouldn't
need laws we wouldn't need courts we wouldn't need police
we wouldn't need military we wouldn't have this talk but
that's fantasy people are exactly the opposite of that people
are utterly [ __ ] selfish and what's worse is
that they are completely in denial and blind to their
own selfishness they think that what they are doing isn't
selfish but that it's good it's righteous and it's moral
and they think that what everybody else is doing is
wrong and evil and irresponsible responsibility requires development and consciousness
which most people don't have social problems rather sorry social
solutions policy prescriptions need to be written and conceived in
such a way as they take into account people who
are not very intelligent and not very responsible and not
very forward-thinking because that's how the masses of people are
there sheep you can't create laws at a society that
assumes the best of people because there's not enough of
them relative to the general population the general population is
not educated didn't go to college many of them barely
finished high school they're ignorant there's a lot of stuff
they don't understand and they're incapable of taking responsibility for
themselves the whole point of government is to safeguard for
those who are unable to take the responsibility that someone
who's more responsible is able to take so for I'm
gonna give you two concrete examples here to drive this
whole point about responsibility the first is social security in
the United States Social Security was passed some 60 years
ago or 70 years ago after the Great Depression why
did they pass Social Security because at that point the
population was aging and because the depression so forth people
didn't save up enough money so basically something like a
quarter or even half of the elderly population of America
were poor living on the streets just begging for food
and scraps because they didn't save up for retirement now
the libertarian will come in here and say AHA that's
because they have failed at taking personal responsibility if they
took more personal responsibility we would not need to create
some social program to give them Social Security everybody can
just invest by themselves Leo we can inter step up
you can have a 401k invest in it for 40
years and then you'll have a nice cushy retirement that
is the proper free market solution to the problem what
kind of [ __ ] fantasy world are you living
in where you are gonna entrust people to save to
put money for 40 [ __ ] years into an
account and then to manage that account so that's not
lost it's not cheated out you know by Wall Street
wolves it's not cheated from them not scammed whatever you're
gonna you're gonna trust the average person to invest for
40 years to think 40 years down the road to
make the connection between what they're doing now and how
they're gonna feel when they're 65 or 70 years old
and they're not gonna be able to work anymore you
expect some kid who's 30 years old full of energy
full of vibrant health and all this you know eager
to have sex and drugs and you expect that kid
to be able to start putting money away for retirement
I mean you're an idiot if that's what you expect
it's not gonna happen this is the perfect situation in
which somebody who's more responsible a more forward looking looking
40 years down the road is very [ __ ]
hard it's very hard to discipline yourself like that very
few humans can do that which is why it's nice
to have some really smart people in government who will
think this [ __ ] up for you create systems
that make it easy and automatic we just deduct it
from your from your paycheck every every month you don't
need to think about it too much you don't need
to do anything you don't need to worry about it
but it'll just accumulate then it'll pay off you'll get
the benefits once you retire and in this way a
lot of you know millions literally tens of millions of
elderly people were saved from premature death health problems running
out of money and littering our streets as as homeless
people now see here again here's where the communal aspect
becomes so important if you're a libertarian and all you
care about is your own individual responsibility you might say
well well so what yes so Leo let's just let
all those people screw themselves why should I as the
responsible one have to pay taxes to you know to
fund their mistakes and they're ignorant that's a fair point
but consider this you're not living alone you're living in
a community so consider the consequences of your proposal here
you say we're gonna get rid of Social Security because
you don't like the fact that you have to pay
money into it every month you feel that it's oppressive
you feel that the government is forcing it from you
okay but then in 40 or 60 years you are
gonna be living in a society where half the elderly
population is sick crippled disabled and living on the streets
in your neighborhood how are you gonna feel about that
you think homeless problems are a problem now you think
panhandling is a problem now wait till you get a
load of what happens when you get rid of Social
Security see you yourself will not want to live in
that world you have to be realistic about what people
are able to do as individuals most people are highly
irresponsible it takes a lot of sophistication education development and
grooming to grow into a responsible adult just like kids
in the sandbox it's absurd for parents just let kids
play in the sandbox unattended to do whatever they want
and just to say oh well you know the kids
they should be responsible for themselves and you know what
if I if a kids get gets you know gets
his heads his skull smashed in by a rock some
other kid you know throws at him he wasn't taking
enough personal responsibility that's his problem see this is this
is utter selfishness it's an utter lack of compassion it's
a letter ACK of lack of knowledge Minh that you're
part of a community you're not living by yourself the
libertarian whenever he's pushed into a corner I've notice this
in their debates whenever you get pushed into a corner
they always sort of say well in the end in
the end you just take personal responsibility and you just
sort of you deal with the consequences of your poor
decisions that's though it's always like their fallback strategy because
a lot of times they want to eliminate all these
policies and proposals and programs that are there to safeguard
people and they take on this attitude of arrogance where
they think that they themselves are invincible they think that
it's like well yeah it's okay if if if we
don't have a health care system a national health care
system because you know I got good health and those
people who get sick there are the people who you
know smoke cigarettes and drink drink alcohol and do drugs
and eat too much that's why they're sick so that's
their problem it's not my problem yeah until you get
cancer until you have a child who's born with a
genetic birth defect and you can't afford to pay for
his medication because the job you're working at doesn't pay
you enough to pay these exorbitant prices and some of
these drug companies are gouging us for in order to
you know make a killing because by the way the
entire health care system in America is a syndicate you
understand this speaking of mafias we have a healthcare mafia
in this country and you libertarians are responsible for for
perpetuating it of course this is not a responsibility that
you are willing to take so the irony of libertarians
is that even though they preach personal responsibility they are
utterly collectively irresponsible there's not one type of responsibilities there's
two fundamental types personal responsibility and collective responsibility the libertarian
shirks collective responsibility tries to pretend as though it doesn't
exist see it's foolish to expect people to have enough
foresight to save up a bunch of money in the
case that they have a child and that child is
born with a genetic birth defect that requires them to
pay thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to correct
it it's completely collectively irresponsible to expect that of individuals
we need a system that will make that easy to
deal with by having compassion and empathy for each other
understanding that hey you know what just because I'm in
a good position right now today just because I have
millions of dollars just because I have healthy you know
but I'm healthy and my children and family are healthy
just because that's the case today doesn't mean that tomorrow
something terrible won't happen I might lose my job I
might lose my health I might discover some rare cancer
that I have I might you know my children might
get run over by a car whatever happens but then
I might need help with that the whole point of
a community is that it's safeguards us against calamitous life
destroying accidents and tragedies that are common in nature if
you were living in the jungle a bear might just
you know come out of the wilderness and maul you
nearly kill you in which case it's very handy to
have some tribesmen your own family or something that can
come grab you drag you back heal you up bring
you back to life get you back on your feet
you know feed you food for months and so forth
rehabilitate you then you can rejoin them you can repay
them by you know participating in society and then you
can help them when they get mauled by a bear
or something that's one of the functions but when you
say like oh that guy got by a bear they
said you're like oh well but individual responsibility man you
got mauled by a bear well why were you walking
next to the Bears cave you shouldn't have done that
that's your problem now you deal with it this is
the selfishness of the latarian libertarian philosophy it's utterly irresponsible
and to really drive this point home let's of course
talk about the elephant in the room right now which
is Cove in nineteen if anything has demonstrated the the
complete unten ability of libertarian philosophy its koban nineteen especially
in America and America's response a lot of America's current
response with the Trump administration is directly coming from a
sort of libertarian philosophy this sort of like laissez-faire like
oh well the virus is out there we'll just let
the states deal with it the local governments can deal
with it you know we're not gonna do much testing
we're not gonna we're not gonna ask for masks we're
going to pass any any serious legislation we're not gonna
really push too hard for anything we're gonna let private
companies just make a vaccine whenever they want on their
time good it's kind of this kind of like it's
everyone's individual responsibility it's your responsibility to wear a mask
you can wear what if you want to if you
don't want to don't wear one that's on you you'll
suffer the consequences this this this this attitude we can
clearly see now the flaws of this attitude especially with
a virus because we live in a [ __ ]
community we're not individuals we're interconnected when I get sick
you get sick when you get sick I get sick
if I am not wearing a mask because I don't
give a [ __ ] maybe I won't get sick
but I will cause you to get sick because I
have no symptoms I don't even know what I don't
get tested but I caused you to get sick because
the point of a wearing mask is not for me
but more for you the point of you wearing a
mask is not for you but for me see so
we're reciprocating that's how community works but people who are
stuck on libertarianism they understand that the function how reciprocity
works I scratch your back you scratch mine and so
we see the clear results of that and we see
in nations which have a coordinated effort against kovat like
in China like in Europe like in New Zealand and
other places of course New Zealand was very small so
it's easier for them but you know China of course
China's very authoritarian but still it shows you the power
and effectiveness of a coordinated response if China had a
libertarian philosophy I don't know how many millions more would
die in China than they have I mean not that
many have died in China but I mean if they
had a libertarian philosophy running the Chinese government I'm telling
you millions of Chinese would be dead maybe tens of
millions so just think that through also I hear some
of you libertarians will say olio but there said that
classic quote by Brent Ben Franklin whoever who says something
like that along the lines of like he who would
sacrifice individual freedom for security will end up with neither
or something like that it sounds good on paper again
in pure philosophy land it sounds good but in the
real world freedom has zero value unless you're secure you
can't care about freedom of you're dead it makes little
difference to you all the freedoms you have if you
don't have any security so security is actually more fundamental
than freedom it's more important for life and for organisms
security comes first then freedom is a luxury you're gonna
struggle to be a libertarian if you catch go in
19 cuz it's gonna kill you see to be a
libertarian you first have to be alive so most libertarians
today what they do is that they take their own
privilege seriously for granted which is why it's mostly young
white males who tend to lean towards libertarianism more so
than females or people of color because females and people
of color they have more of a sense of their
weaker position within society they they understand how easily they
can be oppressed because they were in the past for
long periods of time they're physically weaker usually they don't
control the levers of power as much in America at
least and so and so yeah they clearly see that
they need help they need help from a benevolent government
to regulate things and to equalize the playing field they
want a referee you know who doesn't want a referee
the guy who's dominating the [ __ ] field why
would he need a referee cuz hey I'm beating everybody
I'm bullying everybody so I don't need a referee but
that's super irresponsible to behave that way that makes you
an entitled bully you're not really part of a community
you're acting highly selfishly let's see what else we have
yet to cover so much material here but it's all
real good it's really I think drilling this material into
your mind here if you want the closest example of
a real world example of libertarianism in action go look
at Liberia or Somalia or the Congo that's what Eric
ISM looks like that's what society and life looks like
for people when they don't have a high quality bureaucracy
and infrastructure no police no courts and so forth in
a sense there's sort of a common common trend between
libertarians and communists they're both utopian they're both idealists they
both have these sort of lofty notions of how like
yeah all of us will just work together peacefully and
coexist no no no it doesn't work because humans are
fundamentally selfish the problem with communism is that it assumes
that people are gonna be to sell to selfless they
aren't that selfless enough communism might exist once people become
super selfless but if can't exist now is why I
failed in Russia for example in practice in Russia what
happened was that they had the ideal of communism where
we were all gonna work in in a co-op together
and where no one's gonna be the boss of anybody
else and and we're gonna all share in the spoils
of our labor and all that but in practice would
happen know that people were so selfish and so corrupt
that it just again it devolved into syndicates and then
pyramid like power structures where one guy the table basically
some mafia guy took control of that part of society
and he got all the rewards everybody else was was
left high and dry there's a very good reason why
libertarian states don't exist you might say well but Leah
what if we what if we create a libertarian state
I've actually I've seen some like big billionaire libertarians actually
come up with like stupid ideas like this where they
believe I an island somewhere in the middle of nowhere
and we're gonna build the perfect libertarian state it'll be
maximum freedom there'll be freedom of speech and freedom of
this and freedom of that if you actually do that
what's gonna happen is that it's going to devolve into
tribes factions syndicates and mafias that little society that you
have let's say you put a thousand people on an
island somewhere in the in the Pacific there's no rules
because everyone wants freedom you can do whatever you can
have sex whatever you want you can you know make
money however you want or whatever eventually what happens is
it because everybody's selfish they're they start acting out selfishly
without any concern or regard for how their selfishness is
impacting the selfishness or the the the feelings and the
needs of other people so they start exploiting each other
and then as individuals explore each other more they're gonna
combine into collectives into syndicates there'll be factions eventually factions
will eat up other factions until in the end your
eyelid will just have two factions the red faction the
blue faction and these two factions will fight for each
other whoever wins will dominate slaughter the other faction and
then that one factual say the red faction wins the
red faction will then crown itself king and it'll be
a tyranny and there will be no freedom that's the
reality of it another thing that libertarians don't have any
clue about at all is developmental psychology that's a deep
topic I have a lot to say about that which
I will in the future but also I have in
the past through my spiral dynamics series go check out
all my videos on spiral dynamics you basically need to
to really understand the problem with libertarianism and where libertarianism
fits in to the to the different stages of human
development but what libertarians misunderstand is that humans are fundamentally
not all the same we are at different levels of
development and these levels are very significant each development developmental
level corresponds with its own view of reality basically each
level is living in a different reality in a sense
and society is composed at these different levels there's also
cognitive levels of development moral levels spiritual development cultural development
and there's different states of consciousness that people are at
this creates an enormous amount of diversity such that just
because you as a libertarian might be at a relatively
high level of development that doesn't mean like maybe morally
that doesn't mean that everybody else is and of course
however high you are there's much higher to go beyond
where you currently are and so basically libertarianism is what's
called the Spile dynamic stage orange level of development cognitive
development and moral development it's a pretty low stage there's
nothing there's nothing unique about your libertarian philosophy it's not
intelligent it's not wise it's not special it's extremely predictable
you've been inspected with a mind virus from this iron
Rand Nathaniel Branden camp and this is a popular mind
virus that's going around American culture these days it has
for about 60 or 70 years and it corresponds with
the current stage of development of our culture and our
society and if you want you can learn about higher
levels that you can access part of my function here
is to help you to access those higher levels which
you can but in order to access those levels you
have to first admit that libertarianism is insufficient that is
dysfunctional in many ways it's unhealthy and that there's there's
higher there's something better but for that you have an
open mind which of course most libertarians don't which is
why you're a libertarian to begin with and by the
way iron Rand lion ran was a reactionary ideological reactionary
who was right at that perfect time in history where
society American society was making a transition from stage blue
to orange she grew up in Soviet communist Russia she
moved here Soviet communist Russia was basically staged blue and
red she moved here American society was still staged blue
moving into orange she liked the capital system the orange
system so she would all in and wrote several of
these massive pretentious novels about the value of individualism and
moral responsibility and personal responsibility and and [ __ ]
the collectivism and all that because she was reacting as
communism understandable but was still reactionary and so she was
basically just she was just parroting stage Orange ideology that's
all that our books are and there is some value
in reading those books but overall they're there they're way
way way what's it called over overpraised over appreciate a
something like that I'm forgetting the words yeah so it
there's much better stuff out there if you're taking iron
Rand as your source of understanding of politics and human
nature you [ __ ] up badly time to find
better sources alright so there we go that's that's basically
what I wanted to communicate let me address a couple
of objections that I know libertarians will have number one
is that they will say but Leo just because a
libertarian state has never existed in human history doesn't mean
that it's impossible in the future after all for example
slavery existed like you said for thousands of years and
then it was abolished it you know it seemed like
slavery was impossible to abolish 200 years ago and now
here we are with no slavery so Leo why are
you artificially limiting the potential of mankind by saying that
a libertarian state will never be possible okay that's the
interesting objection so my response to that is that actually
in the very far distant future if we're talking about
thousands or 10,000 years from now when human humans will
not even be recognizable as humans we will have a
totally different levels of consciousness levels of development and cognition
everything different technology in in that very far distant future
may be something like a loosening of regulations will be
possible because people will be so conscious and so loving
and so quote unquote good inherently good and to understand
this you would need to understand spirituality which I can't
explain here but basically I do foresee a future in
the very far future where humans are something that approximates
humans will be so loving and so conscious that they
will not need very much of a government if you've
smoked DMT if you've heard people talking about DMT entities
or DMT aliens the overwhelming reports about these entities or
aliens are there other highly intelligent highly evolved conscious beings
which are way beyond humans or any other life-form which
basically live in a separate dimension from this material one
and that they are they are so conscious and so
loving that you know I would imagine that something like
DMT entities they don't need much of a government also
you know it it it matters how many of them
there are if there are like seven billion DMT entities
they probably need some kind of government if there are
you know if they're only handfuls of them then they
probably don't so it depends so in the future if
mankind let's say let's say mankind you know stops reproducing
so so rapidly and they our population really shrinks in
the future where we build a society that which is
you know much less populated then we can get away
with smaller government but it ain't gonna happen in the
next hundred years so forget about it is completely impractical
or were nowhere near that and also just because slavery
was abolished yeah I mean society I'm not saying society
can't improve society is always improving but you have to
be careful about what you think will actually lead to
more improvement or I will actually lead to a de-evolution
you see slavery how was slavery abolished it wasn't abolished
through some sort of free market or some sort of
libertarian philosophy slavery was abolished by by forcefully forcing people
who wanted to just have the freedom to own slaves
to forcing them to comply and to surrender that freedom
in a sense we had to oppress slave owners to
eliminate slavery and you better believe that those slave owners
felt very outraged that they were being oppressed that's right
those slave owners felt oppressed they felt oppressed that somebody
was trying to take away their slavery because they didn't
see slavery as bad or wrong they saw slavery as
just the natural condition of man and the natural prerogative
of the white man so how dare you take away
the natural rights of a white man to own slaves
how dare you that's their attitude another objection is that
centralized federal planning is not needed our society can work
without that through us more distributed system well that's just
not true coded 19 is a great counter example there
: 19 is a problem that's specifically benefits from strong
centralized planning and if you look at China China's success
China has been one of the greatest economic successes in
the last sixty years they've had huge improvements to their
levels of poverty have they have helped elevate millions of
Chinese out of poverty into a middle class sort of
existence more modernized level of existence they've had a lot
of success and the reason that is because that central
central federalized planning and you see one of the problems
we might have as Americans is that if we don't
have a strong central plan or a strong thing that
we're working towards as a nation we're just gonna be
sort of like a leaf blowing in the wind not
going any particular direction while our neighbors and adversaries will
be using centralized federal planning to grow themselves rapidly and
eventually outpace us and then defeat us that is certainly
a possibility so you know everything is evolutionary and it's
all evolving so this the most the fittest will survive
and so it's it's a question of you know what's
gonna what's gonna be more effective to have stronger central
planning or to have a more distributed system and it
don't just assume that a distributed system will automatically produce
better results that is an empirical test that needs to
be run that's not something you decide sitting in an
armchair doing philosophy um of course there will be the
objection from libertarians that leo you're wrong objective morality and
objective right and wrong truly exist and the only thing
I can tell you there is that no it doesn't
if you really wonder saying how morality works I do
have a few episodes about morality understanding morality how morality
works go check those out also have more in the
future check out my episode about relativity I basically expect
that you're intelligent enough to understand that if the earth
does not have an up and a down because space
rotation in space is completely relative there is no notion
of up or down in space if you can understand
that you should also be able to understand why your
moral system is completely relative and that there is no
such thing as an objective right or an objective wrong
it's relative to what is good for you or what
is good for life or what is good for mankind
to the extent that you say that mankind has some
Universal set of principles that we all agree on that's
still relative still completely brought it's not actually Universal by
definition it's human it's not universal some aliens as a
mother planet will have a completely different system that they
will call universal which of course will not be universal
this is just the earthbound system at best it's a
he it's not even earth even to call it earth
is already wrong because it excludes all the animals it's
a human purely human system and even there still a
lot of disagreement about right and wrong and moral systems
within humans we kill each other over that and so
yeah there's nothing Universal about it to the extent that
it's universal we just say that well really what it
is is it's sort of like you set of principles
that are maybe pro-life or more accurately Pro human life
so yeah if we're saying that okay relative to our
objective of creating peaceful societies we can all agree that
probably there shouldn't be rape there shouldn't be murder there
shouldn't be genocide can we agree to that actually we
can't many people will still disagree I still want to
do those things but most of us can agree and
in that sense we could say we have some sort
of universal moral system but it's completely relative and these
even if we have these loose ideas they're still there
applies so hypocritically you know we kill we kill innocent
people left and right through various kinds of programs plans
military actions you know war crimes whatever so this is
this idea that we're all following some objective universal set
of principles moral principles this is this is a childish
it's childish it's not true so investigate relative anymore here's
a list to conclude of solutions to libertarianism so if
you agree with the things I've said here if you
are now open-minded and you think that maybe you have
been trapped in this ideology of libertarianism and you want
to break free of it somehow and you want some
practical steps here's what you can do first of all
notice that it's a dogma it's an ideology secondly acknowledge
that you cling to it that you're emotionally attached to
it then decide that you're gonna let it go that's
gonna take courage and fearlessness then you should stop consuming
sources ideological sources that reinforce your right-wing libertarian ideology you
probably consume a lot of those sources because that's probably
where you got it in the first place so if
you want to get rid of it you know you
got to get rid of the sources upgrade your sources
to better ones non-ideological ones non libertarian ones find sources
that challenge libertarian principles so you can get new perspectives
of course you're gonna have to radically open your mind
I have episodes about open-mindedness go check those out that
will help you to open your mind and why it's
so important this will help you not only with politics
and government but with your personal life then you should
start to contemplate seriously contemplate and think through real-world examples
of how ego will exploit whatever political system or geology
you have ego is always gonna be exploiting at finding
loopholes think through the consequences of your philosophy how would
it work in the real world not just in your
idealistic examples make sure you account for scale make sure
you account for levels of development that people have different
levels make sure you don't assume that everyone is capable
of responsibility in morality that's not true at all assume
that they're gonna be sociopaths Psychopaths narcissists tyrants in your
population who will want to take control account for relativity
within your moral system don't assume that everyone's gonna subscribe
to your moral system you want to assume that your
moral system is the one true universal one or that
its objective or that anyone wants to even follow it
acknowledge that the free market creates oppression this is a
fundamental feature of the free market acknowledge that you are
part of a community that you're not really an individual
and that you could not survive as an individual acknowledge
all the luxuries that are afforded to you by being
part of this community and be grateful and thankful for
them so that you understand that your sacrifices of freedom
are actually giving you something in return because if you
think that you're sacrificing freedom getting nothing then yeah you
think that's a raw deal and you're pissed off about
it but if you see that you're sacrificing some freedom
and you're getting much more freedom and other good stuff
in return then you will be content drop you're clinging
to individualism learn to be part of the community more
go socialize more stop being some troll that lives in
your mother's basement and just you know does political commentary
online that's very unhealthy drop you're clinging to freedom as
an absolute good freedom is not an absolute good you
should be terrified of true freedom you should be grateful
for limitation and restriction study history more a lot of
your world you simply comes from a lack of proper
education and historical understanding study developmental psychology like Spile and
hammocks explores biodynamic sage green which is the next stage
above yours which is a more socialistic stage which of
course you've even eyes so you don't wanna explore it
see my episode called spiral dynamic stage green which will
help you to make that transition do consciousness work get
into spirituality I have taught lots of videos on the
topic of spirituality how to do it effectively and empirically
that will help to soften you up help to open
your mind help to open your heart help to develop
empathy compassion and love and ultimately that's that's a huge
missing component of the libertarian worldview to be a libertarian
your heart has to be closed you have to have
very little compassion empathy for humans and fundamentally you have
to lack love because if you really were living from
a position of love you would start to realize the
selfishness of your of your worldview and how really it's
based in fear and clinging and ideology and all of
that will be fixed by doing spirituality and becoming more
loving here's a list of final challenges concrete governing problems
that I'm going to give to you if you're a
libertarian if you still think that your libertarian philosophy is
sufficient to govern a 21st century Society here are specific
challenges in government that exist today which will make or
break your whole worldview whatever political ideology or philosophy you
have it has to be able to handle the following
challenges first ecology environment pollution climate change and in general
this is called the problem of the tragedy of the
Commons how do you construct a society or a community
where nobody is individually responsible for the ecology or the
environment in the free market everybody is incentivized to just
pollute the rivers the oceans and so forth and the
atmosphere with no responsibility there needs to be some sort
of higher responsibility higher collective agency which looks out for
the entire ecology and not just for some one individual
agent who's polluting in it that's a huge problem for
libertarians and this is exactly why most libertarians will probably
be in denial about climate change or environmental issues they
don't treat environmental issues seriously because if they did they
would realize libertarianism is [ __ ] another issue is
systemic racism again many libertarians would say that systemic racism
doesn't exist and the reason they say that is of
course because if they acknowledge that it did exist their
libertarianism would have to fly out the window and also
because they're not systemic thinkers to begin with they don't
they don't really think about society in terms of systemic
problems another problem is hate speech religious intolerance ethnic Wars
propaganda cults toxic ideologies and tribalism so how are you
gonna have a giant society with millions of people hundreds
of millions of people without regulating hate speech religious intolerance
ethnic warfare propaganda cults toxic ideologies and tribalism if you
don't moderate for these things if you think that the
free marketplace will just sort all of this out you
have no idea what you're talking about the way that
the free marketplace sorts out something like religious intolerance is
that one religion fights other religion with a bloody war
until one kills the other or there's a genocide that's
not a solution here we've already been through that when
you don't regulate speech when you don't regulate thought and
you just let all sorts of toxic ideologies develop cults
will develop religions will develop very toxic ones which will
then invite infect the minds of ignorant masses and then
lead to all sorts of animosity fear and hatred of
others which will create tribalism and which will tear the
entire community apart so in a community there needs to
be something some moderation or checks put in place to
prevent the spread of toxic ideologies that demonize others and
that create divisions within this larger unity that we call
the United States another problem for you is corporate lobbying
and bribery how are you gonna prevent large powerful corporations
from the free market from taking their money and bribing
the government and corrupting the government with that until they
take over the entire government and defeat all in corporations
we need regulations for that how about corporate monopolies and
capitalism as a whole how do you deal with the
problem of capitalism where monopolies become larger and larger and
larger then they bribed the government more and more and
more to corrupt it to allow them to get even
larger and larger and larger how do you deal with
that acknowledge that corporations are also oppressive not just federal
governments because there's no democratic control over giant corporations also
here's another problem how are you going to prevent a
corporation from taking over the state because your libertarian ideology
says that the state should be minimized minimize minimize minimize
well if you minimize it too much what prevents the
corporation from taking over if it can it will don't
expect on the good kind heartedness of a corporation not
to do it you need to take into account cabal's
syndicates and mafias how they form and that they will
necessarily form if you allow them to form and don't
regulate them you should take into account and this problem
of income inequality how are you going to deal with
ever-increasing income inequality between Americans this is gonna be a
problem against worse and worse and worse under capitalism what
are you gonna do to fix that the free market
is not gonna fix it the free market is gonna
make it worse with the free market the richest people
will earn even more wealth and the poorest people get
oppressed by the rich people how are you going to
deal with poverty Social Security and health care these are
issues that seem to be very difficult to fix through
any kind of private system Healthcare is a mafia how
are you gonna fix it hanging and breaking up are
you gonna regulate it to the benefit of most people
how are you going to deal with the problem of
crippled people sick people and mentally ill people people who
are almost barely functional these people cannot take any kind
of responsibility how are you gonna deal with them are
you just gonna kill them or are you gonna let
them fend for themselves are you gonna throw them out
to the wolves in the woods and just let them
do whatever they can or are you gonna come up
with some sort of compassionate system for them and don't
tell me that some free marketplace solution is gonna help
crippled people sick people and mentally ill people it won't
these people don't have a lot of money it's hard
to extract money from them so corporations are not gonna
be that interested in helping them and don't don't tell
me that's some private charity work is gonna solve this
problem it won't if it could it already would how
are you to deal with terrorism terrorism is potentially a
serious problem of course oftentimes it's overblown by right-wingers but
it can be a serious problem you know it's possible
for a terrorist to to get a dirty bomb or
even a nuclear weapon detonated in New York well how
are you to stop that with libertarian policies how are
you to stop nuclear weapons from polluting and in general
weapons of mass destruction how can that be prevented with
libertarian policies are you gonna apply the problem are you
gonna apply the free-market principles here to nuclear weapons are
you that stupid how about larger potential problems we could
have more pandemics even bigger worse more deadly more virulent
pandemics how are you gonna deal with that how are
you gonna deal with something like an alien invasion or
a meteor impact maybe an alien invasion is a little
bit far-fetched okay but a meteor impact that could certainly
happen within our lifetimes how are we gonna prevent that
are you gonna leave that up to the to the
free marketplace to solve that problem for you or are
we gonna all come together as a human species and
work together to develop some sort of technology that will
help to prevent some meteor impact in the future consider
the possibility that other nations with good strong central planning
like China might significantly outpace America and then defeat America
how are you gonna deal with that so those are
some things for you to consider and also one thing
I forgot is how are you gonna deal with the
increasing complexity scale population interconnectedness and globalization of our global
community the earth is only going to become more global
more interconnected more complex with more people on it at
least in the foreseeable future so how is your libertarian
set of principles gonna be able to handle that all
right that's it that's a long one I'm dead tired
whoo that's almost four hours of talking yes the most
I've ever done all right so please click that like
button for me I've worked real hard on this one
come check out actualize a drug that's my website you'll
find the blog the book list a lot of good
books on this topic there you can find that'll help
you to get your mind straight you'll find the the
forum there you can support me on patreon accomplished actualized
chip in a donation there if you'd like to keep
the good content coming the more support I am there
the the more I feel like I can share more
stuff with you because I don't have to hold as
much back for some sort of you know personal gain
later on and unless I have to feel like I
have to sell out that's it I'm gonna leave it
here I hope what you're realizing here is that government
and politics is not just a waste of time it
is for many people but it's not truly because we
live in a community and to live in a community
effectively you have to understand how the community works the
problem we have right now is we have a lot
of individualistic people alien in it living in an Alienist
society allowed by sort of the luxury and decadence that
we've created for ourselves who have an abysmally ignorant understanding
of the realities and complexities of what community means and
even of the very value of a community why it's
even valuable or desirable to be part of one even
that people are alienated from and that's because we have
a lot of these sort of staged orange ideologies a
lot of ideas about community have been turned into ideologies
as the same problem is religion you know once you
get the religious mind virus in there it corrupts your
whole thinking you're not able to think straight you're not
able to contemplate thinking apparently for yourself you're just parroting
ideas and that's exactly what libertarians are doing and so
hopefully we've helped to deconstruct that for you here and
to do a little bit of a D brainwashing and
if you'd like to learn more about my brand of
politics and what I think the solutions are to many
of these problems that I mentioned you know some sort
of positive vision not just a critique but a positive
vision not just a deconstruction go check out my four-part
series a long series I put a lot of work
into it called conscious politics parts 1 2 3 &
4 where I discuss in a lot of detail a
political asset of political principle an understanding of politics which
is not ideology based which integrates many of the rivaling
factions that we eat that we see today and gives
you sort of a higher meta meta perspective there's a
