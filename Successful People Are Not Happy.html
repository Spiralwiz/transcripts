hey Leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about the illusion of success
how successful people are not happy the way that we
usually assume [Music] there's a very deep illusion within you
that keeps you from glowing to your full potential and
this is the illusion of success and this got imprinted
into you as part of our modern culture what is
this illusion it goes something like this you see celebrities
all around you in the news and in the movies
you see your successful friends you see your co-workers who
are striving to climb the corporate ladder and acquire stuff
for themselves in life maybe you see certain family members
who have a lot of money and these people they
seem happy it seems like they're doing it they're achieving
it they're living the right life they're out there doing
the normal stuff they're not sitting at home reading books
and doing personal development they're out there engaging in life
they're having fun they're working hard and they're putting their
lives together and then you see these mega achievers in
the newspapers you see these uh Bill Gates's and Steve
Jobs and L on Musk's who do all these big
things in business who are just like killing it out
there and you think yourself that's what I need to
be like like one of them if only my life
was like that it then I would have the money
and if I had the good looks and I I
would have my hot girlfriend or my my dream husband
and then I have the great social circle and I
have freedom and time and money to travel and to
do all these exotic things and then I would have
a really exciting life and I would be doing big
things with my business I would be doing significant things
for the world for the economy and that is basically
the epitome of self-actualization right that's the illusion and this
illusion is further fed by all these false role models
that you see highlighted in the news and in Time
magazine and just across the internet Arnold Schwarzenegger L on
musk Tony Robbins Oprah Steve Jobs Donald Trump you know
whoever your role models are these all feed into this
illusion now Trump is an interesting example actually cuz you
might think like well Leo who would take Trump as
a role model actually you'd be surprised I had a
client about two years ago a coaching client of mine
who we would Skype and do coaching sessions and this
guy was really into success and so he wanted help
from me to kind of organize his life help them
put some productivity habits into place and and so forth
and one day he was just picking my brain about
stuff related to productivity and then he starts talking about
his role models and his role models or all these
like mega successful people and then of course Trump comes
up and this was a couple years ago so Trump
was like just starting to get into the into the
presidential race and I knew this guy was trouble but
but my client my client is telling me like aw
but Leo like look at Trump and I'm like why
do you bring up Trump and say well look he's
got the perfect everything he's got the perfect he's got
the perfect house the perfect lifestyle the perfect wife the
perfect kids it's all so well put together and I'm
sitting there and I'm just trying to contain my my-my-my
shock and kind of laughter because I'm like my jaw
is a gape at how he's trying to emulate Trump
and that he think that this is his role model
and this is what he wants me to coach him
to be like and this client was a was a
you know was a fairly successful guy already um he
was he had his own little small business that he
was working on and he was doing well for himself
and he was a well educated guy well put-together guy
so he was it wasn't just some you know just
some some redneck in the countryside or something like that
so so yeah I just that's an aside but anyways
you got to be careful with all these what I
call false role models these role models society puts them
out there as these very successful people we gotta be
very careful this happens with celebrities also you might fall
into this trap with p-waves whatever PUA teachers out there
pick up teachers that you're following be very careful because
all of these people the PA is the celebrities and
all these others that I mentioned really what they're giving
you is they're giving you a of success this is
all an illusion all of this is surface level stuff
these people are not happy at all at all at
all these people are on drugs they're addicted to all
manner of things from gross to subtle they are addicted
to success they are addicted to work they are addicted
to ego they are addicted to manipulation they are stressed
they're overworked they are depressed they just have a lot
of stuff going on in their lives granted but that
doesn't mean very much it's got very little to do
with actual fulfillment in life and it's got very little
to do with your actual development of the human being
these are not high quality human beings they just happen
to be mega successful and that's a very important distinction
to draw what these people are really is they're masters
of manipulation and they have found their niche in life
which has allowed them then to become very successful by
masters of manipulation I don't necessarily mean that they're manipulating
you in some nefarious way although many of them are
I'm more mean that they are masters at manipulating life
and themselves so they have become very very good at
manipulating their situation and their lives and the lives of
everybody around them and the lives of their audience so
that they have this sense of success and it works
to a large degree because you create this bubble around
yourself of success and then you're able to trick yourself
into thinking that well because I have all this success
and I'm able to manipulate reality so effectively that that
means that I'm a good human being that I'm really
developed and that I'm really happy whereas in fact it's
a hollow victory for these people and of course we
see this in the news periodically with various celebrities who
commit suicide or overdose on drugs or have behavioral problems
or get angry and rant at people or whatever right
we see their true colors once in a while but
only once in a while and generally though what we
have in our culture is we have this this illusion
of success and then this illusion is so deeply soaked
into your bones you so believe in it that you
think that this is what self-actualization is about what it's
for is to help you to do that well I
got news for you you're envying the wrong people all
these people at you envy these are the wrong people
if you actually became like them and here's the really
counterintuitive and difficult to believe thing is that if you
actually became like them you would be miserable you would
be absolutely miserable and your life would be a mess
even though on the surface you would be able to
put on a good appearance and everybody around you would
think that well this guy really has it all together
look at him I want to be like him that's
the illusion it's a very dangerous illusion there's also this
echo chamber effect in our culture because our culture feeds
into this and it creates a solution because it largely
only highlights external successes see the common mob doesn't understand
anything but material and gross things their minds are not
subtle enough to to tap into the subtle aspects of
life and therefore they can't really even start to self-actualize
because they're chasing external gross things and our culture feeds
into this because it's very easy to sell success and
resale success that's why you have all these magazines like
Time magazine's and fortune 500 and all of these what
do they do they package and sell the illusion of
success by putting these people on their front covers and
then writing articles about them how they're successful this person
this millionaire that billionaire how much money did in the
stock markets and what kind of company they founded none
of that has anything to do with real success in
life that's all a veneer of success but see it's
easy to sell that because once you've got that thing
going people are bought into that illusion now you can
sell them courses seminars books they buy your magazine they
read your self-help books they read your biographies they take
you as an expert as an authority in your field
then they want to hire you as a consultant and
so it just goes on and on and on the
success gets resold this illusion gets resold over and over
over again and really what it is it's just like
a pyramid scheme of success because it's only like the
top of the pyramid that can survive because they're riding
on the backs of the base of the pyramid which
is the common masses which will never even rise to
that level of success but the shocking thing is is
that even if they do even if you do manage
to go from the bottom of the pyramid all the
way to the top you'll realize that the whole thing
was a sham to begin with because even the people
at the top are not really happy but oftentimes they
don't know it because the mind is very tricky and
of course when you're at the top to maintain this
whole structure you're going to have to lie to yourself
in sneaky ways that you're not even conscious of yet
that actually it's working and that actually you are happy
it's very easy to trick yourself into thinking that you're
happy when you have a lot of money and a
lot of power and you're very good at manipulating your
circumstances very easy to trick yourself into that it's very
easy to coast on celebrity status and to milk celebrity
status and to turn any bit of recognition that you
get or any publicity that you get into money and
into more publicity and into more success and so this
creates the cycle of never-ending success chasing what we need
to do if you really want to unleash your potential
in life and you want to really grow in the
proper manner is to shatter this illusion right now otherwise
you will waste decades of your life is not your
entire life mislead going in the opposite direction of where
you need to go in order to really grow to
be really fulfilled but this illusion is very difficult to
shake it's not enough just to hear me say it
once because like I said it's it's it's an illusion
that goes down to the marrow of your bones it's
a very deep cultural paradigm that you are trying to
shake here so what needs to have is we need
to come back to it over and over and over
again have you thinking about it over and over and
over again to undermine this illusion until you stop believing
in it so let's get to work first make a
very sharp distinction in your mind between success and Happiness
these things are really orthogonal orthogonal and oftentimes they're actually
opposite in that to become happy you're gonna have to
let go of success not chase more success and that
by chasing more success you're actually making yourself miserable it's
also important to understand the fundamentals of how happiness works
because it works in very counterintuitive ways what you need
to know about happiness is that every human action is
always aimed towards maximizing happiness I don't care what it
is it could be a terrorist it could be Hitler
it could be a rapist it could be your politician
pick any one you hate whose actions you despise and
realize for a moment just for a moment right now
that they are actually acting in what they believe will
produce the most happiness for them hard to believe so
why then do they act in such stupid ways well
for the same way for the same reason that you
act in stupid ways because from the inside it's very
difficult to see that your actions actually aren't moving you
towards happiness because like I said happy necessary counterintuitive thing
it's easy to lose track of when your actions stop
working and producing happiness because the success will seduce you
see you start off planning your actions to maximize your
happiness and your hat and your actions and your happiness
are like this they're together and you sort of assume
that that's how it's going to keep being but then
you start taking more actions more actions are getting a
bit of success you started assuming that all its success
is the same as happiness and so these things start
to drift apart though you don't really notice that they're
drifting apart your happiness is going one way your success
is taking another way but see the happiness the happiness
is a very abstract and airy-fairy thing it's intangible it's
subtle it's going misdirection your success is a gross material
thing it's money in your bank account it's cars it's
houses it's your growing business it's how many people know
your name it's your audience your number of subscribers you
have all this and it's going this direction you see
and you just assume that oh well this this is
the same thing as this because as you're getting this
it's sort of addictive and it's stimulating right all I
got more subscribers like all I got more money by
being out I got a new car all that's addictive
and all I got a new girlfriend look she came
to me because she saw my success at hokay and
so now you think oh now I'm really living the
good life and you're living into this illusion success and
now by that point you're completely 180 degrees now in
the opposite direction of happiness and the trick with this
is is that the reason this is such an easy
separation that happens is because happiness what is happiness is
such an Aries very thing it's an emotion it's a
feeling and many people live their life as though they're
very rational and pragmatic so a rational pragmatic person when
he puts on the scale happiness over here this Airy
fairy feeling of happiness and then a car a house
lots of stocks money in your bank account and a
hot girlfriend or a husband and a family in and
vacations and fancy Italian restaurants and all this stuff over
here which one is he going to value more you
see it takes a lot of wisdom to value this
over all of this you see that there's a lot
of wisdom your problem in life is not that you
lack success that is not why you're unfulfilled that is
a huge part of the solution we tell ourselves that
man if I was just doing a little better for
myself that would really do it for me in life
my life would be great that is not the problem
the problem is that you fundamentally misunderstand how happiness works
that's the real problem because if you really understood what
happiness is and how happiness works you would not be
under this spell mesmerized by this illusion of success chasing
it success is largely about manipulating reality to fit you
that's what success is about that's how you acquire success
you want a lot of success become a really good
manipulator of reality and you will have massive success happiness
is the opposite of that it's about surrendering yourself to
reality this is where people go wrong as they misunderstand
this surrendering yourself to reality and not getting the things
you want see you think that to be happy you
need to get all the things you want and the
more you go and you pursue these things and you
get them eventually you will realize what I'm telling you
here now which is that actually happiness is about being
okay and happy with exactly whatever you have even if
you have nothing now that's easy to say the trick
is how do you start to embody this you might
think well leo uh this is all kind of basic
stuff I mean why aren't you talking about more advanced
topics this is such a basic target it's like a
topic for newbies no no this is a very fundamental
topic even if you're pursuing enlightenment even if you think
you're doing all this advanced person development stuff you're probably
still wrapped up in the illusion of success I know
because to a large degree I still am and that's
something I struggle to shed every single day it's a
real challenge you need to really deeply grasp what I'm
saying here that happiness is about surrendering yourself to reality
not about acquiring things or even acquiring what you might
call the good things or the spiritual things like a
loving relationship if I acquire a loving relationship then I'll
be happy that's better than acquiring money no that's still
a very wrongheaded approach to happiness happiness not something you
acquire it's your capacity to surrender yourself to this very
moment right now you need to grasp this to such
a deep level that your entire life starts to unravel
and the reason your life is going to start to
unravel and it's going to be scary is because you've
spent probably twenty or thirty years of your life if
not more building this entire house of cards of success
on this assumption that it would make you fulfilled and
it's very difficult to admit to yourself that it's not
going to work so when you hear me talking about
it right now you might very easily be a denial
about it not just for a week or a month
but maybe for the next ten years you will resist
what I'm saying until finally you have enough of this
illusion of success and it becomes so sour so disenchanted
with it that you come back and you're really able
to deeply grasp what I'm saying here and when that
happens that will be the beginning of true growth for
you that will be the beginning and you will realize
how much time you've wasted decades have been wasted just
to get to the beginning of this path that's why
this topic is so important I really need you to
understand that you can never ever ever never ever have
happiness happiness is not something you have it's not something
you acquire you can only be happy right now with
exactly what is without manipulating what is without trying to
make it better without trying to make it fit your
desires happiness is about making your desires fit reality and
not about making reality fit your desires you see how
it's exactly the opposite of what we're taught by our
culture it is and no wonder then that so many
people are not truly happy even though they project a
veneer of happiness but deep down inside they're hollow what
you really want in your life is you want to
develop a connection to being and being is that which
is right now whether there is an itch in your
ass or on your foot or something's going wrong with
your kids or you didn't get the new job you
wanted you can get the promotion you wanted or your
car broke down you got a flat tire or you
have a health problem or you're running low on money
whatever your situation is if you're connected with being you
can be happy through that regardless of that that's unconditional
happiness being happy all the time so just think about
this do you want to be conditionally happy or unconditionally
happy which do you want to be conditionally happy means
that your happiness depends upon success freedom money your comfort
the possessions you have and everything basically going your way
think of how fragile that is does that strike you
as a wise strategy for living life to be conditionally
happy to be putting yourself further and further into a
situation of conditional happiness does that sound like a good
life does that sound like a smart investment into your
future to invest a lot of time energy to that
because you will invest years into this or does it
strike you as a better investment to invest that time
energy into developing your connection to being such that you
can be happy without relying on success freedom money or
comfort think about this right now think about it be
very conscious here you have to actually think through the
logic of this because that's how something's gonna shift in
your mind don't just agree with me and just say
oh yeah yeah I already know that I already know
that I already know money won't make me happy no
at what level of depth do you know it because
when you really know it your whole life will change
all your actions all your motivations will change radically if
you really grasp what's being said here this is not
easy stuff to grasp if someone told me this stuff
five years ago it would just go in one ear
and out the other it's taken a lot of work
for me to get to this point where these things
really resonate with me and then I'm passionate about communicating
them to you because I want them to resonate in
you as well but if you haven't laid your foundation
I'm worried that it will go in in out the
other now you might say bhalil getting X whatever X
is money sex husband marriage whatever kids getting X will
make me happier I know that in the past these
things that made me have you I get something I
like and then I'm happier look very closely at that
it only seems so the key word here being seems
it seems so we're really this getting X is like
a drug you get X and it boosts your mood
a little bit but then a week later you're just
back down the baseline and you know hit and another
hit and I'll hit and I'll hit but in the
long run it never works you're just delaying the real
inner growth that needs to happen in order to develop
your connection with being yours putting that off till another
day to another day to another day because you keep
telling yourself no just one more thing one extra thing
let me just acquire that house with that girlfriend or
that yacht or that whatever and about that will do
it for me if I just get that one thing
but then notice you've been doing that your whole life
and it hasn't really worked and you keep saying no
no I just need to have one extra thing this
time I know it'll really work do you really think
it'll work think about it really take a look at
all the stuff you've acquired in your life and how
it hasn't really made you fulfilled and in fact the
more you acquire the more miserable you become because success
is very addictive one success is never enough it never
satisfies notice this is the general principle of life what
this creates is a never-ending cycle of achievement constantly acquiring
more and more and more more but when you're going
in orthogonal direction to where you need to be going
you're never going to get there can you see that
if you need to go north and you're going east
west you're never going to get north it's these ask
the problem it's very tricky you tell yourself all well
if I just keep going east a little bit more
eventually I'll get north no you won't you're just going
to go east you're never going to get north success
is very addictive because it's very hard to say no
to success notice this as well when you're doing well
and people around you are telling you how well you're
doing and in the world and the economy is rewarding
you for doing so well it's ridiculously easy to convince
yourself that this is the right path and that you
should just do more of it and more and more
and more and more and that's exactly what these millionaires
and billionaires and these venture capitalists and Silicon Valley CEOs
and the Donald Trump's of the world that's exactly the
game that they're playing is this game they can never
say no to success and then they're hooked on it
it's their drug and some of our best people our
brightest minds are lost to this trap of success and
they are lost forever forever this this absorbs and sucks
in your entire life you know a drug addiction can
take up quite a bit of your time and waste
a lot energy but a success addiction nothing eats up
time and energy like a success addiction it'll eat up
decades and also once you acquire the success and the
money what are you going to do with it you're
going to use it to buy comfort aren't you and
comfort is extremely addictive as well so the success feeds
comfort and then the comfort feeds the desire for more
comfort which then necessitates pursuing more success and so your
life becomes about maximizing comfort without realizing that maximizing comfort
is not how you develop fulfillment in life actually you
get yourself more and more stuck and then this is
why people get really depressed and ultimately suicidal is because
they may realize that all this this time that they
spent developing their comfort and acquiring all this stuff all
this success has really led to a miserable life now
with that said does this mean that you should be
a lazy loser and of course the answer is no
success principles are still important to learn there's value in
pursuing success and that it does build some discipline in
you and it teaches you what does work in the
world what doesn't work in the world it develops some
robustness within you so those are all good things the
only thing you do is you just need to apply
these principles of success to the right areas in life
what I'd call the wise areas like if you applied
the principles of success not to business for example but
to the pursuit of truth or to the pursuit of
love with a the pursuit of being or the pursuit
of authentic relationships and authentic communication which has virtually nothing
to do with typical marriages or typical relationships these would
be good places to apply the principles of success that
you have learned from running your business or from being
successful and pick up or from being successful with whatever
else see but these are much less tangible things and
so if you've been addicted to success can be very
hard for you to to make that switch from going
from something that's so gross like pursuing money or business
success or success with women to now pursuing something like
success in truth seeking but that's the solution that's what
we're talking about here we're talking about making a really
big shift in what you're motivated towards in life and
why you're motivated towards it by understanding the deeper dynamics
that work here you need to deeply grasp that what
you want is happiness not success itself and then when
you grasp that then try to convince yourself to pursue
the happiness directly eliminate all the side roads all the
detours go straight for the happiness and see what that
means for your life it might mean some radical stuff
don't get sidetracked by the parade of chimps the parade
of chimps are all these people these chimps and suits
these chimps and tuxedos that you see on the cover
of Time magazine who are put up there as these
successful chimps that you're supposed to emulate see that for
what it is it's just chimps in suits chimps with
dollar bills chimps that know how to manipulate the stock
market chimps that know how to start a new mobile
app or some new venture capital project in Silicon Valley
but they're nevertheless chips these are not developed human beings
these are not high consciousness human beings you're envying the
wrong people who you should be envying are the monks
and the Yogi's and the Saints not these guys so
keep questioning this culture of success that you've been indoctrinated
with I've been a doctor with it too and I've
spent a lot of time questioning it questioning it and
the deeper I go to my spiritual work theá-- the
more I realize how hollow it is and how it
just is just a parade of chips and just because
everyone's in the parade and the pride mends a lot
of noise and it's very flashy it sounds like a
I should be part of that parade but the more
I grow the more I realized that and I've wasted
so much time being part of that parade and that
it's time to call it quits do that questioning until
you stop believing in this this whole illusion needs to
be shattered when you do that you will be on
track for some of the biggest growth that you've ever
experienced in your life all right that's it I'm done
