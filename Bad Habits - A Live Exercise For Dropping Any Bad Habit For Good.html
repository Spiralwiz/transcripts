hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
video we're going to talk about bad habits specifically how
do you drop a bad habit all right let's talk
bad habits what are they why do they happen and
really in this video I want to do is I
want to take you through a process that will help
you to begin to drop your bad habit for good
so bad habits what do we have to say about
this well I think that we've got to start by
taking a look at some of the examples of what
bad habits are and what they're doing in your life
personally for me I really struggled with a couple of
habits I had to go back and really dig into
my past unearth some of these because I've already forgotten
that I've dropped them and they were such negative habits
for me my biggest negative habits were overeating and watching
television and playing video games so these three habits just
took root when I was growing up and I was
very overweight my whole life and I watched enormous quantities
of television wasted so much of my time doing that
and also spent a lot of hours playing video games
and waste a lot of my life doing that so
those three things were really something I had to overcome
in order to start to move towards a self actualized
kind of life that I am really living in right
now and then I'm shooting for even even higher levels
of it as I'm going forward in the next few
years and and onwards so with you your negative habits
might be the same or they might be different but
in the end it doesn't really matter what the bad
habit is it's all the same thing it's all you
relying on something to give you emotional support emotional stimulation
a crutch if you will so this might be hardcore
drugs this might be pot this might be food this
might be alcohol this might be partying this might be
the internet or television or video games or porn or
any number of other negative habits besides just those obvious
ones there's also more subtle ones these are all very
types of habits and a lot of them are socially
unacceptable but then you've got the more socially acceptable ones
for example constant gossiping and criticizing or being a cynic
or being a pessimist or getting angry at people getting
mad at people being passive-aggressive biting your nails these are
like smaller habits that are still very toxic to your
life so you might want to get rid of those
and if you do this video is perfect for you
I'm going to go into what it takes to actually
start to do this because the biggest challenge of course
is that we all have bad habits and a lot
of us know that we have them but then when
we try to drop them what happens we try and
then we fall off track and then we get back
into the groove of that bad habit again and that's
literally what a bad habit is it's a groove in
your brain that's just been etched through repetition through conditioning
and now that groove is running and you're running along
that track and it's hard to switch tracks now to
switch tracks is going to require something of you some
sort of extra effort and extra awareness extra attention consciousness
is required to do this and also some commitments and
dedication and some willingness to go through the work so
in order to do that you need to really get
in touch with your motivation why you're doing this so
the most important thing to consider when you're trying to
drop a bad habits is asking yourself why am I
even trying to drop it now this might seem simple
and obvious in some cases but not always is that
the case sometimes you want to drop it just because
of some sort of extrinsic motivating factor like maybe someone
is disapproving of you for doing it or because you
think that it would be the right thing to do
for your family or for your friends or for somebody
else in order to kind of fit in so that's
you suck at groupthink that's not a very good and
motivating reason instead of what you want is you want
to tap into you know why this is destroying your
life why it's holding you back from your greatest potential
in life that's what's really important once you get in
touch with that then you can really start to let
it go you're going to have the emotional leverage to
do it and I'm going to take you through an
exercise at the end of this video it's going to
get you a lot of emotional leverage so stick with
me for that okay the next point is that you
have to take full responsibility for your bad habit a
lot of people they'll have a bad habit in the
little boy Ament on others they'll play the victim this
is not going to work if you want to drop
it you only really have two choices in life you
can play the victim and stay stuck or you can
accept full responsibility bite the bullet and be willing to
do whatever it takes to fix the problem and then
that's how a winner is made that's how somebody goes
out there and makes radical changes in their lifestyle and
really improves their life a lot because you're taking lots
of responsibility so you can't blame others for your habit
if you're getting angry all the time that's not other
people or your work situation that's you if you are
are drinking all the time that's not because you have
a bad job or your family is depressing you or
your friends are causing you trouble it's not that it's
you you've got the drinking problem alright and if you
are watching television all the time and you're playing video
games and you're stuck at home and you're not really
living in a rich and full life that's also not
anything to do with the media or society or the
fact that you're tired after work no that's that's you
you're responsible for that so take full responsibility you have
to do that otherwise there is no chance for you
to succeed here and the next point is that you
have to believe that you can that's another place where
people trip up is that they they will come and
they'll say well I've got this bad habit and I
try to try to try but it's not possible for
me so now I'm just kind of stuck with it
and they'll stay now stuck and they'll start complaining and
complaining about all this bad stuff that's coming from this
bad habit they'll complain a lot but they don't actually
believe that they can change see if you don't believe
that you can change then I mean how can you
you're basically screwed right off the bat you're screwing yourself
over from achieving a big life because with that kind
of mindset then you're only going to be doing the
things that you think you can and it's very very
limited thinking in fact your capabilities and your potential in
life is so much more than you realize that you
imagine and yet you sell yourself so short and you
always tell yourself that you can't do this you can't
do that it's too hard it's a struggle you know
what you have to let that stuff go because either
you're going to be a complainer in life or you're
going to be a winner and a winner is someone
who goes at the challenge again and again and again
until it breaks even if you try to quit smoking
ten times that doesn't mean that it won't work on
the 11th time you gotta try again if you tried
dropping television and replacing it with something healthy like reading
and that hasn't been working for you and you've tried
that five times go and try it a sixth time
right this is the kind of mindset that you need
to make this happen because with a lot of these
habits it probably won't be dropped on the first attempt
it might take you two three five ten attempts to
do it but you know what it's still worth it
because this habit is robbing you of so much in
your life and I'm going to show you that in
a minute all right the next point is law of
attraction if you're familiar with law of attraction what it
means is simply that you need to focus on the
things that you want in life rather than the things
you don't want so you tend to attract whatever you
think and focus on and if you're focusing on good
stuff you'll be attracting that if you're focusing on negative
stuff and the stuff that you don't like about your
life you'll be attracting more of that as well so
now let's apply that that law to breaking a bad
habit what would that mean well that means that instead
of just breaking a bad habit and then sitting around
and doing nothing or replacing it with some other bad
habit what you want to do is you want to
shift your attention on something good and positive that you're
doing through life so either instilling an opposite good habit
or just having something else that you're going to be
doing with that spare time that's a lot of times
where people go wrong when they're trying to fix a
bad habit is that they'll do everything right but then
they're now they have all this free time and their
attention is just like let left to sit and to
wander and to be idle and you know the old
saying that in idles idle hands do the devil's work
well that is literally the case here is that when
you don't have a an important mission in your life
when you have no big empowering positive goals then of
course your life is going to be filled with bad
habits that's probably why you got into this mess in
the first place is that you didn't really have anything
good or positive that you're doing in your life so
for example instead of over eating all the time and
going to restaurants and spending a lot of time and
money on restaurants and eating out and eating four meals
a day or three meals a day or whatever like
that if you want to drop the eating addiction that
you have maybe now you commit yourself to something else
that you're doing maybe now instead of eating out all
the time you're going to be spending more time with
your kids or you're going to be spending more time
on that side project that you were doing for your
business that you wanted to launch or you're going to
spend more time in your relationship or you're going to
go and pick up a new hobby maybe going to
go mountain climbing hiking doing something active some sort of
sport see when you have some sort of active activity
that you're doing it's going to take your attention away
from the fact that you're not filling yourself with food
and of course this applies to every other negative habit
that you've got especially stuff like television video games the
reason you're playing video games so much and the reason
that you're so immersed in television you're wasting hours and
hours on television is because really you have nothing else
to do you have nothing better to do see like
for me I've got like a business that I want
to build I've got big ambitions so for me to
sit and spend even an hour watching television my brain
will tell me no way like there's no way I'm
doing that I need to be reading I need to
be need to be contacting people I need to be
shooting videos I need to be working on marketing I
have so many things I want to be doing plus
I have relationships I want to be in so I'm
always strapped for time because I set big ambitious goals
for myself so you need to have some of those
as well so whenever your habit is decide right now
what you're going to replace it with or what you're
going to do with the time that's going to be
free okay good the next point is commitment you really
need to commit 100% to have it you've probably realized
this before because you try to drop bad habits in
your life and they have it hasn't worked that's because
there's this hump right there's this hump that you've to
get over this expenditure of massive energy have to get
over and it takes about 30 days to put in
all that energy and then you can start to coast
with your habit because the the new habits and the
new routines get conditioned in your mind but right now
you have to put in energy that's going to take
commitment from you and the best way to commit is
a hundred percent see a lot of times what people
will do is they'll make a 90 percent commitment or
a 95 percent commitment or even a 99 percent commitment
will they'll say well ok I'm really going to try
I'm really going to try and they tell themselves we're
really going to try to go to the gym or
they're really going to try to stop eating so much
bad food or they're really going to try to stop
smoking but see that's kind of a that's a really
really disempowering way to go about building and breaking habits
that's because that 1% is enough for your brain to
then start coming up with excuses and it creates a
slippery slope where one excuse comes and then you kind
of say okay yeah maybe today I shouldn't really go
to the gym because it's a holiday and so you
don't go to the gym because it's a holiday and
then the next day it it continues that slippery slope
continues in your wrist as well if I didn't go
one day what's what's wrong with missing two days so
you missed two days then you missed three days and
all the sudden you stop going to the gym completely
and the same thing with any other habit so you
have to be you have to be pretty disciplined if
you be committed or you have to tell yourself you're
going to do this no matter what that is how
I broke my food addiction is really I had to
use a lot of harsh discipline with myself which is
not always the best approach but sometimes it is a
good approach when you really have a hard addiction like
with food or a drug or something like that especially
chemical you sometimes really have to like tell yourself that
no like god dammit no this is it this is
the end of it so that's actually what I want
to help you do right now is I want to
help you tap into this commitment of why you want
to be dropping this habit and the way we do
that it was going to do a visualization exercise and
I want you to follow along with me as I'm
talking to you you're going to sit back and close
your eyes alright I'm going to take you to this
exercise it's going to get you in touch with the
motivation you need to get the leverage to really start
to take some action on this bad habit it has
been plaguing you okay so let's do that right now
go ahead and sit back and close your eyes and
relax and keep your back up straight good so as
you're doing that and your eyes are closed just listen
along and follow along and use your imagination and follow
what I'm saying so your eyes are closed now go
ahead and take a nice deep breath in and then
exhale and as you're exhaling release all the tension from
your body good get in touch with your body really
feel your body notice it notice every part good now
take another deep breath in and exhale and relax your
body even more as you're exhaling good feel the rest
of your body feel all the other parts of your
body that you haven't felt yet good now let's take
one more deep breath in and as you breathe in
and then exhale on the exhale you're going to release
every muscle in your body you're going to let it
completely relax and go loose ready good so now we
really get in touch with your body get in touch
with the soles of your feet feel the soles of
your feet feel the tips of your toes feel your
legs and feel your butt on the cushion or the
surface that you're sitting on feel your back muscles feel
your shoulder muscles feel your hands and feel all the
way into your fingertips now feel the muscles in your
neck and relax those and move that awareness of the
muscles in your neck up into the muscles in your
face and as you're feeling all your facial muscles relax
all of those two good now you should be really
relaxed and really in touch with your entire body notice
how you're breathing just let a nice even steady pace
keep your attention on that good perfect now we're going
to do a visualization exercise keep your eyes closed and
follow along what I want you to do is I
want you to imagine that bad habit that's really playing
you that you would like to drop really picture it
picture how it plays itself out throughout the day picture
house plays itself out throughout the week now I want
you to imagine that this habit isn't going anywhere but
this habit is going to stay and it's stuck with
you forever for the rest of your life and I
want you to imagine what the next month will look
like of this bad habit continuing to act and act
and act itself out imagine all the pain that's involved
with that imagine the disappointment you see in others imagine
how disappointed you are in yourself the guilt whatever this
is costing you good now let's project that a year
into the future imagine a year goes by and this
negative habit is stuck with you it's not changing you're
not changing it and it's been acting for a whole
year every single day 365 days imagine what the cost
of that is tallied up for 365 days all the
struggle all the pain good now let's project that five
years into the future imagine five years goes by and
you change nothing about this habit this bad habit is
with you and in fact it's getting even stronger because
the negative habit tends to get worse and worse if
you don't work on it now imagine five years worth
of all the negative accumulation of the effects and the
repercussions of this negative habit how does it affect your
work how does it affect your family how does it
affect your own psychology how does it make you feel
about yourself to be so weak okay now let's project
this 10 years into the future imagine 10 years of
the Segev habit working on you and working on your
life what does your life look like 10 years from
now from the ravages of this bad habit what is
going to happen if you keep doing what you've been
doing really picture it that's the real cost ok good
now clear that image out of your mind maybe think
of something else totally irrelevant you might think of sucking
on a crisp cold lemon wedge feeling the sourness on
your tongue that will be a little bit of a
palate cleanser for you ok good so keep your eyes
closed and now we're going to move on to the
second part of this visualization now what I want you
to do is I want you to clear your mind
and I want you to think about the new habit
that you're putting into place to replace this bad habit
what's the good habit what are you gonna be doing
with all that time and I want you to imagine
that new habit operating on you every single day for
the next week what would it look like just for
the next week for you to be doing that new
habit and no longer doing the old one how to
feel how would you feel about yourself would you have
more energy would you feel more successful would you be
more caring would you be more conscious good now let's
take that and project that out to a whole month
30 days for 30 days you're doing this good habit
how does it make you feel to do 30 days
of it 30 straight days of this accumulating positive effect
of the good habit how does it make you feel
about yourself what does it do for your life how
does it free up your life from all those negative
emotions what kind of opportunities that open for you good
now let's take that and project it a year into
the future imagine 365 days have passed and you have
been on this good habit for 365 days imagine how
much you accomplished during that time the kind of gains
you make in that domain where you're practicing this new
activity what kind of gains do you make what kind
of what kind of successes does this lead to what
kind of rewards that create both physical rewards but also
emotional rewards how proud you feel of yourself for doing
it for that long good now let's project it out
five years into the future imagine you were doing this
for five years this positive habit how much benefit have
you received from it can you see all the little
gradual accumulations and how big those have grown how much
they've expanded and completely transformed your life how proud you
feel of yourself for having done this good now let's
project this 10 years into the future imagine 10 years
from now you've been on this positive habit for every
single day for 10 years picture all the accumulated positive
effects feel how you would feel feel how proud you
would feel if you did this for 10 years straight
think of how this affect every area of your life
from your work to your relationships to your family think
about how inspirational you would be to everyone around you
if you actually were able to do this you could
share the success of your story with them and inspire
them to also do the same in their lives improve
their lives in the ways that you improve yours good
so go ahead and wrap that up at your own
pace finish that visualization basking it a little bit and
at your own pace on the count of three you
are going to come out and come back to me
nice and refreshed and feeling good so here is the
count one two three all right welcome back how do
you feel I hope that felt good right this exercise
is called future projection both negative and positive future projection
that's we did here we helped get you some leverage
over your bad habit you saw the costs the real
costs of staying on this negative track and you also
saw the real benefits of putting yourself on a new
more positive track right now because you are in this
state where you are receptive and you are engaged right
you're ready this is the time they have to commit
I want a hundred percent commitment from you that you
were going to drop this bad habit we know how
toxic it is to your life we also know how
much it's costing you in terms of all the potential
that you have all the dreams that are going on
fulfilled because of it it's weighing you down so much
