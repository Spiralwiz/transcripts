your life is important honor it fight for your highest
possibilities are you right now living your top passion in
life are you doing the most meaningful thing that you
can be doing with your work do you even know
what that is for you and if the answer is
no then what exactly are you waiting for do you
think some magic cure is going to come your way
and solve this problem for you that somehow it's all
just going to resolve itself and life is gonna all
work out for you let me back up a step
tell you a little story this is a story about
a girl who grew up in the 60s and 70s
and ever since she was 5 or 7 years old
she had a knack a natural knack for art she
had a really good artistic eye she could draw she
could sketch she could color she was interested in faces
and animals nature she was just naturally drawn to that
and she did that on her own free time she
was also naturally talented at music the piano the nose
the scales picking all that stuff up and arts and
crafts she was good at all this but life just
kind of started happening to her and eventually she got
married she had kids and she had to get a
regular job and she moved to the United States does
she grew up another country but after she moved to
the US her life started to slide she really didn't
keep up with life anymore because she took a backseat
to her husband and slowly over the next decade or
two she became more and more of a victim she
stopped working on her career and she just became a
stay-at-home mom and took care of the kids and sacrifice
for the family and that seemed all right nothing wrong
with that except she wasn't really developing herself she wasn't
pursuing anything in life she let life happen to her
kind of spontaneously and over time the marriage toxified and
toxified and she became more and more helpless and her
self-esteem eroded more and more until finally the marriage just
broke apart and she had a separate and then she
was off on her own and now she had to
fend for herself she had to go off into the
job market find a job except it was difficult to
find a job because he didn't have any really marketable
skills and so she found the only job she could
which is just a very basic minimum wage retail job
and she worked there actually got two jobs one full-time
one part-time and she worked hard at these jobs she
worked her ass off but at these kinds of jobs
you're not really doing any fulfilling meaningful work and she
doesn't get much respect at these jobs and in fact
sometimes she tries to be creative in her work and
she tries to go arrange the Shelf arrange the products
in a beautiful kind of way and sometimes her managers
notice that she's doing this and she's trying real hard
and they give her a thumbs up that's about all
she gets is a thumbs up which isn't much and
some she doesn't even get that and as he might
expect working these jobs she's becoming more and more bitter
angry frustrated bitter at the fact that no one appreciates
her work that she's not getting paid what she's worth
that she's doing meaningless pointless menial labor week in week
out and that's what her life has become and this
just infects all aspects of her life because she's feeling
stuck now she can't really break out of this cycle
which keeps going lower and lower because she doesn't have
the psychological tools to understand how her own mind is
trapping her and locking her up in a cage it's
a self-imposed victimhood it's really sad to see and she
doesn't understand how victim psychology works and basically she's given
up on her dreams and she's not using those artistic
abilities that she had which in another life perhaps she
could have used and had an impact on the world
and actually built a career around that and been following
her passion and actually be stoking passion rather than bitterness
inside her feeding her muse through her work and then
getting paid well for it as well but that's not
her she really doesn't have much of a life her
life is very weak versus rich a rich life is
a life in which you're taking in everything that life
has to offer you all the experiences all the possibilities
and you're growing to expand yourself continuously so that you
can take in more of what life has to offer
your learning you're growing you're traveling you're evolving but that's
not what she has she's really stuck permanently stuck and
she could still break out but she's pretty stuck because
once you get into that cycle and you live in
that cycle for a few years for a decade or
two it gets real tough because that prison that you
construct around yourself becomes your new status quo and you
don't even believe that there's anything possible outside of it
anymore and if you even have some sort of dream
or aspiration it just gets thrown out into the garbage
as some luxury or some foolhardy ideal some cockamamie far-fetched
scheme that isn't real isn't possible because you've just gotten
used to living in this cage and this is very
unfortunate because to me living life is all about living
a rich life a life where you're expanding and this
case is especially heartbreaking because she is my mom and
I see her wasting her potential and I see her
wasting her life and I know she's got this extraordinary
ability because I've seen her paint I've seen her draw
in fact all through middle school in high school whenever
I got art assignments in school you know sometimes a
teacher wants you to draw something as a project I
would always hand that off to her and she would
secretly do it for me then I would submit the
work and everyone in class including the teacher was so
impressed that I had the best artwork in in the
class whenever we had these assignments and it was all
because of her and not only is it that her
career is weak but when you have a weak career
that's like having a weak backbone a weak foundation that
then infects all the other aspects of your life from
that weak career you get a weak social life and
you get a weak hobby life and you get a
very weak rest and recreation and entertainment time and you
get weak health physical health emotional health all of that
suffers because the backbone is eroded and perhaps the most
heartbreaking for me of all this is that even given
all that as if that wasn't bad enough I feel
like me and my mom are drifting further and further
apart with every year that goes by because for me
I'm trying to do my thing which is out there
self actualizing and studying all this material and learning and
building businesses and traveling and going to seminars and exploring
life and trying to take in and savor everything I
can before I'm dead and she's doing her thing which
is not that and what happens is that there's not
even a common ground for us to relate on anymore
hardly even have a phone conversation because we're on such
different wavelengths and that to me is a shame and
I wish that she had a richer life a life
of fewer regrets but that's her let's talk about you
what about you what is your life about do you
even know is the work that you're doing the most
meaningful thing that you could be doing in your life
think about this you've got one life you've got this
one precious opportunity it's a miracle that you're even alive
that you were even born and that you come into
this really a magical existence this existence we inhabit is
magical there's no other word for it and you have
all these opportunities and now you're living in the 21st
century with all the economic prosperity and all the technological
opportunities and the global economy we have all this all
this is in your favor and what are you doing
with it of all the things you could possibly be
doing what you could be contributing how you could be
living your life and turning it into an art form
and sharing your greatest gifts with the world you're just
letting that go by what's it going to take for
you to wake up from your deep sleep from your
unconsciousness and stop limiting yourself and to really take this
idea seriously of living up to your full potential because
like Abraham Maslow says if you deliberately try to live
below your potential then you're going to doom yourself to
a miserable life I find that a very accurate forecast
of your future I mean what do I have to
say in order to get your mind to take this
idea seriously you know the best way is to have
you contemplate your own death I mean I can start
dragging I wish I could just like drag out photographs
right now of the Holocaust of 9/11 of the trenches
and the beaches of Normandy of slavery of the plague
destroying millions of lives in Europe in the Middle Ages
of cancer victims who are going to die in a
week or in a month or tomorrow car crash victims
who wasted their lives and then they just died suddenly
unexpectedly in a car crash or a plane crash that
you see on the news that could easily be you
this seems morbid but it's not morbid because it puts
your life into perspective see most of the time what
you do in life is you spend distracting yourself you
spend it distracting yourself from the fact that you do
have very little of this life left and the fact
that you're pissing it away well I'm here to tell
you to wake the [ __ ] up because your
life is precious and the limits that are there that
you feel are there in life this is not the
world limiting you this is you limiting you and this
here is one of the most positive things that I've
discovered in all of my studies of personal development and
in my studies of life is that in fact the
limits that are there are self-imposed limits and this might
seem a little negative at first but actually it's the
most positive news you can get because this means that
if they were self imposed they can be self unemployed
and that's exactly what I proposed for you what I'm
talking about here is finding your life purpose making your
life mean something making your life about one thing and
that one thing is your life calling and your dream
career what is it that you're going to be doing
with your work here on earth how are you going
to be contributing to the world in the most meaningful
way because what I've discovered is that if you can
figure out this piece of the puzzle of life this
is one of the most powerful pieces of the life
puzzle to figure out it's one of the most meaningful
and rewarding when you get it right and it's a
shame that so few people have actually figured this out
I've coached many people people who you could say are
not too successful people who are kind of average people
who are extraordinarily successful who make six figures and more
and what I found is that even the most successful
people generally have no clue what their purpose is in
life and that tells me that all these people are
missing out on the sweetest highest pleasures in life the
highest pleasures in life are not drugs or food or
sex or money the highest pleasures in life are these
higher consciousness pleasures they're this like a satisfaction the satisfaction
you get from knowing that you are conquering yourself and
conquering life and living life richly and I see too
many people missing out on that what I've discovered is
that life purpose is the most important personal development change
that you can make both for your fulfillment levels and
also for your success in life and the only qualification
I would add to that is that second only to
enlightenment if you become enlightened that will be a life
altering change but this life purpose thing is really high
up there and it's very practical this is what most
people need this is what most people lack so what
I decided to do having coached clients on this issue
now for a couple of years is I decided to
put everything together in one tight package all the psychological
information you need to know and there's a lot of
it all the counterintuitive concepts all the theory all the
techniques all the application of the theory I spent the
last five months researching this rereading a bunch of old
books on life purpose compiling it all together and now
I'm really excited to introduce to you what I call
the ultimate life purpose course this course is over 20
hours close to ninety HD videos over 200 gigabytes of
material explaining how to discover your top passion and then
how to use the abstract life purpose that you discover
to actually build your dream career or your dream business
this was a deeply personal project for me not just
because of my mom also because my dad which is
a whole can of worms that I'm not going to
go into um both of them have really I think
wasted their potentials but also because of me because I
spent the last ten years of my life trying to
figure this out for me going through a ten year
trial and error process trying to figure out what is
my spot in life what should I be doing in
with my life that's actually going to be meaningful to
me and I feel like over the last year or
two I finally found it I don't know why but
from a young age I was kind of blessed with
this intuition or innate wisdom to seek out a life
purpose I don't know why it happened but I felt
like if I'm gonna have a rich powerful life that
I'm really in love with to love my life I
need to love what I do and I need to
find that one thing that I'm going to commit myself
to and so from a young age I started to
look for what that is but just because I had
that innate wisdom and just because I started looking didn't
mean that I found it so I spent a lot
of time trying to find it and I went down
a lot of dead ends I actually did create what
I thought was my dream career right out of college
and I had a pretty good job nine-to-five job I
was a video game designer but then I discovered quickly
within about a year that actually hated that job and
that that job wasn't aligned with my top values I
didn't know much about myself back then because I was
in my early 20s I was still discovering who I
was so that led me on to the next thing
which was to start my own business and so I
had no business experience but I went off and did
that and had success there but the business I started
was also the wrong business for me so again another
dead-end and then I went to some other business ideas
and those were dead ends until finally I went into
actualized org and this process it started off as just
wild guessing and trial and error first but then along
the way I started reading books started looking at seminars
started started listening to smart people going into coaching getting
various training and then of course starting my own coaching
practice coaching other people on all this and from that
starting to see patterns emerge and seeing all the common
mistakes and pitfalls that people make in this journey and
so I sort of taking notes and compiling all this
stuff together to get like a really accurate model of
what it takes to discover your passion find your life
purpose and then you're aligned your whole life with it
this to me is the most amazing thing is that
when you're living your life congruently aligned with your top
values and with your top strengths and talents and everything
just comes together in such a beautiful way and you
wake up in the morning feeling like you're living a
congruent life like you don't have to tolerate and put
up with a bunch of [ __ ] from your
boss or from this person or from that person but
that you're on your own path in life you're on
the hero's journey to me this is what life is
about but when I look around I see very few
people that live life this way and not surprisingly they're
quite miserable and frustrated and they don't have that sense
of gratitude about life it's amazing when you actually align
your life and you're congruent with all your values you're
living your life purpose you get this sense of gratitude
life becomes beautiful a joy even when something bad goes
wrong and it does you're not living in paradise your
life is still a joy and you have this you
have this appreciation for the fact that you're alive and
you have the sense that you're going to die soon
and that's okay because you're living your life well in
this short amount of time that you got so what
I propose here is that we help you to get
this issue handled once and for all in your life
it's time to stop stalling and delaying and procrastinating and
sticking your head in the sand and what I'm doing
here is I'm making this course available I want to
tell you a bit more about what this course includes
and how it works basically from all the clients that
I've coached or last couple of years what I decided
to do is just take that process that I use
that I've refined with my clients and just make that
available but even more than that I decided to just
take it up another couple of notches because I found
that in coaching clients one-on-one there's a lot of information
like theory and important concepts that I wasn't able to
communicate with them just because our time is so limited
and coaching one-on-one is so expensive right now I charge
over three thousand dollars for three to six months of
coaching with client this course includes more information than you
would get in six months of coaching with me this
course will teach you how to discover your life purpose
how to get on track with the purpose that you
discover because your purpose is an abstract thing we teach
you how to get on track with it especially in
those critical early stages when you're first starting off and
you're first writing to try to build that momentum and
it's so difficult so I walk you through that and
then there's a focus and an emphasis on how to
stay on track over the long run because one of
the things I discovered is that it's easy to start
a project but then what do you do six months
in twelve months in a few years in when you're
starting to doubt yourself and you're losing motivation and you're
not feeling inspired anymore and you're self sabotaging you're procrastinating
how do you deal with all those issues this course
goes into a lot of depth on all that who
is this course good for here are some folks that
I think it applies to really well if you're a
professional who's considering a career change because you're not satisfied
with your career and you know that it's not right
for you this course is perfect for you also if
you're an aspiring entrepreneur which means that you've been kind
of toying around with the idea of starting your own
business but you're not quite sure how to start or
you've got some fears that are holding you back this
course is perfect for you also if you're an old
entrepreneur meaning that you've already made successful businesses maybe you
already have a business that earns you a good amount
of money but what you're lacking is you're lacking that
me meaning that deeper sense of love for your work
I can help you find that I've coached clients through
helping um through helping them to find that and it's
amazing when you take can take a an already-existing entrepreneur
who's already successful and already knows and has you know
successful habits usually if you're an entrepreneur and you're successful
then you've already got it a lot of good stuff
going in your life but then taking it up to
the highest level possible which is finding that perfect fit
that perfect alignment of your work and your talents and
the greatest contribution you can make on the world also
this course is great for aspiring artists and creatives so
if you want to be a writer or a musician
or an actor or a movie director or an artist
or a painter anything like that that's like creative work
and you're not quite sure how to make that work
and you're struggling with those creative challenges this course will
be really good for you this course is also good
for people that are stuck in wage slavery and want
an opportunity to break out of that one of the
greatest benefits that I've gotten from this journey is simply
the freedom and the independence that I have now I'm
completely financially independent I set my own schedule I work
my own hours I can take vacations whenever I want
I still work hard though but it's it's amazing especially
if you're a person that loves and values independence or
freedom this is a really powerful thing for me personally
I couldn't have it any other way the freedom this
gives me to go out there and pursue my personal
development my other passions and my hobbies and my my
health and fitness and other stuff that comes up in
my life is invaluable invaluable I don't know how I
would live if I was still working a nine-to-five job
not to say that there's anything wrong with a nine-to-five
job can be fine as long as you love what
you're doing there but some of us also love our
freedom this course is also great for people that are
stuck in a rut in life maybe you're just coming
out of a bad relationship or a divorce or you
know something's been going on you're going wrong in your
life for a while and you've been just stuck and
not going anywhere and you want to launch yourself to
the next stage open the next chapter in your life
well this course is perfect for you if you're lost
in life and you don't know what life is about
or what your direction life should be this course is
perfect for you if you're a college student or a
high school student who's just entering life and starting to
figure stuff out and isn't sure what to major in
or even if you're majoring in something that you're kind
of interested in but you're not quite certain about it
or you just want to have a really solid foundation
for how to take your major and just drive it
all the way home so you can become world-class in
that major and really kick ass and avoid all the
pitfalls that are going to be there for you on
that journey this course is perfect for you and also
if you're just a self-help junkie and you love studying
this stuff and you like understanding yourself deeper on really
deep levels if you want to understand yourself then this
course will be perfect for you I walk you through
every baby step in this course from A to Z
from all the concepts in theory down to the techniques
how to apply the techniques down to the nitty-gritty how
to set goals and action steps and go out there
to actually make this happen one of the most important
things for me was that we talked about the practical
implementation because it's very easy to talk about the stuff
in the abstract and then people get lost and don't
actually know well how do I take this concept or
idea and actually go create a result that's why there's
a strong emphasis in this course on practice with a
lot of assignments and exercises and worksheets and visualizations let
me give you a brief outline of the course first
thing we do is we get you stoked up emotionally
with a vision for what your life could be like
if you actually do live it aligned with a life
purpose and that's very important this course is not just
about logical facts or just one two three techniques this
is about finding passion passions about emotion so I show
you how to stoke that up in yourself also there's
35 videos covering 35 essential concepts that I discovered through
all the different research that I've done so that's the
theory component then we talked about a values assessment how
do we find very accurately your top 10 values I
help you to do that I walk you through step
by step the exact process that I refined from working
with dozens of clients there's a strengths assessment to help
you find your top five strengths as a human being
there's a life purpose assessment to identify very accurately your
life purpose then after we identify that we have you
articulate your life purpose so we actually have it written
it out in a nice concise way on a single
piece of paper then we have you create a vision
based on this life purpose statement what's your life actually
going to look like 10 or 20 years from now
something that inspires you then we talk about fears and
limiting beliefs this is a really important part of the
course because here we address all the limitations that we
impose on ourselves all the victim mindsets that we create
I show you how to identify those beliefs and fears
and how to eliminate them then we talk about programming
your subconscious mind with your life purpose so that not
only do you have it consciously but then you program
it into your subconscious mind and then you get the
law of attraction effect working for you then we talk
about how to start taking action how to take all
this theory and boil it down to concrete action steps
goals plans stuff you can start doing tomorrow we also
spend time talking about how to find your ideal niche
in the marketplace so it's not just about figuring out
what your cur should be or what your top passion
is it's also about how to smartly position yourself in
the marketplace so that you're occupying a unique niche in
the ecosystem that's out there and you can dominate that
niche it's a very important discussion that isn't talked about
almost anywhere we also talked about how to build powerful
habits habits that will keep you on track with your
new life purpose there's also a bunch of recommended books
that I give you that are all related to life
purpose these are very inspiring and powerful books there's an
FAQ section where I spent a lot of time talking
about all the different questions that people have commonly on
this journey because I want you to get all of
your questions answered so I give you dozens and dozens
of answers to common questions and then lastly as a
bonus what I'm going to be working on over the
next month as this course is released is inspiring audios
what I'm doing is I'm taking the top books on
life purpose that I know I'm taking the best most
inspiring wisdom packed excerpts from those books and these are
from masters people who have mastered this and really understand
how to live a passion life I take all that
and I make mp3s out of those so you can
listen to those and they're like 20 or 30 minutes
long you can listen to those in the shower at
work or at the gym or in your car when
you're driving around or when you're cooking a meal so
that you're getting inspired and this becomes an emotional thing
not just a logical thing so that's the outline of
the whole course over 20 hours of video over 200
gigabytes of content I spent several months just uploading this
content took me two months over 90 videos 90% of
this content is exclusive new content that has never been
talked about before on actualise org and that's going to
be exclusive to folks that sign up this course includes
exercises many exercises many worksheets also a lot of guided
visualizations where we work with your subconscious mind and lots
and lots and lots of concrete examples I really wanted
to make sure this course was practical not just theoretical
that's basically it this course is available now it's accessed
instantly online so there's no need to wait for anything
to ship you don't even need to download anything you
can just stream everything right into your web browser put
a lot of work into making sure that it works
smoothly and effortlessly now a point about price yes this
is a paid course and that's because of the enormous
amount of effort that went into developing this course over
five months of work a lot of work a lot
of work shooting the videos and it was quite a
grueling process to shoot these 90 videos make sure they're
all consistent and make sure they're all high quality and
in fact what I'm committed to is improving the quality
of these videos even further after this course is released
and you're going to be getting those updates for free
if you sign up so a lot of effort went
into this so about the cost what I want to
say is that in a sense you know I've spoiled
you guys on actualised I don't work by releasing all
this other material for free and just having it out
there and I think that's important but also I think
that there's a there's a big downside to that the
downside is is that you don't take it seriously all
the material that I've released on actualize that are work
that's free that material can completely transform your life if
you actually apply it the prob is that most people
don't actually know how to apply it which is why
I'm including so many exercises and worksheets and practical examples
in this course is to help you to know how
to apply this stuff because most people don't know how
if if you're concerned about making a couple hundred dollar
investment in yourself then you got to wonder how successful
are you ever going to be in your life if
you're so cheap that you are afraid to invest in
yourself this course if you complete it and do all
the assignments and exercises will be worth hundreds of times
what you pay for it in the way that it
will shape the trajectory of your life this will completely
revolutionize how you look at life and how life should
be lived and how you view your career or your
business courses that are sold elsewhere with this amount of
content typically cost five hundred to a thousand dollars or
more that's not what I'm charging you here this course
I want to make it quite affordable so that almost
anyone can afford this course and I think that that's
what it ends up being so don't be cheap with
your personal development personally in my own life this year
just this year I've committed ten thousand dollars just for
seminars and retreats that I'm investing to myself because to
me investing money in personal development is the highest leveraged
investment that I can make it's better than investing money
in stocks in fact I pulled all my money out
of stocks because I'm not really thrilled with the prospects
in the stock market right now but I decided to
put that money into myself it'll be very worth it
for you if you actually do it which brings me
to the point of this course not being a magic
pill this is not a magic pill there's a lot
of time and effort you have to put into this
course to really work this course but then again if
you're a person who's really serious about living a powerful
life then this will be a negligible cost in terms
of time and money for you because you can see
the potential that this has if you just get this
part of your life taken care of this is not
a magic pill you are going to have to work
for it basically what this course is in a nutshell
is me mind [ __ ] you into living your
passion that's how I see it I don't see it
as just explanations and theories I try to get like
really emotional in this course because this course is personal
for me this to me is the essence of life
