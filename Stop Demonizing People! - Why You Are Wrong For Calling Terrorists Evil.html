hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
I want to talk about why you really need to
stop demonizing others we're gonna start off this video with
an exercise and you're gonna do the exercise now then
I'm gonna talk and then at the very end of
the video I'm going to tell you how to actually
use this exercise and get a lot of value out
of it so here's the exercise in a second I'm
gonna pause the video I'm gonna have a blank screen
for you you're gonna pause the video and then you're
gonna do this you're gonna get a piece of paper
on the top of this piece of paper you're gonna
write the three people I despise the most are and
then you're gonna write one two three and you're gonna
write down the names of the three people that you
despise the most in your life by despise I mean
you really don't like them they really gall you maybe
you openly despise them maybe you kind of secretly despise
them you don't really even admit to yourself that you
despise this person maybe you tell yourself that you're a
person that doesn't think that other people are despicable that
you like everybody well I'm gonna tell you that you
should be really self honest on this exercise and really
dig deep and see who are the people out there
in your life that really gall you you're gonna pick
three people now a lot of times when I say
this people will go and pick the obvious most obvious
examples of evil people like Hitler and Osama bin Laden
as people they despise I'd say stay away from those
for now instead focus on people you know a little
bit more intimately these gonna be people that you know
personally from your family life or your friends or your
colleagues at work or your boss or it could be
a celebrity that perhaps you kind of follow but you
kind of despise or maybe a pundit on TV or
something like that or maybe a person throughout history but
just don't go with the most obvious examples I want
you to really be accurate here after you write down
these three names what you're gonna do is you're gonna
write down also one quality for each of these people
that is the despicable quality that you really don't like
about them so each name one quality that's the exercise
go ahead do it right now pull out a piece
of paper alright pause the video now all right welcome
back so if you've done that exercise good now put
it off to the side you're gonna pull it out
at the end of this video I'm gonna tell you
what to do with it let me talk though about
demonizing other people this is something that I see that
I find extremely extremely ugly people demonizing other people and
this is something you see a lot more often than
you think you would see it and you do this
too which is the relevance of this video to you
so it's not that others people do it you do
it you know it's interesting in 10th Grade I had
one of the hardest classes that I ever took in
my entire schooling career and that was ap European history
and there I had a teacher who was a real
kind of hard-ass hard-nosed teacher and really expected a lot
of us and we work really hard throughout the entire
year just preparing for the AP exam and I struggled
the most in that class but I also learned the
most in that class and one of the things I
really learned in that class is my love for knowledge
and my love for philosophy that's what I developed there
at the very end of the class after we got
done with all the tests and stuff we got a
little time to relax and we were just sitting in
a circle and the teacher would ask us questions we've
gone around and certainly entire class all 30 of us
or so would answer one by one and we would
go around and around and round asking different questions and
this way we'd get to know everybody little bit better
and one of the questions he asked that I can
remember to this day which was a very profound question
he asked what's the most ugliest thing you've ever seen
and we went around the circle and when I got
to me I said conformity at that point I recognized
the kind of evils and dangers of conformity but I
think that now and I think about that question I'd
have to say that even more uglier than conformity is
the demonization of other people that I see out there
to me this is one of the ugliest things about
human beings and about society and about the way that
human beings behave when they are in a group this
happens because of fundamentally closed mindedness and lack of self
honesty so in this video we're gonna go in we're
going to talk about where the self on the self-dishonesty
is exactly and we're gonna try to open your mind
and open-mindedness it might sound like an kind of a
abstract woo a kind of concept but I think that
open mind this is one of the most important things
that people are missing which is preventing them from doing
the higher levels of personal development work that they need
to do so this is a very much important for
you to start to take this abstract notion and start
to actually say oh this is actually important to my
life this actually affects the results that I get in
my life so people love to demonize people and the
question is why why do people love to demonize other
people so much before answer the Alice give a little
taste of what we mean by demonization and who demonizes
whom so you know very common to demonize dictators and
bad leaders throughout history politicians and such so Hitler Saddam
Hussein Osama bin Laden George Bush Barack Obama or in
whatever country you're living in you know the leaders there
that you may not like or the opposition party that
you may not like so that's extremely common also common
to demonize and this is a little more closer to
home is parents siblings spouses and girlfriends and boyfriends very
very common to demonize the other person in this kind
of relationship when you're not able to get along with
them another category that's really popular is demonizing thinkers philosophers
and religious leaders you can beat even izing the person
themselves or you can also demonize their ideas you can
demonize a whole school of thought you can demonize an
entire religion so this is really common if you're student
of history you know that this goes all the way
back basically all of history is kind of like an
object lesson and demonization as far as thinkers and philosophers
and religions and ideas go also a little bit more
closer to home to me is demonization that happens on
the Internet this is super super common demonization on the
Internet so YouTube comments people demonizing each other in YouTube
comments but that's just a specific case of the more
general problem people demonizing each other through internet forums and
discussions that are happening online this extremely common what happens
with the immunization is that you create this separation fundamentally
between you and the other person and basically when you're
demonize demonizing someone you're making a judgement and you're pointing
at that person you're saying that that person is evil
but for a true demonization happen not only are you
pointing your finger at that person saying that person is
evil but you're also denying the fact that this is
a personal judgment of yours so when you really really
believe that someone is evil and you don't even want
to entertain the possibility that that is false then that
is what demonization is that's my definition of it here's
a truth that I want to tell you if you
demonize anyone ever in your life if you find yourself
doing this then you are definitely in the wrong you
right not the other person but you are in the
wrong the evil actually is within you not that other
person now that person might have done something despicable so
I'm not saying anything about that but what's more important
is what you're doing that's despicable now you might say
but no that person did something really really despicable and
that's what the argument is about no the problem is
not the other person the problem is you and it's
you who's doing the despicable thing and what you're not
recognizing there is actually you're behaving like that person if
they are in fact despicable what you're doing these situations
and you're very subtly this is a very subtle self
manipulation that you do is that you're acting to preserve
your own ego the the really fundamental problem with immunization
is that we have this reality that we live in
this you might call it a physical reality we live
in this and this reality is very neutral and devoid
of meaning and any kind of human additions that we
make to it but what we do is we go
around and we slap labels on things we slap labels
on objects and people and situations and even ourselves we're
always slapping labels on things and we do this with
thoughts with thinking and so with slots we slap these
labels on and what we're doing is we're all men
ting reality we're going around we're all men ting reality
and we're living in a very very mented reality which
is happening here not in some computer science fiction but
in here in your mind you're doing this but the
problem is that you forget that you do this you
don't admit that you do this and then you take
these augmentations to be the reality itself and you take
them very seriously and what this does is this creates
a lot of problems for you down the road why
does this create problems well because you end up living
in a fantasy of your own creation without understanding that
you're living in a fantasy and you confuse this fantasy
with the reality and this creates a lot of your
emotional suffering in life so people who demonize other people
you might notice that these people these generally aren't happy
people it's not possible for them to be happy because
they're living a falsehood and this one particular person who
they demonize that's just one manifestation of how they approach
life to demonize someone successfully you have to augment reality
with your own labels then you have to convince yourself
that these labels are actually true when in fact they're
not and so this can only happen when you're behaving
unconsciously when you're not really aware of what's going on
not aware of the manipulation that's happening on the inside
you manipulating yourself you lying to yourself you kind of
cheating yourself and so this creates a really fundamental problem
in the way that you interact with all of reality
and you might think that oh well it doesn't really
matter in this case you know I think that Hitler
is the evil and what's wrong with that but actually
this is like I said this is just got one
symptom of a much deeper problem the other thing is
that when you separate yourself from this other person that
you're demonizing is that you're not able to learn from
that other person because usually the reason that you demonize
someone in the first place is because you actually want
to keep from looking at what is there in reality
it's like a corner of reality that you don't want
to face and so what you say to yourself and
to others is that you point your finger at that
person says you say that person is evil and in
so doing you create this wall and you basically say
to yourself I don't have to really examine that person
his actions or that corner of reality I don't have
I have to kinda I basically just kind of block
it out I ignore it and I just say myself
that's purely evil there's nothing to be learned there there's
no reasoning there there's no valid arguments no valid points
there it's just pure evil you see politicians doing this
sometimes it helps them to avoid actually having intelligent on
rational argument about a particular situation because if someone wants
to ram a policy issue down your throat the best
way to do it is just to say oh now
the other opposition party is totally evil and what I'm
saying is just correct right it avoids having a debate
it avoids having to actually make nuanced distinctions and it
basically relieves you of the burden of having to seriously
consider some other some other position why do people do
this well because when you have to take into account
corners of reality that you haven't taken into account before
that can be a strenuous and emotionally challenging thing to
wrestle with in your mind you you have cognitive dissidence
personally in my own life I love the feeling of
cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonance is the psychological term for when
your model of reality comes into contact with actual facts
in reality or some other you know potential model of
reality and basically the two are contradictory and you can't
figure out how the two can fit together and so
what happen is that in your mind you suddenly start
to question your own model of reality and when this
happens you usually become afraid you can become angry can
feel hurt but this doesn't happen consciously it kind of
happens subconsciously you don't tell yourself that you're angry because
your model of reality isn't accurate in this case and
so what happens is that you kind of just shut
down and you turn your head the other way and
you don't want to look to me I've always loved
the feeling of cognitive dissonance I think that's one of
the powers that I have is kind of is the
ability to go in there and look at something and
say oh this this doesn't match with what I've got
that's cool I like that because then I can go
in and I can say to myself oh how can
I retool my model of reality to match the facts
a little bit better or how can I reach to
a my model so that it fits with that model
or maybe I can throw my entire model out and
take on the other model but see what I see
people doing is I see people not wanting to do
this in general I would say that 99% of people
in society do not like this and they always stick
their head in the sand like an ostrich when it
comes to to this cognitive dissonance and so they're not
learning from examples from other people and this keeps them
from really honestly looking inside themselves and this keeps their
ego alive they're cute this keeps their ego going and
this creates more and more problems for them down the
road and these problems are so subtle that you don't
recognize that these problems are stemming from this lack of
open mindedness and from the stimulation that you do by
the way it's different let's make a distinction it's different
to demonize someone and to disagree with them so I'm
not saying that you can't disagree with people it's okay
to say that someone is wrong someone can be factually
wrong you know someone can say that when you drop
an apple gravity's gonna pull it up and set it
down now that would be factually wrong and we can
disagree with them on that that's fine the difference is
when you demonize someone is you you call the person
evil or you call their ideas evil so let's make
that distinction clear also let's make a little distinction here
I want to draw a spectrum for you between different
kind of like levels of judgement and acceptance so on
the very far end of the spectrum the spectrum that
you don't want to be at the part of the
spectrum you don't to be at is demonization this is
when you do full-on proper demonization when you are calling
someone evil and you believe that they're actually evil in
reality then you can move a little bit closer to
the better side of the spectrum towards the middle of
the spectrum this is what I call judgment the judgment
area so this is demonization area this is the judgment
area in the judgement area this is where you simply
make kind of more casual everyday judgments most of us
do this a hundred times a day we might see
a person we might think they're ugly we might see
us you know read an ID in a book and
say there's a stupid idea or making judgments there that's
also an augmentation they're not as strong as demonization because
usually when you're making a judgment you in the back
of your mind at least you kind of recognize that
your judgment it's not like set in stone you kind
of understand that well I mean it's my opinion in
this case right I don't like this idea maybe somebody
else likes this idea okay I think that person's ugly
maybe somebody else thinks that person's beautiful whatever so you
make these judgments and these judgments make no mistake they
also create lots of problems in your life I've got
other videos that talk about that you can see my
judgment video on that but you know still much better
why is it much better because you're a little bit
more open-minded to your judgments changing you might say well
I have this one judgment here maybe I'll maybe I'll
change that maybe a couple years later I'll think that
this belief that I read in a book or this
theory that I read but actually be true okay your
judgment a little bit more flexible and then you move
to this very end this far end of the spectrum
over here and when you do that you come to
acceptance acceptance is the accepting of reality exactly as it
is without augmenting it in any way with your own
labels without deluding yourself that these labels are real which
is what you do even when you judge stuff when
you just stuff you still tell yourself that the thing
you're judging that this judgment is actually a part of
reality that's why you feel bad when you see something
ugly or you see something in your life that you
don't like you judge that you don't like it you
judge a certain situation as being bad for you and
so you resist it all the time the acceptance part
of the spectrum is when you accept everything exactly as
it is and as you can probably tell very few
people have a psychology that can allow them to do
this because this allows complete openness of mind you have
to be able to accept all of reality not just
the parts of reality that you like personally and that's
really what's happening here when you're creating these separations between
you and other people and other other things through judgments
and through demonization is that fundamentally they're carving out aspects
of reality that you like and you're separating them and
you're kind of pitting them against aspects of reality that
you don't like personally right you're just one organism in
this larger universe and so just because you don't like
a particular thing doesn't really say much about reality itself
just because you don't like something doesn't mean that somebody
else needs to agree with you on that just because
you don't like something or you think something is bad
or evil doesn't make it actually so and this is
a distinction that you have to draw on your mind
but it takes a lot of intellectual honesty and self
honesty to admit this it already requires a lot of
openness of mind to admit this and a lot of
people don't want to go there so someone like Hitler
you might say but Leo what about someone like Hitler
isn't this person truly evil aren't there truly evil like
I understand leo I understand that sometimes we go overboard
and we judge people and I do it - sure
I'll admit that but you have to admit Leo that
some people are just truly evil and when I'm telling
you this video is no I'm not gonna admit that
and in fact what you need to do is you
need to come around and see that that's not the
case at all the people that you think are truly
evil are not really that that's a judgement you make
that's a judgement you make based on certain beliefs you
have certain preferences you have even your position in this
world as a life form as a human being already
predisposes you to think that certain things are evil and
certain things are not evil anything that threatens your life
you automatically tend to label as evil but if you
think about it more objectively what does that have to
do with reality itself what does reality care what does
the universe care about your life it really doesn't care
much about it at all so some threatens your life
on a social level will say okay that's that's evil
and on a personal level you'll say okay yada I
definitely want that in my life I don't want to
get killed that would be a bad thing we have
to recognize that this is a subjective judgement right you
recognize this is a subjective judgment even in the most
heinous crime that you could imagine which you would say
Hitler is a heinous criminal you still have to see
the larger picture of it that in a really big
picture in the ultimate objective picture actions are never good
or evil actions are simply actions they are exactly what
they are without your addition of judgment on top of
them the addition of judgement you can see it happens
in your mind you can actually sit down and notice
the judgment happening it's a story that's been told in
your mind it's a story a lot of people get
offended by this when they hear this old Hitler but
he'll Hitler's evil how can you say he's not evil
it takes a big and open mind to be able
to reason about these things objectively one little clue that
you can use and you can use as a rule
of thumb as you go through life and develop yourself
is that in any situation where you get easily offended
that's weakness of mind on your part that's a smallness
of mind on your part that's not the situation's problem
that's not my problem that's your problem if you get
offended because getting offended what that means is that you're
upset about reality being other than the way that you
want to be you want to live in a fantasy
but then you come in contact with reality and reality
is different than a fantasy so you tell yourself that
oh but Hitler is truly evil no see Hitler is
a part of reality you want to deny this that
this part of reality exists and you want this part
of reality to not exist you want it to not
have existed it exists it existed in the past now
you can say it shouldn't have existed we can have
a whole long debate about that and I would agree
with you and I say yeah it's probably a good
idea that it didn't exist nevertheless it existed so it
doesn't really matter what you think about reality reality could
go exactly opposite to everything that you want it to
be like you can live a life where everything against
you everything is against you everything wrong happens to you
but that wrongness is still happening from your point of
view in a larger point of view there's no wrong
as being done is just life living itself who are
you to say how life is supposed to run very
arrogant of you to presume that you know the right
way for life to to run and isn't it interesting
that when you have ideas about how I should run
it's always about you always about you it's always about
how your life can be a little bit sweeter how
your life can be a little bit richer a little
bit more secure a little bit more comfortable a little
bit nicer how convenient of you to expect that reality
should conform itself to what you desire and to what
feels nice to you so we have to get very
real about this stuff right we have to get real
about this stuff that when you're demonizing other people what
you're what you're really doing is you're blocking off parts
of reality and this is a deep mistake because reality
is actually neutral your mind creates this separation because at
the very bottom of it as a very root of
it you need to feel like an entity like a
self and so to feel more like a self what
you do is you construct enemies around you in the
environment you construct problems you do this not only with
people but you do this with situations too is you
construct these enemies and these problems in these challenges because
you feel like there's something here that needs to be
protected this is what we call the ego or the
self you right now you can point your finger at
you go ahead and nod your head right now nod
your head that's you that's what I'm talking about that
entity that you think is experiencing life that's that owns
this life of yours this entity feels like it needs
to be protecting itself all the time it needs to
feel real to feel solid now you might say well
leo feel solid it's already solid why would it need
to feel solid now this is a very deep point
that I'm going to cover in other videos especially my
spiritual alignment video but actually at the very center of
it it's hollow it's an illusion this sense of self
it feels extremely real it feels extremely solid but actually
it's a hollow illusion to keep this hollow illusion from
unraveling itself what happens is that more and more layers
of ego get layered on top and these layers are
extremely tricky and self deceptive and so in practice what
this means is that you go through your life creating
separations so that you can feel like you're in a
fight to survive life so that you're in survival mode
when you're in survival mode what that does to your
ego is it makes the ego feel alive and it
makes that you feel real even if it's a negative
situation even if you're scared or threatened or angry you
might say but Leo I don't want that in my
life actually on some level you do want that in
your life because what it does is it creates a
stronger sense of self you feel alive when you do
that and you feel significant you feel like a somebody
it builds up your story of self that you've been
building up your entire life what would happen if we
remove that story entirely and we shattered it to pieces
you don't want to consider that possibility because if you
actually sit down and seriously consider that possibility it's gonna
scare you shitless because you don't know what life would
be like without you you don't imagine that this is
possible or desirable and so what you do is you
cling to your ego you attach yourself to certain situations
in life and you also deny other situations in life
and you demonize people that's where the demonization comes from
and you create enemies and you point your finger at
situations and people out in life and you make enemies
of them because what it does is it actually allows
you to create a partition this way see because the
evil that you actually sense in those people if you
think it hitler is evil the evil you sense in
him that's actually an evil within you you understand that
that's an evil within you because you're feeling it right
it's your mind is happening in your mind but to
deny that what you do is you point your finger
at him and you external eyes it you project it
on to something out there and you say me I'm
here Hitler's over there and there's a separation between us
and so what he is is not part of me
but actually what he is is you but see you're
denying this you're not accepting this you're not allowing this
this is intolerable because your worldview doesn't allow for this
possibility your worldview is based around your entire ego and
your worldview is based around the idea that you're a
separate entity from the rest of reality which just turns
out to be a complete falsehood and so you're living
in falsehood all the time and you might wonder at
this point well Leo this is getting very deep and
profound but where how does this connect to my everyday
existence well you're living this falsehood all the time you're
not accepting reality as it is you can't even sit
down right now and be happy in the moment if
I tell you to sit right now and close your
eyes and just sit in silence for 10 minutes you're
not going to be able to do it you're not
going to be happy you're gonna be frustrated gonna be
agitated why is this the case because the ego it
needs to be in motion all the time is like
a shark if it's not swimming through water it's gonna
suffocate and die it needs to be swimming to oxygen
oxygenate itself so motion needs to be created separation needs
to be created enemies need to be created problems need
to be created because of this you can't just sit
and be inside of reality as it is look reality
is exactly the way it is right now no matter
what you think about it what you like about it
what you don't like about it whether it's favourable to
you whether it's not favorable to you whether your life
is in danger or it's not in danger that doesn't
matter on the grand scale of things because that's reality
right we live in a reality where your life can
be in danger we have live in a reality where
you can die tomorrow that's just reality we live in
a reality where there are murders where there are rapists
we live in a reality where there's a charity being
done well there's acts of kindness we live in a
reality where there's acts of hatred we're like well let
me look we live in a reality where we have
acts of terrorism we live in a reality where we
have ignorance and bigotry and racism we live in a
reality where we have scientific advancements we live in a
reality we have lies and falsehoods we live in a
reality where we have countries like the United States and
European countries Western countries that are advanced we live in
a continent in a reality where we have very underdeveloped
countries and very kind of countries that are still stuck
in the dark ages like North Korea or countries in
certain countries in the Middle East in that part of
the world we learn to come in in a world
where in a reality where we have poverty and also
extreme richness and extreme abundance so we have all these
you know all these kind of polar opposites and all
these extremes within reality and that's just a part of
reality now what you want to do is you want
to say but all this all this stuff on this
side all the poverty and all the rape and all
the murder and all the genocide all that that's evil
but to say that you need to say that that's
a part of reality that I don't want you're trying
to live in a fantasy not into the real reality
because of this you're not literally able to just sit
and be happy because there's always something about reality that
you wish was otherwise you see that this is very
deep and it doesn't just apply to extreme situations like
genocide and and rape and murder and stuff but it
applies to the things that are happening your day-to-day Liston's
so tomorrow you're gonna wake up and things are gonna
be happening in your life that you wish weren't there
you wish you didn't get that email you wish your
boss didn't yell at you you wish your wife was
a little nicer to you you wish your husband would
kiss you in the morning or at night you wish
all these things see but what you're doing there's you're
living the fantasy because of this you can't sit and
be happy because there's always some thing that you wish
would come in and secure your happiness well that's never
gonna happen never gonna happen you have to start to
understand that these enemies that you're creating out of your
husband out of your girlfriend out of your boyfriend out
of a political figure whoever or even out of impersonal
situations in life right with your money problems with your
bankruptcy with your business or whatever that these are internal
enemies that you are externalizing to prevent yourself from doing
the real inner work of looking inside and this is
why this is the ugliest thing ugly as a judgment
this is why this is the ugliest thing that I
am that I've seen because it's because people demonize and
it's because people are closed-minded it is because people judge
they keep themselves in an unconscious cycle and they're never
able to develop themselves above all these problems because if
you develop yourself long enough which you recognize is that
these problems were all created in your mind and these
problems can dissolve that's the positive message here it might
sound like everything I'm saying is being depressing because I'm
forcing you to accept a reality which to you seems
negative but actually when you accept all of reality you
don't see it as accepting the negative evil aspects of
reality what you do is you remove the distinction between
good and evil entirely and contrary to what you think
right now when you remove that distinction what happens is
actually all of reality becomes sweet even what you think
right now is as evil and as despicable to you
you open yourself up to it and it actually isn't
as despicable and sour tasting as you thought it was
and at that point when you do that when you
move totally to acceptance you might think of leo I
don't want to be totally at acceptance well you don't
want to be because right now you're unconscious when you
actually develop a little bit of consciousness you realize I
want to be at acceptance well I don't want to
be at acceptance because I want to be happy no
matter what life is doing I can't really control life
a lot of stuff in life happens outside my control
so what I can do though is I can strengthen
myself enough to literally be happy with whatever is going
on but to do that I need an extreme openness
of mind and I need to stop demonizing other people
and other situations and I need to take responsibility for
the inner demons that I have rather than projecting them
all out into the world what you think terrorism is
about what do you think terrorism comes from it comes
from a demonization and what do you think the other
side right European governments American governments the wars that are
created there all this this tension happening with terrorism stuff
or you think that's that that's coming from that's also
coming from the demonization right you might say but terrors
are really evil the people who are I guess the
terrorists are also evil why are they also evil because
they're projecting their demons out into the terrorists they're not
facing them on the inside and this is a big
promise to be a problem for you personally in your
life but see your personal problems also expand out and
create all the social problems that we have so all
the social problems we have they come from this problem
of demonization that we've been talking about here and this
closed-mindedness all right so in wrapping this up let's get
back to the exercise that you did well I want
you to do now I want you to take out
that piece of paper those three people that you despise
and at the top of the paper you had written
something like these are the three people that I despise
the most I want you to cross that whole phrase
out right now with the pen and I want you
to write these are the people and qualities that I
will work to accept and to integrate into my life
these are the people and qualities that I will work
to accept and integrate into my life and then your
job is to work to integrate this into your worldview
because right now your worldview is disintegrated this integrated parts
of reality that means that parts of reality are being
denied so start accepting those parts of reality that you've
been denying even if it doesn't feel pleasant to you
right now to do it alright this is Leo I'm
signing off I'm gonna give a credit to eben pagan
for this exercise that's where I got it from one
of his seminars and I believe he might have gotten
it from Nathaniel Branden who wrote six pillars of self-esteem
