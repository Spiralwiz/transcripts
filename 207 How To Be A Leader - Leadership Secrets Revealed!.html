            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/I0GDMX6rixk' target='_blank'>How To Be A Leader - Leadership Secrets Revealed!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leadership is not reserved for CEOs or corporate bigwigs</b>: Leadership is essential to live a fulfilling life and contribute to the world. It is relevant for every individual in their personal and professional lives, including small businesses, social circles, relationships, and communities.
</li><li><b>Misconception that leaders fight for power and control</b>: Leadership is not about controlling or fighting for power. Modern leaders lead by consensus building, creating a better future for everyone involved.
</li><li><b>Dissatisfaction with the status quo as the onset of leadership</b>:  Leaders feel dissatisfaction with some aspect of society, conceive of a better world, and then lead others towards that vision.
</li><li><b>Ability to see the future as the core skill of leadership</b>: leaders need to formulate a vision of the future with emotional charge that inspires followers, beckoning them to participate in its realization.
</li><li><b>Leadership involves changing systems</b>: Leadership involves shifting the center of gravity and moving everyone in the right direction. A leader serves as the proxy visionary for those who lack vision and are stuck in present circumstances.
</li><li><b>Leaders live in a higher reality than average persons</b>: Leaders detaching from present limitations can see potentials in the future. They help others recognize that while reality is a certain way, it can be different and we should work towards that change. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to change</b>: The leader perseveres past resistance and criticism because they understand that people often resist change and prefer staying in their comfort zones. Yet, once change occurs, it seems obvious and necessary in hindsight.
</li><li><b>A leader's resilience in the face of criticism</b>: Often, leaders face criticism and ridicule while trying to make drastic changes. They may be called various derogatory names, but they persevere through all the opposition because of their powerful vision. Not only do they envision a better future, but they also ensure that others join them on this journey, resulting in significant changes in reality.
</li><li><b>Fulfillment in leadership</b>: The ability to shape reality for the better gives leaders immense fulfillment and joy. According to Leo Gura, it's one of the most rewarding experiences that most people miss out on.
</li><li><b>Leadership beyond corporate world</b>: The concept of leadership is applicable to everyone, not just CEOs or corporate figures. Being a leader includes showing people that change and evolution are safer than remaining stagnant in comfort zones. As the world is in constant flux and competition is ubiquitous, the capacity to adapt and evolve is essential for survival. 
</li><li><b>Realistic plans and understanding systems</b>: Leaders need to have practical plans to materialize their visions. They also need to understand how systems work and be able to bring about changes within them. Being adaptable and capable of looking at the world from multiple perspectives aids in this understanding.
</li><li><b>A leader as a calming influence amidst chaos</b>: Leaders act as a pillar of strength in times of crisis. Staying calm and grounded when everything is going wrong is another important responsibility of a leader. 
</li><li><b>The challenge of leadership</b>: Leadership is an arduous task that requires maintaining a fine balance. Leaders must refrain from playing the victim, take full responsibility for the happenings around them, and consistently step out of their comfort zones. 
</li><li><b>Self-leadership</b>: Mastering self-leadership is the first step to being an effective leader. This involves managing one's fears, stress, self-talk, and external influences. One must be able to lead themselves before they can lead others. 
</li><li><b>Understanding systems and niche-specific knowledge</b>: A leader must understand how systems work and how to bring about changes within them. They should also have specific knowledge about the system they're working within, whether it's their business, market, or social circle. 
</li><li><b>Eight key roles of a leader</b>: A leader is a visionary and aligner. They resolve conflicts, inspire and create, aware of the role they model, facilitate others, bring people from the known to unknown, have special skills and determination.

</li><li>4. a creator and motivator,
</li><li>5. a conscious role model who ensures their behavior aligns with the values professed,

</li><li><b>Personal Development for Leadership</b>: Personal development is critical for leadership because the very essence of leading lies in the ability to master one's own self. A leader needs to have honed various skills including personal and interpersonal, social, emotional intelligence, creativity, and communication among others. Leadership requires perseverance and consistent efforts to grow and evolve oneself as a holistic entity, mind, body, and emotions. 
</li><li><b>Leadership in Everyday Life</b>: Leadership isn't restricted to traditional leadership roles in businesses or organizations. Realizing oneself as a potential leader in different systems - be it family, school, college, or intimate relationships - is the first step towards effecting change. Being a leader entails bringing about change for the better and making an impact on the world, making it a compelling reason for personal growth and development.
</li><li><b>Leadership Requires Holistic Development</b>: Being an effective leader requires a holistic development of your body, mind, and emotions, making the role of a leader more than just a position, but a lifestyle. Attaining self-mastery enables one to live fully into their potential as a leader.
</li><li><b>Vision for Others</b>: Leadership also calls for having a strong vision not just for oneself, but for others under one's leadership. This involves making that vision align with your personal mission statement, creating a cohesive goal that benefits all, and encouraging followers towards the same goal.
</li><li><b>Goal is Deep and Lasting Change</b>: The aim for a leader is not merely to address temporary or surface issues that face the individuals under them, but to create deep, meaningful change in their lives. 
</li><li><b>Commitment to a Cause</b>: Leaders are encouraged to embark on a 'hero's journey', fighting for a cause that they are strongly passionate about. This journey should be so important to them that they are willing to invest a large amount of time and energy, and even risk failure or sacrifice, in order to see it come to fruition.
</li><li><b>Personal Development of A Leader</b>: The road to becoming a leader also involves personal development and growth in consciousness, body fitness, emotional awareness, and skillset over an extended period. The end goal is to become a fully realized leader who can congruently and powerfully effect change in the world.
</li><li><b>The Reward</b>: The reward from this journey to becoming a leader is much deeper than worldly success, it's a sense of fulfillment and connection to the world, a high consciousness satisfaction. The leader becomes a person who climbed their own personal Mount Everest and reached the peak by conquering their own weaknesses. The journey itself transforms them making them transcend their limitations. They fill their life with meaning and leave no room for regrets.
</li><li><b>Final Thoughts</b>: Leo, Leo, advocates for more individuals to strive towards becoming leaders in their own right, stepping out of their comfort zones and pushing their own personal boundaries. He ends with a call to action: find a cause worth fighting for, identify a personal 'Mount Everest', and start working towards it.
