hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about how to feel good
okay let's talk about how to feel good so what
does it take to feel good in your life and
if you're kind of asking yourself this question then I
would assume that you're not feeling as good as you
believe you could be that's good that's a good start
because you probably could be feeling a lot better than
you are feeling right now so how do we how
do we tackle this problem all right well let's take
a look at it like this so basically to feel
good in your life means very simply to live your
life good live a good life and you will feel
good live a bad life and you will feel bad
and this is kind of an old-school concept this is
a concept that you can find going back to the
ancient Greeks also going back to Buddhist ideas and classic
Hindu ideas from you know from texts like the Upanishads
and and that kind of stuff the bhagavad-gita and basically
you know they talk about they talk about living a
good life and the Greeks talked about living a good
life living a virtuous life and the reason they were
so hot on that and the reason we aren't so
hot on it today as a culture is because well
because they realize that this is the true path to
happiness and that the stuff that usually we think will
work doesn't work and the stuff that consumer society tells
us will make us happy doesn't actually make us happy
and you know the ancient seers the ancient sages they
realize this and they try to teach it to the
masses but the masses tend to rebel and not want
it they don't want the wisdom and so they tend
to kind of go and do the easy stuff that
they think will give them pleasure in titillation and make
them feel good and then that ends up backfiring on
them and then what happens is they come back crying
to the sages and ask us why did that hurt
me so bad why don't I feel good da da
da da how do I feel better and the sage
will say well I told you live a good life
and you feel good live a bad life and you
will feel bad so I'm going to introduce two terms
to you these are two sanskrit terms that I got
from Eknath s Ferran who was a scholar on ancient
Hindu texts and Buddhist texts and basically there's this ancient
idea from from the Hindus I think this comes from
the Upanishads it's written in Sanskrit to Sanskrit words one
is called preah and the other one shreya pray with
a pea shreya with an SH so what is this
preah is pleasure its immediate gratification it's the pleasure principle
it's the stuff that feels good right now preah is
eating a big chunk of chocolate fudge cake preah is
going on a rollercoaster ride priya is going to Disneyland
and eating some hot dogs and having fun like with
the kids right priya is having ridiculous sex amazing ridiculous
sex preah is eating those barbeque ribs pray is alcohol
priya is recreational drugs priya is winning the lottery priya
is you know being lucky and something kind of falling
on your lap or getting getting some big chunk of
money like a windfall so that's Priya immediate gratification what
is shreya SH shreya is doing the right thing the
thing that has lasting benefit what has lasting benefit does
that chocolate fudge cake have lasting benefit probably not do
those recreational drugs have lasting benefit are they the right
thing to be doing is that living the good life
probably not right and this applies to all the other
preyas out there so a lot of us are really
caught up in the preyas and I'm not doing enough
shreya shreya is the long-term stuff that's good for us
priya is the short-term stuff that's bad for us so
we're doing too much short-term stuff thinking this can satisfy
us right we think the television will satisfy us the
movies the girlfriend the boyfriend the drugs the food the
whatever other addiction you've got the Internet right we think
those things will really satisfy us and that mix is
very confused and so ultimately we think well but isn't
that isn't that the way to get maximum happiness is
to go after the stuff that is giving us the
most pleasure and you know you might think that but
that's a naive notion of happiness it's really naive if
that could be done I would do it all right
I have nothing I have no real moral compunctions against
drugs or just you know greasy food or against sex
or like anything else that's immediately gratifying I have nothing
against it and I've partaken in all that myself so
the question now is but will that make you happy
will that make you feel good and what you recognize
after you try that for a bit is that it
won't right and that the reason the sages the reason
the cedars and all the wise men of thousands of
years ago tell us to do the right thing and
to live a good life is because they they can
see what's going to happen they can see what's going
to happen when the instant gratification kind of leads us
off a cliff to our doom they can see that's
going to that's going to come and maybe you don't
see that right now you know you have to see
it in your own life too you have to become
a sage within your own life and see that to
feel good in your life if you've walked consistent high
quality good feelings then it's not the the easy stimulating
stuff they have to be going after it's the more
ethereal long-term you might even say spiritual kind of values
they have to be going after it's that stuff that's
going to make you fulfilled his status that's gonna make
you really feel good and what does that mean that
means hard work you know all the classic values hard
work and like honesty and discipline and and like loyalty
and and like exhibiting love and being excellent at what
you do and like being generous and giving back to
the world and being compassionate like all of these classic
values that sound kind of so lame but without that
I mean they're classic for a reason without them you
literally will not feel good not going to be possible
so you have to start to really challenge your own
naive notion of happiness until you do that then you're
going to be going after the short-term stimulating stuff and
that's not going to going to work if it did
work then I would be up here telling you to
do all that stuff and I would be doing it
myself because ultimately I'm about maximizing my happiness and to
maximize my happiness I found out that it's not going
to work through these these little short-term fixes and little
hits of stimulation that I'm getting I'm gonna have to
go all-out much deeper think more like a like a
sage than like a drug addict right who's more happier
a sage or drug addict interesting question okay so the
next point is you know what is an advanced notion
of happiness well in advance notion of happiness is actually
hard work and discipline and it's working towards something that
you value and that what you're working towards is something
that benefits the rest of humanity so ultimately your greatest
satisfaction is going to come from personal growth in your
own life and contribution giving back to the world and
contribution can take form in so many ways you can
start a business you can have a career that contributes
you know you could be contributing with your volunteer time
or your hobbies or whatever but ultimately I would encourage
you to get your business in your career in line
with contribution and also your personal growth so if you're
growing personally and you're contributing to the world that is
what's going to make you feel good that's how you
make become a solidly grounded feel-good type of person right
that's getting you a consistent even-keeled happiness like steady rock-solid
rather than this kind of spiky up-and-down roller coaster that
you're going through right now which even the happiness that
you are getting from that it's a low level of
happiness it can't even compare it's not even on the
same scale it won't register on the same scale has
the kind of happiness you get when you for example
create a business that actually helps millions of people or
when you are working in a career where you get
to help even a couple of individual people but you
really get to help them and you get to like
share your gifts with them share your knowledge or expertise
or you know some of your talents through through your
business or your career like that mm-hm that's real happiness
so it's getting your life on track with that right
it's the principle of right action also the principle of
that right action states that you do what is right
regardless of what you feel like in the moment and
if you're not feeling very happy in your life then
it's probably because you're you're slacking on this it's because
you know that there are right things you should be
doing the good stuff the Shreyas right the things that
are giving you lasting benefit but you're not actually doing
them because of the immediate gratification that you're getting from
from kind of the comfort layer that you're wanting to
have the immediate pleasure so a perfect example you know
go to the gym you know you should but you
don't because well you think that slacking on your couch
is going to make you feel happier than going through
the discipline and kind of the effort involved with getting
your ass up and going to the gym but actually
going to the GM is what's going to make you
happy that's what's going to make you feel good not
go to the gym that's gonna make you feel bad
even though it seems like it'll make you feel good
in the short term so starting to take right action
be very disciplined about this principle of right action so
how do you start how do you start to turn
her life around especially maybe if you're in a place
where you know you've got a lot of these preyas
preying on you mm-hmm and and you want to get
more into the shreya territory how do you do that
okay so here's a here's a couple of ways I'm
going to give you basically ways to start building good
habits that's what you've got to start doing right now
you've got bad habits habits that are holding you down
they're making you feel miserable and what you want to
start doing is to replace those replace them with good
habits what are some good habits meditation taking time by
yourself I call that solitude time to sit introspect and
contemplate journalling another awesome habit sit down and start writing
your thoughts out on paper reading awesome powerful habit for
personal development and growth and make yourself feel good studying
by that I mean not just reading but actually going
out and actively researching some topic that you're interested in
something related to your career or maybe a side hobby
that you have studying or your own personal development work
hard hard work towards something that's actually productive and meaningful
that's one of the most powerful habits you can happen
have and in fact it's almost like a spiritual habit
this was a spiritual discipline thousands of years ago it's
hard work right and that's for a reason and the
reason is because when you're working hard you get into
a state of flow and you start to feel a
kind of a disassociation with your lower self basically you
start to feel the higher quality W the humanity inside
you come forward and that feels amazing so hard work
Jim definitely encourage that excellent form of exercise at Yoga
Jim do that eating right eating healthy also very important
if your diet is horrible then you're going to have
a hard time establishing other positive habits addictions definitely eliminate
any kind of addictions that you have whether it's stuff
like television internet sugar food shopping you know there's a
whole list of them and I have videos about eliminating
addictions and the importance of that and then the last
point I would make is a eliminate and weed out
negative foss you have to weed out the negative thoughts
that keep coming up in your mind if you're always
thinking negatively it turns into a habit as well right
it's a negative thinking habit and you have to start
to shift that and turn it into a positive thinking
have it and that can take some work so I'm
not going to go into all the details of that
there but here are some good ideas for you how
to start feeling good in your life you have to
make the shift and initially when you do make the
shift it will be painful if you're hooked on drugs
if you're hooked on shopping on television on internet on
video games anything others kind of stuff you're doing stuff
that's giving you Media gratification is going to be hard
to wean yourself off of it but you know at
some point it kind of you reach a tipping point
and you start to realize that the stuff you've been
doing doesn't work and that it's making you feel bad
and you really want to feel consistently good and when
the point when you realize that is the point where
you really start to expand your horizons it's the point
where really your personal growth starts to take off that's
what it happens and then you start to slowly through
a painful process you start to put in some of
these good habits and then eventually those good habits crystallize
they solidify within you and then you start to run
kind of on autopilot and now what you're running on
autopilot but on good habits rather than the bad habits
that you run on a pilot on right now and
when you get there then you will start to feel
good so here what I did is I didn't give
you some sort of a little magic pill for how
to feel good I gave you the you know classic
ancient wisdom with a little bit of a modern spin
on it about how to practically make this happen modern
personal development ideas but ultimately you know the states back
thousands of years and that's because it's true and you
know that the stuff you've been doing right now you
got to cut out because it's been making you feel
bad so that's it that's how to feel good I'm
