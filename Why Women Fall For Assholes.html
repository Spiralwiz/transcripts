hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I want to talk about why women fall for
[ __ ] so two women fall for [ __
] or what this is a fun topic I like
thinking about this stuff I like think about any kind
of female attraction or dating type of topics it's just
fascinating to me I want to cover this because I
have some ideas about it because I've talked to so
many women I've tried to hit on so many women
literally thousands of women that I think I have a
little bit of insight into this topic I'm sure some
women have a different perspective on this but we'll see
where it goes so basically here's my thinking on this
idea women do fall for [ __ ] I've encountered
this I've actually encountered it through my coaching too I
coach people professionally right and I find this where a
woman will fall for a guy who she knows is
not the right guy for her who she knows is
the bad guy who she knows she should not be
in a relationship with but then she simply can't break
that off cannot break it off and it's it's baffling
to me not only that but it's kind of scary
right it's kind of scary that a guy can have
such a hold over a woman and I just experienced
as embarrassed relationships that I've been in that this kind
of effect happens and just from all the different stuff
that I studied and all the people that I've talked
to and clients that have coached so here's my theory
about how this works it's actually pretty simple so here's
what happens a woman in a man what is she
attracted to she's attracted to confidence she's attracted to assertiveness
she's attracted to status and she's attracted to edginess and
she's attracted to a certain sense of indifference in the
man now a lot of times a woman won't want
to admit this she won't admit it to herself she
won't admit it to other people she'll challenge me on
it right but the fact is that this is universally
what women like I mean I didn't want to believe
this when I started out a few years ago angie
was just studying you know how to get a girlfriend
I want you to try to get better and better
with women because I was really bad I did not
want to leave this I was a total nice guy
total choad nice guy right I would supplicate to the
woman I would try to do everything to please her
and of course no woman ever would want to date
me or be receptive to that women hate hate hate
that they run away from it because what it does
is it sub communicates low status and low value a
woman wants a high value guy she wants a guy
who has higher value in her eyes at least you
know she perceives a guy to be higher value than
her and for for her what that means in a
guy is that he is assertive he's dominant he's edgy
he's brash he's got options with lots of girls and
he's indifferent a lot of these characteristics there's a problem
with it because these are characteristics that create an [
__ ] right so at the same time the girl
loves these characteristics because they demonstrate masculinity they demonstrate a
lot of confidence and authority a lot of status and
a lot of value in a man but it's also
the case that a lot of times the men who
are the most assertive who are the most dominant who
are the most edgy who are the most indifferent and
who have the most options with women they're socially proofed
then those guys are the biggest dicks of the whole
population and so if a woman is looking and screening
guys really really hard on these criteria and she's looking
for the guy who maxes out each one of these
stats you might say I almost think about it like
a RPG game like a guy has stats right you've
got a sort of this dominance edginess indifference of social
proof with other girls and if you're maxed out on
all those then man you're going to do really well
with women but with those characteristics also come certain drawbacks
certain character defects you might say which then come back
to bite the woman in the ass except it's interesting
how this works because here's how it works a woman
is at an at a bar nightclub maybe she's in
a cafe guy comes to chat her up right if
he comes in there and he's very weak no assertiveness
no confidence he's mumbling he's shy he's insecure he doesn't
have strong eye contact he has bad body language he's
done he's not getting anywhere with that girl if a
guy comes in there he's he's witty he's charismatic he's
very assertive he instantly assumes rapport with that woman even
though she's a total stranger he just has the ability
to assume complete rapport with her he has the ability
to get very physical very quickly with her he has
the ability to be edgy she has the ability to
be adventurous and brash he's the ability to say whatever
he feels like without giving a [ __ ] what
she thinks or anybody else thinks he's very icy he's
chill he's almost carefree like he doesn't care about anything
he doesn't care if he gets this girl he doesn't
because he feels like he has so many options with
other girls he feels like he's very sexy he feels
very confident in himself he loves the way he looks
he's very arrogant in himself he thinks like he's the
[ __ ] that kind of guy if he comes
up to a girl bar club cafe wherever she's gonna
fall in love with him like very very quickly it's
scary how quickly this happens I know because I used
to be the the former guy and now I've really
been building myself up into this into this ladder guy
and man the difference is enormous its enormous it's it's
almost obnoxious how enormous this difference is and for a
long time I didn't want to believe it because when
you're a nice guy you want the girl to like
you and you want to rationalize in your mind that
well I'm a nice guy you know I want to
do nice things for the girl yes I'm a little
bit shy you know yes I'm a little bit supplicating
to her but she should like that because I'm doing
stuff for her and even women will think that this
is what they wanted a man and maybe this is
what they want later in the relationship with a man
but this is not what they're attracted to what they're
attracted to is that [ __ ] he doesn't strictly
have to be an [ __ ] but it just
so happens that a lot of times the [ __
] is the one who is the most assertive the
most dominant the most edgy the most brash the most
indifferent and he's also a player because when he's that
he's got so many options with girls he doesn't care
about any particular girl and what a girl is actually
attracted to is that even though a girl is not
attracted to a player per se a girl is never
going to be like oh you screwed a hundred girls
so that's really sexy to me no girl will never
think that but she's attracted to all these qualities assertiveness
dominance cockiness edginess and independence from outcome right the guy
when he's talking to the girl has to literally not
care whether he gets her or not if he goes
in there with that kind of attitude that his chances
of getting her are exponentially higher than if he comes
in there acting needy and desperate and really meeting her
for sex or love or companionship or whatever else well
what kind of guy is totally indifferent to whether he
gets the girl or not is that a guy who
has very little sexual experience or guy has enormous sexual
experience it's a guy who has enormous sexual experience so
even though a girl in her mind logically she's not
going to say yeah I want a guy with lots
and lots of sexual experience in practice that is what
you're saying as a woman if you're looking and screening
guys very hard for this for these kind of very
masculine characteristics because the way you develop those is by
banging lots of girls the guys that have those characteristics
at bay lots of girls because girls love them so
much and it's so easy it's ridiculously easy and of
course the guys that don't have those characteristics they're really
struggling because they're not getting the girls that are they're
really struggling to find those kind of girls so what
happens is a girl meets this kind of guy you
know who's alpha who's masculine on all these various characteristics
and of course she's very attracted to him she gets
this emotional wave and she just gets swept up in
the emotions of it of course he's got a killer
attitude he's got a killer instinct so he knows how
to do it he has sex with her really quickly
he has sex with her really quickly there's no logic
in there there's no screening for any relationship criteria or
anything it's just sex and once the girl has sex
unlike a guy who has sex and he doesn't really
get attached that much a girl she has a different
response she has a chemical response oxytocin gets released in
her brain in her system and that oxytocin has a
very interesting effect it creates this emotional attachment it's almost
like a duckling on duckling that's born and when a
duckling is born the first thing it sees it gets
imprinted on it's called imprinting this what they call in
psychology if the duckling sees the mother the duckling will
think that that mother is his mother if he sees
the first thing that he sees is not the mother
but something else like a sock puppet that he'll think
that that sock puppet is his mother and that's just
kind of like you know a biological mechanism that evolved
in a duckling which helps it survive when in its
youth now women have this kind of mechanism - and
what happens is that after sex especially after a few
times of sex especially the sex is amazingly good which
of course if the guy has a lot of sexual
experience it will be amazingly good so she has this
amazing sex with this guy and of course now she's
in love with him what is this this is a
chemical response of course it doesn't feel a chemical response
it feels like an emotional response it feels like this
is the perfect guy he's amazing my true love I
finally found him that's what it feels like and at
this point the girl she doesn't really know this guy
she slept with this guy maybe a couple of times
she knows a little bit about him but she doesn't
really understand his full identity his full is full personality
so what happens that she gets emotionally attached but see
the characteristics of this alpha guy that make him so
attractive to the woman in the first place those characteristics
are also the exact same characteristics which create problems in
one's life if they're out of balance not always but
it tends to be a double-edged sword and so what
happens is that it comes back to bite the woman
in the ass a lot of times so the woman
she gets emotionally attached and in this relationship she's running
off the emotions she's literally hooked to this to this
guy like a drug there's no logic going on here
right there's no logic I've coached a woman like this
in this kind of situation logic is no good we
can talk for a month about how this guy is
not right for you how he is abusing you or
how he's not filling the criteria that you want for
a man in your life we can talk about all
of that you will agree if you're the woman you
will agree to all of it and then you still
will not leave that guy we'll do it why is
this the case because you're running off emotions and this
chemical response it's like a drug addiction it's very hard
just like a drug addict you know that the drug
is not good for you you know that it's getting
out of hand you know that you should quit it
but you can't just because it's hard of the chemical
addiction it's not a logical thing so this is why
women will fall for an [ __ ] and then
she'll stay stuck with that [ __ ] for a
long long long long time this can create codepen relationships
abusive relationships toxic relationships you know needless fighting in relationships
a lot of up and down drama that kind of
stuff and see this guy's bad character traits they don't
really become obvious until much later into the relationship so
something for example like being very very assertive a guy
who's very very assertive is the kind of guy a
lot of times who has to not give a [
__ ] about what people think of him now this
can be a good thing in certain contexts but this
can also be a bad thing in certain context and
inevitably it tends it ends up backfiring on the woman
because actually as the woman in the relationship you want
that deeper intimacy and you actually want to like communicate
with your man right communication is important to you you
want to be on the same wavelength you want to
be able to talk about intimate topics you want him
to be able to be receptive to have that kind
of back and forth that's necessary for a successful long-term
healthy relationship you also want to be able to work
out problems if there's a problem between you between him
you want to be able to sit down talk that
stuff out well with a guy who doesn't give a
[ __ ] what anybody thinks about him does he
care about that do you think he's more likely to
sit down with you and listen to that kind of
stuff than the stereotypical nice guy that you have sex
with no right a lot of times these kind of
guys they just don't give a [ __ ] they
don't give a [ __ ] and as the woman
you end up finding yourself in a situation where you
really love this guy and you're trying to do everything
you can to make this relationship work but there's certain
things about what he's doing or either certain things you
may be wanting to kind of tweak and change when
you talk to him about something but you can't talk
to him because it's like talking to a [ __
] wall right it doesn't it just doesn't it doesn't
penetrate because that's that's the dead double edge that you're
dealing with here on the one hand it's very sexy
on the other hand you're dealing with a stubborn mule
the same goes with some these other characteristics being dominant
also really feeds into that being indifferent really the same
thing being edgy and brash these kinds of personality characteristics
they all tend to have this double edge to them
and it's nice in certain situations but it's bad in
other situations and over time inevitably these bad character traits
they start manifesting more and more and more and more
and really if you want to maintain a long-term healthy
relationships it takes work this is not something that you
just kind of get involved in and then you expect
it to go on and everything's beautiful takes lots and
lots and lots of work two people really have to
core choreograph and coordinate their movements long-term to make it
to make it work because honestly what's going to happen
is that the man will have flaws the woman will
also have flaws if you want to keep it together
you both need to be working on your flaws simultaneously
you both need to be cool with it you both
need to have good communication between the two of you
so that you're on the same wavelength you can make
that coordination happen and also you need to be growing
in your relationship at kind of a similar pace so
that one is not outgrowing the other and you're keeping
a certain balance in equilibrium there well that's really hard
to do with a guy who's extremely assertive dominant independent
edgy and brash and has options with tons of other
girls hard to do it so inevitably what happens is
that you really fall hard as the woman you fall
hard for this guy but then because what you really
want is you want that deep intimate relationship right it's
hard there's a couple of problems here one is that
its first of all hard to pin this guy down
it's hard to pin him down because a player has
so many options with other girls that frankly you need
to be a extremely high-caliber girl to lock this guy
down because he has to say in his mind well
you know what I can go out and if I
go out three nights a week I can get let's
say one real asleep with me and every every couple
of weeks I can get a really hot girl asleep
with me so I've got all the sexual abundance now
I can either choose to be with this one girl
with you or but then I have to give up
all my sexual abundance or I have to keep my
sexual abundance but then I'm not I'm not really exclusive
with you and I'm not doing the whole you know
lovey dovey really deep intimate relationship thing so for him
it's like which one do I want am I going
to give up all the sexual abundance just for you
if I am that means you got to be bring
a lot to the table that's how a guy thinks
now this might sound harsh this might sound dickish this
might sound very calculating but the fact is that both
men and women think this way and it's not even
something that happens consciously it's simply kind of like inner
wiring a woman evaluates a man also very very harshly
in terms of values it's just as the values are
different a man's values what he's a value and a
woman are also very harsh but different we're both screening
each other very rigorously but just in very different ways
and one of the problems I see people doing is
is saying well but women treat your woman's screen men
unfairly and then men will say you know women treat
screen men unfairly and women will say no men screen
women unfairly actually there's no fairness or unfairness here we're
both screening each other pretty rigorously so the point here
being is that it's going to be hard for you
to lock this guy down if he has a lot
of options with women which invariably he does because he's
got that personality that you got attracted to in the
first place but the second thing is that is going
to be hard to maintain that kind of equilibrium with
this person right it can be hard to do that
because his personality really is it suited for that you
would be much better off with that nice guy right
that carry nice guy who doesn't feel like an [
__ ] you could actually maintain a pretty good relationship
with him the problem though is that you're not attracted
to him you want him logically but in practice when
you meet a guy you're not attracted to that kind
of guy so this is what happens and there's another
even even additional aspect that makes this thing even worse
is that when you have an assertive dominant individual in
a relationship what will almost always tend to happen is
that person will start to abuse his power this is
not even something that he consciously does this is something
that has been proven through psychological studies there's some classical
studies that they did where literally what they do is
they will take prison inmates and they'll create this kind
of laboratory setting whether it put us to a prison
guard it will they'll put one person in the role
the prison guard and they'll put another person in the
role of the prisoner and what tends to happen is
that prison guard because he has so much authority and
control over the situation that just over time even if
the prison guard is a good person over time he
becomes more and more and more corrupt with that power
to the point where you start to get prisoner abuse
this is how prisoner abuse happens in various prisons because
the guards feel like they have so much power over
the prisoners they can literally do anything they want and
when nobody's watching them that power gets abused so this
happens with most human beings it's not really that it's
even the guy's fault so much it's just a tendency
for that to happen so the problem here is that
if you have a relationship I think where one person
is very very very dominant and assertive over another then
that person needs to be either needs to have extremely
good sense of value and morals in his life in
order to make that work out or what's going to
happen is he's going to become abusive he's going to
start to exploit this relationship it's just kind of like
human nature to do this and so this worsens the
situation even more because that means that if you had
one of those you know nice guys then he wouldn't
be assertive he wouldn't be dominant he wouldn't he wouldn't
try to abuse the power in the relationship but you've
got this [ __ ] guy this player guy and
he will do it even if he doesn't want to
it's a really freaky phenomenon because I've noticed it in
myself like I come from the from a place where
I'm extremely nice guy nice guy mode and I'm still
very nice guy I care about the girl a lot
more than I see my friends caring about their girls
but another thing that I noticed is that when I
am in a relationship where we're we have this like
a big gap between between me and the girl what
I notice is that if I feel like I have
more power over her if I feel like she's the
really needy one and I'm the indifferent one in the
relationship I feel like I start to get a little
bit corrupt the power has to corrupt me a little
bit because I know that I have so much influence
over this girl and I have to really like hold
myself back because it's very tempting right and I'm I'm
the kind of guy who in all fairness like is
a lot more conscious about this stuff than the average
guy so I'll never go into the frame where I'm
actually abusive that's never gonna happen with me but with
what kind of a lower caliber guy that will definitely
be a possibility that's why a lot of women will
will get into abusive relationships physically abusive verbally abusive you
know lots of anger emotional abuse like that kind of
stuff that's why that happens is because of this this
this this gap that exists and because this guy has
this kind of personality that just feeds into it even
more and more and he really kind of gets drunk
with that power so this is kind of the dynamic
that's going on and really in this situation logic logic
is useless because logically it doesn't make sense that you're
going to be with this guy but that's not why
you're with this guy in the first place you're with
them because of the emotions love that you're feeling the
attachment that's formed there especially if there's this codependency going
on where you're very needy and he's not needy at
all then it's going to even worse in the situation
even more so just by listening to this stuff if
you're in that kind of relationship right now or you've
experienced those dynamics as a woman then just hearing about
it probably it's not going to help you because what's
happening now is that you're still running on those emotions
of love and we can talk about this for hour
an hour an hour and you're still not going to
get it it's not going to actually allow you to
break it off in practice what I find is going
to work is the following you're going to be experiencing
more and more and more pain as this relationship continues
and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse
becomes more toxic it's going to pay you more and
more and more and more until what happens is that
that immense love that you have right now is going
to get overtaken by the pain and when that happens
there's going to be a shift and at that point
you'll be able to break it off with this guy
but until that happens you won't be able to break
it off and the sad thing is that it might
take a long time for this to happen it might
take months it might take years for this to happen
it might take a really really long time so if
you have a lot of this this chemical attachment and
right now your pain is down here you know it's
got to grow and grow and grow and grow and
grow a lot and one of the one of the
dangers here is that really your life as this pain
is growing you know time is passing the clock is
ticking and your life is going further and further down
the drain as this is happening especially if if you're
starting get into physical abuse and verbal abuse and like
really nasty kind of fights that kind of stuff so
I don't know what to tell you because I'm a
logical guy I'm telling you logical stuff all my videos
are logic I have some videos that are you know
trying to trigger you emotionally to get yourself taking action
but that's really what you need is you need an
emotional trigger because as a woman you're responsive to emotions
much more so than logic and while you might understand
all this and you might even agree with everything I'm
telling you that still won't be enough what's going to
have to happens that you have to get emotional leverage
on yourself once you get that emotional leverage perhaps you
can get the courage to break it off for good
with this guy and never go back so that then
you can move on to you know a better phase
a better relationship in your life and from this experience
maybe what you'll get what you're going to learn is
that you should be less focused on finding the most
dominant the most aggressive the most edgy the most indifferent
players kind of guy you know less of an [
__ ] and go more for the nicer type of
guy because even though upfront he now might be a
sexy this nice guy might not be a sexy as
the south of male guy this alpha male guy a
lot of times it's really really hard to keep him
in a relationship a lot of times he doesn't want
to be in a relationship a lot of times he
won't listen to you he won't coordinate with you and
it's just not going to get you to what you
ultimately want in your life maybe I mean every girl
is different so every girl has different objectives but I'm
kind of you know generalizing here so if you're fitting
into the general trend then this this advice will work
for you so that's that's basically what's going on here
another point that I'll make is that a lot of
women what I see them doing is they're backwards rationalizing
their love especially the beginning of the relationship there's a
backwards rationalization so you fall in love with the guy
and then what tends to happen is you get these
um you get these blind spots even your friends might
be telling you well but look at this guy like
he has a problem here he has a problem there
maybe he's you know you doing bad at his job
maybe he's broke maybe there's something else wrong with him
and you're not going to see that because the chemical
love that's there is just so great that it makes
you blind to all those things and in your mind
you tell yourself stuff like he's the perfect guy he's
exactly the one that I wanted he's so sexy he's
so so amazing you know he loves me so much
but there is definitely this kind of blinding effect that's
going on and you got to be careful about that
and it's tricky because women might assume that you know
the way to fix this problem is to screen the
guy really really hard on the front right don't have
sex with them immediately you might say you might say
well let's go on 10 dates and after 10 dates
we'll have sex I'll hold off for 10 days just
to get to know them better the problem is with
that is that if he's a really attractive guy he
knows how to bust through that you're not going to
be able to withhold for ten dates if he has
a lot of options of the girls he'll simply either
dump you by ten dates or he'll just get you
so aroused you'll have sex with him within a few
dates you're having to be able to wait for ten
days ten dates that's the nice guy the nice guy
waits for ten dates a player alpha-male doesn't wait for
ten dates he has sex on the first or second
date that's usually what happens and another even deeper point
is that even if you do wait for ten dates
you're not really going to get a sense of a
guy's true identity and personality until you have sex with
him you're not he's going to be acting fake you're
not really going to get to know him what you're
going to get to know you're going to get to
get to know his mask and you're going to get
to know a little bit about his life but generally
it's still going to be very hard for you to
to properly judge him as like them as a character
you're not going to really get a sense of his
true character just by going on ten dates with a
guy you're going to need to sleep with him not
even once you know you sleep with him five ten
times then you start to get more of his authentic
personality coming up more of his authentic behavior literally months
need to pass before you get a real true sense
of a guy it's hard to do it within even
ten days so these problems are out there making you
aware of them I don't have all the answers here
I just kind of see that these are some of
the some of the kind of like the land mines
that are out there for women I think that's a
lot of what what women tend to do is that
when they're very young in their early 20s up through
their mid-20s what they do is they hook up with
a lot of like really attractive kind of alpha male
type of guys because that's you know that's kind of
the easy thing and it seems like that's going to
what's going to work out and a lot of a
lot of girls will hook up with those types of
guys like the players right and they'll have a lot
of fun with them but they'll have a hard time
locking those guys down the relationships won't either won't happen
or they'll happen but they'll very be very turbulent and
unstable and then what happens is that as the as
the woman's biological clock is ticking more and more more
she's getting close to her 30s and then when she's
in her 30s the clock is shaking even faster maybe
she wants to have a family so at that point
her priorities shift from wait a minute I don't really
want the fun guy so much I want the Alpha
get the got alpha male guy so much what I
really want is I want someone a little more stable
that can really that can work with me in a
relationship and so at that point her filters I think
