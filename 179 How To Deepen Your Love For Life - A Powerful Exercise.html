</li><li><b>Exercise to deepen love for life</b>: Leo introduces a unique exercise where viewers need to list the top 10 things they love about life.

</li><li><b>Value of Deep Conversations</b>: Leo places high value on deep intellectual conversations, although he admits they feel scarce due to his antisocial nature. He would like to find more individuals with whom he can engage in such dialogues.

</li><li><b>Self-Evaluation Exercise</b>: Leo suggests that viewers honestly evaluate how much time they spend on the things they love about life. He encourages people to be truthful about the alignment between their careers, hobbies, relationships, and the items on their passion list.
</li><li><b>Misalignment between Career & Passions</b>: Leo states that most viewers will likely find that their current jobs don't align with items on their passion lists, which he asserts is a fundamental issue. He emphasizes the potential for greater long-term success when one's work aligns closely with their passions, despite potential short-term setbacks.
