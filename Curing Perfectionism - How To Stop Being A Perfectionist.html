hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about overcoming perfectionism how
to stop being so damn critical of people and life
one of the biggest realizations one of the biggest personal
development realizations that I've had this year occurred for me
when I was at a and enlightenment retreat and we
weren't really working on personal development we were working on
enlightenment stuff and meditation type stuff but just when you
do a lot of enlightenment work what tends to happen
is that a lot of emotional baggage and interesting revelatory
insights aha moments come up for you that are like
more psychological and therapeutic and what I discovered there is
I did I just got this very palpable sense of
how hypercritical I am and that really this is a
theme throughout my whole life it stretches back really far
to my teenage years and maybe even before that this
hypercritical Ness critical of everything I notice myself being critical
of people of physical objects of products that I buy
cars on the road of women physical appearance of both
men and women emotions critical of other people's emotions critical
of my own emotions critical of situations standing in line
somewhere in a traffic jam stuff like that so I
just got a real palpable sense of that and it
made me see like oh I'm a perfectionist that's of
course I'm a perfectionist and then also in addition to
that not just seeing that but also seeing all the
all the ways in which the tentacles of this issue
creep into every facet of my life I saw this
and this made me see like oh this needs to
really be turned around because I can go forward to
where I want to be in life if I don't
turn this around and it's hard because these are very
ingrained habits in us I noticed in myself that first
of all the problem is that it just makes me
miserable and saps happiness so directly it saps happiness because
when you're being critical you're not happy it's almost by
definition you're angry or you're frustrated or you're upset or
you're finding a fault with something so you can't be
happy at that point you're always unhappy it also wastes
mental energy I noticed myself wasting a lot of mental
energy throughout the day instead of thinking about the things
I need to be thinking about I'm thinking about all
this shallow petty crap these little nitpicks here and there
which in the end just distract me from what I
need to be doing I also noticed that this this
hinders my self-actualization and this for me is where I
had my big aha moment because I'm all about self-actualization
anything that hinders my self-actualization if I ever become conscious
of that then it's like oh wait okay I got
to put the brakes on this one here so that's
what I saw is I saw just how how much
is hindering my self-actualization because instead of focusing on things
that I need to be doing instilling the positive habits
that I need to instill in thinking the positive thoughts
I need to be thinking and creating the positive plans
the concrete practical plans for implementing my life purpose instead
of doing all that I can get sidetracked into criticism
so that was a my aha and of course you
know the classic problem with perfectionism and criticism is that
if you want everything to be perfect especially right off
the bat then you psych yourself out of a lot
of situations in life and a lot of projects that
you could be starting on you start to procrastinate on
those you don't even start them and definitely don't complete
them because you expect them to be perfect before they're
even begun and I've certainly suffered from that in the
past as well and I still suffer from that so
the problem with this particular aspect of perfectionism is that
it's really perfectionism is an anti mastery mindset if you
follow my work then you know how seriously I treat
mastery Master is a very important concept for me I
think it's one of the most important concepts of all
time for successful self-actualization work you need to learn what
mastery is you need to apply that process to your
career and basically to everything that you're trying to master
in your life mastery process mastery process it's all too
deep to go into here but basically it means that
you focus on the process mastering the process versus focusing
on results and of course this is exactly the opposite
of what a perfectionist does because a perfectionist always focuses
on the results and so this creates problems it really
hinders our success perfection is hindered their own success but
enough of that for now that's just my own little
personal you know quibbles and issues with the perfectionism let's
get into the meat of the topic here so what
actually is perfectionism I would define it as a neurotic
unwillingness to accept reality so if your perfectionist I am
making the claim that you are not willing to accept
reality now you might not agree with me on this
but stick with me because I'll give you some deeper
insights here about why this is and it is the
case this is the the root of perfectionism is really
this it's an unwillingness to accept what actually is true
what is the case what is the fact unwillingness to
accept it and maybe even to such a degree that
you're unwilling to accept that you're unwilling to accept reality
there's a there's an important book called the paradox of
choice by Barry Schwartz and in this book he makes
an interesting observation which is that in modern society we
have a lot more choice than we ever did in
Prior centuries and millennia that humans evolved and our brain
really isn't designed to cope with so much choice it's
an overabundance of choice and this choice seems like it's
a good thing you know have an over bun what's
wrong with that but uh but there is a problem
he talks about something called maximizers and satisficers these are
two types of people two ways of coping with overabundance
of choice the Maximizer is also the perfectionist in a
sense the Maximizer is the one let's say you want
to go buy a new vacuum cleaner now if you
go to the store you want to buy a new
vacuum cleaner there's probably 15 or 20 models different colors
different cord lengths different wattages different amounts of power different
accessories different boxes different packages different prices different values different
warranties so you've got all these options so how do
you choose the best one well the Maximizer he says
to himself okay I need the best vacuum cleaner in
the world what is that well it's not just a
matter of literally the best it also has the best
value so I need to I need to find the
sweet spot between not too expensive but enough accessories plus
the best warranty plus the best product design plus the
the best longest cord and all this stuff I need
to find the perfect sweet spot of all this so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to compare
15 different models going to do the research read all
the reviews and I'm going to go and I'm going
to shop different stores I'm going to compare I'm going
to do a couple weeks of research then I'm going
to buy my vacuum cleaner and he thinks that he's
going to become happy this way when he buys that
super awesome perfect vacuum cleaner now the satisficer what does
he do he walks in there he's like well there's
15 models I'll just narrow down to these three I
like this one here okay I'm going to spend five
minutes thinking about it I'm going to grab it and
let's just go I'm going to be happy with it
as long as it vacuums the floor and it doesn't
break I'm good that's the satisficer so you might think
well leo you know we don't wanna be satisficers we
want to be maximizers right isn't that what self-actualization is
all about it's about getting the most it's about mid
maxing the hell out of life not quite not quite
it might seem like being the Maximizer will get you
the maximum of everything including happiness but actually that's not
the case the Maximizer isn't really happy he's constantly disappointed
by life because his mind is like the perfectionist mind
it's always looking for perfect sometimes it finds perfect but
a lot of times it doesn't find perfect and when
it doesn't find perfect it's upset it's frustrated and it's
not happy and most of the time because you've been
developing this habit of being hypercritical of everything all the
time you're not happy anymore you can't be happy because
you can find fault with almost everything you might buy
that perfect vacuum cleaner you come home and then next
week you're browsing online and you see a new ad
for a new vacuum cleaner you're like oh this is
better than the one I bought and it's too late
to return this one man right and so you're unsatisfied
you're unhappy whereas the satisficer he sees that he's like
oh yeah well maybe it's a little better who cares
I already got my vacuum cleaner it works the satisficer
is actually the one that's happy because happiness is about
acceptance you need acceptance and you're not going to get
very far in your self-actualization work if you don't cultivate
this ability of acceptance it's a bit of an uphill
battle for me to convince you of this because I
know that a couple years back if you sort of
talking to me about acceptance I would be like acceptance
what are you talking about Lea this is like some
hippy woo I don't want acceptance you know I'm a
hard-nosed guy on results I want real tangible things on
I'm oriented towards making money my business and I want
results in my relationship and all this stuff well yeah
the thing you got to realize is that you will
never never ever become happy this way life never ever
it's not going to work so I don't know what
you need to do to realize that maybe am I
talking about it here we'll help help you to see
this maybe get a couple things to click in your
mind um you know for me it was that retreat
that I took and I was sitting there instead of
doing a lot of self self inquiry and introspection and
you know this popped out and I saw that all
I'm never going to be happy this way I really
have this problem with being hypercritical right it's not going
to work it's like I'm trying to stick a square
peg into a round hole it's just not going to
work so you need to start to come to that
kind of realization by the way if you're not sure
if you are or are not a perfectionist what I'll
have for you at the at the end of this
video is I'll have a perfectionist quiz so I'm going
to point you to a link where you can go
and you can download a little perfectionist quiz that I
created just one simple worksheet with a couple of questions
like ten questions on it and you can see just
how much of a problem this is in your life
might surprise you because maybe you're not quite sure of
just how deep your perfectionism runs but more on that
later let's get back into the meat of this so
here's something that was a real epiphany for me at
my retreat about perfectionism is that perfectionism this is a
key inside right here perfectionism is a sneaky form of
procrastination extremely sneaky extremely self deceptive form of procrastination most
forms of procrastination are pretty obvious we got to go
start work on our dream project but instead we're going
to go clean the house or trim our toenails or
you know something like that we procrastinate by doing like
haha entertaining stuff like looking at gossip or tabloids or
browsing online this kind of said okay that's obvious procrastination
I talked about that in other places other videos but
here this one this one's real bad because when you're
hyper critical that energy and time that you're using to
be hyper critical is time that you should be spending
on yourself doing the thing you got to be doing
in your life following your life purpose or whatever other
ambitions you might have right and so what I saw
my epiphany was that oh not only am i hyper
critical and that robs me of happiness but I'm actually
using this as a form of procrastination on my life
purpose oh now this stakes are even higher than I
thought initially and what I realize is that I'm actually
using criticism in a very subtle way to avoid taking
responsibility for all the places in my life where I
need to be kicking ass and you know it's not
like I'm saying here that I'm kind as deadbeats like
I'm I'm pretty productive I work a lot I work
pretty hard and I don't call myself a procrastinator really
but like I'm saying this is a subtle thing this
is a subtle form of procrastination and I'm seeing how
it holds me back it's robbing me of my dreams
in a nutshell that's what's going on here now one
objection you might have is you might say something like
well leo but what if I stop being a perfectionist
I mean is that kind of what you're advocating here
I stop being a perfectionist but then if I do
that won't my work suffer I mean I've been using
my perfectionism to kick ass in business and to get
my hot girlfriend or to find the perfect husband you
know I've been using my perfectionism for all this kind
of stuff I want perfect kids and I want perfect
this and perfect that and I I got my perfect
car and I setup my perfect house so it's been
going good for me right here's the problem with that
is that there's a lie there's a big fat lie
lurking in there when you tell yourself this the lie
you tell yourself is that you tell yourself basically that
perfectionism is excellence you equate perfectionism with excellence right that's
where this objections coming from but that's not what it
really is that's not what perfectionism is for and there's
a difference between these two you also have to recognize
that what got you here won't necessarily get you to
where you altima to go if you've been driven your
whole life by perfectionism and this neurotic thirsting for making
everything perfect and for nitpicking everything and being critical with
your employees and critical with your children and critical with
everything and critical of course with yourself we're gonna get
to that in a minute if you've been living that
way and that's been your sole source of motivation you're
probably gonna want to cling to that your we'll defend
that say well Leo this is where my motivation comes
from but you know what that's a neurotic form of
motivation and so what will become necessary if you want
to go somewhere further in your life I mean yeah
it might have gotten you where you are now but
where you are now is not where you can ultimately
be I guarantee you that you're not even at ten
percent of where you could ultimately be if you really
take on this effort of self-actualization so that means you've
got 90 percent left more growth right more potential to
tap into and if you don't want to tap into
that potential you're gonna have to change how you're motivated
what motivates you I think this is one of the
biggest things that holds back successful people already successful people
you know a lot of successful people who have earned
six figures I've coached these types of people one-on-one and
what I discover is that they have negative or flawed
forms of motivation neurotic motivation and that's just not going
to allow them to reach their full potential and changing
that motivations a little scary because it might mean like
oh I'm going to suffer a temporary setback and then
you know an achievement oriented ambitious person doesn't want to
suffer a setback so it's a little bit of a
difficult issue but you also start to see that you
know after a few years maybe a decade of this
kind of perfectionistic motivation you sure to see that there
really are consequence they really just sabotage itself it holds
itself back art is not done for the sake of
perfectionism art is done for the sake of joy the
joy of creating the thing that you're calling your art
and if you're an ambitious person and you have a
life purpose then you're an artist I hope you think
of yourself as an artist even if you're doing business
and nothing traditionally artsy you're still an artist in my
book I consider myself an artist art is about putting
passion into your work taking your work personally right being
highly creative in your work and that's the kind of
work that really matters that's the kind of work that's
really fulfilling so if you are an artist recognize that
an artist is not create getting something because he's neurotic
and he I mean some of them are neurotic but
but because he's neurotic and he he needs to create
this perfect painting or this perfect sculpture or this perfect
piece of architecture no the artist gets joy and delight
in the process of making art you see if there's
a difference there think about how much more enjoyable your
life would be and also more productive if you actually
truly got joy out of the entire process even the
mistakes even the imperfect stuff hmm maybe you would accomplish
more not less but that might require you some work
you know to make that transition what needs to happen
if you want to be a really powerful artist you
need to focus your mind on mastery focus your mind
on the process enjoying the full process not thinking about
outcome the perfectionist is too attached to outcome he undermines
himself the mastery process gets corrupted when you do it
that way it gets corrupted and then you don't get
your result one time then you get all pissy and
and you want to get depressed and you want to
quit and right that's what happens when you don't get
that result that outcome that you want immediately that's not
what the master does the master is in it for
the long haul the master is in it because he
enjoys the work the true artist loves the art form
a masterful writer loves to write a masterful pager loves
to paint a masterful sculptor likes to sculpt not because
he needs to have the perfect painting made or the
perfect sculpture to WoW the whole world that's not why
he actually likes the process he enjoys the medium so
start shifting towards the mastery perspective very important let's go
on to another really key insight this one's also huge
this is one that I had while I was sitting
there thinking all this stuff at my my retreat and
it's the that criticizing others and criticizing oneself is two
sides of the same coin they're really equal they're identical
so I can guarantee you this if you're hyper critical
of people physical objects and situations in the external world
you're hyper critical also of yourself and of course that's
exactly how it is with me because I'm critical of
everything out there I also hold myself to that same
step standard and so I'm hyper critical that myself and
so here's another facet of this whole problem is that
not only do you kind of hate the world as
a perfectionist but more importantly you hate yourself deep down
you hate yourself and you probably set very high standards
for yourself and maybe you've achieved many of those standards
and you feel like you're doing pretty good but also
I would submit to you that deep down like in
the cracks and shadows of your subconscious mind you actually
hate yourself and you're very hard on yourself you're very
harsh on yourself youself flagellate and you have a secret
guilt about all the stuff that you didn't do right
because you nitpick everything you nitpick everyone and then you
nitpick yourself because once you establish a standard that's standard
you know your mind will hold you to that same
standard - so that's a key insight to realize big
insight when you start to see this again it's like
oh yeah uh I can't let let this perfectionism stand
because if I let this perfectionism stand this is how
I'm going to die my life my I'm gonna die
this way my life is going to end this way
it's just going to be an you know 40 years
until I die let's say but uh throughout those 40
years I'm just going to become more and more and
more self-critical and then at the very end of my
life what's going to happen is that I'm gonna look
back in my life and I'm gonna nitpick the out
of it and I'm gonna tell myself up I wasn't
perfect I hate I hate my life I regret my
life my wife wasn't perfect my kids weren't perfect my
job wasn't perfect my health wasn't perfect and now my
death is perfect that's what's going to happen to you
so unless you want to face that fate then I
think it's time to talk about a solution so what
is the solution to this well I think a really
big important component of it is just simply the realization
of how much damage you're causing to yourself how much
you're holding yourself back it's like that old analogy of
the high-performance sports car which is going 100 miles an
hour but the parking brake is on right how much
better could it do if the parking brake was off
and a lot of times that's how we justify some
of our neurotic behaviors and we keep them in place
as we say well but Leo you know I'm successful
on it I'm ambitious I mean I'm a perfectionist but
I've been doing good for myself yes perhaps you have
but I'm talking about the next level for you imagine
the next level what if we took the parking brake
off imagine how well you would do then hmm can
you believe that there is the next level for you
even very successful people have habits and behaviors especially internal
mindset things that that are like parking brakes that have
been on the whole time in their life and they've
succeeded despite it but man they could go much further
so part one of the solutions just realizing maybe watch
this video a couple of times really listen to and
really think about it start to notice take the quiz
that I'm going to give you at the end you
know really start to take a look at how you're
robbing yourself of of happiness and material achievements second step
is start to notice how critical you actually are this
is going to be i opening for you to because
right now maybe you have some idea in your mind
of like yeah you know leah i know how critical
i am you know i do criticize a lot of
things throughout the day okay that's good but when you
actually take a close look let's say starting tomorrow you
start taking a real close look at how much criticism
you do in your life on a daily basis you're
going to notice like oh it's a it's ten times
worse than I thought it was this problem is ten
times they guy I've only seen the tip of the
iceberg here the rest of the iceberg is is still
yet to be discovered down below the water so that's
going to be step two so that's going to take
your realization it's going to even blow it up even
further it's gonna be like holy this is a real
problem good that's going to motivate you to change right
the third step is to start to retrain yourself you
need to retrain your mental filter that's the problem you
have a mental filter right now in your mind like
this lens that you're looking throughout the world and this
lens is telling you find perfect nitpick everything you know
when I'm driving down the road I'll nitpick even stupid
stuff like a car that I don't like some design
of a car like oh that's an ugly Chevy that's
like ugly for like who designed this car who would
buy this car and I start going down this world
like why would they design it this way why didn't
they just like tweak the bumper this way and why
didn't they change the headlights this way right that's what
I'm talking about here this the subtle criticism and you
do this with everything I mean you do with people
you do this with physical appearance of stuff you do
this with physical objects you might buy something and you
might be critical about it you might do this with
the meal that you order you might go buy a
cheeseburger then you look at it and you're eating in
its pretty good cheeseburger but then you nitpick something's like
oh they forgot the pickles or something you know the
fries they gave me five less french fries and they
should have that kind of stuff yeah so start to
notice that and then retrain yourself retrain yourself to let
go and accept you got to accept these things life
is not about min maxing everything this is not an
RPG game life is about enjoying it accepting it being
cool with it even when it's not perfect see the
thing is the original point that I talked about is
that you do not want to accept reality that's the
fundamental neurosis that you have you don't like reality as
it is you have your fantasies about reality and then
you insist that that's how it has to be it
has to be like my fan see but the fact
is that it life is not like a fantasy life
is life it is exactly what it is so if
you got five less french fries than you deserved that's
what happened that's the truth that's reality can you be
man enough to accept it you have the balls to
accept it it takes courage to accept these things takes
courage and at first it's gonna be like a a
drug addict coming off of in diction it's gonna be
no I'm gonna criticize I wanna criticize and then you
gotta retrain your mind to just say okay let me
just let go of those french fries I don't need
those five French fries probably better for me in the
long run you know it's better that I didn't eat
those five french fries helps my health um but then
your minds can be like no I need those french
fries first let me go complain about the five french
fries that they didn't give me good practice acceptance yeah
it's kind of a hippie concept acceptance for perfectionist that's
a very foreign concept form concept for me it's hard
meditations a real good habit you know if you really
want to practice this practice meditation practice enlightenment work those
are some great tips but I'll give you even a
more concrete exercise that you're going to do here you
can do those things but at the very minimum do
this you're going to get a rubber band for your
wrist such as this right here see this rubber band
you're going to put around your wrist and you're going
to wear it for one month every single day you're
basically not going to take it off you're going to
shower with it you're going to sleep with it you're
going to eat with it keep this thing on for
a whole month and you're basically going to do a
one month 30-day challenge of no criticism this is my
no criticism challenge so I'm actually in the middle of
my challenge right now I've been doing it for about
a week it's been working quite well so what I
do is I just notice throughout the day whether I'm
being critical and any time that I see that I
am being critical and I hear my inner voice being
critical in any kind of fashion small or big what
I do is I snap this sucker and tell yourself
the following it's like a little mantra that I have
my mantra is this when I criticize I rob myself
of my future because that's literally what you're doing when
you're criticizing no matter for what little reason that's energy
that you're wasting and you're not taking responsibility for doing
the things you got to do to advance your life
criticism does not advance your life right so that's going
to be your assignment you're going to go and do
that get yourself a nice rubber band get a rubber
band that actually isn't too tight on your wrist so
you can wear it all day long that's important if
you get a really tight rubber band it's going to
cut off circulation to your hand and you're gonna take
it off pretty quick all right and just keep going
with it keep going with it week after week after
week this is what is the retraining right the reason
this exercise is so important is because this is where
the rubber meets throughout this is where you actually retrain
your your mind you change that lens through which you
see the world and instead practice acceptance just accept what
is accept life see the beauty of life be grateful
for life you know practice any of those right there
and what do you think about instead of critical stuff
you think about what are my dreams what are my
goals what's my life purpose how can I take more
action towards it where could I you know where could
I get more creative ideas who could I talk to
who's gonna advance my my career and so on and
so forth spend more time with the kids spend more
time with your intimate relationship whatever spend more time with
friends that kind of stuff and then lastly go and
check out the perfectionist quiz I'm going to have a
link to it down below it's gonna have some questions

of a problem this might be for you all right

stuff right that's not easy to do most people are
too lazy to do that I'm not here giving you
magic pills what I want to convince you of is
that there's enough reward here to do this work in
fact there's so much reward in doing self-actualization work that
the initial investment you're going to do of having to
spend time watching this stuff and doing some of these
exercises and going through some of the emotional labor involved
that's going to be all paid off tenfold a hundredfold
if you just keep going with it you're gonna start
getting exponential results as you keep going right but at
first it's kind of slow going your first year is
going to be little slow going you can still get
some results but you're going to fall off track most
likely so really the mission of actualize that organ is
to keep you on track for a long time to
come how do you stay on track with this stuff
with self-actualization work for years and for decades imagine the
potential that that would have for you and it doesn't
take that much a couple hours a week that's all
you need to start with right it'll start to build
its own momentum so if you think that's a good
idea then stay with me I'm self actualizing I'm excited
to share my deepest insights with you as I'm on
my journey and I hope that you get on board
with your journey alright sign up stay tuned and I'll
see you soon you
