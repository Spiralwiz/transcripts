hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
we're going to talk about the secret alright let's talk
about the secret so buy the secret I'm talking about
the movie the secret so this is a personal velvet
movie really the secret is if we just give away
the punchline it's the law of attraction the law of
attraction is the secret and you can find this movie
floating around on the internet somewhere so it's been really
popular in the last 5 or 10 years and I
think it's been popular because it's somewhat controversial and I
already have a video up there that's pretty popular about
Law of Attraction where I talk about what Law of
Attraction is and I kind of bring it down back
to earth but I actually want to make some comments
about the secret self because some people will watch that
movie and will walk away misled or confused or with
some sort of questions and I wanted to address some
of those especially because I've studied so much personal element
stuff and I've worked a lot with Law of Attraction
in the last year is that you know I have
some I have some ideas about where the secret is
is misleading you so let's talk about that I actually
to prepare for this for this video most videos I
just shoot on the fly but this one actually sat
down and rewash the secret I watched I hadn't watched
it for maybe 2 or 3 years so I kind
of remembered it but I wanted to sit down and
watch it and like break it down point by point
so that I was going exactly based off what they
were saying and not misinterpreting what was being said in
in the actual like language of the movie so a
couple of first of all when I watched that movie
you know I wanted to come in there and actually
when I sat down to watch it it was interesting
because I said to myself well the secret I kind
of had a bit of a negative negative feeling about
the secret and I wanted to basically start criticizing it
right I started to watch the movie and try to
pick it apart point by point and like saying well
this is wrong here this is wrong here that's not
quite right this is misleading and while I did do
that eventually by the time I got to the end
of the movie the message of the movie the overall
message of it was was actually so powerful that I
couldn't I couldn't even criticize it to myself I had
to say well that's true like the the overall gist
of the movie is completely true and this is what
people need to know and well I think that is
true I think Law of Attraction in and of itself
is an amazing very powerful tool to advance your life
to advance your career to advance your relationships to advance
your personal development I think the way in which the
secret gave it to you is not the best way
in which to apply it all right so I actually
I literally literally watered up my eyes watered up with
tears as I was watching some of the scenes in
the secret because I connected them with how I use
the law of attraction in my own life and I
saw like damn that's really powerful it does really it
can't like it can actually work like that but I
think also some of the metaphysics behind the secret and
some of them kind of the marketing that's layered on
top of the concept of Law of Attraction that comes
with a secret that marketing is a it's you know
it's a little bit kind of geared towards the mainstream
and it can be definitely misleading because I know that
I watch the secret like three years ago and after
watching the secret I mean it can make you feel
good it can inspire you but it doesn't actually really
give you the techniques and the how-to of how to
apply it it tends to be kind of like a
motivational inspirational thing but then from that I see that
most people fall through on it and actually don't start
to use law of attraction their life and to me
I'm much more concerned about how do you actually apply
a law of attraction rather than some of the kind
of airy-fairy stuff that goes around with it and just
getting you kind of pumped up for a few hours
after watching a video although that can be nice too
so I think ultimately I have nothing really bad to
say about the secret but I will criticize it on
a couple of technical points so let's get into that
so these are some of the things that I saw
in the secret that I perceive as being misleading at
least they can be unless you're very very educated about
how this works and you've worked with law of attraction
before if you're totally new to law of attraction you
just watch it then I think you'll get misled by
the following points so let's break into that point number
one is that there's a suggestion it's not explicitly stated
but there's this suggestion implication that there are paranormal paranormal
forces at work that meant that make the secret manifest
that make the secret work right but somehow there are
like thought waves blasting through through the universe and like
when you think a thought that somehow a wave comes
out of your head and it hits some object and
that object gets attracted to you magnetically that's not how
law of attraction works at all at all so to
take away that from the secret would be to be
greatly misled so the law of attraction which actually let
me state that for for those of you who aren't
very familiar with it law of attraction simply states that
whatever you think about you will get more of in
your life and whatever you whether that's negative or positive
so if you're thinking about something positive all the time
you're going to tend to get those positive things if
you're think about negative things all the time you're going
to tend to attract those negative things not repel them
so when you're worrying when you're constantly worrying about all
the problems in your life actually what you're doing is
you're attracting more of those problems and you're you're keeping
them in your life and that the solution to that
is to start start visualizing you start thinking about all
the stuff that you want to create so I think
that that message that's a very powerful message it's very
true and this can totally transform your life if you
start to live and act and alignment with it but
this is not going to happen by some sort of
paranormal psychic force this is going to happen by very
ordinary plane mechanical laws so there's nothing really sexy to
law of attraction right it's not some blue forces come
out your head and pulling something towards you it's just
a mechanical law think about it like this to explain
this properly you know think about how does anything get
accomplished in your life really think about this how does
anything come into your life well you've got this body
that's all you've really got to control right you've got
this mind that's controlling this body and literally your your
your mind is like kind of like a puppet master
that's controlling this this body right here right so like
you can move your arm up arm down hands feet
like move your body twist around look in different places
so realistically that's that's the only way that you interact
with the world is mechanically through your body and that's
the only way that you've interacted with the world and
so that's enough you don't need any psychic forces or
any special quantum energy or anything like that none of
that all you need is you need your hands and
your feet literally if you're if you're going to visualize
a million dollars for yourself and you want to go
out there and get that million dollars I mean fine
that will totally work but realize that you are the
one that's coming out there and getting it ultimately it's
just going to be a long process right to get
a million dollars realistically that's like start a business maybe
climb the corporate ladder invest in something manage your money
well like have multiple jobs or like create multiple projects
so that's how you create a million dollars and when
you visualize a million dollars then that will lead you
towards a million dollars by taking all those actions but
what's happening there I mean literally like it's your fingers
right your fingers are typing on the keyboard to create
that that business plan right it's your your eyes are
looking around in the world and like looking for for
people to talk to about it your mouth is moving
literally words and sound waves are coming out and affecting
other people which will then pay you the money ultimately
that you're looking for your feet will actually walk you
into into the office building where you're going to receive
your check right so this is how it's happening mechanically
mechanical ordinary physical Newtonian laws there's nothing crazy going on
here nope paranormal forces at least nothing that's been scientifically
proven so there's that part the next point is that
there's this implication right off the bat with the secret
just even by the title but right in the beginning
in the intro is that they really suggest that the
secret has been hidden from people form ordinary people for
a long time and somehow millionaires and billionaires and like
there's a sulli class of people in the world that
somehow know the secret and they've been holding it back
from the little guy right they were trying to press
the little guy it's like this struggle between like the
bigwigs and a little guy and the masses you know
they don't have this knowledge of the secret that's that's
total nonsense right no one's been holding back the secret
from you in fact it's been it's been publicly available
for in books and through various religions for for hundreds
if not you know basically thousands of years so it's
all out there the trick is is not that somebody
is withholding information from you it's that really you're withholding
from yourself it's that really that you're not believing in
the power of visualization you're not believing in the power
of what positive thinking can get you right you're not
buying into the fact that this worrying that you're doing
all the time that's actually attracting more of the bad
stuff in your life you're not buying into that right
if you really it takes time to really kind of
get your mind to start thinking along the lines of
the secret it did for me and I study this
stuff incessantly so I can only guess how it would
affect someone who hears it for the first time it
takes a while to kind of get introduced to this
idea to accept it and most people you know their
egos won't let them accept it or there's such a
victim in life that they don't want to accept the
fact that actually they are responsible for a lot of
the problems they're creating right it's easier to blame other
people and in fact the secret kind of perpetuates that
because it's blaming some like the bigwigs for holding back
a secret which in fact no one's been holding it
back for me so let's get that out of the
way the next point is quantum physics so there are
a couple of quantum physicists on the secret talking about
stuff and there's this whole theory of quantum mind and
some of the stuff that's been going on in quantum
mechanics which is actually now a pretty old field it's
basically over a hundred years old but but there's there's
these notions that well the secret has been well proven
scientifically the law of attraction has been proven scientifically by
quantum physics in some way this is complete nonsense it's
not been proven at all in fact there have been
there's been a lot of kind of speculation about whether
quantum effects are going on in the mind and really
the leading consensus from scientists is that there are no
quantum effects going on in the mind that in fact
this is a this is kind of a philosophical mistreatment
of the notion of quantum mechanics I mean we're talking
about very different scales here right your mind operates on
the scale of cells and you've got neurons and those
are very very large big objects compared to what quantum
mechanics talks about quantum mechanics talks about not even atoms
but like subatomic particles within the atoms like quarks and
stuff so the leading consensus is that your brain literally
cannot like it doesn't function because of quantum effects I
mean it's made up of quanta everything in the world
is made up of monta just like everything in the
world is made up of atoms but that doesn't really
mean anything that doesn't mean that literally you're using like
the quantum properties of those or atomic properties to to
solve the problem in your life right I'm thinking right
now and I'm talking but I'm not using quantum effects
to do it in the same way that I'm not
using nuclear I'm not using nuclear forces in my mind
to do it even though my mind is held together
literally by nuclear forces I mean what are nuclear forces
those are forces between atoms so yes my mind is
composed of atoms which are held together by nuclear forces
but to say that I'm using nuclear forces right now
to speak to you is kinda silly it's really a
it's kind of a pop cultural kind of bro science
ii type of idea so there's really no hard evidence
for quantum effects in the brain in fact from all
the research that i've kind of read on this stuff
they say that the brain the temperature of the brain
which is like what almost 100 degrees right a hundred
degrees temperature in the brain that at that temperature any
kind of residual quantum effects that could have been going
on are totally negligible because the chaos and the temperature
of the brain will will basically nullify any of those
quantum effects i mean this is still kind of groundbreaking
research but ultimately to say that it's been proven scientifically
is nonsense so there's no quantum connection here and you
don't need a quantum connection the fact that you even
try to find a quantum connection is silly why do
you need one mechanical laws just like i said your
hands and arms moving and your feet moving in your
mouth talking and your eyes blinking that's all you really
need mechanical laws you don't need to go and get
all crazy on it i think that there's a tendency
to want to go into quantum mechanics and quantum physics
because it sounds like it sounds very official right it
sounds like oh well a quantum physicist said it so
it must be real it must be true and you
know there's no need to do that quantum physicist doesn't
need to tell you that if you think about the
things that you want you'll get those you'll tend to
get those things and if you think about bad things
you'll tend to get those things - I mean this
is happen temeka niché's that's that's kind of on the
level of psychology so a psychologist is a better person
to ask about that that a quantum physicist the next
point that I will criticize the secret on is focus
on material things and I understand why they do this
I mean I do this in my videos too sometimes
and I'll you know if I'm talking about something I
want to bring up an example I'll say money business
career relationship or whatever and or your like your physical
appearance losing some weight those are easy examples to use
people can relate to them very easily but ultimately the
secret is very focused about using law of attraction and
it's talking about how you can use law of attraction
to manifest a car to manifest you know a vacation
house to manifest a like a trip to Hawaii to
manifest a bicycle to like to manifest something tangible in
your life and this is actually the worst way to
use law of attraction that's not how I'll use Law
of Attraction at all you don't want to be really
attracting physical things to you you know it's easy to
talk about those things but ultimately I use law of
attraction every single day and I use it to work
on myself what I want to attract to myself is
I want to track more confidence I want to attract
more discipline harder work ethic being more charismatic I want
to attract more energy to go to the gym and
to workout to do all the work that I have
to do right I want to attract I want to
attract better better reading skills I want to track better
speaking skills I want to attract basically inner things things
inside you intangibles that's so much more powerful than attracting
tangibles because if you attract the intangibles and you work
on that like a like I'm saying you know you
once you learn to control your mind your own psychology
then everything else will come to you you don't need
to to dream for a million dollars dream for yourself
to become someone who thinks like a millionaire and you'll
get millions of dollars so I go kind of more
direct I go to to me the cause of it
the agent plus what's going to be nice about that
is that once I build up the skills and those
skills will will spill over to other areas of my
life so if I'm if I'm trying to attract more
energy more like physical energy to me that's not only
you know help me at the gym and get me
a nicer body but it's also going to help me
in my relationship it's going to help me have great
sex and it's going to help me work harder my
business so it'll affect all those things so a little
bit too much focus on material things I would say
in the secret the next point I'm going to make
is even that they really they have this quote that
says that the universe will rearrange itself for you that
the universe will rearrange itself for you based on your
thoughts this is also I feel misleading that's not going
to happen right I don't care how long you sit
there and how much you think about having a million
dollars the universe is not going to rearrange itself for
you for that what's going to happen is that if
you just sit and think about that stuff then it
won't happen but if you then go out and follow
up and take action then it will it potentially could
happen so the action taking component is important and to
somehow say that like well it's out of my hands
I just visualize it so it's out of my hands
now the million dollar style is going to magically luckily
show up because I've been thinking about it that's that's
a really a bastardization of how law of attraction works
I mean something could come your way but that's not
how you want to live your life is like this
this kind of wishful thinking prayer type of mentality don't
pray for things pray for yourself to be better to
acquire those things you're going to acquire everything yourself it's
not going to magically come to you from the universe
and nothing's going to rearrange itself for you to your
liking that's nonsense so the next point is yeah there's
there's this there's this scene very vividly they show a
boy who like wants to buy a new bicycle and
he keeps thinking about this bicycle and drawing pictures about
and stuff and then he doesn't get it but then
one day he walks out and he realizes and he
sees that his like his grandfather bought it for him
and there it is sitting in the front lawn this
bicycle so a scene like that I mean it's also
misleading because the problem there is that it's it's it's
kind of pushing you toward this idea that you should
kind of expect things to just like magically appear for
you right that idea of like synchronicity like you think
about something and then all this in that person shows
up you think about a new car and like BAM
all sudden it's there again it's that kind of like
magical wishful thinking prayer type of mentality that I don't
like to encourage and go out there and like work
for that bicycle right visualize the bicycle nothing wrong with
that want the bicycle don't worry why you don't have
a bicycle but the way you're gonna get that bicycle
is by moving or your hands on your feet and
ultimately going out there and buying it and the way
you're going to buy it is by earning the money
so we can earn the money is by going to
a job etc right so there's going to be a
very kind of non mystical explanation for how the bicycle
actually landed at your doorstep so I hope you buy
luck and the last point I would say is that
they say that the process should be easy and effortless
and you should always be feeling very good right and
as soon as you're not feeling good then you're not
in alignment with what you're going after and like let's
say you want a million dollars you should be feeling
good about that million dollars and if for some reason
it's feeling effortless or difficult I mean if it's feeling
effortful and difficult then you're not doing it right right
and you have to kind of like force your mood
etc so the point here is that if you're really
even if you're of like a very grounded person right
and you're very solid executor in life you're very like
hard working and you know that you're like totally on
on your life's purpose and you're do something that's very
important for you in the world so this is very
meaningful to you if you're doing that you're still going
to face a lot of hardship a lot of struggle
it's not going to be easy and it's not going
to be effortless to set that kind of expectation is
actually to create failure so yes you shouldn't be you
know you should resonate with the goal that you want
you should actually want the million dollars it shouldn't be
just some sort of a goal that you're kind of
lukewarm about you should actually want it I kind of
imagine it get a get yourself emotionally involved with that
goal but also realize that it's going to take work
to get there right work not effortless sometimes it'll be
effortless sometimes it will feel nice and be easy because
you're on track with your life purpose and your goals
that feels nice but a lot of times it's going
to be mundane brute-force work and that's the point I'm
going to end on is that I really was thinking
about you know well is there a real secret is
there a real secret to personal development is there a
real secret to life and I think that if I
was to say what my secret is you know after
studying hundreds of thousands of dollars of personal development irreal
hundreds of books all this stuff and trying a lot
of stuff out myself and all my clients I would
say the real secret is discipline discipline your mind that's
the real secret to success and happiness in life is
a disciplined mind and this this idea is not new
this idea goes back to you know the ancient mystics
this idea goes back to Buddha said you goes back
to people like Lao Tzu and ancient Hindu texts and
you know ancient Roman and Greek philosophy ultimately you know
the ancients had it right is that you need to
discipline your mind you need to master your mind you
need to understand your psychology not just logically but also
then practically you need to live that and when you
do the rest of it will kind of take care
of itself right and the fact is that you can't
even do law of attraction properly the techniques of it
I actually have a lot of techniques that I use
and I didn't get to cover them here because just
too much I cover them in other videos but ultimately
you need incredible discipline to actually use law of attraction
and this is the thing that the secret misleads us
on the most is that they kind of have us
think that well just something else um wishful thinking some
visualizations but then they don't and then they say it's
going to be easy and effortless but actually to properly
apply Law of Attraction takes incredible discipline incredible control of
your mind like ridiculous discipline and when I do law
of attraction I do it religiously like a religious zealot
and I'm not a religious person but I do this
religiously every single morning I do my law of attraction
work for half an hour I do it very religiously
because I know of how powerful it is and that
it is one of the most powerful tools to get
what you want in your life but it's not easy
and it's not effortless no way if it was easy
and effortless everyone would have what they want so it's
going to be hard and tough and there are things
that you still don't know about how to really use
Law of Attraction and for that you'll have to just
