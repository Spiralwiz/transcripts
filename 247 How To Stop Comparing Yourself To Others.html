            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/WWs6GBwXnmw' target='_blank'>How To Stop Comparing Yourself To Others</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Problem of Comparing Ourselves to Others</b>: Leo Gura discusses how it is built into our DNA, given our ancestry and biological drives, to care about status and our position in society. We, like our primate cousins, need to know where we stand. There are many reasons for these comparisons, from a fear of being labeled as anything other than 'normal', to a desire to gain power and competitiveness, to having a sense of security in our social standing, among others. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Self-Worth</b>: Leo Gura suggests that most people get a sense of value or self-worth only by comparing themselves to others in the social matrix. The society we live in assigns different values to us based on parameters like wealth, positions, and achievements. Leo discourages the idea that external objects or achievements can give us value or make us a better person. 
</li><li><b>Unrealistic Comparisons</b>: Humans are complex beings. We all have unique histories, genetics, personalities, priorities, and environments. Comparing oneself to another based on a single aspect of life is unrealistic and misleading because we can never see the full picture of their circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Comparisons and Competition</b>: Leo argues that comparisons create unnecessary competition and are a waste of time and energy that we could spend on self-actualization or personal development. He asserts that there will always be someone better and reaching the top position does not lead to lasting fulfillment. He advises focusing on improving oneself, rather than trying to outdo others. 
</li><li><b>Accepting Ourselves</b>: Leo emphasizes how embracing our uniqueness and working towards self-actualization leads to a satisfying life. The process of becoming and accepting our authentic selves requires time and effort. This involves accepting our various strengths and weaknesses, and viewing them as unique traits rather than defaults. 
</li><li><b>Focus on Personal Growth and Development</b>: Rather than comparing ourselves to others and envying what they have, Leo suggests focusing on self-improvement and creating a better future. He proposes shifting our mindset from scarcity to abundance, and instead of feeling envious of others' success, using it as inspiration for our own personal growth and aspirations. 
</li><li><b>Vision for Your Life</b>: Leo discusses the importance of creating personalized visions for our lives by assimilating the qualities or things others have that we desire. He promotes converting envy into love and passion for our own growth, and overcoming the scarcity mindset by realizing the abundance of resources and opportunities in life. 
</li><li><b>Developing Skills</b>: Confidence, intelligence, and other abilities are not innate but can be developed over time. Comparisons can be useful if used to inspire growth and not to breed envy or competition. 
</li><li><b>Commitment to Mastery</b>: Leo encourages viewers to stop making comparisons and start to master their lives. He asserts that we all have the potential to be the best versions of ourselves and this process towards self-improvement should be the norm rather than a rare occurrence.
</li><li><b>Human mindset is wired for status and power sensitivity</b>: The human mind is naturally wired to care about status and power and what other people value. However, this condition can be outgrown by adopting mindset shifts.
</li><li><b>Self-worth does not exist</b>: Belief in self-worth is just an illusion created by our minds. External accomplishments and physical objects do not inherently carry worth and the attempt to acquire more self-worth is a losing battle. Our worth is not determined by external validation or societal value assignments. 
</li><li><b>Everyone is on the same playing field</b>: Every human being has the same worth. Actions, accomplishments, or societal status do not make a person better than another. It is only a social matrix that assigns worth and creates a division among individuals. 
</li><li><b>Human beings are too complex for comparison</b>: Comparing two human beings results in an unfair comparison due to the complexity and uniqueness of each individual's life history, genetics, personality, and environment. How individuals invest their time and resources varies and thus leads to different outcomes. 
</li><li><b>Comparison base on a single facet is unfair</b>: Many times, comparison is based on one particular facet of life, ignoring the full picture which leads to an unfair comparison. The full facet of a person's life including the hidden ones beneath the surface should be considered during comparison.
</li><li><b>Unfair and unrealistic comparisons should be avoided</b>: Humans differ greatly hence there is no reason to expect the same results as someone else. Unrealistic comparisons often overlook a persons history, family situation, resources, environment, and genetics, which all contribute to individual success.
</li><li><b>Comparison between individuals</b>: Comparison between two people is not correct due to the complexities of each individual. Celebrities often seem like they have perfect lives due to the limited exposure we have to their lives, which is not an accurate representation.
</li><li><b>Competition is disadvantageous</b>: Competition tends to be a negative influence in life, with people always striving to be better than others. Achieving the top position in any field brings momentary satisfaction but is quickly replaced with fear and anxiety. Life should be focused on self-improvement and personal growth rather than competition.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of personal handicaps or weaknesses</b>: Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses; understanding and accepting this fact is essential. Trying to be perfect in everything leads to dissatisfaction and stress. It is better to focus on areas you are good at and understand that having weaknesses is a part of being human.
</li><li><b>Being 'normal' is overrated</b>: Trying to fit into societal norms often leads to a mediocre and unfulfilling life. Embracing one's uniqueness and eccentricities not only leads to a more satisfying life but also makes one more appealing and interesting to others.
</li><li><b>Difference between fake and authentic uniqueness</b>: Fake uniqueness is an attempt to stand out by conforming to certain trends or fads like tattoos or piercings, while authentic uniqueness comes from embracing and accepting one's true self, including their strengths, weaknesses, passions, and values. Authentic uniqueness requires self-love and acceptance.
</li><li><b>Authentic self-expression</b>: Leo suggests that living as your most authentic self, without attempting to be special, actually creates a unique, fulfilling sense of self that is paradoxically extraordinary in its ordinariness.
</li><li><b>Self love and life ownership</b>: Leo advocates for a complete, inward focus on self-love and ownership of one's life. This involves actively investing in personal development across various aspects of life (career, finance, health, relationships) which would naturally divert focus from comparison with others. 
</li><li><b>Embracing the success of others</b>: Leo encourages a mindset shift from jealousy to inspiration when observing successful individuals. Rather than letting success create a sense of scarcity, he suggests considering it a preview of possibilities that can be added to your own life vision.
</li><li><b>Treating desirable qualities as acquirable</b>: Intelligence, humor, and other desirable traits seen in others should not create envy but rather be recognized as abilities that can be acquired with effort and discipline.
</li><li><b>Abandoning the scarcity mindset</b>: Leo challenges the common perception of limited resources and opportunities, emphasizing on the infinite potentials in creative and knowledge-based careers. 
</li><li><b>Specific areas of comparison</b>: Regarding common areas of comparison such as physical appearance, performance, financial status, position, Leo advises focusing on creation and self-improvement rather than comparing oneself to others.
</li><li><b>Physical Appearance Comparison</b>: Accept whatever your physical appearance is and stop comparing it to others. Change can't be achieved significantly in this aspect, and it is healthier to accept and appreciate one's look.
</li><li><b>Performance Comparison</b>: Everyone can achieve high performance seen in others, provided they desire it and work towards it. Seeing high performance in others can, in fact, inspire and motivate an individual to develop a similar level of performance.
</li><li><b>Financial and Material Comparison</b>: Envy for someone's financial position or possessions should be a motivation to achieve similar financial success, since anyone can acquire these if they desire and work for them.
</li><li><b>Position/Status/Celebrity Comparison</b>: Similar to performance comparison, positions or status can also be acquired through hard work and patience.
</li><li><b>Business Rankings Comparison</b>: Constantly comparing business rankings distracts from new and creative works and is not beneficial. Instead, focus should be on the business's impact and the help it provides to people.
</li><li><b>Ability Comparison</b>: Abilities like intelligence, confidence, humor, musical talent, and artistic talent can be developed over time through hard work and dedication. Seeing these abilities in others should add it to an individual's vision to inspire her/him to develop them.
</li><li><b>Useful Comparisons</b>: The only useful comparisons are those that help in expanding one's imagination about possibilities in life. This can inspire personal growth, and potentially infinite development and improvement in different areas of life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Commitment</b>: To achieve these changes and improvements, commitment to mastering life is crucial, using inspiration from others as a motivation for personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Role of Actualize.org</b>: Actualize.org aids in this journey of changing one's life by teaching advanced concepts needed to transform one's life. Over time and with consistent follow-up, possibilities of profound transformation can be seen, leading to a profound love for life. 
</li><li><b>Exploration of Human Potential</b>: Human beings are capable of changing almost all aspects of their lives, including performance, financial status, and personal characteristics. This potential should inspire optimism and positivity about the future, and should keep the focus on personal growth and improvement rather than on comparisons with others.
