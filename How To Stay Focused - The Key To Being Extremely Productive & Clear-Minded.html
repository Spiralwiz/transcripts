hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I am going to talk about how
to stay focused so focus is the topic of the
day focus is an important topic right because why do
you want to stay focused if you cannot focus then
you cannot be productive and you cannot get any work
done and then you're staying in place in your life
or you're sliding backwards and you're not moving forwards the
way you want to so whether it's focused at school
focus at work or even focus in a relationship or
focus in a hobby that you're doing or whatever being
able to focus is critical to getting you the results
that you want it's actually not only critical for that
but it's critical for your happiness too because we human
beings are really not multitasking machines we suck at multitasking
despite what you might hear out there we are much
better when we're focused and when we're focused and we're
super focused and we're using our skills in a process
that is challenging to us and we're able to match
our skillset to the challenge that is coming up then
what happens is that we actually get into a state
of flow as it's called this is a psychological concept
from Chi Chi semi-high which is a he was a
famous psychologist in the positive psychology movement he talks about
flow flow being this state of ease that you enter
into and total absorption when you are focused on a
single task and you're doing it and you're excelling at
it and you're doing it really well so how do
you actually stay focused what are the practical ways to
get this abstract notion of flow to come into your
life a couple of simple points here that you can
go implement immediately so flow or a focus is all
about eliminating distractions so what are the distractions right now
that are keeping you from being focused go ahead and
sit down pause this video and jot down five things
what are five things that are keeping you distracted in
whatever area of life you want more focus in so
are you not focused at work what is distracting you
is it hunger because you're not eating in the morning
is it your boss who comes in and disturbed you
every 15 minutes or is it emails is it the
Twitter feed that's pinging you is it your cell phone
that's vibrating from text that you're getting hit up with
well you know what is distracting you what about at
school what's distracting you there what about in your relationship
what's distracting you there sit down and identify those factors
because once you've got those identified and I think what
you'll find is actually that one of the biggest factors
that you'll find is multitasking you trying to do multiple
things at one time and that of course is the
antithesis of focus when you're doing multiple things you are
not focused by definition you're slitting your focus and when
you split your focus it's like you know what it's
like it's like imagine if we had the Sun it
was a bright sunny day and I gave you a
magnifying glass and I said here you can take this
magnifying glass and if you hold it up at the
right angle and you hold it steady then you can
burn that ant right there on the ground or you
can set that leaf on fire and at first thought
you'd say like wow that's you didn't know that you
say well that's that's amazing I can't believe that's true
let me try it then you take that magnifying glass
and you'd run over and you try to burn an
ant or burn a burn a piece of leaf and
but of course if you didn't listen to the fact
that I told you you have to keep it steady
and you have to focus the raids that was going
to happen is you're going to just kind of move
move it around move it around move around and you're
gonna come back to me to say what the hell
nothing worked this this you're lying to me this doesn't
work it's not possible to take the sun's rays and
burn anything with them they're they're too weak and of
course the problem is that you didn't focus the Rays
first that's exactly what its life and you're like in
your life if you're trying to get some success in
your career and your business at school what you need
to do is you need to put your with your
full attention on it right you bring all those rays
to a point you need to bring your thoughts to
a point your mind has to be focused on whatever
it is that you're doing and we can't do that
when we're trying to talk to our boss on skype
and then at the simultaneously we're trying to answer an
email for a client and then sign Dainius Lee we're
trying to text with uh with your girlfriend or boyfriend
and then trying to cook lunch and trying to to
ris'n to to listen to the radio if you're trying
to do all those things at once you're going to
be really really miserable and you're actually gonna be performing
all of them sub-optimally and you're going to feel very
frantic and overwhelmed when you're doing that so here's the
biggest thing you've got to eliminate the distractions and really
restructure your life so that you have time quiet time
to just focus on one thing at a time this
is called working in block time and I cover this
concept more deeply in my personal development Lou print which
you can find on actualise org but what I'll briefly
mention about it here is that to work in block
time what you've got to do is you got to
basically set off 60 to 90 minute blocks throughout your
day where you sit down and work on a task
and you do nothing else you do not let yourself
get distracted by anything else you don't let yourself get
up and do other things you just focus on that
one task and you don't do multiple tasks at the
same time it's a very simple concept but do you
actually have it implemented very few people I find do
even when you know about the concept it still takes
some time to actually go and restructure your day so
it's like this that means when you sit down to
work you sit down and you say okay what's the
most important thing I got to be doing right now
I have to be checking emails okay then you sit
down and you just check emails for 60 to 90
minutes you just check emails nothing else you don't check
your cell phone you don't check your text messages you
don't browse the web while an email is loading you
don't talk to your boss you don't go up and
grab a bagel you don't do any anything but checking
emails and you do that for 60 to 90 minutes
then because you've been so focused on checking emails you're
going to find first of all you've checked a lot
of emails and you basically got that task done because
you were so focused so determine you got a lot
of work done you were able to concentrate but then
of course you were because you were so focused now
you're a little bit exhausted because you did put a
lot mental energy into that task and now what you
got to do is you got to give us a
little bit of a break ten to five to fifteen
minute break that's where you can go and grab your
bagel talk to your friends you know to text your
girlfriend or whatever and then fifteen minutes later you come
back and you start the next task maybe you need
to do another session of email checking or maybe you
got to do something else maybe now now I may
be going to have a meeting with your boss and
you do a meeting with your boss for however long
that needs to take and don't make these blocks too
long because you're going to get exhausted so 60 to
90 minutes do that and then take another break and
basically have your day broken up into these blocks so
that you can focus on single tasks and once you
find that way if you develop this discipline and really
prevent yourself from multitasking shut off all the distractions close
the doors close the computer screens close the web browsers
shut down the cell phones you're going to find that
each one of those tasks is getting completed so much
faster so maybe before we're checking the email we'll take
you half the day if you just focus on it
for 90 minutes without any distractions you'll get all your
email checked in just 90 minutes and you'll be surprised
because right now you might be thinking well I got
to put in as much time as I can and
that my work and my productivity is tied to the
amount of time that I'm putting in but actually your
productivity is more tied to your focus and the energy
you're putting in and a a task that should take
90 minutes can easily take a half a day or
a whole day if you're doing a bunch of other
things while you're trying to do that task because here's
what happens is that every time you get distracted studies
have shown that it can take up to 10 to
15 minutes to get your mind back on track with
the activity that you were doing this especially applies if
you're doing creative type of work let's say you're drafting
up a plan for your business or you're writing a
piece of a complicated piece of code or you're planning
a presentation that you're going to give at work if
you're doing something creative like that that requires a lot
of your you know a lot of your your thinking
skills and creativity skills and you're sitting there and you're
making that presentation let's say and then your boss comes
in he interrupts you 20 minutes in you talk to
your boss for five minutes and he walks out now
it might take you 10 to 15 minutes to get
back to that mental state that you were at when
you started before your boss came in and that of
course is is setting you back because those 10 to
15 minutes it's going to take you to get back
into that flow state is time that you lost time
that you're not productive and also it's just not satisfying
to us as human beings our psychology is not satisfied
when we're always interrupted and we're not able to to
finish things off so that's important I think that is
that is really the key to focus is to just
shut off the distractions and to have the discipline to
do that I know in my life I personally don't
have enough discipline so I've actually lately been working on
this you know I've been shutting off my cell phone
more I've been muting my cell phone I've been giving
myself more quiet time to do the things I need
to do because otherwise I can't get done the important
things that need to be done and I can't focus
for example right now I'm doing an hour of meditation
in the morning and to do an hour of meditation
is challenging because I do have other obligations I could
be checking email I get phone calls all the time
I get text messages what do I do I have
to just shut it off I have to shut it
off in my mind I have to shut it off
in the real world if I'm sitting there and my
cell phone is not muted there's no way I can
meditate so I have to mute my cell phone just
a practical little tip but it gets me focus so
again going back to that list of the five distractions
that you have now I want you to come up
with a list of five things you can do to
eliminate those distractions what would that be what does that
mean for you if you go ahead and you do
that and you implement this block working in block time
technique you're going to find that your focus skyrockets your
satisfaction skyrockets you're going to be in the flow a
lot more consistently you're going to be happy and you're
gonna be way way way more productive alright this is
