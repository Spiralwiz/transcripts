            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6Qqc3gL3oHE' target='_blank'>Intro To Systems Thinking</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Systems Thinking</b>: Systems thinking is a meta perspective that treats the world as interconnected systems within systems, each interacting in complex and counterintuitive ways. It involves studying the laws, principles, and potential pitfalls of manipulating these systems. System thinking is crucial for achieving larger scale changes outside the scope of personal success, such as in government, corporations, or the environment. It also allows individuals to fulfill their life purpose by understanding and adapting to the complexities of the systems that resist change.
</li><li><b>Importance of Systems Thinking</b>: Systems thinking enables more significant, meaningful impacts in the world aligned with one's life purpose, particularly for individuals in leadership, visionary, design, architecture, and artistic roles. The concept aligns with the 'stage yellow' level in the Spiral Dynamics model developed by Clare Graves, characterised by the understanding of the world's systemic complexity.
</li><li><b>Defining a system</b>: Systems are made of interconnected elements and relationships, where the latter are more important. They exhibit complex behaviour and serve a specific purpose, which is crucial to understanding the system. Common purposes include self-protection, homeostasis maintenance, and growth. Systems are highly ordered yet chaotic, meaning they are nonlinear and unpredictable.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of Systems</b>: Systems follow patterns similar to living organisms. They are self-organizing, self-sustaining, self-repairing, and respond to external influences in complex ways. Non-biological entities such as corporations, governments, and ecosystems can also be viewed as systems due to the complexity of their interrelationships and their responsive nature.
</li><li><b>Evolution of Systems</b>: Systems have the ability to evolve over time and adapt to changing conditions. Language, for instance, is a system that has remarkably changed throughout history due to various influences.
</li><li><b>Evolution of Systems</b>: Systems are evolutionary, continually changing and adapting over time, similar to how language has evolved over the last few centuries. No single individual designs a system, rather, it self-organizes and evolves over time, with humans as the substrate.
</li><li><b>Systems VS Scattered Parts</b>: While a system is complex and interconnected, it is distinct from scattered parts which don't have meaningful, interconnected relationships. Examples of non-systems might include rocks randomly lying on the ground or books organized on a bookshelf.
</li><li><b>Examples of Systems</b>: In order to understand how systems work, you need to examine a variety of systems. Examples can range from a rainforest, the human body, an aquarium, a city, corporations, public education, the Catholic Church, individual businesses, and even oneself.
</li><li><b>Nested Systems</b>: Systems can become complex by nesting, which is having systems within systems. For example, the human body is a system which contains subsystems like the cardiovascular system, digestion system, and the immune system. You can also consider the entire cosmos as the ultimate system, and other systems as its subsystems.
</li><li><b>Persistent Systemic Problems</b>: Systems may create persistent problems like poverty, environmental issues, shrinking middle class, drug addiction, crime, war, obesity, depression, etc. These problems exist not due to individual humans but due to the larger operating systems that have evolved over thousands of years.
</li><li><b>Principles of Systemic Thinking</b>: To tackle these systemic problems effectively, you need to understand the principles that define systemic thinking, which includes viewing the world as interconnected, complex systems constantly evolving. Manipulating a system without understanding its complexities can often lead to unintended consequences, hence the need for careful study and analysis.
</li><li><b>Recognizing problems as systemic, not personal</b>: Systems thinking implies understanding that obstacles and issues are not the result of individuals, but rather of larger, poorly designed systems. Therefore, instead of blaming others or labelling things as evil, systemic thinkers consider the broader meta principles at play.
</li><li><b>Seeing everything as a system</b>: A guiding principle of systems thinking is viewing everything as a system, which is particularly beneficial for those transitioning to stage yellow spiral dynamics.
</li><li><b>The non-linearity of systems</b>: Non-linearity is a crucial component of systems thinking. It refers to the fact that the variables within each system affect each other and can change nonlinearly, leading to unexpected outcomes. Systems often behave in a counterintuitive manner, and actions taken without a comprehensive understanding of the system can result in unintended consequences.
</li><li><b>Influence of local actions on the global scale</b>: The actions of an entity, like a company, don't just affect that entity Â— they also impact larger systems such as the national economy, global economy, and public opinion. Therefore, systemic thinking requires consideration of how one's actions fit into and impact these larger systems.
</li><li><b>Systems as their own greatest enemies</b>: As with individuals, systems are often their own biggest adversaries. This principle is evident in how knee-jerk reactions to terrorism, for instance, can lead to systemic collapse. Systems thinking encourages the understanding of such backfiring mechanisms and the development of counterintuitive solutions for systemic problems.
</li><li><b>The interconnectedness of systems</b>: Systems thinking involves acknowledging the interdependence of various systems and recognizing the complex factors that influence variables such as poverty, war, education improvement, and drug abuse. Hence, making changes within a system requires a broader, more informed perspective that appreciates the complexities of these systems.
</li><li><b>Collective accountability and systems thinking</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that systems thinking enables us to understand that problems are largely internal, both individually and collectively. He mentions how the US, akin to any entity, creates its own problems. This highlights the responsibility to seek internal solutions rather than pointing fingers, avoiding overreactions that can disrupt and damage complex systems.
</li><li><b>Disruptive actions and system balance</b>: Applying disruptive changes to intricate systems can result in disaster, as evidenced by the election of Trump and his unsuccessful attempts to alter the intricate US government system. Gura indicates that systems need balance and harmony involving positive and negative forces, which disruptive actions can destabilize.
</li><li><b>Reductionism versus Holism</b>: Gura warns against simplistic, reductionist thinking that focuses on discrete elements and ignores relationships within a system. He encourages a holistic perspective that values relationships and interactions among system components, which provides a broader and deeper understanding of system behavior.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of System Boundaries</b>: Leo Gura explains that system boundaries are not fixed into reality but are subjectively defined by human beings. He adds that the ability to redefine boundaries is a key aspect of systems thinking, as it allows us to gain new perspectives and potential solutions.
</li><li><b>Dynamic Nature of Systems</b>: Emphasizing that the world is continuously morphing and evolving, Gura cautions against a static worldview. He highlights the significance of recognizing the changing nature of everything, from personal bodies and beliefs to larger entities like countries and industries.
</li><li><b>Valuing complexity, Wisdom, and Lifelong Learning</b>: According to Gura, systems thinkers appreciate complexity, nuance, wisdom, and are dedicated to lifelong learning. Understanding the evolving complexity of systems is critical and drives the need for continuous learning.
</li><li><b>Understanding Systems for Solution Formulation</b>: Gura stresses on understanding systems before acting on them. He suggests that systems thinkers appreciate the power in understanding a system before altering it, rather than arbitrarily manipulating it. This vision might appear academic or theoretical to people at lower stages of the Spiral Dynamics model, but it reflects a more accurate understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Principle of Preventive Action</b>: Systems thinking involves a forward-looking approach, taking preventive action rather than reacting to problems after they occur. The same principle applies to personal health, business strategies, and other such systems. Actions have ripple effects that affect the individual and their environment, necessitating careful consideration of each decision or action.
</li><li><b>Admitting the Unknown</b>: Systems are complex and beyond complete comprehension, making humility a necessary trait in systems thinkers. They recognize the limitations of their understanding and do not oversimplify complex problems and solutions.
</li><li><b>Self-Reflection</b>: A key component of systems thinking, self-reflection allows for the identification and resolution of internal structural problems. Without self-reflection, systems, including individuals and organizations, face disastrous outcomes and can't compete effectively.
</li><li><b>Looking for Root Causes</b>: Systems thinkers prioritize seeking root causes of issues rather than focusing on the superficial, emotional aspects. They can see through red herrings and comprehend the underlining structural problems within systems.
</li><li><b>Concern for Balance</b>: Acknowledging the importance of balance, systems thinkers recognize the dangers of unchecked growth or dominance of a single force within a system, likening it to a cancer. They understand the need to balance different aspects such as population growth, corporate greed, and societal power distribution to ensure longevity and stability of the system.
</li><li><b>Appreciation for the Wisdom of Nature</b>: Systems thinkers value the wisdom found in natural systems such as rainforests, coral reefs, and even tribal populations, often overlooked in Western civilization. They realize that synthetic solutions, like pharmaceutical drugs, can sometimes disregard the existing natural remedies, leading to issues such as an addiction epidemic.
</li><li><b>Appreciating the wisdom of nature and understanding sustainability</b>: Systems thinking emphasizes on understanding and appreciating the delicate balances within ecosystems, including endangered animals and fish populations, among others, to ensure sustainability. 
</li><li><b>Global concern over local or tribal concern</b>: Systems thinkers promote a global concern as opposed to a local, tribalistic viewpoint. They integrate all elements and consider the entire human species, animals, and the environment as important. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing unsustainable practices</b>: Systems thinkers evaluate the sustainability of different systems, recognizing when enough is enough, and understand that never-ending growth is not what humanity should pursue. 
</li><li><b>Understanding dangers of self-interest and need for inclusivity</b>: They acknowledge the dangers of serving self-interest blindly, both at an individual and collective (corporation, government, religion) level. They also understand the importance of inclusivity in finding solutions since excluding anyone could destabilize and break the system.
</li><li><b>Addressing systemic addictions</b>: As systems thinkers, they are aware of systemic addictions like a nation's addiction to oil or low taxes and work towards addressing these.
</li><li><b>Importance of changing paradigms</b>: They also understand the power of changing paradigms to bring about a shift in perspective and solve problems.
</li><li><b>Understanding the mind-body problem</b>: A shift in paradigm is suggested to solve the mind-body problem - recognizing that the brain is not creating consciousness but that consciousness is the location of the brain.
</li><li><b>Integrating Multiple Perspectives</b>: Systems thinking requires accommodating various perspectives to understand the holistic functioning of a system. A system thinker proactively seeks and integrates various viewpoints, understanding that each perspective holds a degree of truth, irrespective of how misguided it may seem initially.
</li><li><b>Open-mindedness in Systems Thinking</b>: Good systems thinkers remain open-minded while exploring various perspectives. Preconceived notions about perspectives can lead to incorrect judgement and blindsidedness. A system thinker values unbiased investigation and allows flexibility in adopting differing viewpoints.
</li><li><b>Study of Patterns and Cycles</b>: Recognizing that systems often demonstrate cyclical patterns is a crucial aspect of systems thinking. Studying these patterns and understanding patterns of life, businesses, ideologies, etc. can help predict outcomes more accurately.
</li><li><b>Understanding Systemic Problems through Feedback loops</b>: Poorly designed feedback loops contribute significantly to systemic issues. Strong systems thinkers focus on improving feedback processes for better system functionality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Systems Thinking for World Improvement</b>: Engaging in systems thinking allows for meaningful contribution to the world. The degree of success and satisfaction in life directly corresponds with the ability to critically analyze and creatively solve real-world systemic issues. Stagnation or lackadaisical attitudes towards systemic progress may lead to personal and communal failure.
</li><li><b>Causation of World Problems</b>: Narrow-minded focus on personal success often contributes to global issues. Blindly working within destructive systems, like environmentally damaging industries, without any intent to drive positive change can lead to societal decay and potential extinction of human race.
</li><li><b>Using systems thinking to understand traffic</b>: For example, instead of blaming the driver in front, a systems thinker would ask why the traffic jam occurred in the first place and could consider various contributions like the number of lanes, stoplights, speed limit or lack of nearby highways etc.
</li><li><b>Significance of Systems-Thinking Books</b>: Lastly, learning about systems thinking is crucial and books provide a valuable resource for in-depth knowledge. To that end, the viewer is advised to check out the two newly added books on systems thinking in the Actualized.org website's book list.
