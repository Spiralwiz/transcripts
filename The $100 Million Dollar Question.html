hey what's up this is Leo for actualize org and
I want to ask you the hundred million dollar question
and the hundred million dollar question is this if you
had a hundred million dollars right now in your bank
account you woke up with a hundred million dollars tomorrow
what would you do and here's the trick to this
question first of all I want you to actually go
through and actually think it through actually visualize try to
experience it but do it along the following lines a
hundred million dollars is in your bank account now and
ask yourself if you woke up tomorrow what would you
really do knowing that you had that money sure you'd
go probably go out and you'd buy yourself a nice
car and then what would you do you would go
maybe rent a yacht and sail out into the ocean
and have a party and you'd probably go buy some
expensive champagne at some fancy nightclub and then maybe you'd
go travel to some favourite country that you've always wanted
to travel to and maybe you'd buy yourself that dream
house that you've always wanted so you'd buy that and
maybe you'd move to the city that you want to
live in or the country that you want to live
in and you'd settle down there and then you would
decorate your house full of all the fancy gadgets and
electronics that you would want your TVs DVD players game
systems audio systems kitchen appliances whatever it is that you
wanted you you would do all that and you'd get
yourself some nice health insurance and you'd buy if you
have kids you'd buy your kids some nice toys that
they could have fun with and if you have a
spouse you'd buy them some gifts and and and do
some good for them but then after all of that
you know let's say you have a month to really
sit down and use all that money or some chunk
of it after that you're still sitting on a hundred
million dollars and what would you do then the question
is what would you actually be doing with your life
what would you be putting your effort and energy into
would you be putting that into into some sort of
cause would you be doing something creative would you be
doing something productive what would that be sit down and
just think about this little thought experiment it's a little
bit silly but if you sit down and really think
it through almost as though you have it like trick
yourself into believing that you have 100 million dollars and
that you've gone through and you've bought the fancy cars
and the houses and all the gadgetry and you've done
all the traveling you want to do and now it's
kind of like the next day you wake up you've
got the cash you've done all this stuff you've gotten
that taken care of and then what do you do
then and that is the hundred million dollar question this
is a really powerful question when I asked myself this
question and I got rid of some of all that
all that filler like what I would do with that
money I would buy myself a nice camera and I'd
buy myself with a better car and I'd move to
this place and I'd buy myself a condo after all
that I just imagined myself you know sitting in that
condo that I would have in some high-rise somewhere some
some nice city and then I would just kind of
wake up and then I would think what is the
next step for my life and I really pictured it
and for me what I came up with was that
I would be doing what I'm doing right now is
that I would be traveling and I would be shooting
videos and I would be studying self-development the way that
I am right now and then I would be presenting
that information to people out there like you that would
hopefully get some benefit out of it and that for
me there's really nothing I would rather be doing than
that you know I scanned all the different scenarios do
I want to start some other company do I want
to launch a new website do I want to maybe
become a professional X or professional Y or professional Z
do I want to just sit around and party do
I want to go buy myself a yacht and travel
to the Caribbean you know what what would I do
for me it ultimately boiled down to the deepest satisfaction
that I would get is is pursuing self-development because to
me that's the most interesting thing that I found in
life and that's that's personally just me doesn't have to
be you for you it might be something else you
know maybe for you it's art or maybe for you
it's it's running some sort of charity or maybe for
you it is travel and all you want to do
is travel or maybe for you it's playing some sort
of sport or whatever but the hundred million dollar question
stands is what would you be doing with your life
and then the trick is of course once you've identified
that thing is to really have the courage to go
out there and do it because that's what's really difficult
because of course you don't have 100 million dollars and
so you still have the bills to pay and you
still have your boss nagging you and maybe you don't
have health insurance etc etc so you have your issues
that are limited basically you're limited by the money right
maybe you don't have the capital of start the business
that you want to start but the hundred million dollar
question the value of it is that it gets you
thinking and it gets you to cut out all the
filler cuz right now there's this tendency to think well
you know if I had a little bit more money
I would go do that and if I had a
little bit more I would go do this or what
you do is you really you create projects and endeavors
for yourself that are just about getting you money but
then the question is what would you do when you
had that money you know maybe you want to start
a business right now and you want to start a
business doing something but ultimately if you had 100 million
dollars you wouldn't start that business because that's not something
you would be doing just for the sake of doing
it you're only doing it because you want the reward
for it the money that will then get you to
someplace else the question is what is that ultimate place
that you're trying to get to and for me what
I've really figured out as I've done this exercise and
I really really imagined it and visualized it and almost
lived it like I would wake up in the morning
and I would just picture myself having that money and
then picturing myself like being totally free like free of
all the obligations I would cast aside all my obligations
and then I would really just focus on what I
want to create the kind of impact that I want
to have and for me that is self-development I want
to study it I understand it better because the way
I understand it right now even though I've been studying
it for a while now and I do coaching etc
I feel like my level of understanding of self-development is
still very very minuscule compared to what it could be
and compared to what I want it to be I
really want to understand how human beings develop and all
the strategies and techniques involved all the challenges involved and
also I just want to see how far I can
develop myself because for me that's the most rewarding part
of life is being able to grow in new by
doing new and interesting things and pushing myself and seeing
how far I can get and see how much satisfaction
I can get out of life so that is my
purpose so - so to speak the question is what
is yours and I really encourage you to take this
100 million dollar question to heart and think about it
think about it as though it was real and have
the courage to cast aside what society wants you to
do what your parents might think you should be doing
what your spouse might think you should be doing all
of that cast all that inside and and just ask
yourself if you were free of all that if you
were free of all the social pressures all the financial
pressures that you have in your life what would you
be doing and if your answer is that you would
be doing nothing or all you would be doing is
travelling or all you would be doing is is partying
and using this money to buy gadgets and stuff I
think that you fail to appreciate the depth of the
challenge there you think that the stuff that you're gonna
acquire with the money is it going to make you
content but really bypass all that because that's it's not
going to make you content you've you know better than
that you've gotten you've gotten stuff in the past and
you know that it has never really satisfied you the
only thing that satisfies you is what you're doing it's
the action that you're taking towards something the question is
what is that thing and for everybody's gonna be different
the question is what is it for you so if
you had a hundred million dollars what would you be
doing like they have been thinking a lot about what
it means to be a hundred percent authentic in your
expression and what it means to live a life where
you're expressing yourself at a hundred percent I feel this
is something that most people don't do and I think
the people that are able to do this are able
to tap into some sort of genius or they're able
to create results that most of us are not able
to to even match or come close to and that's
because these people what they're able to do is they're
really able to share who they are at the very
core and whatever it is that they're doing in their
life whatever their career is what avocation whatever their job
they're able to channel that and have their job express
who they are 100 percent now what does that mean
to me it means whatever your deepest values are whatever
you love in life being able to do it do
that thing and have it Express express yourself so it's
like the the full expression of your personality let's say
you were working at a job where you didn't have
to hold back at all right you can be just
completely 100 percent creative and just put put forward and
put poor and just bring out and what you're bringing
out ultimately on some level it's certain standards that you
have but ultimately if you can get past all the
filler like what other people want you to be putting
out what what maybe market research tells you to be
putting out what surveys tell you to putting out what
what economics tell you to be putting out like what's
gonna earn you the most money if you get rid
of all of those filters and you just are left
with like what you feel is most valuable to be
creative in and you're able to bring that forward and
bring it out and somehow manifest it that is what
100 authentic expression is and I think there's a lot
of power behind that but the problem is that most
of us are are not in a position to really
be that expressive and I don't mean just like going
and being an artist that's not what I'm talking about
you can be running a business you could be working
for somebody else it doesn't really matter what you're doing
the question is is it an expression of your deepest
personality like who you truly are and your deepest values
I think for most people the answer is no because
first of all they're either stuck into some job that
they're just doing just to pay the bills or they
haven't really taken the time to do the deep soul-searching
that you got to do in order to even know
who it is that you are what your values are
to like really get down to the core of those
clarify them and then find a medium or a vehicle
to translate them to the world so maybe if you're
if you're an entrepreneur then for you that's starting a
business and maybe you don't even care what kind of
business it is you can express your values as as
an entrepreneur by starting some sort of business and then
just like running that really well so maybe that it's
that or maybe if you're an artist then there's a
certain you know a certain something that you want to
share with the world a certain something about you that
you want to express or a way that you're looking
at at the world around you and you want to
express it in a certain style and so being completely
authentic to that style and not holding back because you're
not worried about how someone might judge it whether they'll
like it or not or whether they'll they'll buy your
painting or not you don't care about any of that
you're just so comfortable in it that you're able to
express just Express Express Express without any sort of attachment
to getting validation or feedback from from society or anybody
else I think this is a really difficult thing to
do to do this completely authentically a hundred percent because
well in reality that you do have these issues of
well am I gonna get paid for it how am
I gonna how am I gonna make ends meet you
know what if people don't like it how is that
gonna reflect on me what do people think my art
sucks what people think the way that I run a
business sucks you know putting yourself in that kind of
position where you can where you can do this where
you can totally express yourself it's very challenging it takes
a lot of balls it takes a lot of courage
to put yourself on that kind of out there on
the line because you do run the risk of being
rejected you might even run the risk of being hurt
financially as you do this I think the challenge in
life is is finding a way to to get yourself
in this kind of position where you're able to express
yourself authentically first that means you got to know who
you are authentically so you have to do a little
bit of soul-searching it's not something that you can just
get in one day it's something that you got to
go out there and test stuff out and through a
process of trial and error ultimately you're gonna peel that
peel that onion back you're gonna peel the layers back
until you get to the core of what your purpose
is and once you've got that core then that is
like the first step so now you have some sort
of idea of what you should be moving towards then
of course there are practical challenges to all this even
if you know what you should be expressing and what
that means is still a challenge to put yourself practically
in the situation where you can do that without being
beholden to other forces right so maybe you care about
what your parents think of you maybe you care about
what your spouse thinks of you maybe you care about
what your friends think of you or maybe you just
care about the money that you're getting and you have
to you feel like you have to weigh your creative
output with the amount of money that you would be
receiving for it so maybe you feel like being a
hard percent authentic would be rewarding for you it's like
spiritually it would it would feel nice but it wouldn't
pay the bills at that level that you want it
to pay at you know maybe you wouldn't be a
millionaire if you did it maybe you'd only be making
fifty thousand a year or maybe you feel like you
would even be making that maybe you feel like you
wouldn't be able to make any money doing what it
is that you really love doing I think the power
though is to summon the courage and then of course
use user logic user intellect use practical things that you
understand tools to kind of put yourself in a position
where you can be there expressing yourself hopefully getting rewarded
for it financially and also not caring what others think
of you I think that's ultimately the most rewarding position
to be in in life and the trick though is
is figuring out how to get those pieces all fit
together and that's a large puzzle to solve that's not
something that you can solve in a week it's not
something you can solve in a month this is probably
gonna be a multiple year-long endeavor for you to get
this handled maybe it's gonna take you a decade to
get a handle maybe even more because you gotta do
some deep soul-searching figure out what you want then you
got to actually start putting the the action steps in
place to get yourself there maybe that means you got
a sort of business that's gonna earn you enough money
so that you can be financially independent so that then
you could do what it is that you want to
do but I think the power of of this concept
is that once you get yourself in a position where
you can be completely authentic just expressing who you are
that is like the core because there's something that you
can bring to the world given your unique experiences in
your beliefs and your skill sets and your personal history
and psychology that nobody else on the planet can do
you know and whether that's being manifest through business or
through through a job that you have there's some sort
of career or whatever is if you do volunteer work
doesn't really matter there's something there that you can share
with the world that will be a value and that's
like your personality right manifest through some sort of lens
like a job or whatever I think it's really powerful
that once you get aligned once you get aligned with
that you get all the elements in your life aligned
with that then you can start achieving amazing things you
can start feeling really rewarded and great about yourself not
because you're earning money but because you're having the kind
of impact that you want and it's not even so
much about impact it's just that you're just like expressing
it's just like a full natural expression you feel so
good about that that almost nothing else is even necessary
but ironically what happens is that when you are that
expressive usually what happens is that stuffs starts aligning with
you and you start getting more and more success it's
like to start snowballing because you're you're being so expressive
people are drawn to it because you're sharing something unique
that nobody else is offering and then that all of
a sudden puts you in a position where you have
prestige you have you have authority you have value so
you can charge more and therefore the finances come into
place as well and then you get your independence and
then that just lets you express yourself even more and
so you get this snowball effect going now that is
the ultimate goal I think I have for you if
you are interested in life purpose and finding your life
purpose and getting on track with your life purpose is
finding out what it is that you want to express
and how exactly you want to express it and then
putting the action plan into place for for getting that
going so maybe you're just starting this or maybe you're
already halfway into it and there's some extra steps you
need to take to move it further along either way
I encourage you to think about what kind of true
expression you want to have in your life you
