[Music] is time for a good old-fashioned motivational speech i
think i'm long overdue on this actually i keep saying
this but like when i started the channel originally years
ago the point of this channel was really a large
part of it was motivational speaking and somehow i've gotten
sidetracked and haven't done enough of that so this episode
is going to be a a serious motivational speech but
i don't want it to just be some platitudes or
some sort of fluffy motivational speech the way you see
a lot on youtube this needs to be a serious
talk this needs to be almost an intervention this is
an intervention like for a drug addict you are the
drug addict in this case we need to have a
serious talk about your entire attitude towards life because this
motivation thing goes very deep it's a very deep problem
within you your complacency you're taking of life for granted
and then from that stems your inability to create success
and to live the kind of life that you want
fundamentally you take life for granted this problem of motivation
really stems from a lack of spiritual connection and reverence
for your own life for the magic of what existence
is you exist existence is a miraculous magical occurrence you've
been gifted with this life and you don't even appreciate
what this life is and what it has to offer
you because if you did you would not have any
motivation problems you would be working your ass off every
day waking up early working on your life building the
kind of life you want shaping the world contributing to
mankind being creative being artistic improving yourself ironing out all
of your personality flaws and weaknesses and fears and limiting
beliefs because they would all be obstacles to get you
to where your creative vision needs to take you to
become the pinnacle of what you could be but somewhere
along the way you have become so complacent largely because
of how you're situated in the social matrix you become
so complacent because everybody around you is just sleepwalking through
life in this complacent manner and you've picked up this
habit and this attitude from everybody around you that you
socialize with and you are a social animal and you
take all of your social cues i mean your life
cues and your ideas for what your life could be
from those around you and you're not very creative about
that you're not very original you're being a herd animal
see everybody around you also takes the miracle of life
for granted and they're just in it to survive they're
just barely able to survive they have not undertaken a
conscious project to make something amazing out of their life
to honor this gift of life the miracle of existence
they're not honoring it they're not conscious of it they're
just surviving like animals and you have fallen into this
complacency because you don't see others around you who are
really turning life into an art form where they are
living beyond just survival complacency is our biggest problem today
because life in first world countries has become too easy
it's too easy to survive actually the entertainment is too
readily available video games tv the internet social media music
comedy it's way too easy to distract yourself and you
can waste years and decades in these sorts of pursuits
that leave you nowhere not working towards your vision not
even having a vision you see to be deeply conscious
of the gift that your life is to view it
as sacred to view it as divine to view it
as miraculous when you're connected to that then you feel
a sense of obligation to honor this miracle and to
work on its behalf to make the most of it
because you're conscious that this opportunity is not going to
last forever it's a very brief window that you have
to make something of this life now maybe you'll get
more lives in the future but this particular life it
goes by so fast and when you're conscious of that
you realize that there's really only one thing to do
in life which is to honor the miracle that life
is as much as you can humanly stomach and to
see how far you can take your life how much
of your potential can you actualize what even is your
full potential this is what makes life worthwhile this is
what makes life meaningful this is what makes blood life
beautiful and exciting and passionate it's a full engagement with
life and there's a seriousness that comes with that you
realize that you have a duty to the universe not
just to scrape by not just to survive not just
to be comfortable not just to buy a fancy car
or to titillate yourself with pleasures and entertainment and material
luxuries but you have a duty beyond all of that
and you take on this duty not as a chore
or an obligation but you take it on with alacrity
it is the greatest honor to work on behalf of
the universe to see what you can make of yourself
and how you can contribute to the evolution of the
universe this is the opportunity that has been presented to
you and when you're conscious of this opportunity you are
naturally eager to seize upon it and to take on
this challenge will willingly this is what life is about
and that becomes the backbone that gives structure to everything
else that's happening in your life so that your life
is not just a a grab bag of random events
and experiences of pleasure and avoidances of of suffering and
pain but that your life has some sort of trajectory
that's what grounds you that's what then gets you to
be serious and to live according to proper principles which
is necessary to be satisfied with life and to be
successful in life you're not living life haphazardly you're not
going to be following the path of least resistance this
is actually the opposite you're taking on a challenge there's
going to be more difficulty with this life i'm talking
about than just skating by on the path of least
resistance and you realize that but it doesn't matter to
you because what matters to you more is honoring your
life because you really only have two options you're alive
right now you have this life either you're gonna honor
it and you're gonna appreciate how beautiful and amazing life
is reality is how precious this opportunity is or you're
gonna take it for granted and if you take it
for granted then you're just going to be skating by
and just doing the bare minimum to get by and
when you're doing that bare minimum how can you be
motivated how can you be passionate how can you be
excited you're not really engaged engagement is the key what
is going to make you engaged in life at a
hundred percent figure that out it's going to have to
be some kind of spiritual connection it can't just be
material stuff what is it in life you can really
believe in find that and then do that every single
day and don't make any excuses for why you can't
oh but leo i don't have enough money or i'm
stuck in this shitty situation with my family or i'm
stuck in some third world country or capitalism is holding
me down not giving me the opportunity i don't have
enough capital to start on my project my dream project
i don't have the skills i don't know what to
do i'm confused those are all excuses that's all secondary
you need to ground yourself in what is primary what
is primary is that you know that you want to
make the most of your life and you want to
live a passionate life and you want to be fully
engaged with life that's what you want do you want
that or not now if you don't want that i
can't help you nobody can help you but if you
do want that then the rest in a sense solves
itself as long as you're focused on what you really
want every single day and you wake up and you
focus on that and you keep focusing on that and
you keep wondering how how can i make this a
reality it doesn't matter what the obstacles are it doesn't
matter that you don't know how to do it it
doesn't matter that you don't have enough money it doesn't
even matter where if you don't know exactly how you
want your life to play out none of that matters
because what matters really is first principles you operate based
upon first principles and if your principle is engagement and
passion and honoring your life then all you have to
do basically is keep asking yourself every single day what
is going to make me 100 engaged what does it
mean to be honoring my life what is the most
meaningful thing i can be doing with my life what
is the highest vision for my life and you just
focus on that and you ignore all of the excuses
all of the obstacles all of the limiting beliefs all
the distractions those will all be there you're gonna have
fears you can have questions about how to go about
this don't let that distract you keep your eye on
the ball very much fulfilling on this promise of living
an engaged life depends upon you not getting distracted and
this requires a seriousness and a focus and nobody is
going to do this for you only you can focus
yourself only you can adopt the kind of seriousness that
is necessary to actualize this kind of life people around
you are going to be distracting you constantly with their
problems their attachments their fears their bs their culture wars
their latest you know uh titillating distractions their their pursuit
of petty shallow things like money and sex and pleasure
that's what everybody around you is going to be doing
and they're going to be dragging you into their activities
and you got to be focused enough keeping your eye
on the ball of what you're really up to which
is you are building your life for maximum engagement maximum
passion and nothing will get in your way this is
non-negotiable this is what allows you to cut through all
the [ __ ] and there will be a lot
of [ __ ] there will be a lot of
excuses and limiting beliefs this is all par for the
course expect that it doesn't matter that you don't know
the details of how you're going to go about doing
this because all of that you will figure out along
the way it simply doesn't matter especially at this day
and age that we live in the 21st century with
the internet you have no excuses anymore all of the
information all of the knowledge all of the wisdom all
of the principles that you need to create this kind
of life are at your fingertips if not free then
for pennies and dollars you can get this stuff it's
not hard all of the world's books are at your
disposal you can find courses on anything you need you
can find workshops seminars conventions on any bit of information
you need any skills you need what makes this so
powerful and so hopeful is when you realize that really
literally nothing is stopping you there is nothing stopping you
from actualizing your life other than your own complacent complacency
and laziness and lack of focus and lack of discipline
that's really it that is the obstacle all other obstacles
are just offshoots of this you can find any resource
you need any knowledge any experience you lack you can
develop any skills you don't have you can build anything
you don't know you can find somebody who's already done
something similar and you can get their advice and work
off of their experience of course this requires you to
be very committed and very resourceful and go out there
and search for this stuff but if you're fully engaged
at a hundred percent with actualizing your full potential and
honoring this gift of your life then you'll do this
eagerly it won't even be a chore for you and
you will build your life piece by piece by piece
day after day week after week month after month year
after year you will build the skills you need you
will find the people you need you will read the
books you need you will find the videos you need
you'll listen to the podcasts you need you'll find the
experts you need all the fears you have it's okay
you'll tackle them one by one all the limiting beliefs
you have it's okay you'll tackle them one by one
and you'll bust them all nothing is preventing you from
from busting all of your limiting beliefs whatever obstacles you
have whether they're financial ones you can tackle those health
obstacles you can tackle many of those as well if
it's having the wrong people in your life you can
get rid of those people if it's about finding better
people adding better people to your life you can add
better people to your life but you have to be
fully engaged and you have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to get it done if it means
moving to a different city you move to a different
city if it means moving to a different country you
move to a different country and you don't make excuses
about it you see and that's the power of this
method is that ordinarily it's like when you want something
then there's usually a cost to it and then when
you hear the cost you're like oh well but that's
kind of inconvenient i don't want to do that but
when you're fully engaged you don't care what the cost
is you do it anyways and you you eagerly take
on the challenge of of facing all these obstacles and
paying all these costs in fact you're proactive about paying
the cost when you realize that i gotta move to
a different country in order to actualize my full potential
rather than saying like oh well but that's going to
be a problem and how am i going to live
there and i'm going to be far from my family
and all this stuff you don't think about that you
get excited about the prospect of i'm going to do
it i'm going to go through this challenge that's gonna
get me one step closer to what i need to
actualize my life and in a sense it's not even
an option in your mind you must do it because
you've already committed to being fully engaged with your life
and if this is necessary then it's necessary and you
this is just the next thing you gotta do and
in this way you will tackle every single obstacle that
comes your way and a lot of it is going
to be a deep introspection asking yourself honestly who do
i have to become to reach my full potential how
am i gonna have to change myself what kind of
fears do i have that need to be dropped or
faced what kind of limiting beliefs what kind of lack
of experience maybe you don't have enough public speaking experience
maybe you don't have enough socialization experience you feel deficient
in that area whatever area you feel deficient in maybe
you're deficient with finances maybe you're deficient to with sexuality
and that's holding you back you systematically go through all
of those and you fix all your deficiencies one by
one by one by one and what you have to
realize that nothing is preventing you from doing that all
of these problems can be solved within a vision clarity
focus and hard work and it is going to take
work you need to develop a work ethic this is
not possible what i'm talking about living a fully engaged
life is not possible without work ethic so that's a
bullet you're gonna have to bite and the way you
bite that bullet is just uh again if you're really
connected to the sacredness of your existence and your life
and this one opportunity you have then you're going to
be willing to work to honor it what does it
take to honor your life if that means you're gonna
have to wake up early and go to the gym
then that's what you're gonna do if that means you're
gonna have to go to the grocery store and buy
healthy vegetables to make smoothies in the morning or whatever
to give you the energy you need to power you
throughout the day then you go do that sometimes it's
going to be a grind but also as you practice
and do that you're going to you're going to start
to engage in activities which you actually enjoy doing it's
not all going to be a grind because in the
end the point is not to grind towards some achievement
that's not what i'm talking about here in the end
the point is to enjoy the process of building yourself
up to who you want to be in life that
should be an enjoyable process for the most part sometimes
it'll be a grind but the core of the work
you're going to be doing has to be built around
something you actually enjoy doing so what is that maybe
it's music maybe it's art maybe it's film making maybe
it's public speaking maybe it's writing maybe it's coding maybe
it's engineering maybe it's design work maybe it's dealing with
people if you're a very social sort of person extroverted
type of person then you actually enjoy dealing with people
personally for me dealing with people is is my my
idea of hell but hey i'm not a very people
person and you might be and that's okay what do
you actually enjoy doing the core of your work has
to be built around what you actually enjoy doing what
are you interested in what facets of reality fascinate you
deeply profoundly if it's music go into music if it's
film go into film if it's spirituality go into spirituality
if it's metaphysics go into metaphysics if it's philosophy go
into philosophy if it's engineering go into engineering if it's
computers go into computers if it's cartoons go into cartoons
if it's video games go into video games this is
actually very simple stuff our minds make it way too
complicated the blueprint for living an amazing life is not
complicated it's simple don't make it complicated don't get lost
in the distractions there's so many distractions the distractions will
confuse you and lead to a lack of clarity all
you really got to do is you got to find
the thing in life your most fascinated by and pursue
that find the thing that you really enjoy doing for
its own sake and pursue that if it's carpentry it's
carpentry and find a mate a way to make it
work to make it sustainable and keep doing that and
keep building on it and building on it and building
on it and become really good at that thing build
the skills this is going to take years build those
skills and keep building those skills both the technical skills
but also then the inner skills you need the psychology
you have to re-train your mind and your psychology in
order to allow you to be really good in that
field in that domain and keep investing in that over
and over and over again every day every week every
month every every year and keep doing that over decades
keep investing and investing and investing and investing in those
skills both the hard skills the technical skills and also
the soft skills we might say you're going to be
investing in the outer game and also in the inner
game the inner game is what my work can help
you with the most the inner game i mean working
on your psychology improving that removing limiting beliefs tackling shadow
stuff working on epistemology some metaphysical stuff some spiritual stuff
being more disciplined learning how to motivate yourself learning how
to let go of certain things facing fears and dealing
with fear dealing with anger dealing with emotional stuff emotional
mastery all of these will be crucial as a foundation
for with the outer game of the skills that you
will be developing in whatever career or craft that you
pursue and as you get better and better at that
craft that you're pursuing you're going to be able to
monetize it either for an employer for a boss or
as your own boss or as an entrepreneur or as
a small business or as a large business in a
corporate environment or in a non-corporate environment you're going to
start to be able to monetize that and then be
able to live off of that and pay your bills
with that at the highest level what this challenge of
life is really about and the reason it's an honoring
of your life is that you're not just going to
be developing a career or practicing a craft really what
you're going to be doing at a spiritual metaphysical level
is you're going to be finding some unique way to
fall in love with yourself with reality and then expressing
that love in your unique way that's really what we're
talking about here see there's only two options either you're
gonna love your life or you're not what do you
think it takes to love life that's a proactive endeavor
to love life to love life first of all begins
with looking around you and realizing how beautiful and amazing
it is just the baseline of existence itself you gotta
connect with that that's spirituality 101 is just not taking
the beauty of life for granted the beauty of life
is infinite it's literally infinite beauty now that's obscured by
all of the survival challenges and obstacles and problems i
get that life can be a pain in the ass
but you can't let all of that get in the
way of the core your core is the thing you
find most beautiful about life you find that you latch
onto it and you don't let that go for any
distractions and anytime you get distracted from it you bring
yourself back after you know within a day a week
at most you bring yourself back and ground yourself in
the core for example for me what i find most
beautiful about life and i mean i there's a lot
of things that are very beautiful about reality but for
me just and this is a bias this is my
bias my eccentricity you might say and and that's okay
because every finite human mind is going to have its
own eccentricities of what it finds most beautiful about life
that's worthwhile to pursue for me personally what it is
is the mind i find the mind to be the
most remarkable aspect of existence the fact that i can
think the fact that i can understand things the fact
that i can be intellectual that i can make sense
of reality this to me is the most magical and
amazing feature of reality i love that aspect of reality
i love the fact that i can think about reality
and actually figure [ __ ] out to me that's
a that's a quasi-mystical experience just that right there it's
amazing that that's even possible people take this for granted
it's amazing that you can even think it's so amazing
and then all the different ways in which you can
think and all the ways in which you can think
that are sort of twisted and distorted and corrupt and
the way the mind can can be biased the way
it can be prejudiced the way can become ideological and
dogmatic the way it can be closed or open the
way it can create cults and ideologies and various toxic
forms of belief and the ways that it can have
genuine insight into the nature of things the way it
can be wrong the way it can be right the
way that it tricks itself all of these games that
it plays with itself to me this is the most
fascinating aspect of my existence it's messy it's complicated it's
difficult to figure out it's like a infinite puzzle this
labyrinth of the mind and i just love exploring it
i love it purely for its own sake i love
it uh at an aesthetic level i love the aesthetics
of mind just the patterns and the ways in which
it behaves the way it twists and turns to me
that's beautiful like a person might see a beautiful sunset
or a beautiful mountain range and you might look at
that and say wow that's amazing or you might see
an animal like a really close-up macro photograph of some
insect a butterfly or something you might say wow that's
amazing look at the structure of that that's amazing and
if you really love that butterfly and the whole idea
of studying insects then you should probably become a biologist
or someone who studies insects for a living you should
be out in the amazon discovering new insects and studying
them under the microscope if that's what you really find
most fascinating about reality but see for for me the
thing i find most fascinating is not insects or dinosaur
bones as cool as that is i love those things
um or mountains or trees or looking up at the
stars and looking up at photographs of of planets i
mean as as amazing and magical as all those things
are all of that pales in comparison to the magic
of the mind i can appreciate the functions of my
mind in the same way that a connoisseur can appreciate
the different kinds of line or tasting different kinds of
food from around the world different cuisines there are these
shows that were pie i don't know if they're still
popular but there were these shows that were popular some
years back where this guy would just travel around the
world and taste different cuisines and he would deliberately go
out of his way to taste like weird cuisines sometimes
it was disgusting stuff you know for shock value but
sometimes it's just just very sort of alien different types
of foods that normally you wouldn't eat and just exploring
that see and if you if you have that sort
of love for that then you go and do that
and then your life becomes something you love well for
me that's how mind is that's my attitude towards mind
i love the aesthetics of it in the same way
that you might go to an art gallery and just
look at a van gogh or at a monet and
just kind of compare them and marvel at them and
look at the brush strokes and you know think about
what did the artist mean when he drew this and
uh and what kind of composition and use of colors
and light and structure and lines and geometry was used
there you know the way an art historian might study
that kind of stuff and you know if you enjoy
that then go become an art historian or become an
artist become a picasso to me i appreciate the aesthetics
of mind in that way and i love the fact
that mind is so abstract and intangible that in fact
makes it more interest all the more interesting to me
now that's not the only thing i like or that
i'm fascinated by within reality but it's uh it's my
eccentricity and so i've devoted my life to exploring mind
because see someone in the universe has to explore mind
or it will go unexplored i mean think about it
mind what is mind you don't even know what mind
is you're using mind all the time you're thinking you're
imagining you're conscious of things you're subscribing to various beliefs
and ideologies but most people don't appreciate the aesthetics of
that they only care about mind as a means for
so some sort of other end like how can i
use my mind to manipulate somebody to get something but
that's not what mind is to me to mind i'm
not to me i'm not interested in how i can
use the mind to achieve some goal to me the
exploration of the mind is the goal it's an end
in itself the pleasure comes from not achieving something with
the mind the pleasure comes from exploring the mind and
appreciating its beauty for its own sake in the same
way that when you're a connoisseur of wine you sipping
the wine is not done towards some other end you're
not sipping the wine to get drunk to then reach
some sort of party state and to have fun with
your friends that's not why you're drinking the wine see
that's that's why most people drink alcohol is to get
drunk and then maybe to go get laid or something
and to have fun at a party you're drinking the
wine because you actually appreciate the wine to you the
wine is the end likewise when you're an artist you're
a true artist to you it's not about making a
painting to sell as many copies as you can to
become as rich as you can so you can live
in a mansion that's not that's not a true artist
a true artist is in it for the the process
of making the art exploring the domain of art whatever
art form you're exploring whether it's sculpture or architecture or
painting you want to explore that art form for its
own sake because you find that to be most interesting
and beautiful now be careful here because even though i'm
sort of confessing to you my own passion for life
uh you have to be careful that i'm i'm only
putting this out there as an example my love for
the aesthetics of mine i'm only putting this out as
an example i'm not saying that you should now go
copy me and that's the danger with giving you this
example because now many of you will be tempted to
just say oh well i i want to do what
leo's doing no you got to find what that thing
is for you and this takes a a real honesty
you got to be real honest with yourself what it
is about reality that you find fascinating do you find
mind fascinating maybe you do maybe you don't there's really
no reason why you should or shouldn't and so you
got to explore reality broadly enough to find something that
you really are fascinated by by deeply that you're going
to be willing to devote your life to to building
skills in to practicing and you actually enjoy practicing that
like for me i enjoy exploring mind it gives me
deep pleasure doing that which is one of the reasons
why it's so difficult for me to meditate it's a
double-edged sword and of course your passions will be a
double-edged sword no matter what your passion is but see
you gotta find that for yourself now one of the
challenges with finding that is that you might simply lack
experience you might have experienced so little of life that
you simply haven't stumbled upon the thing that you would
really fall in love with it's almost like if you
only sleep with three people in your life what are
the chances you're actually going to stumble upon your dream
person that you really fall in love with the chances
are slim if you sleep with 50 people the chances
are much higher now i'm not saying you should go
out necessarily and sleep with 50 people that's just an
example but likewise you want to stick your nose in
enough things in life that you have a relatively good
sampling it's almost like going to a buffet you go
to a buffet and you don't stick to three dishes
the whole point of a buffet the beauty of a
buffet is that you get to sample a lot of
different stuff until you find something you really fall in
love with and then you go hog wild on that
thing and you just get a couple of full plates
of that that thing whatever that is for you lobsters
crabs steak bacon you know that's how buffet works and
that's really what life is it's a it's a love
buffet so one of the mistakes people make is that
they simply don't have enough broad experience testing different stuff
that they can actually make a informed selection so you
need to so if you're stuck in that place and
if you're very young you know the younger you are
the less experienced you have so if you're really young
the way that you can catalyze this process and speed
it up is start to like i've talked about in
the in my previous episode about um exposing yourself to
massive experience right that that episode you want to expose
yourself more and more to experience as much as you
can this means practical things like traveling reading more books
going to conventions talking to different kinds of people living
in different parts of the world doing lots of research
online you know you want to expose yourself to as
much experience as possible so you can stumble upon something
that you really enjoy also running through many hobbies you
know try different stuff try doing some mechanical stuff like
for example when i was younger i would i was
interested in in like rc cars rc helicopters you know
sort of like sort of the kind of stuff they
sell at the classic hobby stores i would build helicopters
i would build remote control cars and um things like
that sort of mechanical engineering type stuff i was interested
in that uh so you know try that kind of
stuff or maybe go and actually like maybe if you're
interested in dinosaurs go actually go travel to a place
where you maybe can actually dig up some dinosaur bones
see what that's like i remember when i when i
was younger i became interested in meteorites i actually then
made a trip me and my brother we i convinced
my brother to take a trip to the mojave desert
in california to a salt lake bed where we actually
walked around in the middle of a you know triple
digit weather uh it was ridiculously hot in the summer
but we went out there anyways in the middle of
this you know in the desert walking around searching for
meteorites which you can do on salt lake beds that's
one of the best places to find them i didn't
actually find any pretty difficult to find but you know
that was an experience and so by sticking your nose
into a lot of different stuff you get a sense
of what resonates with you and what doesn't and you
keep using that to refine your sense of what you
really want to commit your life to you keep testing
the waters like at a buffet keep testing testing testing
different dishes and then you you stumble upon something and
then you go all in on that and hey you
might be wrong maybe that's not going to be your
ultimate pursuit but this is not about perfection this is
just about you're incrementally inching your way closer and closer
right uh the way you live life is it's not
like a like a sniper shot where you take a
careful aim at the target you want and you just
shoot you know right between the eyes that's not how
life works it's more like a homing missile the homing
missile adjusts its orientation no matter where it is it's
always adjusting towards the target a little bit a little
bit a little bit and eventually it reaches the goal
and that's how you're going to do it it's more
of an improvisational technique than it is some sort of
deliberate plan because when you start out in life you're
going to be totally ignorant you're so ignorant when you
are born you don't even know what you like and
what you don't like you have to discover that and
so part of what this is is it's a self-discovery
process it's a giant life is a giant process of
self-discovery you're discovering the way in which you want to
honor and to love life how do you want to
fall in love with life and what is it going
to look like you're falling in love with life what
is it going to look like to manifest that because
see first in a sense you kind of fall in
love with life or some facet of life and then
you're going to be working to deepen that love by
working on that thing you're deepening your love for it
every time you work on it and then you deepen
it and deepen it and deepen it and then as
you develop skills and proficiency in that you're going to
want to share your creative inventions and constructions with others
for the benefit of others and to help them to
see the beauty of that aspect of life so for
example maybe you're fascinated by industrial design and what you
really like is you like to design cars you know
the shapes of cars maybe you're really fascinated by that
and so you go into that and you study the
[ __ ] out of the different shapes of cars
and you you start making the most beautiful shapes of
cars that have ever been made and then you you're
excited to share that with others to have your designs
driving on the road by the millions seen by millions
of people having other people appreciate your designs and then
you work towards making yourself the best at that what
do you got to do to train yourself to do
that really well this is ultimately how you stay motivated
and engaged with life you have to connect it with
love stop treating love of life as a luxury like
oh well leo yeah you're talking about love but i
mean i just got to pay my electric bill i
just got to feed my kids i don't have time
to worry about what i love about life this is
idiocy this sort of attitude if you truly fell in
love with life and you had a focus and you
were engaged and motivated and that allowed you to be
disciplined and focused and actually building skills and being highly
creative and excellent at what you do developing mastery in
something you wouldn't have any problem paying your electric bills
or feeding your children the reason you can't feed your
children and pay your electric bills is because you haven't
done what i've talked about because you're complacent and you're
just following the path of least resistance and you're not
really engaged with life therefore you struggle to even wake
up in the morning and go to work and the
work you go to is some menial dead-end job some
form of wage slavery where they bear you barely pay
you enough to pay your rent and you don't even
have enough bargaining power to change that because you haven't
developed any serious skills that would provide amazing value to
the world you see to provide amazing value to the
world you need to be able to create create amazing
things to create amazing things you have to be in
love with what you're creating are you in love with
serving coffee at starbucks are you in love with packing
groceries into bags at the grocery store are you in
love with taking people's money at the cashier stand where
you work are you in love with serving people food
if you're a waiter well if you're not in love
with those things and yet you're doing those things eight
hours a day for the majority of your life decade
after decade how can you love your life you can't
love your life you can't be engaged with your work
and therefore your work is going to be mediocre at
best and it's going to be a waste of life
and deep down you're going to know it's a waste
of life to honor your life means that you make
it your non-negotiable duty to find what you love most
about life and to do that thing on a regular
basis no excuses this is not a luxury this is
the backbone for your entire life and if you take
that attitude eventually you will succeed in this to honor
your life is to fall in love with reality in
your unique way see the beauty of what reality is
as a system at a metaphysical and spiritual level is
that reality is an infinite singularity of love which manifests
itself in a infinite diversity of form infinite forms of
animals and inanimate objects and mechanical objects and computers and
arts and music and film and everything stars and planets
and rocks and mountains and rivers and underwater areas and
caves and virtual worlds and video games and virtual reality
and different kinds of businesses all of that it's an
infinite multiplicity contained as a singular whole and it's designed
in such a way that you get to participate in
that infinite multiplicity in your preferred way because by virtue
of you being a finite incarnated in a finite body
and mind as you are as this human form for
the duration of this particular life you have uh you're
gonna naturally have certain inclinations and aversions and certain biases
now in certain ways your biases can be problematic but
in other ways your biases are necessary as part of
your finite form just by virtue of you being finite
you're going to have certain biases that are necessary to
maintain that and and that's okay now if you want
you can shed all of your biases you can become
completely infinite and you can experience love at the absolute
level if you want to love the entirety of the
multiplicity you can do that that would be the ultimate
pursuit of spiritual awakening but that's not necessary per se
you can the beauty of reality is that you can
it is designed in such a way that you can
do that if you want but you don't have to
you can also enjoy and appreciate life in a more
finite way which is maybe all that you're up for
in this life you can become an artist and just
paint and just appreciate painting and fall in love with
painting and just appreciate that facet of the infinite multiplicity
because you see there are trade-offs between loving reality at
sort of the big picture level versus at the small
finite level because at the biggest picture level when you
completely zoom out of reality all form collapses and disappears
and so your love becomes completely metaphysical and abstract it's
a pure abstract love it's a love that's so abstract
that it can't even separate into forms like you can't
really appreciate a picasso painting at that level because the
painting can't even materialize because everything is so unified into
just an infinite nothingness if you want to appreciate a
picasso painting you got to incarnate as a human to
look at that picasso painting and appreciate it and also
there had to be a finite picasso to create that
finite painting a painting is a finite thing you can
appreciate beauty in its finite form and also in its
infinite form and so in a sense what the universe
is doing is it's incarnating from that purely abstract pure
infinity it's incarnating to appreciate itself in the fine details
in the minutia of what infinity means which is all
the finite forms it's sort of like white light which
contains all the different colors of light is being polarized
through a prism into the different colors and then the
different colors are being able to appreciate themselves like the
color blue gets to say oh look look how lovely
blue is blue is an amazing color and the color
yellow says but i'm amazing too that's a beautiful color
too and then orange says but i'm beautiful too and
then the color red says i'm beautiful too and so
all of them are beautiful in their own unique way
and so if you want you can fall in love
with one particular color or if you want if you
want to be super like mystical you can you can
recollect all the colors back into their pure white light
and then you can love that you can love them
all simultaneously to the point where they even disappear because
what you love is you just love the white light
you love the potential more than you love the particular
forms of individual colors you just love the potential before
it's even been polarized see that would be like the
godhead loving the godhead existing as the godhead but see
the universe takes both forms the universe loves itself in
its pure form uh the non-polarized form and then the
universe polarizes self-conscious polarizes itself in its full multiplicity and
diversity and then it marvels at that or it gets
it gets horrified as that too you know i mean
the universe incarnates itself as you know genocide and slavery
and racism and all that nasty stuff that we generally
don't like and you know and then the universe appreciates
that too people who are racists they love racism they
love their racism people who do genocide they love genocide
people who are warmongers they love their war now from
a human perspective we say that's kind of twisted and
weird and dysfunctional but hey you know who are we
to judge the universe for what it it likes the
universe loves all of itself so there's going to be
people who love all aspects of reality even the most
twisted dark corners of it now i'm not suggesting you
go in that direction but uh you know find something
positive and constructive in the universe and then fall in
love with it you can also do both you can
you can sort of reach up towards the godhead and
experience that a bit and then you can still fall
in love with some specific feature of of reality maybe
it's martial arts maybe that's your thing maybe it's mma
maybe it's um hunting maybe it's fishing maybe it's treasure
hunting maybe it's hunting for dinosaurs maybe it's history maybe
it's living outdoors maybe it's being a farmer maybe it's
science you see this is instinctively what the most successful
humans are doing and the most happy humans the most
passionate humans they're doing what i'm talking about instinctively but
they're doing it implicitly they're not conscious of what they're
doing if you do what i'm saying consciously you can
do it much more effectively and it can take on
a much deeper spiritual dimension so most people are falling
in love with certain aspects of reality but they don't
connect that to any kind of deeper spiritual notion of
love they just sort of pursue their instincts in an
animal like fashion and they become successful at it they
make good money at it they build certain skills in
it but it's still limited they're not fully realizing the
majesty of what reality is and what it offers see
reality offers this to you it's the greatest gift but
it's the kind of gift that you have to work
you have to work at it you have to invest
in it over months and years because it's a mature
sort of gift it's a complex gift it's not a
kind of gift that you just open it and there
it is for you it's the kind of gift that
like it's like a very complicated piece of furniture you
bring it back home you unbox it and then it's
all in pieces you got to assemble it you got
to assemble your life and then your life project is
assembling this piece of furniture that eventually once you assemble
it piece by piece by piece more of the love
and beauty of it is revealed to you and then
finally when you assemble the entire thing you realize that
the entire process was just a process of you uh
falling in love with this object that you've been building
and the reason that it's so challenging is precisely because
it's so open-ended it's radically open-ended see most people this
is an uh video game analogy we're going to use
uh you know there's two types of video games there's
sandbox games and then there's very linear games which have
a defined story and you just go through a linear
path it's completely linear you go from a to b
to c to d and you have no no branching
choices these kinds of video games are really designed for
for sheep gamers because they require the least effort these
are the most casual kinds of games they require the
least investment the least vision you just go down corridor
after corridor after corridor just going through the motions and
these kinds of games are the least rewarding the other
kind of games which are more for hardcore players are
sandbox games like a sim city sort of game where
there's no clear objective you can do whatever you want
you can build whatever you want there's no need to
build anything there's no need to go in any particular
direction or achieve any particular goal explore do whatever you
want have fun however you want but these sorts of
games to get the most out of them requires that
you bring your own meaning to the game you set
your own goals you define your own objectives you have
to have some kind of vision there's a inherent trade-off
there when your game is very linear it tends to
go only one way for everybody everybody has the same
kind of experience it's not very diverse also these games
aren't highly replayable you played it once you don't want
to play it again because you're just going to go
through the same thing all over again the same cut
scenes all the same obstacles all the same bosses it's
not interesting how much more interesting is it to replay
that game but this time you're going in you know
before you went north now you're going south and it's
a totally different area with totally different monsters totally different
loot all in different characters different stories different cutscenes that's
the kind of game you can play over and over
again well life is an infinitely replayable game it's the
ultimate infinite sandbox game completely open-ended this is the beauty
and intelligence of the design the trade-off though is that
because it's so infinitely open-ended there's nobody telling you what
you should do if you don't create your own meaning
and your own objectives your own vision what's gonna happen
is you're just going to go around in circles and
your life is gonna feel fairly meaningless and hollow and
you're gonna tap into only one percent of what life
has to offer there's gonna be so much you don't
explore and you're not gonna experience the fuel the full
infinite beauty of what life has to offer because to
experience that you you have to bring that intention into
it and it becomes easy to get distracted because different
people are doing different things and a lot of people
in society and in the media are doing stupid things
and they've turned their existence in just into just a
rat race some sort of mechanical grinding thing or the
pursuit of some some material never-ending material chase for things
or for pleasure or just even avoiding suffering that's what
their life becomes about just minimizing suffering can you imagine
that of course you're depressed if you're living your life
just to minimize suffering every day then you're constantly just
thinking about suffering even if you have a little bit
of suffering you're still thinking about suffering the way to
endure suffering is to have some sort of higher thing
that you're more passionate about such that you can ignore
the suffering and so other humans have actually built corridors
into this open world game that is life they've built
corridors that they corral people down like cattle and you
know why they do that because it earns them money
and if you're complacent and you're not going to be
on your own path having your own vision your own
plan your own direction for your life and you're not
going to be very hyper focused and instead you're going
to be letting others manipulate you and tell you what
to do and persuade you and influence you too much
then you're going to be going down their corridors and
their corridors have basically been turned into monetization schemes and
machines whether it's the university system or academia or science
or the corporate world or orthodox religion these are all
channels designed by others for enhancing their own survival at
your expense and what they do is they allow you
to live a sort of easy life like for example
if you go into orthodox religion you don't have to
think very hard you have to be original you have
to be creative you don't have to truly explore the
spiritual domain of of reality you just go by their
rules go to church on time show up at the
right time the right date that they tell you to
show up on it's very robotic and mechanical and it
gives you a little bit of a sense of direction
it's almost like it's a certain game that you can
play but it's a very it's a very weak way
to play a game if you wanted to you could
construct your own pathway towards exploring the spiritual dimensions of
reality which don't rely upon showing up at a certain
place at a certain time and following certain rituals that
somebody else has designed for you but that follows your
own heart and your own interests that is more aligned
with your values and strengths and interests and that would
be a much more powerful way to explore spirituality but
that would require in some serious work and focus and
vision and investment because you have to build that out
for yourself rather than just using this channel that has
been built out for you and these channels because they're
built to accommodate masses of people they're built for the
lowest common denominator so you're sacrificing depth for breath and
to me the most amazing aspect of reality is how
infinitely deep it goes and that's what's beautiful about open-ended
games sandbox games is the depth and complexity they have
whereas the sort of linear corridor shooters they're they're very
simple their simplicity makes them less rewarding so see somewhere
along the way you got trapped into you got channeled
into some of these uh corridors these narrow pathways through
life and uh and that that has robbed you of
of living authentically to yourself and that has robbed you
of engagement and passion and love because chances are you're
not in love with that corridor that you're that you're
walking down because that corridor really wasn't built to accommodate
and to make your own love flower it was built
to accommodate masses and to earn money from them and
just to maybe help them survive a little bit in
order to enrich the people who built the corridors and
help them survive a little bit and so what's crucial
for living life your highest potential is that you have
to become very independent in your thinking and in the
way you construct your life you have to really customize
life to yourself but that takes more work that takes
vision clarity focus that that takes a self-exploration because if
you don't explore yourself how can you know how to
customize your life to suit yourself so it takes a
lot of maturity and again seriousness in order to fully
plumb the potential of life life is designed in such
a way that it's really designed for those who want
to go deep those are the ones who will who
will get the design and appreciate his beauty those who
are just coasting by and are doing the bare minimum
to them life will be lost on them they'll live
for 70 years and at the end of it they'll
just ask well what was all that about seemed kind
of meaningless kind of pointless is that all there is
to life i did some stuff i had sex with
some people i had some children i had i went
to work for 40 years i did some of this
stuff i ate some good food but then is that
it that's all there is to life it's kind of
meaningless kind of lame and it never even occurs to
them that they've only experienced one percent of what life
had to offer because they were never serious about it
life is like a gold mine you have to you
have to mine deep to get the gold the gold
is is deep underground and when you realize that and
then you commit your life to digging deeper and deeper
and deeper every day because you know if you spend
the next 10 20 years digging deep eventually you're gonna
hit the mother lode and then that mother lode will
keep paying dividends for the rest of your life and
then you're gonna keep even digging deeper and deeper and
it's just gonna get better and better and better and
better and the beauty of all this is that literally
nobody is stopping you by yourself it's your own complacency
and disconnection from love your own negative beliefs and habits
and things that is stopping you your own lack of
vision that's what's so hopeful about all this you have
nothing to be depressed about you can start turning your
life around right now whatever has happened in the past
has happened it doesn't matter now that you have this
information now that you understand the big picture of how
to create an engaged life you can begin doing that
today tomorrow and nothing will stop you as long as
you're completely committed to this process you're going to have
a lot of failure along the way i'm not saying
it's going to be easy i'm not saying it's all
going to be success from here on out you're going
to have a lot of failure it doesn't matter your
commitment your willingness to work at it your willingness to
pay the cost is all it really takes and then
you'll see you're going to feel good about your life
even if you don't achieve anything yet per se it
might take you five or ten years to actually achieve
something from that it doesn't really matter you're going to
feel positive and hopeful because you're so committed to this
process you need to have a faith in this as
a this is these are these are deep principles of
life we're talking about here you can bank on these
principles you have to trust in these principles now you
might wonder well leo how do i know that these
principles are valid well course the only way you can
know is by exploring it for yourself and verifying it
for yourself i'm sharing with you my own discoveries from
having lived life and studied it if you want you
can study you can read books you can cross-reference what
i say with what other people say you can try
to make sense of things but ultimately the way you're
going to know is by doing it and trying it
life is a beautiful thing when it's lived according to
principles the right principles and life becomes really shitty when
you're not living according to principles i've shared many of
the principles in the past i have videos about that
i've shared some principles here as well for example one
principle is that the pursuit of love for reality is
not a luxury it is the core it is essential
it is crucial without it you're lost that's one principle
you take that principle and now you build your whole
life around that principle this is an eternal principle it
has always been true for humans and it always will
be true for humans another principle is work ethic you
cannot have a great life without developing work ethic when
you realize that then you're going to do whatever it
takes to develop the work ethic it doesn't matter if
you've been lazy in the past or if you don't
know how to build a work ethic it doesn't matter
when you realize the principle that either i develop a
work ethic strong work ethic or i will have a
shitty life you only have one option at that point
which is to develop a work ethic no matter what
you're going to go read the books struggle through whatever
practices you need to build the habits you need to
eventually develop that work ethic another principle is facing your
fears because fear is the opposite of love and if
you're going to pursue deep love your primary obstacle is
going to be various sorts of fears that you have
and you've got many of them and those fears need
to be faced head-on and conquered and it's the conquering
of those fears that makes life rewarding and that makes
the love deeper another principle of life is that you're
going to get what you put into it i've said
that in the past so when you realize that now
you become excited about investing every single day into your
life and you invest and invest and invest and invest
more and more and more it builds upon itself like
a snowball and then it starts paying more and more
dividends and the earlier you start to do that it
has compounding returns just like in the stock market another
principle is to be constructive rather than destructive that's a
topic i'll i'll address in the future by itself it's
a very important topic but a lot of people get
mired in criticism judgment debates ideological arguments try to debunk
others trying to troll others attacking others doing violence to
others i mean probably half of the world's energy is
wasted on destructive activities it can be very seductive when
you have no better constructive plan or vision then destruction
is the only joy the ego gets and it's much
easier to destroy a thing than to construct something beautiful
but if you've got a clear sense of what you
love and what you're going to be doing you have
a clear vision then you can get very constructive about
it and you just you ignore all the destructive stuff
you eliminate all the destructive stuff from your life all
the criticism all the trolling all the attacking all the
demonizing and you just focus on being constructive all the
time and you fall in love with being constructive the
act of being creative creativity is one of the greatest
joys of life it's a question of how do you
want to be creative because reality is infinite creativity there
are many other principles i won't articulate them all here
i'd have to sit down and think deep about them
to make a long list and i have done some
of that in the past and probably will do more
of that in the future but you get the point
but these principles you gotta you gotta contemplate them and
think about them deeply until you really they penetrate into
your mind you really get their significance that's when it
starts to transform you it transforms you and see these
principles they can't just become beliefs in dogma you have
to sort of derive them or at the very least
you have to think through them enough to see why
they work or how they how they will play out
in your life and then when you do that then
you get interested in in obeying those principles and of
course you're gonna fall off track with with following these
principles many times but you bring yourself back and back
and back and back and it's a sort of discipline
of bringing yourself back to the to the principles to
the principles to the principles every time you fall off
you bring yourself back until you ingrain them very deeply
into your psyche and then they will shape your life
and they will make your life easier then when your
friends tell you to hey let's go party and go
drinking and binge drinking and this sort of stuff or
doing drugs you tell them no because i'm sticking to
a certain principle i'm going to get much more pleasure
out of the creative work that i'm doing the life
that i'm building than i will from one night of
binge drinking so i'm gonna go back to bed early
today so tomorrow i can wake up in the morning
and get back to work on my creative pursuits and
building the kind of life that i want or i'm
gonna rather than go binge drinking i'm gonna sit and
meditate or do my yoga practice and when your friend
comes to you and starts to criticize somebody and starts
saying a bunch of negative and destructive stuff and starts
telling you to join him in his destructive activities you're
going to say no i'm not interested in that because
my life is about being constructive i'm pursuing creative endeavors
that i love and i'm just going to keep my
eye on that prize on the ball and i'm not
going to engage in your destructive trolling criticizing ideological activities
because i got something higher to live for i'm not
going to dishonor my life and the universe by engaging
that kind of nonsense and by doing that over and
over and over again in your life and instilling these
principles in yourself that's when your life starts to then
become amazing after years of doing that after years of
building your foundation this is what creates healthy meaning in
your life a healthy purpose it's not complicated it's pretty
simple but are you going to do it this is
an intervention this can be a turning point for the
rest of your life what you do from the end
of this recording what action you decide to take or
not take this is going to determine the entire trajectory
of your life whether you're going to have a great
life or you're going to have a miserable life and
nothing i say here matters unless you take action these
ideas need to penetrate into your mind so deeply that
then you are excited to take action tomorrow morning on
these ideas and you don't just forget them the next
day and you don't just do it for one day
but you do it for two days three days for
weeks and months and years and really for the rest
of your life that's how deep these ideas need to
penetrate into your mind and you need to start taking
action on them immediately stop procrastinating stop waiting stop expecting
some perfect opportunity to open up start taking action towards
your goal don't delay even if you're stuck in some
situation let's say you're stuck at a certain job you're
stuck in a certain family situation you're stuck in a
certain country it doesn't matter there are things you can
do starting tomorrow baby steps to start inching your way
towards what i'm talking about maybe you can't quit your
job yet but you can start making plans for how
you can upgrade your job maybe you can start looking
for better jobs maybe you can start taking courses at
night on the weekends online to develop skills so that
in a few years you could quit this job you're
stuck in and then you'll be more free to pursue
the things i'm talking about that's enough maybe right now
you're stuck in some third world country or in some
bad family situation and it's gonna take you a few
years to get out of that that's okay you can
still take action towards the things i'm talking about you
can go buy some books start reading those books start
creating a plan start creating a vision start a commonplace
book maybe start saving up money that you're going to
need for when you do get out of that situation
as you begin this long-term process of investing in yourself
you're going to get more engaged it takes a while
for the snowball to gather enough inertia and and mass
as it's rolling downhill when it first starts it's small
you don't feel it it takes some months and years
for it to really accumulate and to be felt and
so you're gonna have to go through that initial period
of not much stuff is visible there's not much results
yet you're not feeling a lot of payoff or return
or dividend yet and you keep investing and investing and
investing and this is what most people do not do
it takes a long time horizon it takes patience and
the thing that holds you over in the meantime is
your trust in the principles if the principles seem sound
to you in your mind then you owe it to
those principles to follow up on those principles and to
test them out and the more you invest in yourself
the more you start to love yourself and love your
life the better you want to be the more reason
you have not to engage in shallow low consciousness activities
the more reason you have to maintain your health not
to get involved with drugs not to get involved with
drinking or smoking not to get involved with various kinds
of wasteful activities like watching a bunch of television and
then your life becomes more interesting [Music] because you're actually
working towards something there's now an overarching ark to your
life now your life starts to take on some meaning
and purpose that's beyond survival because you're actually living for
something beyond survival you're no longer just doing the easiest
thing you're no longer just doing what everybody else is
doing now you've taken responsibility and ownership over your own
life and you're planning it out according to you now
there's a reason to contemplate to introspect to journal there's
a reason to read books there's a reason to educate
yourself there's a reason to go to seminars and to
talk to interesting people to expose yourself to more experiences
because all of those can give you the resources and
little tidbits you need in order to develop this larger
vision that you're working towards and now you're engaged and
now you're motivated and then to really take this to
the next level is that you combine that with your
study and pursuit of spiritual work such that you weave
together your creative pursuits whatever that is your career with
your spiritual practice together so that they inform each other
and work synergistically together such that you can infuse your
spiritual insights and the love you get from that practice
into the work that you do with people or with
whatever you're doing however you're working and of course you
don't want to fool yourself into thinking that what you're
doing has any kind of ultimate meaning or ultimate purpose
it doesn't it's a game it's a sandbox game and
that's what your spiritual pursuits will help you to keep
in mind is that you don't want to you don't
want to take your creative pursuits too seriously you have
to realize that it's just a temporary game you're playing
it's one way of expressing your love for reality out
of many other ways you're exploring some corner of reality
and you don't want to get too attached to that
as some end-all be-all thing and you should be willing
to let it go at any time because in the
end what's the difference between one corner of reality and
another corner of reality nothing other than your biases and
eccentricities so it's a bit paradoxical because you work so
hard you're going to work your ass off in this
pursuit but at the same time even though you're working
so hard you realize that it's just a game that
you're playing with yourself and that you don't want to
take it too seriously you don't want to confuse that
limited creative pursuit that you're doing with the sum total
of reality itself and your spiritual practice will help to
keep that in check so this is the mistake that
many creative and successful people make is that they get
so locked into their career that and they have no
spiritual practice that they just take that as all of
life and then that becomes dysfunctional they become either workaholics
or they then have a very narrow view of life
and reality only through the lens of their career like
for example someone becomes a scientist and they think that
that's how reality is is just they're looking at reality
through the lens of materialist science or reduction of science
or mathematics or physics because their physics and their mathematics
is not grounded in some sort of deeper spiritual understanding
and practice and so there's this paradox that even though
you're working on your life purpose and you're constructing this
meaning in the back of your mind you understand that
all meanings are constructed and they're not really true that
it's just an illusion and so you might wonder like
well why would i work so hard for an illusion
well what else is there to do it doesn't bother
you when you're watching a movie that it's an illusion
you enjoy it anyways it doesn't bother you when you
bother you when you're playing a game that you know
you're playing monopoly does the monopoly money have any real
world value no does it matter if you get a
monopoly or not no doesn't matter how many properties you
own no you enjoy the game of monopoly and when
you play the game monopoly you take it seriously you
play it as if it's real as if it matters
as if the money matters but in the back of
your mind you you always keep in mind that it's
just a game and it's there for entertainment this keeps
you in the proper perspective this is what a lot
of people lack who are successful and artistic and creative
they forget it's a game they forget that science is
a game and that all those are limited and that
really the game the true game is unlimited so enjoy
that game maybe the next lifetime you'll play a different
game also appreciate that different people are playing different games
that's fine don't expect everyone to be playing your game
[Music] some people play the game of being a rapist
that's their game or they play a game of being
a racist that's their game the universe is playing every
possible game it's an infinite game and when all the
games have been played that's how the universe realizes what
it is infinity every possible game every possible creative act
every possible way to love every possible form of love
and it's using this particular lifetime in order to love
itself in this particular way in which you're going to
love or if you choose not to if you choose
to just slack off and take the path of least
resistance then the universe will experience that disconnection from love
and that too is this sort of form of love
you know the lack of love is also a sort
of love and that is that but are you going
to do anything about it are you going to actually
take action on this i'm sick of seeing people who
watch my content just endlessly mentally masturbating about these ideas
without actually taking action if you're not taking action you're
not actually honoring your life and you're dishonoring these ideas
force yourself to take action force yourself to take right
action right action is action according to the principles that
we discuss that we intuit as being correct for living
the good life don't make it optional don't make it
optional to live the good life don't make it optional
to be engaged and passionate in your life don't make
it optional to love don't make it optional to self-actualize
don't make it optional to grow don't make it optional
to achieve your full potential don't make it optional to
honor your life every day don't make it optional to
be spiritually connected to existence make these the core of
your life and at first it's going to be difficult
but just push yourself as best as you can and
force yourself to act in alignment with these principles that
you know you intuit are going to work for you
and just keep doing that keep chipping away at it
i'm not asking you to be perfect about it you're
going to procrastinate here and there you're going to screw
up you're going to be lazy certain days you're going
to have failures that's okay just keep pushing and pushing
gently at first it's like rolling a snowball downhill like
just a little bit each day a little bit a
little bit keep telling yourself that it's going to add
up to something big it's going to add up to
something we can keep pushing a little bit a little
bit a little bit a little bit keep doing that
keep doing that keep taking action notice how your mind
tricks you into not taking action and take action notice
the distractions don't allow yourself to go to the distractions
focus keep your eye on the ball and before you
know it you're going to start living the good life
this is it it's not complicated don't make it overly
complicated but you have to actually do the things i'm
talking about you have to practice this if you don't
you're going to become even more miserable than you were
before you listened to me that's when one of the
burdens of becoming more aware see the the information i
share with you makes you more aware of your potentials
and possibilities in life and as you become aware of
these things but you don't take any action on it
then you become aware of what you're missing because i'm
talking every week about cool stuff that i'm experiencing or
you could be experiencing and you're not experiencing it and
then you feel bad about it and then you start
wondering well how do i experience and you keep mentally
masturbating about these ideas for years and you don't take
any action and then you're still left nowhere so don't
get caught in that trap as soon as you start
taking action you're going to feel better notice this you
don't need to achieve the end result to feel better
you will start to feel better as soon as you
start taking action towards these things and that's it just
just discipline yourself to to follow these practices surrender yourself
to the principles and to the practices and just start
doing them and that's it you don't need to make
this very complicated or very difficult or very painful just
it all really begins with making 100 commitment to living
an engaged life a passionate life refuse to live a
passionless life just refuse and then allow the actions to
happen that are necessary in order to not live a
passionless life it's not complicated but you do have to
disengage from some of the harmful and distracting and destructive
social activities that you're immersed in it could be media
it could be tv it could be the wrong kind
of food that you eat it could be your family
situation it could be your the friends you hang out
with it could be your trolling on online forums or
wherever you hang out online you're gonna have to channel
your energy into something creative and constructive and this may
feel lonely at first because you know it's fun to
go on a forum and to troll for a few
hours with all your troll friends your ego gets some
satisfaction from that whereas whereas disengaging from that and going
and sitting in a room alone by yourself and working
on your writing skills or working on your artistic skills
or reading a book or meditating this this can feel
lonely because you're doing it by yourself nobody's there with
you no one's cheerleading you you have to cheerlead yourself
in that process and no one's going to force you
to do it either you're going to discipline yourself to
do it or it won't get done but i don't
want you to feel bad if you feel like leo
what you're saying sounds good and i and i into
that it's right but i just can't i don't know
you know i don't know how to i can't follow
through with it you might say you know i've tried
in the past and it hasn't worked and i just
keep falling off track i get distracted so easily i
can't focus what do i do it doesn't matter first
of all how many times you failed in the past
all that matters is how many times you're going to
keep trying so keep trying keep trying keep trying and
what you'll notice is if you keep trying it'll get
a little bit easier even if you fail tomorrow it'll
still get a little bit easier than if you didn't
try at all trying and failing is better than not
trying at all or sitting there and making excuses watch
out for your excuses what do you do if you
have a bunch of excuses and limiting beliefs and you
don't even believe you can do this what you do
is you realize to yourself of course my mind is
playing tricks on me my mind is very self-deceptive as
leo has talked about in his episodes called self-deception part
one two three uh i'm aware of the deceptive nature
of my own mind i'm aware that everybody has limiting
beliefs and leo had many limiting beliefs when he started
this whole process and so um those are going to
be there i can't remove those overnight but what i
can do is i can i can still take action
i can take action so for example if i'm overweight
and i believe that i'll always be overweight for the
rest of my life and i have that limiting belief
i can say well maybe that's a trick of my
mind and you know what no matter what my mind
says i'm still going to go to the gym tomorrow
even if my mind is telling me that i'll always
be overweight and then i can't lose weight it's impossible
i've tried a bunch of times in the past i'm
still going to go to the gym tomorrow and the
next day and the next day and i keep going
and going and going and going and i will beat
my own mind simply through persistent action beware of getting
stuck in endless intellectualization endless self-doubt endless debating with yourself
endless confusion or indecision you can sit there and ruminate
about something but eventually you gotta make a decision and
go take action and even if you don't think it's
maybe the right action you're not sure should i take
action a or action b just make your best guess
and go take it and see the results that's how
you push your way through this see this is going
to be very messy hairy process it's not going to
be clean and nice for you you're going to be
in the dark a lot of times just trust in
the process trust that like a homing missile you're going
to figure out your direction but um you have to
take action every day a little bit of action every
day towards what you love as you do that you're
gonna start to get feedback as you start following these
principles of right action you can get a little bit
of positive feedback that you're doing the right things uh
the the right thing things in your life will start
to go your way a little bit more you're gonna
start to feel a little bit better about yourself and
pay attention to those subtle cues and then keep doubling
down on those and just keep doing that and also
as you do that your self-esteem will grow your sense
of self-efficacy will grow you will start to feel stronger
you will stop feeling like a victim you will start
to feel like you have some sense of control about
your life you can't achieve what i'm talking about without
a foundation of discipline principles independence of mind strong work
ethic focus and you also need solitude you need solitude
to give you time to go inside of yourself and
to study yourself and evaluate your own life to listen
to that intuitive voice inside of you that speaks to
you to contemplate and ask yourself questions to journal so
make sure you you leave plenty of room in your
life where you're not always harried and rushed to you
know go to the next event or this is the
next social thing or to be working you need time
to isolate and to evaluate how your life is going
and in fact if this is going to be if
you if you want to make this episode the inflection
point in your life that's going to change your whole
life forever where now you're going to start living your
life on purpose engaged following pursuing your your love and
your passion if you want to make that switch and
you also have the the free time to do this
i recommend take a couple of days off at least
if you can take a week off and just spend
a week in silence in a retreat location uh it
could be at home you could go camping in a
tent in the mountains or rent a cabin in the
woods somewhere and just sit there for a week just
contemplating everything i talked about running it through your mind
see it's not enough just to listen to what i
said once nor just listening it a bunch of times
like robotically that's not what i'm talking about what you've
got to do is you've got to really mold this
over in your mind until it sinks through and you
can see the consequences and you can develop a bit
of a vision of where this is taking you in
your life and ideas can come to you from this
sit with this reflect on it in solitude let it
sink in also realize that as you're engaging in this
process all sorts of opportunities will come to you serendipity
will click into place it'll start to function in your
favor serendipity means seemingly random things will start to happen
to you that reveal to you the path the next
step forward but this only really happens when you are
fully engaged in the process and you're looking for that
serendipity to happen and you're looking for the answers and
you need that next step you're not sure what it
is but you're looking for it you're looking for it
you're contemplating every day and then something will come to
you you might be listening to you know driving in
the car to work and then on the radio you
some advertisement on the radio tells you something about oh
some seminars being held in your city that's related to
what you want to be doing and then that's perfect
for you that's exactly the next step you need a
little piece in the puzzle that's going to get you
to the next thing or maybe you're you're looking through
some you know some website and then there you'll you
see an advertisement for some for some job the next
job that you need the perfect job that's aligned with
you know your skills that's going to get you to
the next level that's going to get you out of
your crappy job that you're stuck in now and you
can seize on that trust that the universe is going
to help you in this process when you align yourself
with the right principles when you've got the work ethic
when you're focused when you're being constructive and creative when
you're taking time in solitude to contemplate this stuff when
you're thinking deeply when you're asking probing questions when you're
taking life seriously when you set the intention to honor
your life and reality when you align yourself with love
when you're doing your spiritual practices if you're doing all
these things how can you not believe that the universe
is not going to help you of course it's going
to help you count on that when you're taking action
and you're following all the right principles the universe is
going to help you in subtle ways this is not
a left-brained rational approach to living life this is a
right-brained heart-centered intuitive approach to navigating life this is the
proper way to navigate life honing your intuition trusting in
your intuition learning to follow your heart connecting with your
higher self really listening to your higher self as opposed
to listening to your lower self which is full of
fears and limiting beliefs and negativity and criticism and destructive
ideas your higher self is that part of you that
is connecting with the love that's what's driving you what
your higher self wants is love what your higher self
wants is a is a deeper connection with reality with
our what your higher self wants is a is a
more authentic experience of life unobscured by petty survival concerns
and fears and various kinds of niggly obstacles that higher
self needs to be fed with action lack of action
complacency has led to your higher self being atrophied over
years but you can reestablish that connection with the higher
self by pursuing love as much as you can in
the face of fear taking action and doing all those
other things that i talked about and then your higher
self will flourish and then your higher self will feed
you ideas visions inspiration it'll help you to stay motivated
in those difficult times and that's the last point i
should tell you is that it will be difficult at
times it will be lonely at times where nobody is
supporting you and in those times just console yourself reassure
yourself that you're on the right path this is how
to live life life is not supposed to be easy
sometimes it's going to be very very difficult and you
keep taking action you don't take your eye off the
ball you don't let yourself get distracted you double down
in those difficult times and you sit through the solitude
and you have an unwavering faith that you're gonna find
solutions to all the obstacles faith is a huge component
here but i'm not talking about a blind religious faith
in some sort of ideology what i'm talking about is
the deep trust in this whole process of living your
life according to this principle of love basically that's what
religious faith ultimately is about it's not about faith in
some sort of man in the sky who's going to
save you or any religious dogma it's faith in the
timeless principles that mankind has discovered over the centuries of
how to live the good life and if you want
to build some confidence in these principles go go study
go study the world religions the mystical traditions go talk
to the greatest sages and mystics who have ever lived
ask them the top principles by which to orient your
life if you don't believe me if you think that
i might be misleading you then go compare what i
say to what others you know other great uh you
know wise people have discovered what has been written what
philosophers have talked about for for millennia and uh cross
reference all of those and then derive some basic principles
and then whatever principles you derive start following those and
then and then see you'll see that you start feeling
good about how you're living your life all right that's
