            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2u5M6tDc5TE' target='_blank'>State Of Consciousness Is Everything</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Significance of States of Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura posits that there is nothing outside states of consciousness, meaning all that reality is, is states of consciousness. All physical objects exist within these states, and no matter what is happening, we are always in a state of consciousness. The denial of states of consciousness is, itself, a state of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Fluid Nature of Consciousness</b>: Consciousness is depicted as fluid, instead of static states. The number of unique states of consciousness is potentially infinite, due to the infinite variation and overlap between states. The transition from one state to another is not binary but more like the turning of different knobs and dials. 
</li><li><b>Introduction of Figments of Consciousness</b>: States of consciousness are composed of 'figments of consciousness'. Reality is made up of these figments, which are like strands in a story or elements of a dream, instead of physical objects or atoms. Gura suggests that reality can consist of a figment within consciousness with no need for reduction to simpler elements like atoms or energy.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality through Consciousness</b>: To explain another notion, regarding a physical object like a Snickers candy bar, Gura insists that it doesnt need to be reduced to atoms or energy but can simply exist as it is within consciousness. This forms a 'figment paradigm'. This idea contrasts with materialistic beliefs which demand everything be deconstructed into tangible, physical parts. 
</li><li><b>Dreaming as an Example of Figments of Consciousness</b>: Gura uses dreaming as an illustration of consciousness made of figments. He explains that when asked about the composition of a dream, it wouldnt make sense to say its made of atoms but rather people, places, and occurrencesthe elements of the dreamwhich are ultimately figments of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Existence of Reality as Figments of Consciousness</b>: In an attempt to make viewers comprehend the abstract concept of figments of consciousness, Gura explains that these figments function like elements of a story or a dream. As with dreaming, reality isnt built from atoms, energy, or mathematical calculations, but from figments of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Concept of a 'Dream Machine'</b>: The metaphor of a 'dream machine' is used to explain how reality forms from figments of consciousness. Just as the building blocks of dreams are the elements within, which do not need atoms, energy, or mathematical equations, so is reality formed from states of consciousness, one figment at a time.
</li><li><b>Figments of Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura explains that items experienced in our dreams, such as a Snickers candy bar or a human body, are figments of consciousness woven together to create our experience of reality. Consciousness is not grounded in anything, such as a physical nervous system, universe, or computer simulation. Instead, these are all figments held within consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Physical Objects as Figments</b>: Gura expands this idea by providing a range of examples, emphasizing that physical objects, from yellow rubber duckies to Albert Einstein, are not made of atoms but are figments of consciousness. He explains the concept of weaving together these figments to create larger, complex figments, likening it to spinning strands of yarn into thicker ropes. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness Works Top-Down</b>: Contrasting with the common metaphor of reality being built up like Legos, Gura presents consciousness as working top-down. This means that conceptually complex items  like Albert Einstein  represent a single, large figment which can then be deconstructed into their component figments. He criticizes the reductionist viewpoint of trying to understand what something "is" by breaking it down into its smaller components.
</li><li><b>Rejection of Materialistic Paradigm</b>: Gura rejects the scientific-materialistic paradigm of reality as the result of a sequence of events, like the Big Bang leading to the present existence of a Snickers bar. He proposes a paradigm shift, suggesting that reality is the spontaneous creation of figments of consciousness, not a result of specific past events. 
</li><li><b>Reality Creation</b>: To conclude, he emphasizes the idea that we create our own reality by inventing and grounding figments of consciousness in an ever-continuous process. He presents a novel perspective: the potential for reality to spontaneously manifest any figment, such as a Snickers bar, from 'scratch', as opposed to necessitating a sequence of foundational events leading up to its existence.
</li><li><b>Figments of consciousness as direct experiences</b>: Leo Gura argues that every item, concept or experience we perceive, such as a Snickers candy bar, a mosquito bite, or even the entire city of New York, are all figments of consciousness. This means they exist not due to their physical or atomistic structures but because they are directly perceived and held within our consciousness.
</li><li><b>Infinite consciousness properties</b>: Consciousness allows us to experience these figments at any scope or granularity. He uses the example of New York City, suggesting that it can be perceived in its entirety or even zoomed into its smallest details, and an infinite number of sub-figments can exist within each figment. Gura stresses that no single figment is more fundamental than another and this allows for infinite imagination and perception possibilities.
</li><li><b>Radical shift in paradigm</b>: This concept pushes against traditional scientific and materialistic views, suggesting that paradigms are forgotten inventions formed from a lesser form of consciousness. These invented stories may be less tangible than the direct encounters with figments of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Limitations of the materialistic view</b>: Gura criticizes the materialistic view of building reality from smaller components, suggesting instead that figments of consciousness are infinitely complex and can be analyzed or subdivided endlessly. Reality is therefore as likely to be constituted of complex and abstract figments, like a pina colada or a sexist joke, as it is from traditionally accepted, 'simple' components like atoms or molecules.
</li><li><b>Direct consciousness exploration</b>: Gura encourages viewers to explore their consciousness directly, without the need for scientific experiments or philosophies. He emphasizes that this understanding can be achieved by keen observation and direct experience, rather than adopting belief systems or metaphysical theories. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming cognitive arbitrary limits</b>: Finally, he argues that dismissing seemingly complex or abstract figments of consciousness as unlikely building blocks of reality is arbitrary. This dismissal represents artificial cognitive constraints that can be overcome, thereby unlocking infinite potentials of the mind.
</li><li><b>Understanding limitations of reality from consciousness perspective</b>: Leo Gura explains that reality, from consciousness's perspective, does not differentiate between what is easier or harder to create. The creation of an electron or a pina colada, for example, doesn't matter as both are figments of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding consciousness as the grounding source</b>: Gura argues that trying to identify one entity or element as the grounding source for the figments of consciousness is a fruitless endeavor. Whatever one posits as the grounding source will also just be another figment of consciousness. To truly understand reality, one must consider their entire life as a whole as a figment of consciousness composed of various strands of sub figments of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Grasping the concept of objects as figments of consciousness</b>: Gura urges his audience to consider that all material objects around them are figments of consciousness. He uses a phone as an object of example here. He explains that this phone is a figment of consciousness and it exists wholesomely as a piece of consciousness. Consciousness creates objects of all sizes, shapes without any bounds or ground; it's infinite in this quality.
</li><li><b>Perception of Reality as abstract or concrete</b>: Leo Gura opens discussion regarding how reality is perceived and understood as being either concrete or abstract. These two views are often considered as exclusive to each other, but Gura suggests that reality could be a blend of both or even beyond these concepts. While the traditional view of reality is that it is comprised of concrete entities or objects, Gura proposes the possibility of reality being abstract and vague at its core.
</li><li><b>Understanding consciousness</b>: Gura concludes saying that consciousness is irreducible, meaning it cannot be broken down into simpler parts. Its complex nature makes it challenging to define or explain accurately. Gura insists that consciousness is the source of the figments of reality that we perceive. While this explanation is itself a simplification, it emphasizes the complexity and fundamental role of consciousness in shaping our understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding Consciousness</b>: Consciousness is defined as the sum of all possible "figments" of consciousness including all possible factors, experiences, and states. This infinite state of consciousness is intertwined with reality. The weaving together of these figments from the top-down creates a holistic and unlimited reality. This process maintains sanity which is why reality feels very solid and physical.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Sanity</b>: Understanding consciousness fully requires a very deep awakening. Gura points out that as individuals start to question reality with the aim of understanding it while maintaining sanity, they don't perceive that they might have to lose their sanity to truly understand what consciousness really is. Gura suggests that if one was given a choice between understanding the nature of reality and their sanity, very few would choose to lose their sanity, hence understanding of consciousness remains not well-known.
</li><li><b>Confronting Physicality</b>: If one started to realize that physical reality was just a figment of consciousness, Gura argues they would feel as though they've gone insane. For instance, if one realized that they could walk through walls because they were non-physical, it would disrupt their sense of normalcy and trigger fear. This illustrates how physically-bound our perceptions of reality are, and the struggle to let go of it in favor of non-physical reality.
</li><li><b>Losing Physical Reality</b>: If people lose their physical reality, they would be confused on how to survive or function normally. Because physicality grounds people in their daily experiences, losing this perception may seriously disrupt their sense of reality and sanity. Gura argues that this experience can cause fear and may make one feel like they're going insane. This threatens the basic comforts and coherence of people's reality.
</li><li><b>Attempt to Regain Normalcy</b>: When physical reality starts to unravel and turn non-physical, people may perceive it as a form of insanity. In reaction, they may seek psychiatric help, take medications, and engage in normalizing activities to return to their original state of consciousness. The established societal definitions of sanity and material reality make it difficult for them to accept their new perception.
</li><li><b>Misticality and Materiality</b>: The misunderstanding and fear of non-physicality is due to society's understanding of material reality. The coherence and consistency of the material world make it difficult for people to accept the notion of non-physicality. The material world is thus seen as a well weaved together collection of figments of consciousness, mistaken as truth or reality.
</li><li><b>Figments of Consciousness</b>: Figments of consciousness are viewed as absolute and are not just personal experiences contained within physical objects like brains or bodies. This insight into the nature of consciousness is hard to grasp without awakening or experiencing a paradigm shift in understanding. Gura indicated that people will only acknowledge sanity within their comfort zones of consciousness, thus limiting their understanding.
</li><li><b>Narrow Spectrum of Consciousness</b>: To maintain comfort, people accept a narrow spectrum of consciousness: what fits within their comfort zones. Anything outside these zones is considered insane, and people avoid exploring it. Gura suggests that a deeper exploration of consciousness, which may require verging into non-traditional zones of comfort, could give rise to fresh insights regarding the nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding of consciousness as absolute reality</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that every quality or figment of consciousness is exactly itself, making it absolute. For instance, he posits that seeing the color red or a character like Mickey Mouse is not merely perception, but an absolute reality.
</li><li><b>Everything as a figment of consciousness</b>: Gura argues that everything, including the brain, physical universe, atoms, science, history, and computation are all figments of consciousness. Rather than constituting reality, they are attempts to ground and relativize the absolute reality.
</li><li><b>Awakening to consciousness</b>:
</li><li>He suggests that to fully awaken to consciousness, one needs to unravel all these intertwined figments of consciousness and comprehend that they are all part of a single continuous strand, similar to a sweater made out of one long piece of yarn.
</li><li><b>Difference between mind and material</b>: Gura distinguishes between mind and material, stating that, unlike material, the mind is fluid and works in a holistic, top-down manner. Meanwhile, he reasons that material can't have intelligence because it's made of simple elements and works in a bottom-up way, contrary to mind which is capable of sentience and intelligence.
</li><li><b>Unfathomable high intelligence</b>: Gura asserts that the mind without limits, or a mind that has reached infinite intelligence, can often seem insane. The ability to comprehend everything is a trait of the mind, unlike material objects which lack this capability.
</li><li><b>Mind's unique capacities</b>: In his lecture, Gura imparts that the mind possesses unique capacities. It is capable of creativity, remembering and forgetting. Beyond that, mind is without any substrate or ground, unlike material systems. The mind also has will.
</li><li><b>Material systems as manifestations of mind</b>: Gura adamantly suggests that material systems are not separate from mind, but are in fact manifestations of the mind. He dismisses the idea of material systems existing outside the mind, emphasizing that the mind is absolute and everything is contained within it.
</li><li><b>Mind as an infinite field</b>: Advancing his perspective on the nature of consciousness, Gura compares the mind to an infinite field of 'voxels' or pixels. He underlines, however, that unlike in a computer simulation, the mind's voxels have no smallest unit of resolution  they are infinitely subdividable.
</li><li><b>Figments as Infinite Resolution Fields</b>: According to Leo Gura, figments or pixels, as imagined in states of consciousness, are infinite fields of beings that can be infinitely divided and combined, making each pixel unique and boundless. This means figments or pixels are not confined by a specific size or shape, can communicate, and can be coordinated infinitely, displaying the nature of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Remembrance</b>: Consciousness has the power to remember or forget itself. It is suggested that the state of consciousness can be manipulated like a switch or a dial. When the dial is turned up, the universe remembers itself, and when it is turned down, the universe forgets. He says that the current state of consciousness in humans is inflicted with forgetfulness and remembering could be likened to an awakening. 
</li><li><b>Restrictions of Materialist Thinking</b>: Comparing to a materialist viewpoint where consciousness is seen as an arrangement of atomic particles, Gura points out that such a view is limited and fails to consider the complexities of consciousness and its ability to hide things from itself. 
</li><li><b>Thinking and Consciousness State</b>: It is highlighted that thinking, modeling, and conceptualizing any aspect of reality cannot substitute for different states of consciousness. This is primarily because thinking and logic are bound by a certain frame of consciousness. To understand or experience things beyond this frame, one would need to access a higher state of consciousness, out of their current frame.
</li><li><b>Hyper Thinking and Spiritual Consciousness</b>: Gura introduces the concept of hyper-thinking, a new dimension of intelligence that can be achieved by expanding one's state of consciousness. According to him, hyper-thinking allows reasoning and thinking in hyper-dimensional ways and can lead to insights that are otherwise impossible to conceive in a current or lower state of consciousness. The notion of hyper-thinking introduces the potential for profound advances in understanding and acuity similar to an extraterrestrial entity with significantly higher intelligence. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Current Discourse</b>: Gura acknowledges the limitations of current human discourse, language, and logic in articulating concepts related to higher states of consciousness and the interactions within. He likens the unreachable understanding to the intelligence of a highly evolved alien species and emphasizes the restricted nature of current communication tools, like human language.
</li><li><b>Understanding Hyper Thinking</b>: Leo Gura introduces the concept of "hyper thinking" &mdash; a higher state of consciousness that is multidimensional and goes beyond the rationality and logic of normal human thought. It encapsulates elements of mysticism, visions, and intuition. Hyper thinking allows access to profound insights and spiritual truths that are beyond ordinary thinking.
</li><li><b>Accessing Hyper Thinking</b>: This state can be accessed by everyone, but it requires the expansion of one's level of consciousness. Leo argues that spiritual truths and deep insights can be gained through hyper thinking that may not be reached through meditative states alone. 
</li><li><b>Constraints of Lower Consciousness States</b>: The state of consciousness a person is in defines what they can think, understand, and feel, as well as what they consider possible or impossible. The range of these experiences can contract or expand based on one's state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Radical New States of Consciousness</b>: There are radically new states of consciousness that we cannot comprehend in our current state. These states are so radical and different that they can shock us, challenging our parameters of what is possible or impossible.
</li><li><b>Memory and Current State of Consciousness</b>: The present state of consciousness determines the bandwidth and memory available to perceive and understand experiences from higher states of consciousness. Even memories of profound insights from higher states are heavily condensed and degraded when perceived from a lower state, thus limiting their transformative potential.
</li><li><b>Expanding the Bandwidth of Consciousness</b>: The ultimate goal of spiritual work is to expand this bandwidth of consciousness. The current state of consciousness doesn't offer enough bandwidth and memory for profound insights and truths from higher states. Thus, expanding one's consciousness allows for a fuller understanding and experiencing of these insights and truths. 
</li><li><b>State of Consciousness and Life Experiences</b>: Our life experiences and interests are largely defined by our state of consciousness. For instance, lower states of consciousness are more focused on mundane, regular human activities, while higher states can be so abstract and beyond human experiences that one wouldn't care for regular human needs or interests.
</li><li><b>Changing State of Consciousness</b>: Changing a state of consciousness - either temporary or permanent - is the most significant change one can make in life. While temporary changes or "peak" experiences are easier to achieve, changing the baseline or habitual state of consciousness is far more challenging but yields more significant transformations.
</li><li><b>Peak Experiences and Baseline Consciousness</b>: Leo cautions against dismissing the importance of temporary peaks. Even though they're temporary, such peaks offer important utility in terms of accessing insights and perceptions beyond baseline consciousness. They contribute to the understanding of reality and spiritual truths. 
</li><li><b>The Need for Higher Consciousness</b>: The higher the state of consciousness, the lesser the limitations, to a point of "god mode" where consciousness is infinite, and nothing is impossible. This emphasizes the need for expanding one's state of consciousness, which ultimately shapes our ability to conceive truths, insights, and possibilities++.
</li><li><b>Significance of raising baseline and peak states of consciousness</b>: Raising baseline consciousness is challenging and it does not directly lead to accessing highest states of consciousness. However, focusing solely on peak experiences without working on baseline can also lead to lack of spiritual growth. Therefore, a balanced approach of improving both baseline and peak states is essential.
</li><li><b>Implications of various states of consciousness</b>: States of consciousness govern the perception of sciences, philosophies, life, and death. Different states are not inherently superior or inferior to one another; their value largely depends on individual intention and need. Higher states of consciousness might be detrimental for individuals who wish to maintain sanity and live an ordinary life.
</li><li><b>Understanding of spirituality and religious teachings requires higher consciousness</b>: Most people never experience high mystical states of consciousness, leading to misunderstandings about spirituality, religion, and reality. Most religious teachings originate from higher states of consciousness and thus fail to make sense to people with lower state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Shifting consciousness can be scary, threatening, and isolating</b>: Higher states of consciousness can feel like insanity and can be isolating due to lack of shared understanding with others at lower consciousness levels. However, the higher the level of consciousness, the better one's understanding and intelligence.
</li><li><b>Methods to change state of consciousness</b>: Various methods such as meditation, concentration, visualizations, mantras, etc., can be used to alter one's state of consciousness. The key to accessing the highest states is deep concentration and quantity in practice.
</li><li><b>Various methods to shift one's state of consciousness</b>: Techniques such as prayer, visualization, concentration, shaktipat, dark room retreats, astral projection, lucid dreaming, vision quests, extreme experiences, nature immersion, falling in love, and psychedelics may be used to shift state of consciousness. However, these methods may work differently for each person based on their personality type, level of consciousness, genetics, and preferences. 
</li><li><b>Difficulties in altering baseline state of consciousness</b>: It is challenging to permanently shift baseline state of consciousness, and easier instead to access peak states of consciousness. Methods such as deep concentration for prolonged periods, intense yoga, and intense breathing are reported to help raise this baseline state.
</li><li><b>Paranormal abilities associated with higher states of consciousness</b>: Mystics may possess seemingly impossible abilities, such as clairvoyance and telepathy, which are possible from certain higher states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Awakening or enlightenment as states of consciousness</b>: They can be both temporary or permanent states, with different degrees of awakening, not being an on-off switch. 
</li><li><b>Disagreements in spiritual or mystical teachings explained</b>: Misunderstandings or disagreements between spiritual teachers or religions often stem from access to different higher states of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding consciousness</b>: Consciousness is infinite, unbounded, and forms the foundation of all realities. It cannot be easily defined as its understanding goes beyond current states of consciousness. Assertions of where consciousness comes from are null since the concepts of 'where' and 'coming from' are figments of consciousness itself.
</li><li><b>God as consciousness</b>: The concept of God is not a figment of consciousness but is consciousness itself, encompassing all possible figments and going beyond them to the meta level. Humans are biographical, biological selves that are themselves a figment dreamt up by consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding of consciousness</b>: Leo Gura states that his understanding of consciousness is still evolving, even though he's accessed very high levels and recognizes its infinite nature. Still, he admits to struggling with understanding the nuances, mechanisms, and details, including facets like love and intelligence.
</li><li><b>Articulation challenges</b>: Leo acknowledges that articulating, modeling, and explaining consciousness to others is a separate challenge from accessing higher states of it for oneself. Being highly conscious doesn't necessarily mean one is good at conveying it to others and vice versa.
</li><li><b>Embodying consciousness</b>: Leo notes his struggles with embodying the higher levels of consciousness in his day-to-day life, saying that he still has much work to do, potentially decades more.
</li><li><b>Potential for self-deception</b>: Self-deception is a significant concern for Leo, who continually double-checks and second-guesses himself. He acknowledges that he's not immune to self-deception and emphasizes the need for listeners to cross-reference, contemplate, and have direct experiences to validate teachings.
</li><li><b>Responsibility in spirituality</b>: Leo stresses the importance of individual responsibility in spiritual growth. He urges listeners to think for themselves and not just rely on teachings from any teacher, including himself. He also recognizes his responsibility in teaching accurately and avoiding deception, even as he admits to his limitations and biases.
</li><li><b>Being fallible</b>: Leo highlights that everyone, including himself and other teachers, is fallible. Therefore, individuals should practice discernment and double-check teachings for themselves.
</li><li><b>Spirituality as personal work</b>: Spirituality is deeply personal, and Leo urges listeners to take active responsibility for their spiritual journey, viewing it as work and effort rather than just absorbing dogma passively. He emphasizes that spirituality cannot be outsourced to others.
