hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
video I want to talk about why men cheat why
do men cheat this video is for the ladies I
know that so many ladies are really struggling with this
you're struggling with getting a guy to stick around to
lock him down and maybe you've had situations in the
past a lot of you women have where a guy
has cheated on you and that hurts you very very
badly and you don't understand why they do it you
think that you're this nice girl you're doing everything that
he wants you are taking care of your health and
you're maybe even attractive and all this stuff and he's
still cheats or maybe you aren't those things and he
cheats so there's many different reasons and I want to
go in this video and cover all the different reasons
my top reasons for why I think men cheat and
I want to also give you the deeper understanding what's
really going on here about male attraction because I think
that there's a fundamental problem is that women I find
don't really understand how men think I see a lot
of women thinking that they understand how men think because
they've they've heard about it in a culture or in
in the media and they think that they understand how
men think most of you women don't really understand how
men properly think you understand this sort of very neutered
version of how a man thinks and that's causing some
problems because as soon as you do start to understand
how men think and what men are attracted to then
it all of a sudden doesn't become quite as surprising
you're not surprised by some of the behaviors and then
take and there's also some factors here that you could
tweak some variables that you can tweak in your favor
so you can make sure that men don't cheat on
you as often you can't guarantee that they never will
but you could do some stuff that will certainly help
so we're going to go into all that in this
video let's build a foundation here the fun foundations that
men are extremely sexual most men are especially if they're
in their 20s 30s and 40s the male sex drive
is very strong and men are much more sexual than
you think they are so I know that you think
that you know that men are sexual and that seems
like oh that that's obviously oh no it's not obvious
they're much more sexual than what you currently think they
are your man is she bisexual he's also extremely visual
you have to understand that what men are attracted to
in the partner that they want to be with is
very very different than what women are attracted to the
mistake here is to think that what you're attracted to
in a man is what a man is attracted to
in you no no no no no big big big
wrong assumption that's not how it works what a men
are attracted to through tracted to the body they're attracted
to visuals men men's attraction is 95% visual this is
critical because some women will think that all men are
attracted to confidence men are attracted to humor and funniness
men are attracted to a woman who has her life
together no no man is attracted to any of that
men will like that in their girlfriend they'll like that
in their wife bill like for a girl to have
her life together but they're not actually attracted to that
they're attracted to her body they're attracted to her face
they're attracted to her ass that's what they're attracted to
the rest is bonus it's like the cherry on top
of the ice cream right the ice cream sundae it's
the cherry on top so don't make the mistake of
inverting that and saying that your confidence and your funniness
and all that that that is the ice cream and
the cherry on top is really looks that might be
the case for you but that's not how a man
sees it now you got to take a step back
here leave your ego at the door because I see
a lot of women what they do is they immediately
come in with all sorts of responses and rejection you
know rebuttals to this argument and and they keep saying
these various different counter points just hear me out be
very open-minded here because this is not how you think
it can be difficult to understand how the opposite sex
thinks unless you become a little bit empathetic and step
into their own shoes see I want to really put
you through the process of how many gets attracted here's
how it works a man is walking down the street
20 to 30 feet away he sees a beautiful girl
the kind of girl that he likes it takes him
about this long to get attracted to her how long
did that take a third of a second a fourth
of a second maybe takes him half a second sometimes
it'll take him 1 to 2 seconds if he's got
other stuff in his mind and he's a little busy
that the computer processor is churning away on something else
or sometimes if the girl is not very attractive if
she's borderline attractive it might take him five seconds he
might actually do kind of a little mental analysis and
say oh yeah she's like she's got a nice face
but like I don't like her but or she got
a nice ass but I don't like her face or
it's like oh I really like that girl right there
but she's kind of like this hippie chick I'm not
into hippie chicks right you might do that kind of
like mental a little bit of mental analysis or it's
not quite as instinctive but still it's fairly instinctive and
if she's really really borderline and he's really really desperate
for sex but he doesn't really like this girl and
he would never take her for a girlfriend but he
would have sex with her one time and that's it
in that situation no maybe 20 seconds maybe 30 seconds
it takes him to a little bit of analysis and
this and then get attracted to her that's about it
in most cases it's literally less than a second that's
what you actually want it to be if you want
a guy who's really into you you want him to
get attracted instantly if it takes him a long time
to get attracted to you he's not really into you
now be the man here put yourself in the man's
shoes you instantly get attracted now what does this have
to do with with cheating well what this has to
do is it's a simple logistics as a woman how
do you get attracted as a woman you need to
speak with a man for at least a few minutes
you need to get a sense of his character is
a his masculinity you're going to get a sense of
his energy his vibe you a sense of Hewlett mostly
stimulate you or not it takes a while to uncover
those details you don't get those 30 feet away without
even speaking to a man so as a woman it
takes you what 30 minutes maybe 60 minutes maybe even
a couple of hours or even a couple of days
of knowing a guy to really get to know him
enough were you kind of open up and you get
really attracted you're like oh there's something really funny about
him I like his little quirky sense of humor or
at all like he's really confident these situations I've seen
him in a couple of situations like I really like
how confident he is there and of course all that
is going on on subconsciously as well it goes on
subconsciously for guys and for girls that processing is going
on subconsciously there's a little bubble of consciousness here there
but mostly subconsciously and then you get attracted to it
so you've got to be cranked up like a dial
right it takes a while to crank you up to
build your attraction with a guy it's instant so what
does this mean this means that just if those are
the mechanics and it's easier for guys and a guy
can get an attractive to a girl from 30 feet
away without even talking to her then that just creates
more opportunities right more opportunities and sometimes that's all you
need is an opportunity and that's one of the big
components of this explanation is that guys simply have more
opportunities for getting attracted it gets acted more easily so
they're more likely to find somebody that they have chemistry
with and then have sex with them now this isn't
an excuse I'm not saying that this is why men
should cheat on you I'm simply saying these are the
mechanics this is kind of the reality of the situation
this is how male dating works right female dating works
in a different way it has different dynamics see the
other thing you understand is that this is a very
heavy evolutionary component to this whole dating and attraction thing
some women will tend to think of love as this
this noble ideal these good emotions in this chemistry that
you have together I mean it is those things but
also can understand what is underpinning all that it's the
emotional it's the evolutionary forces rather that our underpinning those
those good emotions that you're feeling and what you call
love you can also understand that there's other forces there
besides the good emotions there's the desire to have the
best mate possible every one of us if we're honest
will admit that we want the best mate possible we
always want to date someone out of our league we
want to date up don't we don't you if you're
honest about it I mean if you take a scale
of attractiveness and hotness and value of a man or
a woman and you kind of graph it out like
this then you can place yourself somewhere and within that
where's your value along that scale let's say somewhere in
the middle where is your man's value along that scale
usually it's also someone in the middle the man that
you attract is going to be about at the same
level of value that you're at so if you're a
very low value you're going to attract the very low
value man it's gonna be hard for you if you're
low value as a woman to attract a very high
value man it's gonna be very difficult because you're not
going to be offering him what other women are offering
them and vice versa if you're a low value man
it's gonna be hard to attract a high value woman
so there's this kind of a process going on all
the time in in the dating market is that guys
and girls are trying to you know find the best
that they can get but they can't get too good
because if they get someone too good problems start to
happen and usually they don't get the attraction going in
the first place now value for man for women are
different things men are looking for certain things that are
valuable in a woman and women are looking for certain
things that are very different from that in a man
now we all want to date up so the situation
is that if you attract a man who's much higher
value than you the problem is going to be is
that he's going to know that and he's always going
to be on the lookout for somebody else it's the
same thing with you if you if you attract a
man who's much lower value than you and you're higher
value then whether you want to or not your eye
is always going to look out for someone who's a
little bit higher value because you want to date the
hottest most attractive most confident most masculine guide that you
can find out there and a guy wants to date
the hottest girl that he can find out there that's
just it's just how we're wired this is wiring it's
important not to hold this against men or women because
this is something that happens very unconsciously within us we're
not choosing this stuff a man is not choosing to
get attracted to the woman that's walking down the street
he sees her she's beautiful to him and that's it
in the same way that a woman doesn't choose to
get attracted to a man because a man for example
might come by at a party have a very good
charisma and energy to him and she gets attracted after
a few minutes she gets attracted because that that personality
is something that she finds very masculine and strong and
confident attractive she wants to be a part of that
she has to be part of that masculine energy so
all of us want to date up so don't be
too self-righteous about this stuff women also cheat on men
it's not the problem that's not a problem that that
only men chained women also cheat and they treat quite
a lot but I would probably assume I mean I
don't have that a number so I would assume that
men cheat more and the reason for that is because
they're visual they get attracted much more easily than women
do so I think that is the key explanation ok
so that's kind of the foundation a little extra piece
of that foundation is that evolutionarily speaking we're not a
monogamous species I'll shoot another video about that because that's
a very deep topic there's a lot of science that
goes on to to make this point but you can
take a look at the signs you can read books
and different research that they've done but really it's pretty
clear that within the animal kingdom there are various types
of sexual relationships going on some animals are monogamous some
animals are polyamorous some animals are are polygamous and various
combinations like that now what are human beings human beings
are not monogamous human beings are also not naturally polygamous
human beings are in the middle they're polyamorous what does
polyamorous mean that means that we have multiple sexual partners
and our relationships don't tend to last long we like
to screw around we're basically or the slots of the
animal kingdom and there's this face a lot a lot
of sense you guys for example even if you take
a look at primates you take a look at various
species within the primate kingdom if you can look at
chimpanzees and gorillas and and other primates there you'll take
a look that for example certain anatomical features will correspond
to the mating style of that species for example with
gorillas they they live in in troops where the one
male has sex with a lot of females so that's
kind of like a polygamist type of situation in that
situation the male testicles are very small they don't need
large testicles because they're not competing with other males to
inseminate females take the opposite end of that spectrum is
you've got chimpanzees who are extremely promiscuous and they have
sex with everyone all the time there's no sense of
relationship going on with chimpanzees so in that kind of
environment the anatomical features that correspond to that is that
the male is there they have extremely large testicles because
they're always competing to inseminate females and so they need
large testicles to carry large quantities of semen human beings
are actually in the middle are testicle size is closer
to chimpanzee than is to a gorilla but we're in
the middle there now why am I saying all this
it's not to shatter your hopes of a monogamous relationship
or a marriage or anything like that if you want
that you can have that all I'm saying is that
that's kind of where our natural needle is settled right
that's kind of our default position now you can move
away from that default position but the more you move
away from human nature the more trouble you're going to
run into so just keep that in mind keep that
in mind that we're trying to create these long term
relationships you're trying to make them last and it's difficult
it's difficult because we're not really wired for it neither
men are no women are but we're kind of trying
to do this artificial thing all righty so that's the
foundation now here are the top actual specific reasons that
men might cheat on you in a specific situation now
everything I told you up to this point that was
nice theory because understanding but you can't really change that
that was human nature you're not going to change human
nature so that might make you feel a little bit
depressed you might say well Leo you told me all
this stuff but like I'm really interested in finding that
one guy for me how is this helping me you're
just making me miserable and depressed you're you're making me
feel even worse about my chance of finding that right
guy no don't worry here's here's the you can actually
take some action on that's just human nature you can't
do anything about that but you can do something about
this so two top reasons reason number one and number
two and number three all have to do with sex
so reason number one is that you're giving a bad
sex the sex is bad reason number two is that
the sex is stale which is different from me bad
it's stale that means it was good before and now
it's bad reason number three is that you're giving him
no sex at all your relationship has devolved to the
point where there's no sex going on so these three
points actually what I want to do is I'm going
to tell you the rest of the points do you
have some context so they're going to go into some
depth on each one so those are the first three
the next one the fourth one is that you're overweight
you're gaining too much weight or you're letting your appearance
and your looks you're letting that go you're letting yourself
go too much he's losing a traction visually to the
point after that fifth point is the passion is gone
so the sex might be missing but also just excitement
in the relationship non-sexual passion that might be gone or
maybe it wasn't there in the beginning the next point
is that it's just there if a woman you got
to understand if a man is is offered sex on
a silver platter if some beautiful woman just comes up
to him says hey would you like to have Sesame
right now I don't care how loyal that guy is
I don't care how moral that guy is I don't
care how much he's in love with you he is
going to be very tempted at the very least most
guys would probably have sex and maybe if he's he's
very very committed to you he'll he'll think really hard
about it but he'll really have to go against his
nature so sometimes you got to understand that if it's
just offered to him if he if he ends up
being in a situation where sex can happen easily he's
most likely he's going to take that or is gonna
be hard the next point reason that a man would
cheat on you is he's trading up quite simply I
mean he might be in a relationship with you right
now because you're giving him some easy sex and it's
nice but he's on the lookout for something better maybe
he he really knows that he want something better he
want something more attractive or maybe he knows that your
lower value he's higher valued he's looking to close that
gap with somebody else so that's why it's important to
always be dating somebody who's you know reasonably within your
league if the if the difference in value between you
two is very drastic it's gonna be tough to to
hold that together one or the other of you is
going to be tempted to trade up the next point
is that he's drunk I don't drink I've ever really
drank never been a big drinker but a lot of
guys do they go out partying Friday Saturday night they
drink like I said stuff happens and sex is just
offered it's easy it's convenient they get with another drunk
girl and it happens of course this is an excuse
but it's a major reason it's very hard to hold
back your natural urges when you're when you're wasted so
consider that and the last point that I would say
is bad character he just simply has bad character now
what is what does this mean bad character well no
matter no matter even if the guy's attracted to you
some guys out there just scumbags just like women are
I mean there are bad people in the world people
who aren't moral people who don't really care about being
honest people who will lie constantly about stuff so if
you run into a character like that you're not really
good at screening character and people then you might run
into people that you get into relationships with that are
going to cheat on you simply because that's how they
live life they cheat at not just with you but
other areas of life so sometimes a cheater is just
a cheater is just a cheater so you got to
look out for that as well so those are the
points right sex make sure the sex is good make
sure it's not stale make sure that there's excitement going
on make sure that from the very beginning the sex
is awesome make sure that you are good in bed
make sure that you study and you learn how to
please a man in bed because if you can please
a man in bed you know in a you know
in a way that other women can't Wow that's a
very good way to lock him down very good way
to lock him down a man will really think twice
about trading you up when he says to himself a
home and she's amazing in bed very few women are
that amazing in bed that's going to make them think
twice about sleeping with out of the girl I guarantee
it if there's no sex in your relationship at all
while don't even expect for the guy to stick around
that's that's pretty much disaster going on right there I
don't even know why you want him to stick around
if there's no sex going on that already shows dysfunction
but you know sometimes marriages will turn into this is
that you start having sex in your relationship once a
day then once every two days then three times a
week then one time a week then one time a
month and then never or maybe once a year so
that's what your relationship is like you're having sex once
a month or once a year yeah that's so that's
a big big big red flag right there you need
to fix that or don't expect them to stick around
your weight if you're letting yourself go in the looks
department I know a lot of people are overweight these
days because it's very easy given the culture the culture
and how it stimulates with all the nasty and garbage
food that you're eating get yourself into shape be fit
for your man there's nothing that a man likes more
than for his girlfriend to be nice and fit and
attractive and beautiful looking that's what he wants in a
girlfriend every man wants that I don't care who he
is if he doesn't want that and he's full of
he's lying too so he wants a fit woman make
sure you take care of your nutrition make sure you
take care of your exercise so that you look good
passion make sure thanks there's adventure and excitement going on
in the relationship make sure that you're not just him
is taking you on dates and stuff but you're coming
up with ideas too it always helps when the girl
is coming up with stuff to do keeps more of
the passion alive because the passion does tend to get
lower and lower lower as the relationship ages and then
other than that you know screen for those bad characters
make sure your your guys and going out and getting
wasted every night because if he is then it's just
gonna be a matter of time before you and subside
with somebody but you know don't be too paranoid I
don't want to make you paranoid I want to in
fact use this video to make you more grounded and
we're more confident yourself sometimes guys will cheat on you
sometimes got girls will cheat on guys yeah maybe maybe
guys do it more often than girls but in the
end that's part of human nature you can't change that
it's better to just accept that that's a reality that
I could always happen and then take care of some
of these points that you do have control over like
the quality of the sex how you look the passion
that you bring into the relationship screening for bad characters
if you do those things then you're going to do
everything that you can and I don't want you to
be bitter against men I want to I want you
to to kind of just say oh okay so this
is kind of how a guy thinks this is kind
of why it happens I got a little bit more
clarity and insight now into how this works these are
just kind of some of the mechanics of life and
you know it's okay I don't need to be bitter
about it I don't need to be hyper-vigilant about it
I don't need to assume that every man is going
to cheat on me because all those are dysfunctional modes
of being in a relationship you don't want that if
you approach a relationship from one of those angles it's
just gonna it's gonna it's going to hastin your chances
of getting cheated on so don't do that go in
there expecting the best of your man but also now
watch out watch out for some of these factors some
of these red flags that are going on all right
