[Music] you welcome to part two of this two-part miniseries
on cult psychology where we're gonna look at the broader
epistemic applications of the lessons that we explored in part
one what I want to really focus in on in
part two is that cult dynamics are everywhere in modern
society and also throughout all of human history if you
just take a look so usually when we say the
word cult people think oh he's talking about Scientology or
Jonestown or the Moonies or Jehovah's Witnesses or some crazy
outlandish fringe conspiracy theorist groups out there that believe crazy
things and do crazy things that have nothing to do
with me and have nothing to do with my organization
nothing to do with my business nothing to do with
my religion nothing to do with my sports team or
anything like that but you probably don't think of when
I say the word cult Buddhism yoga science self-help atheism
rationalism materialism capitalism Wall Street academia politics libertarians pickup corporations
consumerism marketing mainstream media mainstream norms and culture ethics morality
abortion fashion language psychotherapy YouTube channels Twitter Facebook medicine family
abusive relationships homophobia the church whatever church you belong to
the military sports yet all of these areas of life
are infested with cult dynamics and so while in part
one of this miniseries what I wanted to focus on
was sort of drawing a sharp distinction between a cult
and not a cult and that can be very useful
it can be very useful to have a strict technical
definition of a cult which I gave you in part
one so that you can you can really evaluate when
a group is a hardcore cult but now we're sort
of shifting almost to the polar opposite and now we're
gonna look at cults not in this binary yes-or-no sort
of way like you look at an organization you ask
the question is that organization a cult and you just
say yes or no rather looking like that now let's
evaluate it in shades of grey in degrees of cult-like
behavior and now let's really break down what it means
to be a cult into subcomponents because the label cults
it's like this one monolithic label which stands in for
a lot of stuff it's rather abstract and there's a
lot of sub components to it and so while most
organizations in mainstream society would not be classified technically as
a cult if you're going to pose this sort of
binary yes-or-no question to it they will still exhibit a
lot of the sub components and that can be extremely
useful to see so what I want you to start
to see is that there's no clear boundary between where
a cult ends and where mainstream society begins and then
in fact most cults are just offshoots from mainstream society
and that really it's a difference of degree not in
kind and yet while we're gonna be considering this differences
in degrees here today I still want you to retain
the old lens of looking at cults as this binary
yes-or-no thing using that strict technical definition that I gave
you still retain that you're gonna be using both of
these lenses simultaneously as you're gonna be analyzing and looking
around the world and also of course looking at your
own life and looking at all the groups that you
are a member of and how cult-like they might be
really cults are not a new phenomenon cult behavior cult
dynamics have existed I would guess for at least three
hundred thousand years modern Homo sapiens recent discoveries are showing
have been dated back to three hundred and fifty thousand
years that's modern Homo sapiens that means they probably had
very similar brain wiring and very similar cycle giggle mechanisms
which drove that drove their behaviors so it's very hard
for me to imagine that 350,000 years ago there weren't
cults there were and the original cults are basically just
tribes and you can still find them in underdeveloped parts
of the world in Indonesia in the Amazon in Africa
you can still find tribal people that live in small
groups of a hundred and fifty or something people and
basically what are these groups they're cults they have their
own little cultures their own little sets of norms their
own in-group and out-group and all this stuff that comes
with that and they're very defensive about their rituals their
religious customs their culture their language their way of doing
things you know how many dialects of language there are
in the world not just a couple hundred there's thousands
of them thousands of different dialects of different kinds of
languages some languages are so small and so remote that
you've never even heard of them they're not even written
about in books but they exist within ezel tribes literally
a little tribe will develop its own language over time
and of course what is modern society but just a
bigger version of that we've scaled it up into the
millions and billions but modern nations are really just like
large tribes you can look at them that way now
of course there are important differences but it's an interesting
way to look at it and also every major religion
regardless of what it is is basically itself a cult
at some point in history in its history and it's
an offshoot off of something else and every major religion
has its own cults that shoot off from it so
the Jews might consider Christianity a cult and then the
Christians might consider Mormonism occult and then the Mormons will
consider fringe fundamentalist Mormon groups also a cult straying away
from mainstream Mormonism see there's no end to it reality
is always splintering itself off like that and that's what
people are doing that's how collective ego works one of
the trickeries with the word cult is that in the
mainstream usage of this word there's a common mainstream mistake
that's made which is to think that well if I'm
not part of some fringe ideological group if I'm not
in a cult that means I'm safe that means the
things that I believe in my views of reality are
basically true and correct and that's not at all the
case not at all the case because what you're doing
there is you're judging the validity of your beliefs and
worldview based sort of on majority rule of opinion it's
like whatever the majority opinion is that's like the correct
way to look at the world and if you live
in a modern European style developed country like in America
or somewhere in Europe then chances are that you're completely
bought into this illusion that somehow mainstream Western civilization has
the correct perspective on the world and that by sticking
to that perspective you're somehow safe you're somehow safe by
sticking to science or you're somehow safe by sticking with
atheism because you're not gonna get sucked into some radical
ideology not at all you can get completely diluted by
mainstream thinking now of course there's sort of a double
edged thing going on here with this with this point
because at the same time I also want to say
you should appreciate that mainstream culture and society does in
a sense protect you from extreme and dangerous ideologies and
ideas it does have a sort of moderating influence and
that is because it's gone through a long evolutionary period
of trial and error where a lot of radical ideas
were weeded out ideas that would get you killed ideas
that would destroy society those were weeded out through revolutions
and bloody wars and through torture imprisonment and criminal trials
and protest movements and civil rights movements and Democratic votes
and this has been going on for thousands of years
Society has been evolving so in a certain sense mainstream
society is we're evolved it's much more evolved than if
you go to some African tribe and look at what
they're doing there they can believe some really crazy stuff
but that still doesn't protect you and that still doesn't
mean that your mainstream views of the world and of
reality are correct in fact they're wrong mostly everything that
means your society teaches you from a metaphysics standpoint from
a truth standpoint is wrong because what culture is is
this sort of reality bubble that we're creating collectively together
to help us to survive it doesn't care about the
truth it cares about helping you to survive and those
are two very different things you have to distinguish living
in these reality bubbles that we create really it's better
to call them fantasy bubbles is what human beings do
it's sort of like our our distinguishing feature among the
animal kingdom is that we create these fantasy bubbles in
which we live and there's so many different kinds of
these fantasy or reality bubbles that you can create way
more than you would think thousands if not tens of
thousands of different kinds so the trick is figuring how
which one of them is correct which one of them
is gonna lead to a productive living which oh and
which ones are gonna lead to craziness calamity suffering and
suicide and torture and other sorts of things like this
and then how do you get to the truth see
most people what they do is they get stuck in
their own bubble and they think that that's what the
truth is it never even occurs to them the truth
could be a meta thing maybe the truth is not
one of these bubbles at all so it's not a
matter of finding the right bubble it's actually about seeing
the entire meta dynamic of how the mind creates these
bubbles and why it creates these bubbles and why these
bubbles are so addictive and why it's so difficult to
step outside of bubbles and to take a sort of
meta perspective the view from outside the bubble and what
that might be you know so what happens is that
most human beings live inside these bubbles it's very difficult
for us to see the world outside of our bubble
and then we tend to reinforce our own bubble because
we need that bubble to help us to live and
to survive it's literally a matter of life and death
it's not just a matter of like oh yeah that
idea is cooled I would like to believe this thing
there all that sounds like a nice theory no no
it's like your entire life is predicated upon surviving within
one of these bubbles and so you're gonna now reinforce
that bubble compulsively and pathologically and your own clinging to
your bubble is then gonna create all of your suffering
and misery pretty much in your life and you're not
gonna know that because you're gonna mistake your bubble for
reality so this is the larger dynamic that we're working
with here these are epistemic dynamics dynamics about human knowledge
and how do we know anything in the world how
do we know what reality is how do we know
what we can trust how do we know we can
trust science how do we know we can trust atheism
or Mormonism or Buddha's and them or anything for that
matter how do you know you can trust anything that
I say everything I say applies reflexively on everything that
I say so I'm not creating a sort of a
special privilege zone for me and my actualized philosophy as
though it's somehow immune from all these factors no no
no it's it's extremely susceptible to all this so you
got to keep that in mind but anyways I don't
wanna address too much on that let's talk about the
various sub components that we see commonly throughout mainstream society
that is cult-like and perhaps the most important one to
stress here the defining characteristics of cult-like behavior is stereotyping
judging and devaluing Outsiders this is like the epitome of
cult dynamics and there's a lot of sub components to
this one sub component so let's cover the sub components
of this one sub component so if you notice when
human beings come together in a group we tend to
develop sort of herd mentality and we start to stereotype
and judge and devalue Outsiders and this stereotyping and judging
and devaluation becomes very addictive and it takes on a
life of its own it takes on a reality of
its own there's always a in-group and out-group that's created
us versus them we're the good guys they're the bad
guys and once that dynamic or duality is created then
a lot gets built around that to reinforce that and
make it seem very real until people buy into it
and you can notice in your own life how you've
done this with other races with other countries with other
languages with with people who look different than you speak
different than you I mean this is found everywhere throughout
human history and it's not just something that existed fifty
years ago with your grandparents no it exists right now
today you're seeing it in the news every single day
oversimplifying the other group and then demonizing them and creating
the sort of polarity and then blaming them and scapegoating
them for all of the problems that you have in
life and that becomes very convenient because any anything that
I'm creating my life I can just offload off to
some other group out there a different religion a different
racial group a different gender a different political orientation that
people have you're doing this all the time and all
of your teachers and mentors are also doing this and
then what happens is that that that judgment and that
stereotyping that oversimplifying the other becomes contagious for example I
don't know if you've noticed this but take a look
into your history your personal history when you were a
child or a teenager notice were your parents very judgmental
of somebody some group some group of people some religious
people or some scientific people or whatever some political party
some racial group what you'll notice is that if they
were judgmental about something you then very likely caught like
a virus you caught that contagion of judgment and now
it's very difficult for you to stop judging in the
same way that your parents judged because when an authority
figure or somebody that you love or somebody that you
look up to or someone that you're a friend with
judges something you tend to try to align with that
usually so notice notice that I remember my dad this
is kind of a funny example um he wasn't racist
or anything but he would judge Chevrolet he would always
make fun of Chevy cars like they would have Chevy
commercials and on the TV that their slogan Chevy slogan
used to be like a rock that was their slogan
and then for us it became sorta like a joke
because we thought that Chevy's were kind of ugly looking
like clunkers compared to other cars like Toyota's and stuff
and so we would always kind of like when we
were driving we've gone on long road trips up Northern
California and into Oregon he was doing work and I
was I was on the road with him and we
were just you know talking we were pointing at cars
a lot talking about different cars that we saw new
models of cars and so we it was kind of
like between him and me there would be this kind
of like in joke of like oh look at that
it's like a rock this ugly looking Chevy and so
and so but I but see I adopted the I
had I didn't realize it at the time but I
got infected with that to the point where like I
would become judgmental of Chevy's and then like later in
my life mmm in my early 20s you know I
would see a Cheviot and then Chevy like improved their
line of products and they started putting out nicer looking
cars but I would still have that judgment and I
realized oh my god this is exactly how racism works
this is exactly how it works this is what we
mean by this kind of stereotyping judging and devaluating devaluate
devaluing some other group out there and it really doesn't
matter what it is it could even be cars it
could be Apple products it could be windows or or
it could be Xbox or Playstation you know you could
be doing this with your friends and you don't even
know you're doing it as part of this dynamic also
what you do is you ascribe bad motives to others
you tend to view others as evil and selfish and
has like sometimes when you when you create this rift
you can create the rifts so large that you look
at that other a group and you say I don't
even understand those people that they're insane they're crazy they're
so evil how could they be so evil in their
actions and the reason you can't understand is precisely because
you've already created this rift and you've oversimplified an over
stereotyped them as a group because that's a gross abstraction
that you're creating that group doesn't really exist whatever you
believe about black people or Asians or Jews or Christians
or Mormons like this is complete fantasy there is no
such thing as Mormons or Christians or Jews or or
black people I mean these are these are constructions of
your mind really now don't get me wrong that doesn't
mean that their skin color changes the skin color is
there but what you believe about it and and the
stereotypes you create and those kind of stories you tell
around that that's what you're constructing also another component that
comes with this is ridiculing and humiliating that other group
because you can't take their perspective on life seriously they
have to be ridiculed and humiliated which is why you
see a lot of this for example on YouTube have
you seen these videos on YouTube which try to be
controversial a lot of these political videos where it's like
conservative eviscerates social just you know like social justice warrior
feminists and makes her cry humiliates and ridicules and like
that's the whole like it's so juvenile the way that
a lot of politics on YouTube is done it really
is just ridicule and humiliation without really trying to get
at the other person's perspective trying to understand why is
there this difference between us what am I not seeing
that maybe they're saying how did life shape their experiences
differently and why is their worldview different than mine could
it be because they've had a different upbringing maybe they
know something I don't know none of this none of
this happens when you ridicule and humiliate the other side
so you see a lot of belittling of other perspectives
and straw meaning a lot of what the mind does
is rather than doing the hard labor the emotional work
and the intellectual work of going through somebody else's arguments
and looking through that perspective and kind of trying to
understand why does a person see the world that way
rather than doing that the perspective is just straw man
it's grossly oversimplified to the point where then it becomes
very easy to ridicule and to humiliate it and then
by doing that you don't have to seriously consider it
and therefore you can't really learn anything from it and
then that that gap is growing larger and larger and
larger and then at that point once you've straw man
the hell out of somebody's perspective then all you can
do all that's left to do is just to call
them crazy or to call them hysterical or to call
them evil or deluded another aspect of this sort of
stereotyping is the use of cliche pejoratives and we talked
about this in part one of this miniseries where I
talked about how cults will create their own jargon their
own language just like tribes do they create their own
language and of course the labels that are used are
often stereotypical and grossly oversimplified abstractions which are baked in
with the various prejudices and judgments and demonization --zz that
the tribe holds so for example a really good example
of this is the the pejorative cliche axis of evil
that was used by george w bush and one of
his speeches back in the in the 2000s and it
was coined by david fromm served a speechwriter david fromm
and this was so interesting to me does this this
idea of the axis of you ever when I heard
this like it just it made no sense to me
the axis of evil like how self-righteous an arrogant do
you have to be to lump three completely unrelated countries
together it was this this label referred to Iran Iraq
and I believe North Korea and it sort of like
you simplistically lumped these different countries with completely different histories
different ideologies different religions you lump them all together and
you call them evil like how self-serving it is to
do that and then to actually come up there to
think that you're actually you have some sophisticated analysis of
the world you have some sophisticated understanding of geopolitics by
using this label of axis of evil and yet as
silly as that sounds we do this all the time
in mainstream culture here's a few examples the label socialism
is a very loaded label there's a lot of pejorative
negativity assigned to that label and a lot of times
especially in America for example conservatives will use that label
socialism and as soon as they hear that word like
in their mind it's just like it triggers just sort
of a knee-jerk reaction like okay that's just nonsense and
it's just stupid and like the person who's holding that
perspective is just an idiot like that's that's as far
as that line of thinking goes just because that label
socialism and of course where did that whole dynamic come
came from well it came from our history with the
Soviet Union and the Cold War and all of that
and car theism and the whole Red Scare all that
stuff and of course the legitimate there are legitimate concerns
about socialism so don't make the mistake of thinking here
that I'm trying to advocate socialism as though socialism is
somehow pure and can't create problems in the world not
at all I'm just saying that the way that most
people in America think of the word socialism and I
mean it's changing now socialism is sort of getting a
renaissance these days but still a lot of people have
a lot of negative associations with the word socialism and
it's because they have this very simplistic stereotype of it
I would I would bet a lot of money that
most people who are triggered by the word socialism and
have negative associations with it that they have never actually
studied any serious socialist theory which is not to say
that they have to agree with it I'm not saying
you have to agree with it I'm just saying that
these people they've never even bothered to study it they
never even like bothered to go to Wikipedia and read
through the Wikipedia entry on socialism from beginning to end
like you know you would think that before you demonize
something before you judge something you would want to like
at least read through the whole Wikipedia page on socialism
before you do that maybe like read through Karl Marx's
works first before you start to judge it and that's
not saying it's right it's not saying it's perfect it's
not even saying that we should adopt socialism it's just
that you got to see what your mind is doing
with these simplistic stereotypical labels also another one that's very
common these days is social justice warrior it's like as
soon as you label someone that in a lot of
people mind people's minds like immediately that just triggers like
sort of an automatic response and then that person's mind
immediately either is like even for it or against it
either that person is on the right side or that
person is crazy the deluded social justice warrior or the
opposite the anti social justice warriors right and so it
creates this very simplistic black-and-white narrative another common label that's
popular these days is cultural Marxism this is a very
disgusting label because most people who say cultural Marxism have
no idea really what culture or what Marxism are nor
the combination of the two feminism of course has a
lot of cliche kind of negativity associated with it fascism
also you know so I'm not just speaking from the
left liberal perspective here a lot of a lot of
liberals for example will do the same thing with the
conservative perspective they will just say that all well the
Conservatives are all fascists and they're all racists that's also
not right that also takes away responsibility from really understanding
the conservative mindset terrorism is another label that's used like
that see it's very easy to just slap a label
terrorist on somebody and then you could say well we
can just torture that person cuz he's a terrorist or
suspected terrorist but what does that label even mean terrorists
what does that really mean this terrorists mean that you
kill innocent civilians using bombs is that what terrorism means
most people would say yeah that's basically what it means
so you know what's wrong with that isn't that wrong
isn't that evil well by that definition the United States
government is a terrorist organization because we kill civilians with
bombs all the time innocent civilians so now you're said
well no look you know so we gotta we gotta
flee oh we got to fine-tune that definition so it's
not bad is it involves more it's like terrorist is
like when it's done in the name of Allah or
something that's a terrorist well okay but you know but
who's drawing those distinctions and are you really studying the
dynamic of terrorism what it really is or are you
just lumping a bunch of stuff together you don't even
understand you've ever studied and you're just saying well those
people they like theirs they're different they're weird they're stupid
they're wrong they're crazy they're criminal so to hell with
them that's the whole point of the label terrorism is
to say to hell with them that's the whole point
of all these labels Muslim Jew I mean we can
go on there's hundreds of these labels that that are
used I'm just giving you a small little taste so
these labels are then used to create these sort of
simplistic black-and-white narratives of capitalism versus socialism the good guys
versus the bad guys the Christians versus the Muslims the
Western civilization versus all the other lesser developed civilizations and
none of these narratives are ever true the deeper you
study the the facts you discover more and more complexity
and all of these narratives they they just dissolve and
that's precisely why they're always accompanied with these sort of
knee-jerk emotional reactions precisely because those knee-jerk emotional reactions keep
you from investigating and questioning these narratives and this polarizes
people polarize a society we're seeing it happening right now
so when you stereotype the other side and you demonize
them of course automatically you're going to lack interest in
their actual statements you're going to doubt and you're going
to be suspicious of everything they say you're not gonna
be able to look at the world from their eyes
you're gonna fail to consider what points they might be
making that might be partially true and partially valid so
again it's this sort of like debate is so oversimplified
that usually it's like well whose right is it the
capitalists that are right or the Socialists that are right
and it's framed in such a way as though like
only one of them can be all right or all
wrong which is absurd because capitalism has so much different
diverse perspectives within it there are many different kinds of
capitalists and socialism also has a lot of diversity within
it too and there's a lot of overlap between the
two so they're not totally separate camps and there are
governments in fact virtually all governments are a mixture of
capitalistic elements and socialistic elements there's no purely socialist country
and there's no purely capitalist country either it's always been
a mix historically even in in China even in the
Soviet Union it's always been a mix so it's not
really a question of who's right or wrong it's a
question of what is that delicate complex balance that needs
to be struck which elements are correct which elements are
confused and there's plenty of confusion within both of them
which is not to say that there's an equal amount
of confusion you have to actually go through all the
details and figure out where where the confusion lies but
but when you stereotype that perspective as other then you're
not going to consider those partial truths that are contained
within that perspective you're you're not looking at and also
you're not going to consider the partial falsehoods or limitations
of your own perspective and so by doing this sort
of judging and stereotyping people don't critically look at their
own position and that is exactly the whole point it's
really just a smokescreen from looking at one's own position
and also a smokescreen from looking at other interpretations so
in a cult usually what's denied is that interpretation is
happening at all a point of view is presented within
a cult as though it's not a point of view
at all as though there was no interpretation as though
it's just factual just the facts and this is where
I have a lot of criticism against science because science
you would think well Leo surely the opposite of a
cult is science and you would never find cult-like dynamics
within science but what does science do as a collective
body but present its perspective on the world as though
it's the ultimate factual truth and that no interpretation is
involved within science and that size is just an objective
matter that's how science is presented now of course really
high quality scientists know better really high quality scientists who
have studied some epistemology they understand that actually science comes
with a lot of interpretation and that most of reality
presents us with various facts and this problem called under
determination which means that the problem is that there's a
lot of different theories and models that we can create
for the exact same set of facts so which model
and theory are you gonna choose this is what's called
a reality sort of being under determined and and see
most people don't understand this about science well if you
understand there can be multiple interpretations and just how much
interpretation is going on with them signs and this leads
to a false sense of certainty because when you believe
that what you've got is raw your facts and that
no interpretation no subjectivity was involved at all then it
seems like well there could be no other possibility this
must be the truth because you know science is not
a perspective it's just the objective truth that's a very
common trap that many scientists fall into of course part
of this whole dynamic of stereotyping and judging is closed
mindedness which we've talked a lot about in the past
and also projection so what the ego is doing in
all this judging and stereotyping is that really it's a
lot of times offloading those aspects of itself or of
reality that it doesn't like its shadow and it's projecting
that unto others so for example with terrorism collectively what
the American collective ego is doing is that it doesn't
like to admit that the US military and various geopolitical
maneuvering that we do as a country hurts a lot
of innocent people kills a lot of innocent people we
bond a lot of innocent people in trying to defend
our borders as a country but see that's that's all
sublimated that becomes our collective shadow the American collective shadow
and then that's projected out onto the terrorists and so
now we fight a crusade against the terrorists who are
the ones who kill all the civilians and we say
how evil they are for doing that and of course
the terrorists aren't aren't angels they are Devils and in
certain cases they need to be stopped no question about
that but you got to look deeper at what is
really behind behind the emotionality of this idea of terrorism
and a lot of it is sort of the sort
of unconscious projection of our collective shadow onto other nations
calling other nations the axis of evil you know but
take a look at how many civilians America has killed
over the last 50 years compared to other nations and
I would bet that we come up pretty high on
the list maybe number one pretty high up there so
yeah watch out for projection so all of these sub
components that I was talking about was just sub components
of the one sub component of cold dynamics called judging
and stereotyping and creating this group of other creating the
enemy out there so notice how your favorite group does
this if you're part of an online forum a reddit
sub group notice how you do this if you're part
of a sports team notice how you do this if
you're in a corporation notice how you do this against
your corporate enemies the corporate enemy is out there you
know if you're if you're an employee of Microsoft you
do this against maybe Google or Facebook or Apple and
vice versa notice that your political party does this notice
how your religious group does this notice how your family
does this there's a lot there to notice of course
notice how you do it personally to another subcomponent now
we're moving on so now the next sub component after
judging and stereotyping is claims to absolute truth and denials
of relativity this is something that cults do very characteristically
but it's something that most groups do many people do
this is they make claims to absolute truth and they
deny relativity now of course you're gonna say Blio but
you talk about the absolute truth so aren't you falling
prey to this very same dynamic that you're speaking against
well first of all you got to realize don't fall
into the trap of demonizing all of these dynamics these
dynamics are are not just really about cults these dynamics
or dynamics of survival this is how the mind survives
so I'm not saying that all these dynamics are certainly
bad or that then they can all be avoided but
also you have to make a distinction between those people
who make claims to absolute truth who have not actually
realized directly realized absolute truth and those who have now
that might seem like well leo but that's a self-serving
distinction cuz you're porting yourself into that category of people
who have supposedly become conscious of the absolute truth and
then the other people who haven't so how do you
know how do we know who has and who hasn't
directly become conscious of the absolute truth how do we
know who's right and that's exactly my point is that
you don't you will never know until you yourself one
day stumble into the absolute truth and when it blindsides
you and it mind [ __ ] you then you
will know but you will never be able to convince
anyone else or tell anyone else about it so it's
like a black hole you go in there and only
you know what's inside and nobody else will ever know
that's how absolute truth works so I'm not asking you
to believe me that I have the absolute truth nor
am i saying that the things I talk about are
the absolute truth because nothing I talk about is the
absolute truth because the absolute truth can't be talked about
so one of the ways you can distinguish between people
who are legitimately in possession of the absolute truth and
those who aren't is that those who are who are
conscious of the absolute truth they will steer you away
and they will tell you that absolute truth cannot be
spoken of nothing can be said about it and that
no belief is it no idea is it no Matt
of talking will get you there and that it can't
be qualified at any way whatsoever because that's what makes
it absolute for that you need to have an Enlightenment
experience but anyways I digress now back to the point
is that notice your organization your group whether it's a
religious group your family or whatever what is held as
the absolute truths of your group of your community of
your society of your culture that's not really the absolute
truth never the culture never possess absolute truth but it
sure does make a lot of claims to it so
be very mindful that also be mindful of your own
claims to absolute truth unless you've actually directly experienced absolute
truth and you know what that word is referring to
then you haven't experienced it and in that case you
can't make claims to it and any claims that you
may do make to it anything you do hold is
absolutely true is not its relative another sub component is
a sense of absolute self-righteousness uncertainty that often comes with
of course the previous component of claims to absolute truth
notice that the more cult-like an organization is the more
self-righteousness it will exhibit and the more certainty it will
have in its actions and behaviors and in its doctrines
another sub component is that notice within cult-like groups how
they tend to present one monolithic worldview that promises a
solution to all of life's problems they don't acknowledge the
importance of multi-perspective ilysm of putting on different lenses and
looking at the world from different lenses and different perspectives
almost never does a cult encourage that and so one
way you can evaluate how cult-like an organization is is
how much does it encourage the exploration of multiple perspectives
and you can see in my own work I do
that quite a lot I'm really passionate about that I
love that and that's precisely what keeps you from getting
locked into one perspective because see a cults whole purpose
sort of is to lock you into one perspective it
wants to monopolize the truth that's what the ego wants
to do the ego loves to monopolize things and of
course that's another dynamic while we're talking about it another
subcomponent how you can evaluate how cult-like is an organization
how much seek to dominate and monopolize whatever it's involved
with and you can see a lot of examples of
this within business for example businesses how monopolistic is your
corporation how much do they want to dominate and eliminate
all other competitors and you see many businesses are like
that and you might say Lea all businesses like that
no it's actually possible to run a business which is
not monopolistic that would be a more higher consciousness business
conscious capitalism that's sort of what I try to practice
for example I make I make no aspirations to monopolize
the teaching of self improvement or self actualization and I
make no attempts to monopolize the truth or I know
I make no attempts to try to monopolize the entire
field because like to me that that's silly I'm kind
of more conscious than than that I see how that
would turn my organization into a cancer I don't want
actually the hurt to become a cancer that's what a
cancer does is it tries to monopolize everything it tries
to grow infinitely for example you see many tech companies
and big pharma companies doing this they create patents they
try to seize these patents on these patents they try
to lobby government in order to give them more power
so they can they can not be regulated they can
just spread themselves out everywhere so aunt Amazon is sort
of doing this you know sticking its tentacles into every
aspect of everything so like if we would let Amazon
what Amazon would do unless it became conscious enough the
leaders of it became conscious enough is that it would
spread itself into every corner of society into every country
across the entire world and he'll try to monopolize everything
and basically enslave the entire world now and I'm not
saying this against Jeff Bezos or against Amazon I'm saying
that almost any modern corporation basically is trying to do
this but of course it fails it doesn't succeed because
actually the way that reality is structured it's not possible
to monopolize reality um and that that's a deeper point
that I'll talk about later but it's not possible because
reality is structured in such a way as to maximize
diversity so there's always a there's always this never-ending back
and forth between monopolization and diversity and so what happens
is that consciousness is always sort of trying to monopolize
everything but then it also crumbles under its own weight
and so eventually what will happen is that Amazon will
get so big too big that other forces will come
into play and it will break it apart government will
crackdown on it you know people will start to resent
it they will lose customers and you're already basically starting
to see some of this starting to happen and also
because they become so big they are unable to innovate
they are unable to be creatively flexible in all this
and so eventually smaller companies will actually over take them
in certain fields and so this is how all of
reality works is through a proliferation of diversification this is
how species evolve and how life evolves how technology works
how how business works how government works how nations work
how races work this is very very deep point I'm
getting a loft rack so so there's that watch out
for this Tennessee within yourself and within your organization you
know many religions try to do this and the way
that you can evaluate the quality of a religion is
how monopolistic is it does it try to convert everybody
then it's a pretty low consciousness religion if that's his
goal whereas not all religions are like that there are
some religions that aren't like that they're not trying to
convert the whole world like for example in fact this
is one of the nice things about Judaism is that
actually a lot of times like if you want to
become a new Jew you want to convert to Judaism
then you might go to a rabbi and the rabbi
rather than saying okay yeah come on come on come
on let's let's get people off the street to become
more Jews and more Jews rather than doing that most
rabbis if they're serious actually what they do is they'll
try to dissuade you they'll say oh well why do
you want to become a Jew being a good Jews
not good what why prove to me that you really
should be a Jew and maybe I'll think about it
and a lot of temples do this as well like
if you want to become a Zen monk one story
I heard about how it works in Japan in certain
temples is that you have to go there and you
have to you have to knock on their gate if
you want to come a new monk you have to
come with a letter of recommendation from some from some
previous monk then you have to knock on the gate
you have to slip them the the letter of recommendation
and then they make you sit outside the gates for
48 hours and you keep knocking and you keep asking
like hey can I come in I would have come
up and they say no go away you're worthless we're
never gonna accept you and so they keep doing that
and do you have to keep knocking and they keep
kicking you out kicking you out until you know and
know and no they don't they so they do this
for 48 hours and then if you sit through all
that finally they'll open the game to let you in
so it's like the opposite of trying to proselytize and
convert others that's the sign of a of a more
evolved sort of religion another subcomponent of cults is that
they love to emotionally manipulate and control people they love
to intimidate to charm to seduce to withhold approval and
love to shower people with disapproval and scorn to ridicule
them to humiliate them finding ways to squeeze them to
pressure them to leverage them to put them into an
impossible position because this is what low consciousness egos do
is they behave this way so notice how much your
organization does this your company your boss your religious leaders
your managers your political leaders you know the more they
do this the less consciously developed they are this desire
to control people is just like a dead giveaway of
underdeveloped people highly developed highly conscious people do not have
a desire to control or manipulate anyone and in fact
manipulation and this specially psychological and emotional manipulation if you're
doing it for example in relationships this is one of
those things that it's just a dead giveaway that you
have a lot more work to do because manipulation actually
separates you from from truth and from being but more
on that later there's a lot to say about manipulation
but one other sub component is also the manipulation of
lower emotions so a lot of times you'll notice corporations
groups people trying to manipulate you specifically appealing to fear
anger hatred guilt embarrassment because they know that these are
the emotions that sort of get a knee-jerk response from
you making you very easily manipulated to do that person's
bidding so if I want you to attack someone for
me or if I want you to donate lots of
money to me or if I want you to to
work long hours for me one of the ways I
can do that is I can try to manipulate you
by scaring you or by making you hate some other
group out there or by making you feel very guilty
and so you'll donate to me you see so you
can see how from my perspective as the one who's
doing the manipulation it would it would be very profitable
and very lucrative in a in a set in a
sense that it would significantly increase my odds of survival
and reproduction if I was really good at manipulating lower
consciousness emotions which you can see our current President of
the United States doing very well right now see that's
his whole thing that's his whole shake that's all he
does that's what he's done been doing his whole life
he's a master at manipulating lower emotions and that's what
demagogues do cuz demagogues usually they're not very conscious but
they can certainly whip someone into a frenzy you know
Hitler was great and whipping himself and his people into
a into a you know a racist frenzy of fear
and anger and hatred and blind and demonization and then
you know when you do that then that can be
very very motivating you can you can move mountains with
that force of energy but it's also very toxic and
pathological and self-destructive in the end as you see you
know what happened so it works for a short time
but then it collapses and you of course you see
that happening with with the current administration in the u.s.
do you see the presidency collapsing you see the Republican
Party collapsing right now and that's why because unconscious dynamics
are sustainable they only work in the short-term another sub
component of cult dynamics is cults tend to be very
materialistic and pragmatic in an odd sort of way so
on the one hand cults can be very sort of
idealistic and they can have lofty religious purposes and goals
and a lot of religions have you know these spiritual
goals and it seems like religion is the opposite of
materialism or is it look at how those people actually
behave sure they love to cloak themselves in lofty ideals
and talking about Christ and the love of Christ and
how how important it is to to be christ-like but
then look at their actual lives and mostly what you
see is that you see these very same people actually
being extremely materialistic and pragmatic in their business endeavors in
the way that they recruit people to their religion in
the way that they even conceive of religion you know
of a physical heaven that you go to of a
physical God somewhere in the clouds with the beard who
physically wrote a Bible this is all a very materialistic
version of religion and it's actually very pragmatic like for
example you look at the Catholic Church you would think
that well the Catholic Church they're crazy and they're living
up in fantasy land no the Catholic Church is extremely
pragmatic they run that organization just like a business they
they have bank accounts with billions of dollars they they
have sophisticated infrastructure for handling donations axes i mean they
have their own bureaucracy they have like basically their own
government in the vatican they're extremely bureaucratic and pragmatic and
super materialistic which is the whole hypocrisy and the whole
ridiculousness of it anytime that a religious or spiritual organization
becomes pragmatic and materialistic you can already tell it's gone
off their own track i mean it's it's on the
wrong track and so when this happens ethical principles fly
out the window because they're violated in pursuit of success
so look at how your organization does is to look
at how your corporation your business does this do you
really care about following ethical principles or you know is
it success at any cost and he means most marketing
works this way most marketing the way that it's taught
it's like well if they get you the most eyeballs
then who gives a [ __ ] do it doesn't
matter and most large fortune 500 companies operate this way
so like for example if there's a big pharmaceutical company
and they're making an evaluation of whether to put some
new drug on the market or not and then one
of their scientists you know says but you know this
drug has certain side effects that might kill a few
people and then they might sue us and that would
be bad and the way the business managers think about
that the wall street types is they say well but
okay so how many peoples are gonna kill okay so
it's gonna kill only a hundred people okay so hundred
people each one of them Souza's for five million dollars
that's 500 million dollars okay but how much are we
gonna make oh we're gonna make twenty billion dollars okay
yeah just let's do it who cares I mean we're
internet positive we're net profit-making so it doesn't matter we'll
just pay the legal fees and we'll we'll you know
we'll make some settlements it won't matter it's very typical
stage large thinking also marketing through stimulation of fear greed
and vanity how common is that look at how most
marketing is done look at the buttons they're trying to
push in you also marketing through controversy polarization click fake
titles have you seen this I mean most of the
internet most of main kriem internet is is predicated upon
this most youtube videos the most popular YouTube channels they're
all predicated upon what controversy polarization click big titles scandalous
topics and scandalous thumbnail pictures tabloid type stuff so that's
a cult-like dynamic that I want you to see look
at how even the government does this it's not just
business for example in wartime during World War two I've
shown this before I've shows the posters of how the
US government demonized the Japanese literally as demons with fangs
and claws or how they demonized Nazis also as Devils
and vice versa you know they do the exact same
thing in the other country to us another sub component
of cult dynamics is the lust for power money sex
fame love meaning and purpose so how much does your
organization lust after those things how much is it fueled
by those things the more it is the more the
more cult-like is gonna be another sub component of cult
behavior is a heightened sense of self-importance and a belief
in a divine mission and of course this divine mission
then justifies any means so how much do you believe
you have a divine mission and how much how willing
are you to pursue it at any means do you
have a divine sense of self-importance and mission such that
if I said that all well you could you could
kill that puppy over there and it would help if
it would help you to achieve your divine mission would
you kill that puppy and you would say yeah sure
no problem it's all good as long as my mission
gets minute well that's very cult-like now of course most
people wouldn't do that but you know hey never underestimate
the Wall Street types they probably would lower a basket
of puppies into it until cauldron of boiling water if
you know if it earned them a few million dollars
so take a look at how much you do that
as well also another sub component is pride taking pride
that you are part of the good guys this dynamic
is is very prevalent for example in sports and sports
of course are extremely tribal have a lot of collective
ego in them the whole point of almost watching sports
is less about the sport and more about the pride
pride in your country if it's the Olympics or pride
in your city or in your state in your in
your team it's rather ridiculous what do you think about
all sports really do they'll appeal of sports it's just
it's like it's preying on low consciousness pride another common
dynamic with cults is that they tend to split off
and form new sub cults and sub groups and as
they do that they always demonize the old one that
they left so you see this with the history of
religion most clearly but it happens for example with businesses
and corporations as well you see this all the time
is sort of like it's almost like a bacterium you
know splitting through through fission it splits apart crates little
baby bacteria and the baby always like demonizes the parent
sorta in this situation right because the whole point of
this cult or this group is that it's trying to
create its own sense of identity so oftentimes the best
way to do that is to split off from some
larger group create yourself but then of course because you're
small you're still small you're not as big as the
mama bacteria you're still small and you want to kind
of assert yourself in the world and so the way
that you do that because you're small and you're insecure
and all this is that you actually attack the thing
that you came from and of course a lot of
children do this with parents do that's why children rebellions
parents why teenagers do that because they want to establish
their own sense of identity and what's the fastest way
to establish your own sense of identity demonizing some other
group and in your mind clearly drawing a line between
this is what I represent and that evil stuff is
what they represent of course oftentimes what that is the
projection of your own shadow into that other so you
see this you see for example a lot of let's
take Christianity the fragmentation of Christianity so Christianity was basically
a cult of Judaism then once Christianity took over became
mainstream then you had sort of the split between Catholics
and Orthodox Eastern Orthodox Christians which are still found in
Eastern Europe and in that part of the world and
then the Catholics themselves during the Protestant Reformation they split
apart into the various Protestant groups and there was all
so many different during process Reformation or so many different
sub sects and cults of Christianity and then we had
in America later we had Mormonism then Mormonism splitable why
this was just kind of it just kind of fragments
like this into this bouquet of diversity so I want
you to notice how your organization does that or how
you do that in your life that can be quite
eye-opening and especially watch for the demonization part so it's
not a problem to split off you know it's okay
to for example be part of Microsoft and then come
up with your own business idea and then start your
own business that's okay nothing wrong with that and maybe
you compete with Microsoft the problem where gets pathological is
when you start to demonize see sort of demonize like
all Microsoft they're the evil ones because they're trying to
out-compete me and a lot like that and then of
course the big group also falls prey to this dynamic
so like for example a lot of times what happens
is that the big group will then try to crack
down on the little group so for example when the
Protestants were trying to split off from from the Catholics
the Catholics of course try to crack down and of
course there was physical violence physical coercion various kinds of
ink were started and probably many kinds of Wars resulted
from from this because basically they didn't want the the
diversity of Christianity they wanted to monopolize Christianity to there's
one simple thing and basically the same thing happened during
the civil war you know the Confederacy wanted to split
off from the entire US and of course the entire
US a union you know it didn't want to let
that happen so there's a whole war about that so
you see this everywhere in society everywhere in history look
out for that another thing I told you is that
subcomponent of cult-like behavior is that you're told to ignore
your own perceptions notice how this happens in whatever enterprise
you're a part of this is a very sneaky one
for example science does this and most people would deny
that science tells us to ignore our perceptions and yet
exactly that's exactly what science does science is almost predicated
upon the rejection of first-person phenomena so for example you
tell a scientist that you had a mystical experience what's
he gonna do he's gonna dismiss that and say oh
well that's just first-person phenomena that's just perceptions doesn't matter
perceptions could be confused you're just hallucinating or you tell
a science it's about a psychedelic you say here take
the psychedelic he says know what what's the point of
taking a psychedelic because if I take this psychedelic it's
just gonna be hallucinations and just experience sensory data sensory
experiences and perceptions and we know that you can't pay
science on perceptions first-person experience see science rejects phenomenology science
rejects the subjective that Sciences shadow is the subjective and
first-person phenomena which is of course the only thing that
exists and the only thing science could be predicated upon
but because science is in denial about it has to
repress that projected outwards and then science demonizes religious groups
and mystics and people who use psychedelics and all this
other sort of phenomenal investigation science demonizes that because because
that's sort of inherent to the enterprise of modern science
because it's rejecting perceptions literally to be a modern scientist
you have to clam it's crazy you have to ignore
perceptions that's what you have to do to be a
great scientist because you have to be completely absorbed and
lost to compete with other side you have to be
completely absorbed in lost within concepts within your imagination to
create scientific theories the scientific theories our imagination concepts they're
not perceptions you can't perceive a scientific theory you don't
perceive gravity you invent gravity with your mind as a
concept and as a theory and then you formalize it
using equations and things and then have to convince yourself
that all of those equations formalizations and models and maps
that you made are actually real and that they were
out there in the world and that you didn't actually
create them and that they're more real than your first-person
experience of life and that that stuff your imagination all
your concepts and theories that that's what's objective and this
this stuff here what you actually feel and experience actuality
that this is this is all the flaky stuff this
is all the subjective stuff it's a complete 180 devilry
is what it is you're turning black into white and
white to black all of modern science is predicated upon
this notice this double check for yourself don't believe me
another stuffed component is fear that the world is coming
to an end and this this sense of urgency that
motivates you to take action notice how common this is
fear that the world is coming to an end see
the ego always fears death that's what it's always struggling
against and there's different versions of this so spawn dynamic
stage blue people for example will fear that the world
is coming to an end because the moral fabric of
society is unraveling and it's all those social justice warriors
and and gay people and minority who are taking over
and it's all now becoming vulgar and no one has
any moral upstanding anymore no one believes and reads the
holy book this is what's gonna destroy society that's how
stage blue things you know it's like God is gonna
punish us and deliver Armageddon because of the gay people
you can go find videos of preachers talking this way
I'm not making this [ __ ] up that's rather
a message blue-eyed ass brother name is sage orange it
changes the fear of the world coming to an end
is different now it's a now maybe it's gonna be
more like a fear of economic collapse or maybe fear
the world will come to an end because terrorists will
get a hold of a nuclear weapon and it's those
crazy religious people you know it's all of the religion
if we could just get rid of religion society would
be perfect everything would be peachy and science would deliver
us to to salvation that's the origin version of this
Armageddon story and then the stage green version of this
arm again story is is of course global warming and
he cannot or ecological collapse that's the green version and
and see see all of this this motivates cult-like behavior
at every stage the spiral in a different way this
gets the ego a sense of urgency now we can
rally a group around this you know stage blue people
will rally a mob you know fundamentalist religious mob stage
orange people will you know rally some military industrial complex
to go destroy the terrorists and the stage green people
will come into a circle a drum circle to talk
about you know global warming and stuff like this and
then this will create a shared ideology between those people
and then now we're off to the races now we
have a group now we can create a structure around
this now we can monetize this now we can you
know create a whole collective ego around this now we
can demonize everyone else that we don't agree with and
then so people disagree about what's going to lead to
the collapse of of the world and of course what
that really is is just a projection of themselves it
doesn't say so much about the world it says more
about you whatever you're a theory of how the world
is gonna end that says something about you so like
if you fear that AI are gonna kill us all
well that says something about you and where you are
are at your level of consciousness and development and then
when you're at the highest level you ain't gonna give
a [ __ ] if the world ends tomorrow it
won't matter to you you'll be you'll be sitting there
with a smile on your face it won't matter because
you realize it's all just a dream another subcomponent of
cults is they create a sense of identity through being
a good rule keeper don't underestimate this dynamic a lot
of people find it very attractive to be the rule
keepers in the world they really like they get off
on this they love keeping the rules these are really
the people who are like the military types the policemen
of the world the firefighters the the religious moralists you
know they get their whole sense of identity from being
a rule keeper and so I'm gonna be the good
one because I'm gonna enforce the rules against all those
other evil people out there I'm gonna be the policeman
of the world and of course is the policeman I'm
the I'm the good one I'm the morally righteous one
so notice how you do that notice how your group
or business or religion or political party does that another
sub component of cult behavior is loyalty and favoritism over
competence notice how much your group or your boss or
whoever does this do they tend to prefer competent people
or those who are most loyal to them the less
developed a person is the less conscious they are they're
gonna go for loyalty and favoritism over competence because competence
requires a certain objectivity and you have to stand off
you have to separate yourself at least a little bit
from your own personal egoic needs in order to be
able to evaluate various people's competencies and then pick the
one that's actually competent so like maybe you have three
people who apply to your job let's say you have
an important job and you will have an Asian person
a black person and a white person apply and then
you know you have you have a guy who's the
boss who's making these decisions he's not very developed not
very conscious and he's himself as white so of course
you know he's automatically gonna show favoritism to the other
white candidate like automatically because even though the it would
be better in the long run for his business to
really pick the most competent person let's say maybe the
black person is the most competent one looking at the
resume but that won't matter because the ego will be
so selfish and so self-involved with its prejudices and stereotypes
that it will it will discount that and pick the
white one and it'll it'll convince itself that actually the
white one is the one who's most competent and it'll
create various kinds of stories and justifications to convince to
convince that person that he's made the right choice see
so to outgrow that you have to develop yourself and
become more conscious become conscious of these self biases that
you have and then learn to be objective but that's
very hard to do if you're wrapped up in all
these cult dynamics another common sub component of cults is
indoctrination camps and trainings how many indoctrination camps and trainings
have you gone to in your life and with which
organizations your religious organizations Sunday school elementary school middle school
high school university graduate school business trainings what is that
but indoctrination camps also indoctrination of the youth that's a
very common characteristic of religions and cults they want to
get you early because that's the easiest way to to
inject yourself permanently into someone's mind is to get that
person early you know get them with that religion when
they're still you know three years old baptize them real
young start reading to them real young about the Bible
about Jesus and all this right so um but don't
think that this is somehow exclusive to Christianity or a
religion this is exactly what happened to you with science
for example or with atheism or with whatever kind of
judgments that your parents taught you or with whatever kind
of racial preferences you have it was all indoctrinated into
you when you were still very young and that's fundamentally
why this work is so difficult why histology is so
difficult because it was hardwired into you when you were
so young that you weren't you weren't independent enough to
really have a choice and so now you have to
you have to basically undo that programming that's very difficult
to do because it's lodged very deeply inside your brainstem
another common sub component is exploitation of workers cults love
to do that how much does your organization love to
do that how much do you love to exploit workers
yourself also overwork is used as an indoctrination technique in
many cults what they do is they overwork you to
actually help to doctrine ate you because when you're so
busy working you don't have time to really think for
yourself or to become independent but then again how many
non traditional non classic cult groups do this as well
for example the US Army does this with boot camps
many corporations do this many for example dr. residency's if
you're trying to become a doctor in the United States
they will work you to death many prestigious law firms
will work there new lawyers to death in this way
and you might think well that's just because you know
they need to get a lot of work done well
that's true on the one hand but on the other
hand there's sort of a a much more subtle and
sneaky and devilish motive actually behind this tactic is that
by overworking you so much they make it easier to
indoctrinate you and to make you part of their collective
whatever that is you know so by putting you through
the wringer of a military-style boot camp in the Army
for example that get that gets lodged very deeply inside
your brain and then that that will that conditioning will
now run you for the rest of your life that's
how a lot of our maybe people are and you
know same way for a lot of these doctors and
lawyers you know once you go through one of these
brutal residency's as a doctor you know you're gonna be
fully bought in to the Western medical establishment you're gonna
be fully bought into that entire system it's gonna be
very difficult for you to to ever leave that or
to question that or to consider other non-western paradigms and
of course that's good for the system that's good for
big farm and that's good for the whole medical industry
in the United States that's good for the status quo
because they don't want you to have time like as
a doctor you know they don't want you to actually
have time to like question their practices they don't want
you to actually question Big Pharma and question Western medicine
and to actually ask the question like wait a minute
I gave this pill to my patient but you know
I sell a patient a month later and he didn't
get better like if you're so busy working all the
time you don't have time to check in with your
patients a month later to see if what you actually
did for them actually solve the root issue or not
because most doctors I got kept so busy there just
writing out prescriptions they're not even checking with their patient
not even asking the patient like what the real issues
are they're just right now prescriptions I mean it's insane
and you know some fraternities and sororities have like hazing
processes brutal hazing processes that they will put their members
new members through precisely because that allows you to indoctrinate
people better and then you know working together against some
external obstacle that brings people together another common tactic is
keeping a tight schedule so you're so busy that you
don't have time to really ask questions and that's a
lot of what schools do colleges do you know one
of the most toxic elements of our education system right
now in the West I don't know how it is
in other places but in America I assume in Europe
as well it's like we just we put students through
the wringer of like taking more and more AP classes
and just like more tests and more studying and it's
like more more and more and then you need like
summer school then you gotta take extra classes and this
that is you're just so busy basically from the point
where you enter high school to like the end of
your university studies that by the time you're done with
that like you had no time there for deep self-reflection
and deep contemplation and really thinking through the theories and
the ideas actually matching them up with your direct experiences
and like working with them and like understanding them like
almost none of that is possible because you're just constantly
just trying to keep up with the school workload and
memorization and tests and scantrons and multiple-choice questions and this
and that and extracurricular activities try to get into college
and trying to be you know the perfect student all
of that that's basically a cult indoctrination technique right there
another sub component of cult-like behavior is sophisticated PR campaigns
and fake front organizations but this is not exclusive to
cults companies do this oil companies do this they pharma
companies do this political action committees and organizations do this
all the time um you know the devil needs a
fake front because he can't be looking like a devil
he has to paint himself as an angel and that
takes a lot of work you know there's there's thousands
probably millions of people in the United States alone working
for these PR campaigns and marketing groups and fake front
organizations just to give a nice pretty face to all
of the [ __ ] and egotism and selfishness that
this corporation organization puts out and does to mask it
you see so there has to be a an enormous
self-deception campaign or just deception campaign going on and of
course these these people who work on these fake fronts
and all these marketing campaigns they convince themselves that actually
what they're doing is they're just making a living and
they don't see the larger dynamic that they're playing how
they're contributing to the evil of the world through their
marketing marketing is like the devil's favorite tool for for
masking and spreading is evil doublespeak is another component of
cults and what doublespeak is is just language which calls
something the opposite of what it actually is so basically
as a devil I'm gonna call black white and white
black I'm gonna call whatever I'm doing good even though
what it might be is evil so if I'm lying
I'm gonna call myself honest you know if I'm cheating
I'm gonna say that I'm actually not if I'm stealing
I'm actually gonna paint myself as though what I'm doing
is actually donating or giving or helping rather than stealing
if I'm leeching off someone I'm gonna say that I'm
contributing to them and helping them so cults create these
kinds of labels these doublespeak like labels and so does
society various kinds of euphemisms that we use to kind
of whitewash our egotism collectively and individually so notice how
you do that notice that your organization does that another
sub component of cults is obedience to mechanical rules and
norms you can very clearly see this within religion but
you also see it for example within academia you see
it in universities you see it in schools you see
it in businesses you see it within bureaucracies and governments
notice how you yourself become obedient and addicted to various
kinds of mechanical rules and norms another sub component is
impossible ideals so if you've noticed with traditional fundamentalist religion
one of the problems that it puts up these high
ideals of how you're supposed to be christ-like and how
you're supposed to be super religious and all of this
and how you're not supposed to be tempted by sex
and tempted by money but then of course deep down
inside these are all just facade these are just words
just ideas and fantasies the person is not conscious or
developed enough to actually be able to embody these ideals
and so cults tend to have these impossible ideals that
very few people can meet which of course makes you
feel guilty it makes you feel you're not like you're
not good enough ruins your self-esteem and that makes you
even more susceptible to the cult or to the religion
or to the business sources or whatever you know fill
in the blank maybe your parents did this to you
set you up with various kinds of impossible ideals and
denied you love because you weren't able to meet these
ideals and now you know you're still running around trying
to get the approval of your father or your mother
a big subcomponent of cult-like behavior is of course seeking
comfort in certainty and authority that's one of the key
things that a cult offers is certainty that you have
the right worldview and an authority figure and don't overlook
the appeal of an authority figure because very many people
grew up in dysfunctional families without decent fathers or mothers
who were negligent or absent or whatever and they never
really had that father figure or that mother figure that
they really wanted and oftentimes even if the father or
mother was there they didn't love them or they were
too idealistic with them or they were too disapproving of
them they didn't approve your career they didn't approve your
relationships we had sex with what kind of boys or
girls you like in all this right they didn't approve
how you dressed so imagine now what if you could
find a new mother or father surrogate sort of authority
figure and now this one will will offer you the
answers to all of life and truth and now you
don't need to actually go and explore the world you
don't need to read a bunch of books you don't
need to struggle through meditation and self inquiring contemplation studying
a bunch of different perspectives this takes a lot of
time a lot of money a lot of energy gets
expended on this mental emotional labor you know it's difficult
reconciling these paradoxes you're trying to sort through out through
all this stuff you're confused so instead of all that
you could just go find a father and mother figure
some guru who you will outsource the seeing of truth
to you will just ask them anytime you have a
question about life you're not gonna question yourself or try
to like introspect and find the answer within you you're
gonna try to get the answer from them and then
you're gonna of course start to worship their personality you're
gonna get attracted by their charisma and their charm and
their eloquence of course they're gonna be eloquent they're gonna
be nicely dressed and they're gonna be you're gonna look
up to them like a father figure or mother figure
because this one you could actually choose you know your
real mother or father you couldn't choose them but here
you have to choose when you can find one that
fits with your own wounds and emotional egoic needs and
then of course you're gonna start to worship this leader
and follow this leader and that becomes an addiction in
and of itself is just to surrender to some leader
who tells you what to do with your life and
gives you all the answers to life there's a sort
of a tendency in human beings to try to please
powerful father figures both for men and for women a
lot of men most of what they spend their life
doing is just trying to like please their fathers and
so so this tendency for an authority figure becomes very
seductive so notice how this is happening not just in
cults but this is happening in religions mainstream religions it's
happening in politics it's happening in government it's happening in
business it's happening within sports it's happening with actors and
celebrities it's happening with YouTube youtubers you know notice how
you do this how you create these sorts of leaders
notice how you do that with myself there's a sort
of a leader follower dependency fantasy that's created as though
like you're following me and then you don't want to
disappoint me and then I don't want to disappoint you
and we get this kind of dynamic going and that's
a lot of what happens within cults and then of
course once this happens you start to idolize and lionize
the the leader the authority figure because they are dispensing
truth to you and they are a sense of direction
in your life because you don't want to take responsibility
for actually making hard choices you just want to be
told what to do and then of course by that
time now you start to believe that the leader can
do no wrong because you you want to paint a
simplistic picture of the leader as either good or bad
black and white and this is what happens this is
what this what's happening with Trump right now is his
supporters see yeah he see him as not being to
do any wrong not being able to do any wrong
and then you know look at this happening in Islam
with Mohammed Mohammed can do no wrong look at Buddhists
with the Buddha Buddha can do no wrong look at
the rajneeshees with Osho Osho can do no wrong look
at the Pope in in Catholicism the Pope is infallible
so notice how this happens outside of religion part of
this the subcomponent of certainty and authority is also blaming
whistleblowers so as soon as someone in the group stands
up and starts just maybe badmouth the leader or whatever
then oftentimes the whistleblower gets blamed and demonized and scapegoated
look at for example what happened with Edward Snowden and
the whole NSA spying wiretapping situations going on here in
the US you know he was demonized basically um might
even be executed in the future the u.s. gets its
hands on him of course unwillingness to admit wrongdoing goes
on in order to reinforce the sense of certainty and
authority rejection of criticism and feedback of course no cults
allow for criticism or feedback and many other kinds of
organizations also suppress it so notice how your organization does
that the more conscious and developing organization the more it's
gonna allow for criticism and the various kinds of feedback
and it's actually gonna solicit feedback and take the feedback
seriously and of course avoidance of responsibility the whole appeal
of joining a cult is that you get to avoid
responsibility so notice how you do that with other kinds
of groups that you join it helps you to avoid
responsibility and independent thinking and making your own decisions another
sub component of cults like we talked about in part
one is that whole remember that pyramid structure that authoritative
pyramid structure well I want you to notice more broadly
in society all the areas that you see a pyramid
structure that requires constant growth in order to sustain it
that's literally the definition of a pyramid scheme so notice
how many pyramid scheme like structures there are in society
like the military industrial complex or the government's or corporations
or Wall Street or capitalism as a whole requires for
example never-ending economic growth which is absurd Wall Street requires
company to grow faster and faster and faster they don't
care about how much the company earns they care about
how much the company earns more than it did last
year so they want an acceleration of earnings every single
year but of course it's impossible it's unsustainable it's a
really kind like a pyramid scheme and it's waiting to
collapse so notice how this this kind of structure happens
and then also notice how people this is not a
very prototypical cult dynamic is that people try to position
themselves at the top of the pyramid in order to
leech off of it that's the whole point of starting
a cult for the cult leader is to leech off
the top of the pyramid so notice how that's happening
within government with lobbyists and corrupt political leaders in the
military with corporations you know how many people are in
corporations are trying to climb the corporate ladder to the
very top because they know they can leech off of
that because the higher they get the more power they're
gonna have the more they can exploit the everyone below
them that's the whole point of these pyramid schemes notice
how even in universities this is their pyramid schemes and
universities mmm most organizations yeah I'm not saying a pyramid
scheme or just a hierarchy is necessarily wrong I mean
hierarchies are actually very important and I'll talk in the
future about hierarchies they do serve important structural functions within
within nature and reality as a whole so we need
hierarchies you can't just level every every hierarchy but I
want you to specifically notice how people build these pyramid
schemes with the intent to leech off of them and
how maybe you are doing the same thing with your
business or your corporation or your organization or your religious
movement or whatever another sub component we talked about with
cults is information control secrecy and lack of transparency so
this is super common across all of business government and
basically religion and everywhere filled with all sorts of secrecy
and lack of transparency and that's because the ego and
the devil you know does its dirty work in the
shadows not in the light so notice how you do
this or your organizations do this trying to conceal the
true agenda of your business or your corporation or your
your entity notice you know the skeletons that are hidden
in the closet even within your own family for example
notice how information is controlled house Christy in Maine is
maintained and the lack of transparency that's their lack of
open lines of communication in your intimate relationships notice how
this goes on notice how much you withhold information and
how secretive you are in your intimate relationship in your
marriage that's cult-like behavior right there another common characteristic of
cults is restricting contact with outsiders hanging out only with
people you agree with hanging out with people only of
your race or your religious orientation well notice how you
do that in your life do you really surround yourself
with the diversity of people and perspectives and employees if
you're a boss for example or do you just tend
to get people who reinforce your existing ideas and then
you know a lot of corporations even make you sign
contracts that restrict you from being able to go and
work for another corporation in the same industry if you
leave their corporation that's like exactly what cults do sign
these non-compete agreements and so forth another common characteristic of
cults is that they deny and excuse any collateral damage
that their actions caused so notice how you do that
notice how your government does that notice how your business
does that notice how your industry if you're an entire
industry notice how your industry does that if you're in
the pharmaceutical industry notice how the farmers who do industry
refuses take responsibility for its collateral damage and so do
you maybe you're just a secretary working for a some
you know big drug company and you don't make any
big decisions but nevertheless you're part of this organization that
causes a lot of collateral damage are you taking responsibility
for that not in a way where you have to
guilt yourself and tell yourself that you're bad but I
mean like really becoming conscious of what you're doing in
life and how you're fitting in to all these collectives
that you're a part of and what these collectives are
actually doing and how they're contributing to the kind of
world that you either want or don't want very common
component of cults is crusading or the lesser jihad as
I call it externalizing your spiritual work being very busy
out there without self reflecting in here or making your
life purpose the defeat of other people that's like the
definition of crusading and the lesser jihad make sure your
life purpose is not predicated upon the defeat of somebody
else or some other organization that would be a big
mistake we also talked about a common stuff component of
cults as being sexual manipulation abuse and irresponsibility so of
course notice how much of that is going on around
our society and government in your business and your corporation
in the news in relationships and Families another stuff component
is not acknowledging the importance of balance cults don't appreciate
the importance of balance oftentimes what a cult does is
it takes a good thing too far like yes maybe
your religion does have some important wisdom and insights but
when you try to take that and you try to
convert the entire world to it that's when the evil
happens you see so it's not that the Quran doesn't
have some some beautiful insights some valid insights it does
of course it does the mistake is when you try
to make everyone in a Muslim that's the mistake you're
taking a good thing too far or you're taking it
too literally so like many religious books will have will
have nice insights but also they're filled with some delusions
and some antiquated notions and and stuff like that and
they're filled with some bigotries and you know some racism
and some homophobia in this so you know you're supposed
to take the good stuff and leave the bad stuff
but people you know they they take it too far
they just want to say like well the whole the
whole Bible has to be true the whole Quran has
to be true like either it's all false or it's
all true and so if it's all true we got
to take everything and in a lack of discrimination taking
a good thing too far it wasn't meant to be
taken that way religious teachings were meant to be delicately
interpreted consciously thought about an embodied in your life not
just like read and then literally followed like a simple
robotic one two three step manual that's not how religious
texts were meant to be understood so so notice how
you and your organization whatever you're part of doesn't acknowledge
the importance of balance and takes it too far so
it's not that you know drug companies are evil in
the sense that you know we shouldn't have any drugs
no we need drug research we need new drugs we
that's all good but it's like you're taking it too
far you know when you're trying to like market opioids
to vulnerable people in the way that's been happening over
the last five years or so in America you know
that's an example of taking a good thing too far
opioids are necessary morphine you know it's a good thing
when you're at a life-and-death situation you're your scruciating pain
it's great but then you know to hand it out
like candy and then to incentivize doctors to do it
through various kinds of sneaky marketing techniques that's when you
took a good thing too far all right let's take
a quick intermission here and we still have more to
say so stick with me so I want to wrap
up this episode and this whole miniseries by going through
a list of cult-like organizations and events throughout history so
we're gonna sort of run through human history here really
quickly I've already been sprinkling various examples from this list
throughout the first part here where I was talking about
the various sub components but it's useful to just really
get a sense for how significant these cult dynamics really
are we need to take this out from the realm
of theory and abstraction I want you to really see
how this permeates and is characteristic of all human behavior
and of course leading up all the way to the
present so if you look at the origins of all
religions they are just rife with cult dynamics and the
only reason that any major religion today exists at all
is because of cult dynamics it couldn't exist otherwise take
a look at the Crusades what were the Crusades but
various kinds of cult dynamics in action look at the
conquest of South America and the new world with people
like Cortes Columbus and Magellan they were pretty much motivated
by cult dynamics and what went on with the founding
of America and South America various South American countries that
was all cult dynamics based the Spanish Inquisition called dynamics
the French Revolution in the reign of terror called dynamics
the 16th and 17th century European witch mania the hunting
down of witches by the establishment Orthodox Church cult dynamics
the civil war confederacy slavery racism ethnocentrism nationalism the KKK
predicated on cult dynamics the Marxist revolutions of the early
20th century in Soviet Union in China in North Korea
and Vietnam and other places call dynamics all the stuff
that I talked about all those sub components you're gonna
find many of them operating within these examples that I'm
talking about Nazism and anti-semitism called dynamics misogyny and anti
feminism called dynamics McCarthyism the Red Scare called dynamics the
way capitalism currently operates in the United States and the
entire wall street apparatus the military industrial complex the big
pharma called dynamics the 60s hippie counterculture revolution with psychedelics
and all that stuff called dynamics and also of course
the crackdown on that revolution well the reaction against it
was sort of the counter counter-revolution was also called dynamics
and the demonization of psychedelics is called dynamics stock market
bubbles called dynamics Trump the alt-right FoxNews Alex Jones the
Rush Limbaugh and the Breitbart news this is all cult
dynamics the alt-right is predicated upon cult dynamics what Trump
is doing all of the the ways in which Trump
motivates his base the way that he interacts with them
the things he says to them the way they respond
to him this is all classic classic cult dynamics so
even though technically I wouldn't call the alt-right cult because
it doesn't fit that technical definition of a an authoritative
hierarchy in a sense you could call it a cult
yeah I mean it's basically an online cult is what
it is the various Russian manipulation campaigns that we saw
in the 2016 election and that are still seemingly ongoing
with Facebook and various kinds of rigging of polls and
online media advertising and all of this the disinformation campaigns
what is this the Russians are exploiting cult dynamics within
the United States in order to sort of sabotage and
so chaos and the only reason they can do that
is because much of the u.s. population is ignorant about
precisely everything we talked about in this miniseries I mean
if if people broadly speaking just watched and understood these
two episodes about cult psychology and they really not just
intellectually understood it but saw in action their own life
and they accepted it of course they have to agree
with what I'm saying here which is a bitter pill
for many people swallow but if that was the case
this was part of our standard education in elementary school
then a phenomena like the alt-right or Donald Trump or
Nazism or the KKK would just not be possible that's
why we're going to such detail about this because this
has very practical effects and this is something that needs
to be integrated this the understanding needs to be deeply
integrated into our education system to inoculate people against this
stuff and it will help to not only reduce hardcore
cults it'll also help to reduce all sorts of other
ideological and dogmatic phenomena and religious nonsense and even scientific
nonsense and all sorts of stuff like that what about
fads like beanie babies Pokemon Bitcoin the fidget spinner these
are all based on cult dynamics about a year ago
actually my brother he he's really into techy stuff and
he was getting into Bitcoin and he bought some tens
of thousands worth of Bitcoin I think and he was
making good money out if this was right when the
Bitcoin market was like at the very very peak with
bitcoins were almost $20,000 per Bitcoin and I remember he
was talking about bitcoins like back in the early days
like eight years ago or so when bitcoins were just
like a few dollars per Bitcoin now they're like 20,000
and then it dropped so anyways he was trying to
get me to buy into them and invest like several
tens of thousands of dollars in them because I was
looking for an investment opportunity and I was kind of
hesitant I was stalling and having an hawing but I
was almost gonna buy in like at the peak at
20,000 per Bitcoin and then I just kind of waited
and kept falling and falling and falling and it felt
to me like it was a fad and and sure
enough the market now has crashed the point where it's
like I would have lost a lot of money on
that so this stuff is very helpful another very interesting
fad I don't know most people probably haven't heard of
it it's called the 17th century Dutch tulip mania and
this is detailed in a classic book about cult psychology
and behavior of crowds is the extraordinary and popular delusions
of crowds I think that's what it's called classic book
where the author details all sorts of various kinds of
herd mentality and interesting calamities that resulted but one of
the cases was the 17th century Dutch tulip mania where
tulips the bulbs of tulips they became like collectible items
and they became extremely prized for no good reasons to
the point where these tulips were being sold for thousands
of dollars and even more to the point where some
of these tulip bulbs were the most expensive objects on
the entire planet at that time and so that lasted
for a short number of years then in the whole
market completely collapsed and like who even cares about tulip
bulbs today so you can see how cult dynamics are
responsible for that terrorism and suicide bombing is a cult
activity also though Islamophobia is a cult activity and in
case you think that Iraq too much on conservatives let
me rag a little bit on liberals because liberals are
certainly not immune to cult phenomena and I'm sad to
see quite a bit of it in in in many
liberal outlets so social justice warriors are certainly prone to
it socialists and Marxists there's a sort of a resurgent
like I said there's a Renaissance of socialism happening now
but there are dangers with that of course because it's
gonna get taken overboard too much of a good thing
becomes a bad thing and so we're starting to see
that happen certain liberal like YouTube channels that I like
to watch for example of TYT if you're familiar with
that one the majority report I like that one is
as well but they also engage heavily in cult dynamics
like one thing you see them doing a lot as
you see them demonizing and stereotyping conservatives and this creates
a further polarization and it oversimplifies the conservative perspective and
calling all conservatives fascists and the like well actually it
does a disservice and it only feeds into the sort
of the prejudices of the audience and even though I
like these channels I see them much more less more
much more involved than Fox News for example or many
of the alt-right sources you got to watch out you
got to watch out because it creates an echo chamber
with a lack of diversity of perspectives and that sort
of judging demonizing stereotyping over some flying and straw Manning
the other side and just even creates the idea of
another side sort of a separation between you or uh
sources the Conservatives or rubber or whatever and you got
a you got to cut that [ __ ] out
that's not gonna cut it if you want to go
to the deepest levels of your development and consciousness so
watch out you know it's hard to find really really
high-quality new sources so what I recommend as far as
news goes because most new sources are quite judgmental and
polarizing these days is just really diversify the sources that
you that you look at and sort of consider many
different perspectives which is not to say that consider all
perspectives equal that's also not the case so a lot
of times even though these liberal new sources might demonize
the Conservatives and not fully give them credit their surge
generally more in the right direction than the opposite be
careful with academia there's a lot of cult thinking going
on within academia I mentioned wartime propaganda that's a classic
example North Korean indoctrination I have a book on my
book list about North Korea I highly recommend you read
it that's like a case study of cult dynamics taken
to the extreme and is really interesting because it's like
North Korea is basically like a cult of classic hardcore
cults scaled up to an entire nation it's quite amazing
that they're able to to sustain it for as long
as they have if you really want understand what the
North Korea situation is all about you have to go
read that book and and look it's gonna open your
eyes to the kind of indoctrination techniques that they use
in their schools like it's it's crazy like that stuff
is like science fiction dystopian territory level of cult indoctrination
and there's a lot of lessons to learn from that
for me personally studying the extreme examples helps to highlight
and helps me to then understand the more subtle versions
of it that then I see in America or I
see in Europe or I see in my own life
various scientific and philosophical schools if you're student of science
and philosophy then you know there's all sort of different
schools and subgroups and subfields that science and philosophy divides
itself up into and usually they war with each other
there they're in conflict and they also tend to polarize
and engage in cult dynamics and that hurts the enterprise
of science and philosophy both and a lot of times
the way philosophy is taught which I really don't like
is it's taught as like one school versus other school
it's like the materialists versus the idealists or the anti-realist
versus the realists or the phenomenologist versus the analytical philosophers
or versus the continental philosophers and this is just a
bad way to frame it the phenomena of in cells
pick up red pill and the Jordan Peterson stuff that's
going on these days on YouTube and in the media
very very cult-like be very careful about that because those
basically are online cults new atheism was also cult-like with
folks like sam Harris and and Richard Dawkins you see
that the people who believe in that and who really
are fans of that they become very cult-like in their
in their commentaries and in their way of thinking that's
also like an online cult it's sort of with the
same here just interesting is like a cult of rationality
which you would think like well rationality is antithetical to
cults no that's not you could certainly create a rationality
cult which he's done also with the occult magic witchcraft
in various kinds of other new-age what we call the
fields subfields these can get very culty so watch out
for those if you're getting into that nationalism and patriotism
is called behavior basically celebrities and rock stars Paris Hilton's
and the Kim Kardashian's of the world and all this
sorts of stuff it's all cult based on cult dynamics
Western medicine very very cult-like watch out because that one
could actually mean the difference between life and death for
you if you get a serious illness or disease various
kinds of cultural rituals that you might be attached to
circumcision baptism female genital mutilation animal sacrifice even human sacrifice
honor killings these are all cult dynamics and one really
interesting one that I learned about just recently from Hinduism
is called sati SI TI sati and what this is
it's a cultural ritual which apparently goes back centuries maybe
even millennia in in India where you know Indians are
very family-oriented so if if the husband of the wife
the husband dies and she becomes a widow then under
this sati ritual sort of the ideal that the Hindu
culture programs is that you're supposed to as the wife
you're supposed to sacrifice yourself the wife is supposed to
sacrifice herself on the funeral pyre of her dead husband
and even to this day even though there's laws in
India against sati now but this was a very common
practice just a hundred years ago even fifty years ago
and even today if you go on the Wikipedia page
and look up sati you will see that like every
year even now in the two thousands every year Indian
women commit sati and it's seen as like a sort
of a prideful way to go out in life so
it's very interesting and the only the only reason people
do it is because of cult dynamics worshipping of various
gurus leaders and presidents for example the way that the
Conservatives in America tend to look upon Ronald Reagan and
to quote Ronald Reagan is very cult-like even the way
that we look at the founding fathers in the way
we try to like whitewash the history of the founding
fathers and idealize them is very cold like watch out
for social media YouTube Twitter Facebook Instagram like I said
all cult dynamics are moving online these days you know
call cult dynamics are being modernized and and are evolving
with new technology you know when VR comes out you're
gonna expect cult dynamics and ER when massively multiplayer online
games come out you're gonna see cult dynamics and those
conspiracy theories are popular these days online flat earther ism
and and all sorts of various kinds of theories what
is that that's cult dynamics right there government censorship cult
dynamics sports teams I already mentioned those the Super Bowl
the World Cup the ridiculous amount of money and advertising
that goes into that all the sales the salaries that
athletes make this is all predicated on cult dynamics gender
roles what are your opinions about male and female gender
roles do you believe that male and female is a
real physical biological category whether you do or you don't
you probably have pretty strong opinions about gender roles and
I want you to notice how those were instilled in
you through cult dynamics and how they reinforced continuity hairstyles
cult dynamics uniforms suits high heels fashion what constitutes luxury
what constitutes very standards of beauty I remember when I
was a teenager like in the 90s it was a
spiky hair that was the best hairstyle for a guy's
spiky hair and then it's like just the Justin Beaver
hairstyle came in like or the early 2000s you know
and it's always changing so what is that but cult
dynamics gangs are an example of cult dynamics abusive relationships
a lot of women especially ones with self-esteem issues get
sucked into abuse and relationships Wiccan which can become very
toxic and cult-like don't think that if it's just you
and a guy to pee in a relationship that that
is not enough to constitute a cult it certainly can
and that's really sort of like the simplest way to
start a cult if you want to sort of cult
do it with your wife or your husband or your
girlfriend or your boyfriend and you get to be the
cult leader and they get to be the cult follower
and you can certainly do that there's right now I'm
describing probably millions literally millions of relationships in the world
that fall under this category also though those can then
turn into authoritarian and cult-like families so of course like
let's say the father is I want to be cult
leader so he sucks his wife into it and then
of course they have some children and then they they
turn them into a cult into a sort of a
cult family and then you know you have authoritarian families
that dictate down and then you see all the cult
dynamics happening had a very kind of like micro local
level right in that family and if you're in one
of these families you came out one of these families
you know how dysfunctional that can be you know how
it's like a little bubble maybe your family was involved
with criminal activity or abuses of various kinds manipulations exploitation
you know all the stuff that I mentioned up above
you're probably very familiar with those dynamics and it's precisely
because of that that your life is so dysfunctional you
can change that but it's going to take some work
because unfortunately it's been programmed deep into you and you
don't know any other way yet but we can work
on that through more self-development and consciousness polygamy is a
cult dynamic in our nation through television and advertising as
a cult dynamic anti-vaxxers it's like sort of a cult
dynamics and online forums can easily become very cult-like so
that's the list I try to just pummel you with
example after example after example because what you need to
do with this work is you need to ground it
I tend to talk about very abstract concepts and things
and it's very easy for especially many of you newbies
to not appreciate sort of how advanced some of these
things that are being said are we're talking about very
advanced stuff here very tricky stuff very self deceptive stuff
that your mind will just it'll just like slide off
your mind it'll go in one ear and out the
other unless you find ways to practice it into two
ground to ground the things I talk about ground the
theory and your everyday experiences that's extremely important for you
to do so I give a lot of examples so
that you can see just how practical and applicable all
this stuff is so that your ego mind doesn't just
say oh well leo it's just theory it has nothing
to do with my life and you know how can
I possibly apply this stuff what could this possibly do
for me well hopefully you can see just how far-reaching
just with this one concept of cult dynamics and cult
psychology is but really everything I talk about is like
that to really understand what I'm talking about here it's
gonna take you years of patiently carefully observing and studying
yourself your family your friends your boss your co-workers your
business you know your government your nation your religion your
culture at large your everything the people you look up
to celebrities you like and so forth so start doing
that that's what you got to do with this stuff
it can't just be an idea that like oh yeah
okay I understand it that's way too intellectual yes you
got to start with the intellectual understanding of course but
then you got to like start to observe it and
start to track it in everyday life and then of
course you got to look inside of yourself and see
it inside yourself it's not enough just to point your
finger at say at all look look at that stupid
person over there and look at that Trump and look
at this Alex Jones and look at these extreme examples
of bad people sucking others into cults no you got
to see how you're doing it and that's where the
real work begins is when you start to see how
you're doing it because that's where it actually gets difficult
that's where your mind gets really tricky on you and
tries to get you to avoid looking at your own
behaviors and your own thinking pattern your mind doesn't want
you exploring and investigating this stuff but that's exactly what
you need to do if you want to see results
from the things that I talked about you know as
a culture in the West in developed countries we talk
a lot about truth and integrity and democracy but we
don't teach people the actual underpinnings of democracy the epistemic
underpinnings we don't teach people against the problems of authoritarianism
yes we give people a few examples from the history
books like Stalin or Hitler or whatever but that's not
nearly enough what we really need is we need education
of how authoritative ism is present in every ego and
how that manifests in your life even when you're a
child and you act like a little tyrant or a
dictator or when you're a teenager and how it works
in your family and all of this that's the kind
of education that's necessary if we really want true democracy
see because most people when you ask them oh do
you like democracy they'll say yes do you like authoritarianism
they'll say no but when they don't know how to
spot Punk dynamics to get very easily sucked into a
cult-like behavior by some wannabe authoritarian which then undermines democracy
they don't understand the democracy to really have solid democracy
you need to be able to be extremely conscious of
your own self biases and your own tendencies to get
sucked into these various kinds of ideologies and to see
you'll see the bigger picture see all these interconnections businesses
hijack cult psychology to make money politicians hijack cult psychology
to gain power intellectuals hijack cult psychology to become famous
and well-known and build their reputations which then of course
also gets them lots of money and turns into a
business see that happening see yourself doing it see the
temptations of it notice the devil alive within you most
people are devils and most people are Devils because their
unconscious and if they seem good on the surface it's
only because they're putting on a nice facade for you
because that's what's necessary for them to slip under the
radar and it's only working because most people have not
acquired a lot of power Fame or money and so
they really don't have a lot of opportunities to exhibit
their devilishness and then of course we see with those
people who are powerful and famous and have a lot
of money then we see a lot of the devilish
stuff that they do that comes out in the news
see it all the time and there's nothing shocking about
this it's just because we're not really taught how any
of this stuff works and so you know most people
are closeted authoritarians put them in power give them a
lot of money give them fame give them sex and
you're off to the races they will enslave you if
you give them the opportunity so a conclusion I want
you to start seeing cult dynamics everywhere be able to
see cults in the sort of rigorous technical sense that
I defined in Part 1 and also be able to
see cult dynamics everywhere in society and within yourself and
make sure that you don't demonize these things that I've
talked about stop calling this stuff bad this is not
bad this is how Maya works this is how devilry
is devilry is not bad devilry is a necessary inevitable
aspect of life and of reality and of the universe
like a law of physics you don't get mad at
gravity don't get mad at cult dynamics some of the
stuff may be unavoidable when we're dealing with large of
people organizations hierarchies herd mentality necessarily comes out but a
lot of it can also be mitigated through really becoming
conscious of how these dynamics work within yourself so that's
what I recommend that you do alright that's it I'm
done please click the like button for me and come
check out actualize that org that's my website there you
will find my blog what else the book list my
life purpose course and the forum where you can come
and talk about this stuff the last thing I'll say
is that really I've only shared like 5% of my
understanding of reality with you through actualized org so stay
humble don't think you've got it all figured out and
that all of it has been explained to you the
majority of it I have not explained to you and
that's because it's challenging to articulate this stuff takes a
lot of work to really understand how many of these
dynamics work mm-hmm and it's just like one of my
greatest frustrations in running actualised org is the fact that
I can only communicate a tiny fraction of everything that
I've realized and understood and the most deepest stuff I
can't really communicate because this medium is very limited even
video is very limited even three hour long videos are
very limited for the kind of stuff that we're trying
to understand you have to understand that with actualize that
org were like trying to understand everything we have a
really a much bigger goal than science or religion traditional
religion or psychology or philosophy like we have we have
a very we've bitten off a lot of stuff here
we're trying to understand the entire universe and not just
theoretically but grounding it in our in our direct experiences
and a deep exploration of ourselves as well so it's
not like science where science is out there or I
mean the objects of science are out there and then
we're doing science over here so it's kind of like
we're separate from the thing that we're observing using science
usually no no this is a very intimate involved process
where really you're you're running a mad science experiment on
yourself on your own mind so there's there's still so
much more that needs to be communicated I'll probably spend
the rest of my life trying to articulate it and
the frustration of it is is that I'll never be
able to put it all into words no matter how
much I try because it's infinite but I want you
to be smart enough to realize that and to realize
that really with actualize that order no matter you know
you watch a few of these videos maybe you start
to get excited about some possibility your possibility for life
purpose or you get a little glimpse of some mystical
insight or whatever it's like it's cool maybe you have
an improvement in your mood you have an improvement of
your depression symptoms or whatever and it starts to feel
like oh yeah there's something there and this is kind
of cool I'm into it yeah let's do some self-improvement
you don't even you don't even see one percent yet
of this iceberg so I really want you to appreciate
how much there is here to explore about life to
understand about life and how practical and how significant it
is right and the reason I'm telling you this is
really I want you to I want you to become
passionate about teaching yourself how to live not even through
my teachings teach yourself how to live figure out life
figure out why you're here figure out what motivates you
figure out why your life is dysfunctional figure out how
you're manipulated and controlled by your own emotional system figure
out how to live healthily figure out how you're being
manipulated and brainwashed by society by your family by your
corporation in all of this figure all this out you
can figure it out that's like your ultimate purpose is
to figure it out and the rewards for figuring out
are so stupendous and awesome and gargantuan that they can't
possibly be communicated you can't possibly know how enormous the
rewards will be until you're already deep into it so
you need to sort of be able to intuit that
because this work does take years it takes the gears
it takes thousands of hours that's what I'm talking about
here really I'm interested in getting you bought in to
the idea that you should be spending thousands of hours
doing this work and it's a little hard to do
that because how do I convince you to do that
when you haven't really felt the fruits of it yet
I guess you got to either be smart enough to
intuit it or you gotta have just take a leap
of faith or whatever but hopefully you can see that
if you are able to truly figure out life all
of life not just on a social level or psychological
level but on a metaphysical level you're able to figure
out on all these different levels you're able to figure
out how to live you can do that you know
you can do that and you're not gonna read that
in any book no book will tell you this no
course will tell you this this is an intimate process
because you are intimately at the center of your very
life but I'm telling you that it's possible to do
that this is the most worthwhile thing you can do
in your life and you can verify that for yourself
you don't need to believe me on that it would
help if you started by believing me on that because
you know if you're too skeptical then you're not gonna
do any work nor any research and then your stocke
but you need to go and verify the things that
I say for yourself and then at some point it'll
hit you it'll hit you the significance of this and
even then you'll still not be at the bottom of
the iceberg you'll still be only scratching the surface of
it that's how deep this stuff goes perhaps the most
amazing thing that I've learned on my entire journey of
self-actualization for the last 10 or so years that I've
been deliberately doing it is just how deep it goes
it never ceases to amaze me how deep it goes
it's I'm still my mind is getting blown every week
by how deep it goes and I can see the
potential of where I'm gonna be in in 10 or
20 years and it's amazing and I know that even
all of that is still not even how deep it
goes that's how deep it goes but of course precisely
because there's so much depth to it precisely because there's
so much here that can transform your life it's gonna
take a big commitment from you it's gonna take work
from you means you can't just be lazy and you
can't just sit back and listen to me casually while
you're washing the dishes or while you're taking a shower
or taking a [ __ ] or whatever and then
just like kind of like going back to life as
usual you really got to reach a point in your
life where it strikes you the significance of this that
you devote your entire life to this this literally becomes
your life this becomes your religion self-actualization but not in
the negative sense of religion but in the true sense
of religion what religion was supposed to be this is
religion actualize that orga is true religion which ironically is
the opposite of mainstream religion of course because the devil
has co-opted mainstream religion so it has to be the
opposite we talked about this in the catter intuitiveness episode
so I encourage you to get engaged get engaged with
life get engaged with living life excellently become a sage
become a philosopher for real not as theories and ideas
not as academic pursuit but as a way of living
life because all you've got is this one life what
are you gonna do with it you got a better
idea what are you gonna do what are you gonna
do you gonna earn money you're gonna chase sex you're
gonna what you're gonna run around and join some religion
and then proselytize people what what's worthwhile to do in
life but this to understand what you're supposed to be
doing how can you be doing anything when you don't
know what you're supposed to be doing and the only
way you gonna figure out what you're supposed to be
doing is by figuring it out the journey and the
process of figuring it out that's what this work is
you
