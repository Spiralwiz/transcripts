hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment in about ten minutes I'm going to
tell you how to make a guy fall in love
with you alright so this is a interesting topic for
me because I've been involved with pick up and did
a lot of personal development work like advanced deep level
work on dating and social interaction with the opposite sex
and learning flirting and just all this amazing stuff so
this is a really fascinating topic to me from a
girl's perspective I think if you want to keep a
guy on the hook and you really want to keep
them keep them and keep them steady with you and
you want them to like become your boyfriend fall in
love with you what you got to realize is a
little bit of male psychology and what guys like and
girls and you'll find that this is pretty much invariable
across most men most of the human male population so
a couple of points first of all if you want
to guy to like you number one thing you got
to realize guys or visual men or visual women are
more emotional more about comfort more about personality guys are
visual so I'm sorry to say you have to take
care of your looks and it doesn't mean you have
to wear a ton of makeup or be fake but
you got to take care of your health you got
to take care of your weight you got to take
care of your hygiene make sure that you're nicely dressed
you've got a sense of style you've got you know
you've got your weight handled you're going to the gym
you're eating clean these are important things and these are
also beneficial to you because well you should be doing
these things hopefully anyways because you care about your health
and you care about your hygiene many girls don't have
this issue some girls do have this issue so it
depends it depends where you're at I think very almost
all guys are very sensitive to weight so you have
to take care of your weight and manage it because
guys like healthy fit girls that's just a fact that's
our biology that's something we're drawn to we can't really
do anything about it so keep your weight in line
that's very important and you might be asking well what
does I have to do with love like of hasn't
has nothing to do with physical appearance well the problem
is is that to a guy who has options it's
important right just like to you for example as a
girl the personality of the guy is important and you
like a guy who's humorous and who's adventurous and who's
outgoing who's strong it has a sense of of like
command over life well the same argument can be made
like what does that have to do with love what
does personality have to do with love the fact is
that's just something you're drawn to women are drawn to
personality guys are drawn to physical appearance so try to
make your physical appearance you know as decent as you
can make it without bending over backwards so that's important
the next point is how to make a guy fall
in love with you is you know be sweet I
think most guys like a sweet girl who is like
caring and loyal to the guy it's hard to reject
a girl like that so be sweet be outgoing like
that be kind to your guy don't be a bumpy
a and don't be don't be too naggy guys hate
it when you are nagging them all the time for
guys it's like we want the connection we want the
intimacy but a lot of guys don't want too much
of it because we also are independent minded and we
want to be out there and doing whatever it is
that we're doing and we don't want to feel like
we're like attached at the hip we want our sense
of Independence at least a strong guy will want that
any kind of guy that you really want to lock
down he's going to have that independence that's what you're
attracted to and so you don't want to smother him
too much in fact you want to play a little
bit cool play a little bit cool and have things
that you're doing in your life that are not just
revolving around the guy and getting the guy counter-intuitively the
best way to get the guy is not want to
get the guy so much because the guy will chase
you especially in the beginning he'll chase you because the
guys are the pursuers in the beginning and it's still
always important to keep a little bit of that kind
of edge in the relationship because if it ever becomes
too like too obvious too stale then like that sense
of like playfulness is lost so make sure that you
have stuff that you're doing you're not just sitting around
and waiting for your guy you have other friends that
you're hanging out with you have things that you're doing
and the guy will see that that will become very
apparent in the way that you're acting in the way
that you're communicating in in how much you want to
see him so all that's going to all that's going
to show in very subtle ways and the guy's going
to pick up on that and when he sees that
you're actually out there and doing stuff and you're not
so desperate to have a guy in your life he's
actually going to chase you a little bit and that's
going to be ideal that's going to be kind of
the ideal situation for you so keep that in mind
make sure that your life is interesting right have friends
have activities that you're doing that's always attracted that's most
attractive to guys and two girls girls want guys to
be doing stuff on their own and guys want girls
to be out there and doing stuff on their own
nobody just wants somebody that sits home all day and
is boring it has no life people want somebody who's
more attractive who's got something going for themselves right who's
got a future ahead of them that's important the other
thing about how to attract a guy I think great
sex guys are sec are sexual we want to be
in relationships that offer us great sex so make sure
that you know how to do good sex read up
on it study it practice it you know whatever you
got to do make sure that you're satisfying your guy
that he is really getting getting his kicks from it
because like to me that's that's the best part of
the relationship is making the sex really awesome so I
like I pride myself in learning how to how to
do that stuff mastering sex mastering just mastering the whole
sexual realm and that's a much deeper topic then like
Cosmo makes it out to be you can go out
there and actually buy information products that will teach you
and it can really really good at sex like amazing
amazing things to the point where you can take sex
to a whole new level like most people don't realize
how deep sex goes and they just have boring vanilla
sex they're not exploring their sexuality and therefore their relationships
get stale because the sex you know after you have
normal sex just for a few months it tends to
get boring so you want to keep it spiced up
learn different techniques be adventurous have sex in different places
and be a little bit sexually aggressive with your with
your guy I think as guys we like that sometimes
when a girl is too submissive and expects the guy
to do everything then it feels like well we're just
doing all the work and we want some sometimes like
we want to be a we want sex to be
initiated on us I know that's not always natural for
girls depending on what kind of girl you are but
I think most guys like that when when sometimes you
initiate and you initiate in like kinky adventurous ways because
for us it's like oh damn like that's cool most
girls don't do that and that's something rare something unique
something valuable that we are attracted to so what I'm
talking about here is you ask the question of how
do you get a guy to fall in love with
you and before you can get that you have to
get them attracted to you and really what happens is
that you get attraction and then that attraction will build
to love fairly naturally as long as there aren't any
big obstacles in the way and so what I'm basically
telling you is try to clear up those major obstacles
one major obstacle might be appearance hygiene another major obstacle
might be that you don't have the kind of social
life or the kind of life that guy would would
want in you if he's looking for like a long-term
relationship or girlfriend another thing might be the sex isn't
up to his standards and he's not thrilled with that
and so he's looking up in other places so all
these things you just remove those roadblocks and it's going
to naturally happen you know it's going to be naturally
naturally happening just make sure that you're you're doing more
than the average girl because the average girl if she's
not looking at these at these areas in her life
and she's not working on them and fixing them then
the guy will eventually get bored of her or he'll
he'll find faults and then that process of falling in
love will either take longer it'll be rockier there'll be
problems there or it won't happen but if all the
roadblocks are removed and you've got all the fundamentals down
he's attracted to you there's sexual chemistry three there's intimacy
then it'll naturally lead to where you want it to
go so it's pretty simple it's not that complicated and
as far as you know where to find more guys
well you got to go out there and socialize if
you're not finding enough of the kind of guys that
you want to get you know to start that whole
process because you got to start here you don't start
with love you start with an acquaintance and then it
builds up to love so make sure that you have
this part of your life handle too that means going
out with your friends going out to bars going out
to clubs be more receptive to guys maybe even approaching
guys sometimes that's attractive to is when a girl will
approach a guy that can work although just being receptive
and being attractive will get you natural approaches as long
as you're in an environment where that can happen right
if you're sitting home if you're hanging around the same
friends all the time and you guys in our place
where there aren't many other people then what are the
chances of you meeting somebody not very high you can
dramatically improve your chances by going out there and moving
in new social circles going to places that are crowded
where other people can see you and meet you and
approach you and then that process will develop very very
naturally all right so that's pretty much how to make
a guy fall in love with you in 10 minutes
