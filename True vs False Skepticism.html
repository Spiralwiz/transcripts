Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about true versus false skepticism.
I'm going to teach you about the original ancient School
of skepticism called Peronism. And how very different it was
from modern versions of skepticism. I have a big gripe
with modern skepticism, because modern skepticism is really 180 degree
perversion of what true skepticism was supposed to be. And
to understand this, we need to go into some of
the history. But modern skepticism the problem with it is
that it masquerades as skepticism, when really what it is,
is dogmatism. Which is exactly the thing that skepticism originally
was supposed to be against dogmatism. So in this episode,
we're going to talk about true versus false skepticism, we're
gonna really go in depth here and compare and contrast
them. And you're gonna get a really good sense of
what Peronism was. Peronism was the name for the original
school of subject skepticism, which originated back in ancient Greece.
Now, true skepticism. What's interesting about it, or Peronism, is
that of all the philosophy that I've studied, and I've
studied quite a bit of Western philosophy, I majored in
it in university, I find Peronism to be the most
accurate epistemic ly speaking. And one of the most important
influences in my life, which has allowed me to move
forward in to advanced self actualization work, it simply would
not be possible for me, had I not embraced puritanism
very early on in my teenage years. And so I
hope to convince you of this and to show you
just how practical of a philosophy this is, because there's
some very important epistemic insights here, that many modern scientists
and rationally minded people, atheists, intellectuals, academics simply do not
understand. It's kind of sad to me, that many intelligent
people today haven't learned the lessons from 1000s of years
ago, which the ancient Greeks have discovered. So let's go
into some of the historical context here. Why is it
called Peronism and not skepticism? Well, it's named after the
guy who founded it. His name was Piero of Ellis.
He was an ancient Greek. And he was born in
three 360 BCE, so almost two and a half, 1000
years ago, around the time of the Buddha. Now, Piero
didn't just sit in Greece and come up with this
skeptical philosophy. What he did is actually he traveled with
Alexander the Great as part of his entourage, all the
way into India, because Alexander the Great kept conquering more
and more land towards the east, from Greece. And eventually
he ran up into India. And they're Piro traveled with
him, and they bumped into the gymnasts, sofas. What are
the gymnast? Sofas that's a very odd name. In Greek
gym means naked. And sofa just means thinker or philosopher.
So who are they referring to? When they're talking about
the gymnasts, sofas? The Naked philosophers of India? Can you
guess? That's right, the yogi's. So they ran to these
curious people called the yogi's. And from them Piro, because
he was a philosopher, he learned some interesting insights about
the nature of reality. And what these Yogi's basically convinced
him of is that nothing is certain. And that all
the stuff that the Greeks thought that they knew, for
certain, really wasn't as certain as they thought. So Piero
took this to heart. And he brought back these lessons
to Greece. And then he lived out the rest of
his life in Greece, basically as a wreck loose, just
embodying his skeptical philosophy and teaching a little bit. He
didn't write anything of significance. There are no surviving works
of Piero, because back in those days, most philosophers, they
just lived their philosophy. And maybe they taught a little
bit face to face if they had some students and
a school that they developed. So how do we know
about Peronism? Well, it was only For centuries later that
a guy by the name of Sextus empiricus, wrote a
book called the outlines of puritanism. And this book is
available today. It's a very readable book. And I'm gonna
talk a lot more about this as we keep going
here, because most of this episode is about this book
and some of the important insights that are found here.
So these are basically the lessons, the Sextus empiricus, learned
from the peroneus, or ancient skeptical school. And we're going
to cover a lot of these in depth. But what
did Piro teach in a nutshell, he taught that the
chief aim of life is eudaimonia. eudaimonia, is a Greek
term, which basically means happiness or living the good life.
But what's important to understand about this term, is that
when the Greek philosophers talked about eudaimonia, they did not
talk about pleasure. So when we think of happiness today,
we usually think, oh, that just means pleasure. That means
success. That means getting all the stuff that I want.
That's not what the Greeks meant by living the good
life. To them. The Good Life was the philosophical life,
the reflective life, the life of truth, finding the truth,
embodying the truth, living your life, according to certain principles
of what you believe and think is good, the ultimate
good, good with a capital G. That's what's meant by
eudaimonia. So for Piero, all of philosophy was about eudaimonia.
Not only for Piro, but for many philosophers of that
era. That was the case. That's actually why Greek philosophy
is so great, because modern philosophy has lost its way
because it has given up on this notion of eudaimonia.
And it has become an analytical academic pursuit, which is
not what philosophy was in the old days. So that
was the aim. But then what was the skepticism about?
Well, like he learned from the yogi's, basically, what is
philosophy about philosophy is about trying to discover what is
true. That's what we care about what is real, what
is true? How do we sort out the truth from
the untruth? The reality from the appearances. And what skepticism
says is that nothing can be known for certain. Why
not, because we have only two ways of accessing reality,
we have the senses, and we have our reasoning. And
both of these are deceptive, and potentially very faulty. The
senses deceive us very easily, and they can be faulty.
And also reason is very deceptive. And it can also
be faulty. So because these are the only two ways
we can get to know reality, and both of them
seem such uncertain vehicles for understanding and knowing reality, we
have to be honest and admit that we can't really
know reality, for sure. Piro taught that neither sense perceptions,
nor our views, theories or beliefs tell us the ultimate
truth. Moreover, he taught that all reasoning and proof is
either circular, or involves an infinite regress, and is ultimately
groundless. So the essence of the peroneus skeptical argument was
that we can know anything for sure. Because to claim
something for sure, we need to provide some sort of
proof. Because without proof, we could claim the opposite of
whatever was originally claimed. So how do we know what's
true? Well, we claim something and then we back it
up with justifications and proof and evidence. But if we
just think about this little bit, it becomes untenable, because
whatever evidence you provide, we'll need yet more evidence to
prove itself. And then we'll need more evidence to prove
that evidence and more evidence to prove that evidence and
more evidence to prove that that evidence. So every proof
either goes around in the circle proving itself ultimately, or
it involves an infinite regress, that ultimately ends in groundlessness.
Because you can't ground anything, because it's just proof upon
proof upon proof upon proof, and it has to end
somewhere. And what most dogmatists do, and dogmas. This is
a technical term that the ancient skeptics used against all
the other philosophers who they were opposed to. And what
they meant by dogmatists are people who hold beliefs or
who really believe that something is a particular way. So
they have a doctrine, they say something like, well, reality
is this way, and mathematics is this way. And you
know, one plus one is indisputably true, and God exists
or God does not exist, and so on and so
forth, like Atoms make up the universe, and atoms are
indivisible, right? So there are all these sorts of different
metaphysical and epistemic theories about how reality worked. And what
the skeptics wanted to say is that we can't be
sure about that stuff. Because whatever proof these people are
providing, is ultimately groundless. Because against every statement, its contradiction
may be advanced with equal justification. That's what we get
when we realize the groundlessness of all justification. Therefore, the
Peronist reasoned, we must refuse to take any positions. Because
we don't have grounds for taking any positions. And this
means that we will be without any views, and we
will refuse to take sides. And in fact, we will
recognize that this entire philosophical game is a game. It's
a matter of people taking sides taking positions without any
real grounding. And they're tricking themselves because they're not admitting
to themselves, that they don't really know. And that whatever
their reasoning or the senses tell them could be wrong.
But yet they're not honest about that with themselves. That's
why we call these people dogmatists. We ourselves distinguish ourselves
from the dogmatist as skeptics, in that we say that
we will totally suspend judgment about non evident matters. We
will withhold assent from all doctrines regarding the truth of
things in their own nature. We will allow appearances because
they appear as appearances and appearances or just appearances. But
anything beyond appearances, we will doubt because it can't be
ultimately proven. And in fact, we are so opposed to
the dogmatists that even such a statements like nothing can
be known or nothing is true. We oppose that statement
as well. And now, this is a very nuanced point,
which is very important to understand. The skeptic is not
set in his own skepticism, he is not dogmatic about
his own skepticism. And he does not claim that nothing
can be known because even that cannot be known to
make that sort of claim would be dogmatic. So really,
the essence of what the skeptic is against is dogmatism.
To get you a better sense of this, I want
to read you some powerful quotes from outlines of puritanism
by sexist empiricus. The language here can be a little
bit old fashioned and arcane. So listen carefully. And stick
with me because this is good stuff. This is stuff
that's really worth paying attention to. He says quote, skepticism
is an ability or mental attitude, which opposes judgments in
any way whatsoever, with the result that owing to the
equivalence of the objects and the reason stuffs opposed, we
are brought firstly to a state of mental suspense, and
next to a state of unperturbed madness and quietude. Suspense
is a state of mental rest, owing to which we
neither deny nor affirm anything. quietude is an untroubled and
tranquil condition of the soul. The main basic principle of
the skeptic system is that of opposing to every proposition
and opposite proposition. For we believe that as a consequence
of this, we end by ceasing to dogma ties, and
quote. So see, skeptics are really interested in this idea
of unperturbed madness of mind. This is something I'm going
to keep talking about as we keep going here because
it ends up being a larger and larger point. We're
not just skeptical to be a stick in the mud.
We're skeptical because ultimately we're after Eudaimonia happiness. And we
recognize that happiness is peace of mind. And how do
we attain peace of mind by ceasing to take positions
on things of which we can never be certain? And
we see the dogmatists out there taking all sorts of
silly positions, deluding themselves, and then getting fooled. fired up
about it. Going crazy and having these ideological wars back
and forth. And we just recognize that that whole thing
is a game. And we don't want to play that
game. Let me keep reading some more, because this is
really good stuff. He goes on to say, quote, when
we say that the skeptic refrains from dogma tising, we
say that he does not ascend to any one of
the non evident objects of scientific inquiry, the peroneus philosopher
assent to nothing, that is non evident. Our doubt does
not concern the appearance of things, but the account of
the appearance. For example, honey appears to us to be
sweet, and this we grant, but whether it is also
sweet in its essence, is for us a matter of
doubt. Since this is not an appearance, but a judgment
and quote, you see, so it's not appearances that we
deny. We perfectly allow appearances, everything we see in our
sensory field. We accept that it's an appearance. But we're
not going to go any deeper the way that most
dogmatists do. And we're not going to make any sort
of existential claims, saying that well, because it appears so
and so that it actually is that way. If someone
comes to us and says, Well, it appears that there's
no God, we will say, yeah, it might appear that
way. But we don't know if that's really true. Or
if someone comes and says, it appears that God exists,
we will say the opposite. We will say, Well, yeah,
maybe it appears that God exists, but in fact, maybe
he doesn't. And we will do that with every single
statement, where there is a judgment or sort of a
jumping to conclusions. And that's the whole problem here that
the peroneus are recognizing with other philosophical systems, and all
sorts of ideologies and beliefs that people hold, is that
we recognize that these are judgments and conclusions, which are
really unwarranted. We are going beyond what is given to
us by reality. What is given to us by reality
is appearance, and nothing more. And we want to be
very honest about that. We don't want to kid ourselves,
like we know more than we really do. Let me
read you some more. He says quote, even in the
act of enunciating the skeptic formula, the skeptic still does
not dog monetize. For whereas the dog Monetizer posits the
things about which he is said to be dog enticing
as actually existent. The skeptic does not pause it in
any absolute sense. In regard to all skeptic expressions, we
must grasp the fact that we make no positive assertion
respecting their absolute truth, since we say that they may
possibly be computed by themselves, seeing that they themselves are
included in the things to which their doubt applies, just
as laxative drugs do not merely eliminate the humors from
the body, but also expelled themselves along with the humors
and quote, so this is a very important point. Because
when a skeptic gets into an argument with a dogmatic
person, the dogmatic person will want to accuse the skeptic
of being just like them. And the dogmatic person will
say, Ah, but you're a skeptic and see, you're dogmatic
about your skepticism. So that's something we have in common.
This is where the dogmatic person is unable to really
see the skeptic position. The skeptic position is so skeptical
and open, that it doesn't even give itself the special
privilege of being the one true philosophy. See that the
the deadly mistake that almost every ideological, religious, scientific and
philosophical system ever, in the history of humanity makes is
that it gives itself special privilege. And it likes to
say that I am the only right philosophy, I am
the only right paradigm. The skeptic wants to avoid this
trap. So how does he avoided? Can he avoid it
by saying that well, skepticism is the only right paradigm?
No, he can't. Because if he did that, if he
said that, he would just be committing the same mistake
in a different flavor. So instead, he's very careful. And
he has to say that even in being skeptical, he
holds his skepticism very loosely. And he's not claiming it
as the absolute truth. Which is why as skeptics, we
don't say that nothing can ever be known. We leave
some room. We just say that we have to be
skeptical. And even there we leave some room. That's a
very important nuanced point to understand, which is something that
differentiate true skepticism. From false skepticism, which I'll get back
to in a minute, let me read you some more.
Here. This next quotation goes to the heart of why
Peronism is a very practical philosophy. And it's not just
mental masturbation. It has some real world consequences that are
important for your happiness level in life. Remember that Peronism
is about attaining eudaimonia. So here's why. He says, quote,
The Man Who opined that anything is by nature, good
or bad, is forever being disquieted. When he is without
the things which he deems good, he believes himself to
be tormented by the things naturally bad, and he pursues
after the things which are as he thinks, good. That
makes sense. Which then when he obtains those good things,
he keeps falling into still more perturbation, agitation of the
mind. In other words, because of his irrational and a
moderate elation, and in his dread of the change of
fortune, he uses every endeavor to avoid losing the things
which he deems to be good. On the other hand,
the man who determines nothing, as to what is naturally
good or bad, that means the skeptic that person neither
shuns nor pursues anything eagerly, and as a consequence, is
unperturbed. And quote. So you see, this is why puritanism
is such an important position. And it's so different from
dogmatism, and all other philosophies, and all other ideologies. Because
all other ideologies, make definitive claims about what is good,
and what is really bad. And when you are certain
about what you think, is really good and really bad,
then you end up chasing the good stuff, and trying
to avoid the bad stuff. Naturally, right. And this game,
becomes your downfall. Because this is the game you can't
win. You might think that if you acquire all the
good stuff you think is good, then that will be
it, and you'll be happy. But see the peroneus this
is where they were very astute. They had an astute
understanding of human psychology, and of how true happiness works.
They understood that acquiring good stuff doesn't lead you to
happiness. Why not? Because even once you acquire everything you
want, then you will still be agitated in your mind
perturbed. That's their language perturbation. You're going to be perturbed.
Why? Because now you need to defend your good stuff.
The fortune that you've acquired, the fancy house, the car,
the money in your bank account, you're beautiful children, your
trophy wife or your trophy husband. All of this, once
you've acquired it, now you need to worry constantly about
maintaining it, defending it. And then how are you going
to feel if your trophy husband or wife gets stolen
by some other girlfriend or boyfriend? Or if they die?
Or if they get sick? Or if your kids fail
in school? How are you going to feel you're going
to be perturbed. And you're never going to attain eudaimonia.
So the skeptic in recognizing this whole game this whole
dynamic, he says, I'm not going to play that game.
Instead, what I'll do is I'll make a very counterintuitive
move, and I will not take positions on what is
truly good and truly bad. I will actually admit that
I don't know. And as a consequence, I'm not going
to pursue and chase. I'm not going to have cravings
after stuff. And that will leave me with a quiet
unperturbed mind. And from there, I will attain Eudaimonia that's
the logic. You see how wise and counterintuitive This is
is very tricky stuff. You have to be very clever
philosopher to to navigate past all these sneaky egoic drives
that are part of our psyche, which get us into
suffering. In this sense, the pureness were very much of
like mind with the Buddhists and the Indian Yogi's and
with non duality, and with spirituality, because this is the
essence of spirituality is recognizing this cycle of chasing of
materialism. and seeing through it, because you start to recognize
that it's never ever gonna work. This is a game
that is rigged against you. And that even when you
think you win the game, you will actually lose the
game. And now lastly, let me quote to you one
more. So segment and hear this gets to the heart
of the reason why skepticism is opposed to all positions
and all ideologies. So this concerns the matter of the
ultimate truth. He says, quote, does anything true really exist?
It is impossible to decide the controversy, because the man
who says that something true exists, will not be believed
without proof, on account of the controversy, of course, and
if he wishes to offer proof, he will be disbelieved
if he acknowledges that his proof is false, of course.
So, he has to declare that his proof is true.
But if he declares his proof is true, he becomes
involved in circular reasoning, and will be required to show
proof of the proof. And then more proof of the
proof, and more proof of the proof, and so on
ad infinitum. But it is impossible to prove an infinite
series. And so it is impossible also, to know that
something true exists. And quote, so you see, this is
the essence of their argument. It's the infinite regress and
the circular reasoning argument. And I actually encourage you to
sit down at some point in your life, this is
very important. Take any ideology. And by ideology, I include
religion, science, any paradigms that I've spoken about in the
past any belief system, anything that you believe is true,
take that thing. And then ask yourself, What's the proof.
And then keep going. What's the proof of the proof
and the proof of the proof, and the proof of
the proof and the proof of the proof and get
to the very bottom trying to get to the very
bottom and see what happens? What I'm claiming is that
one of two things will happen either you will notice
that it goes around in a circle. Or it just
stops somewhere. At some point, you're gonna get to a
position where you just have to accept something on faith.
And that's what the pyramid is recognized, is that all
other ideologies, all the dogmatists, all the other philosophers, what
they do is they accept something on faith without any
justification. And the peronists don't want to do that. They
recognize that that is a source of deception. And they
want to stay as far away from that as possible.
Therefore, they refuse to take any positions. Now, there's an
additional wrinkle here, your you might say, but Leo, it
sounds like the period is here are talking about there
not being an absolute truth. And yet, in your other
episodes, you talk about the Absolute Truth. So how to
reconcile that it doesn't sound like what you're talking about,
or teaching is in line with Peronism. who's right and
who's wrong. This notion of the Absolute Truth is a
tricky topic. This gets us into how enlightenment connects up
with Peronism. That's something I'll cover at the very end
of this episode. But what I want to point out
to you, and this is a very important point is
that like I said before, the skeptic truly in his
essence, does not make any firm commitments to anything. Therefore,
he is even open to there being an absolute truth.
Here in this quotation that I read to you, they're
giving you a a reasoning argument for why we shouldn't
expect an absolute truth to be possible. But the skeptic
also has to admit that he is using reasoning, you
know, he's using reasoning here. He's forming an argument and
that argument could end up being wrong. And if it
will be wrong or disproven in the future, he's open
to that possibility. So see, he doesn't want to be
dogmatic and say that absolute truth is not possible and
never attainable, because that would be a dogmatic statement. If
we knew that for sure, then we would know that
as a truth. But the skeptic says that we don't
know anything for sure. Including the fact that we don't
know anything for sure. What ends up happening is that
Peronism take into ultimate conclusion will actually produce a very
funny result, it leads to non duality. So it goes
full circle, it might seem right now that puritanism leads
to this ultimate relativism. But actually, what happens is that
relativism, when it goes full circle actually becomes absolutism. And
what you end up hitting upon is the ultimate truth,
by refusing to take all ideological positions. Now, this is
something that I don't think the pianists fully grasped. Because
to fully grasp this, you have to actually experience the
absolute. So what the pureness I think, left out in
their reasoning, is they left out a third possibility, you
know, how they talked about there being the senses and
reasoning, those are our two ways of understanding reality, they
left out a third possibility, which is direct consciousness. This
is something that is real. And generally, I think the
parents didn't understand what consciousness really was. And so that
was an element that was lacking in their philosophy, which
is why when I talk about paganism, I don't teach
it to you as the only piece of information you
need to know to self actualize. And to get to
the truth in life. I teach it as just one
perspective out of many other perspectives that I talked about.
So keep that in mind. There is a very interesting
connection, though, between the absolute truth and what the pyramids,
peronists talked about as quietude of mind. What's really interesting
is that it turns out that total quietude of mind
this is not just an ordinary notion of like, Oh,
my mind is sort of silent and quiet. And it
feels nice. This is a much more profound thing. It
actually is the absolute truth at the deepest level. But
now whether you reach that, that will take some real
work. That's the question. I don't think that even some
of the best pureness actually reached it. But that's something
to talk about in the future. So what I want
to do now is I want to contrast this true
form of skepticism as outlined by Sextus empiricus. With false
skepticism, which is the modern version of skepticism that we
see today. What do we see as skepticism today? It's
not pure anism. It's a sort of debunking mentality. And
usually what we see it as as a weaponized ideology
against religion, spirituality, mysticism, and New Age concepts. So usually,
when you see a skeptic these days, a self proclaimed
skeptic, this guy is embedded with science, rationality, logic, and
naive realism. And he's militant against religion, spirituality, and various
new age concepts. And he wants to quote unquote, debunk
them, because he's a hyper rationalist. And he lives in
his left side of the brain. And so what he's
doing there is he's taking a very clear position. But
he's still calling himself a skeptic. The problem with this
is that this sort of skepticism, this bastardized skepticism is
a is a problem because it's blind to itself. The
whole heart and soul of the original caronian position was
that it was conscious of its own limitations. And that
produces sort of modesty and humility, and a sort of
open mindedness. Whereas modern skeptics are blind to themselves, they're
unconscious, they don't question themselves. It's a skepticism that's pointed
outward. Whereas period ism was a skepticism that was also
pointed inward. That was his most important feature. Modern skepticism
or false skepticism gives a special privilege to his whole
position. So really, in that sense, it's dogma. It's not
pure anism. It's absolutist in its defense of certain paradigms
and assumptions like science, rationality, logic, and naive realism. And
it doesn't question these things. And this makes it closed
minded. If you want to have a good litmus test
to see if someone is a true skeptic, just take
a look at how they behave. Are they open minded
in their manner? Or are they closed minded? Is their
mind calm and unperturbed? Or is it agitated? Is it
militant? Is it fighting? Is it debating is it arguing?
Modern skeptics are very dogmatic, very closed minded and very
militant. against religious people and against religious ideology. Now, mind
you, that does not mean that I'm saying that all
religious ideologies are correct. And that they're better than science.
That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm just pointing
out the limitations of false skepticism and the problems with
it. There's a deeper game here being played than just
between religion versus science that is a trap. We're talking
about something much deeper here. We're talking about how the
mind uses concepts and ideas, to entrench itself and to
become a tool of the ego. If you're following and
embodying true skepticism, then your mind sees its own limitations.
And it's actually a tool for dismantling the ego. When
you're embodying false skepticism, this is a tool for becoming
more egotistical, more entrenched in your paradigms. And this is
the greatest danger of false skepticism is that it leads
to paradigm lock. And what I'm saying is that modern
scientists, atheists, secular people, academics, logicians, mathematicians, rationalists, these are
very paradigm locked people. They tell themselves that they're different
from the religious people, and that they're not paradigm locked,
because they tell themselves that science and rationality and so
forth these are not beliefs and these are not paradigms.
But a true skeptic would question the hell out of
many of the assumptions that science rationality and naive realism
make, he would not take those things for granted, because
he would be conscious that those things are positions. So
now what does true skepticism look like? True skepticism recognizes
very importantly, the limits of the mind of rationality and
of science. It questions all of these, and it doesn't
take them for granted. It doesn't give them a special
privileged position. True skepticism questions, every single assumption that is
made by the mind in any sort of reasoning about
the world. True skepticism is actually non dogmatic. Unlike false
skepticism, it's conscious of itself. It's conscious of its ability
to deceive itself. And therefore it questions itself. And for
a true skeptic. His one of his favorite targets to
question is in his own self and his own philosophy,
it's one of the few philosophies that is self reflective,
it really cares about not committing the same mistakes that
it sees other philosophies committing. It is. It is brutally
self honest with itself. It does not give itself any
special privileges. See, the problem with false skepticism is that
the false skeptic doesn't apply his own skepticism in on
itself. It never occurs to him to to wonder like,
hey, maybe my application of skepticism is actually backfiring, and
is actually leading to delusion. Maybe I'm stuck on skepticism.
Maybe I've made an identity out of skepticism. And we
see this a lot with these people who you see
these days on TV or in the media. These are
people who have a whole identity about being the debunkers
I'm going to debunk God and I'm going to debunk
this and debunk that and debunk the yogi's and debunk
the the New Age hippies and debunk everybody. And then
that becomes a new identity for you. That becomes your
ideology is debunking stuff. And of course, to debunk stuff,
you need to make all sorts of philosophical positions. And
then you need to play the whole game of justifying
having proofs and evidence and arguments and then so you
become an argue or an a debater. A master debater,
that's what you become. A true skeptic is not a
debater. He's not interested in debate. He's interested in the
end of debate. He's interested in having an open mind
because his ultimate goal is happiness. You see, the false
skeptics ultimate goal is ego gratification. He creates a whole
identity about arguing over other people and out arguing them.
And that becomes his goal. But he doesn't realize how
much he suffers for it. And how much delusion he's
saying when he does that. The true skeptic is interested
in open mindedness. very radical open mindedness. And there are
flavors of humanism that come with true skepticism. It's a
compassionate, loving philosophy. Because how can you hate or criticize
other people, when you don't have any strong opinions about
anything, you don't take any strong positions on anything, to
hate somebody, to be violent to somebody, to be racist
against somebody. To hold yourself as above somebody, or some
class of people, you need to have a strong position.
You see, true skepticism aims at tranquility of the mind.
And that's the ultimate metric by which you judge the
quality of a skeptic. How tranquil is his mind? You'll
see that these debunkers they don't have tranquil minds at
all. They're very easy to tell. True skepticism actually leads
to spirituality. Not because it posits a belief in God.
But actually the opposite. See true people people get this
wrong, right? This is a very counterintuitive point. People think
that all spirituality means a belief in God, no, not
at all, just the opposite. spirituality means complete open mindedness,
and freedom from all ideologies. And that gets you the
peace of mind. Which ends up being God. God is
just ultimate peace of mind, you see, but you can't
know that while until your mind is still your mind
has to agitate it to see that and to understand
that. And that's not something you believe you don't believe
in tranquility of mind. You either have it or you
don't. And how do you have it? By stopping to
take ideological positions, stop doing that stop being dogmatic. So
true spirituality is actually the opposite of dogmatism? To be
effective at spirituality, you need to be very effective at
inquiry. And that's what true skepticism leads to is it
leads to the ultimate ability to inquire because you are
so open minded, that you can keep inquiring and inquiry
inquiry for the rest of your life. Without taking views
or positions or having preferences. And in this sense, true,
open mindedness really starts coming. True skepticism really starts to
look like Buddhism, Advaita, Vedanta, and other non duality teachings.
Now, what are the practical ramifications of Peronism? Firstly, it's
radical open mindedness, which I keep harping about over and
over again. And you might wonder, why do I harp
about rapid, radical open mindedness so much, is because when
I was young, when I was still a teenager, I
learned about Puritanism, I sort of learned about it and
invented it on my own at the same time, it
was an interesting process. And that made me so open
minded, that because of that, I was able to discover
personal development, self actualization, and then ultimately, non dual inquiry,
and ultimately, the highest levels of consciousness that are so
mind blowing, and so amazing that if you even had
a glimpse of this, even for a few seconds, your
entire life would change. And that all was facilitated by
Puritanism. This right here, by really taking this to heart
by really understanding the problem with dogmatism. See, so that's
why I harp on that so much. That's a very
practical matter. Most people cannot grow, cannot self actualize, and
cannot do any kind of spiritual purification work, because their
minds are too closed. So don't think of Peronism is
just some sort of philosophy in the abstract. No, no,
no, no, this is very practical stuff. This will completely
transform the way you feel about your life. We're not
just talking about profound metaphysical questions here. We're also talking
about very practical matters, your everyday life. Because guess what,
when it comes to your relationships, to your finances, to
your emotions, to your business, to your career, to your
life purpose, In all these situations, you hold very many
beliefs. You don't have to be a scientist or a
mathematician or a rationalist. To be paradigm locked, you are
paradigm locked. And that's why you're stuck in a lot
of these areas in your life and you can't move
forward. And you don't know how to outgrow them. Because
you're stuck in this sort of paradigm. Peronism is the
lever that you use to prop yourself out to free
your mind Another practical ramification of Pierre anism is that
it produces a state of perpetual inquiry. All the other
ideologies, they try to lock your mind down, so that
you believe in that ideology and that ideology alone. And
then you don't go explore all the other possibilities. Pure
anism is one of the few philosophies that bucked that
trend. Another ramification of paganism is that it leads to
pragmatism. Once you realize that philosophy and idealogue an ideological
thinking, doesn't get you anywhere, then you pause and you
stop. And what happens, you get thrown back into your
experience and into your senses. And then you go about
living your everyday life in a non ideological manner. And
this is very practical. And yet this pragmatism is different
from the way that most people are pragmatic in their
lives. A lot of people are very pragmatic in their
lives, but in the wrong sense in the materialistic sense,
in the sense that they go and they just chase
whatever they think is going to be pleasurable to them.
In the moment, they chase drugs, women, men, money, success,
fame, a house, all this sort of stuff. But that's
not the peroneus pragmatism, Peroni and pragmatism is that you
realize, like, hey, ideology is not going to get me
to eudaimonia. But I'm still after eudaimonia. How do I
get through diammonium just through becoming one with my experiences
and my sensations. And in this sense, Peronism then leads
to mindfulness. And mindfulness then strengthens the tranquility of your
mind, and ultimately leads you to the absolute ultimate truth,
which is utter tranquility. The absolute is pure tranquility, pure
emptiness, consciousness, the true self. So all this comes together
in a very beautiful way. But most people don't pursue
mindfulness or a real exploration of their experiences or their
sensory field. Because they're stuck in ideology and theorizing about
stuff. You don't actually bother to sit down and take
a look at what's really going on here. Within the
appearances, because you're too busy conceptualizing the appearances. Another practical
ramification of Peronism is that it creates a sort of
active vigilance against the minds trickery. It recognizes that the
mind is very tricky, and that we always need to
be on guard, we always need to be questioning everything.
And that becomes important for not getting stuck. Which leads
the next ramification appear aneurysm is that is one of
the few mechanisms that exist out there to prevent paradigm
lock. I've talked about paradigm lock and other episodes pretty
deep topic of check out my episode on paradigms, understanding
how they work. But virtually all other philosophies or ideologies
get you stuck in a paradigm of some sort, which
is blind to itself. And that's a that's a huge,
huge obstacle to your growth and to your ability to
be happy in life. Another ramification of Peronism is a
sort of what we might call Peroni and modesty, that
results when you actually embody Puritanism, and not just talk
about it, but embody it, you become humble and modest.
It's not that you eliminate every single belief in every
single position ever, and you have no preferences whatsoever. That's
a difficult state to reach to that sort of an
ideal, that's the pinnacle. But the next best thing to
letting go of all your beliefs and all your ideals
and all your preferences, is at the very least, to
be humble about them, and to acknowledge that they're just
your own preferences, and that they're not the absolute truth.
And what this leads to, is a sort of ideological
humility, where you can speak and listen to all sorts
of other ideologies that exist all sorts of other beliefs
in a non judgmental manner and you're tolerant rather than
being offended the way that most people are, why are
most people offended by other conflicting ideologies, because to maintain
their ideological position they need to avoid all other ideological
positions. See, their mind is forever pitted against all other
minds, only the peroneus, who has no position to enjoy
the luxury of freedom in the intellectual domain, it's a
really beautiful thing. I wish I could describe it in
a better way. But I feel very free. Intellectually, I
can study anything without getting upset by it is such
a such an amazing freedom to have intellectual freedom. I
wish you could experience it. That's because I've been adopting
Peronism for several decades now, since my late teenage years.
And another very important thing that this leads to is
holism. I've talked about holism in the past, and how
one of the most important elements that I'm trying to
teach you with actualised.org is to take a multi perspectival
approach to your learning. Don't go with any one school
or any one philosophy, be holistic, try to understand all
the perspectives and see them as perspectives. This is such
a rich and rewarding thing. And I find it so
rare. Even among non dual people, I find it very
rare, most non dual people, they just pick one school
and they they stick with it. And if they're lucky,
they pick the right school and it works. And if
they're unlucky, they pick the wrong school or a cult
or something. And then it turns out horrible. To avoid
those mistakes, be holistic, but you can't be holistic, unless
you're really a peroneus. Because there's going to be certain
ideologies that will rub you the wrong way, you're not
gonna be able to study or understand them. So one
of the practical ramifications of Peronism is that you become
a super efficient, deep learner, your learning abilities get multiplied
by orders of magnitude, you are able to assemble really
big pictures, you're able to understand reality at levels that
almost nobody else can. It's incredible. That's why I love
it so much. And lastly, the practical ramification of puritanism
is what the Greeks called ataraxia. That's their term. And
what that meant meant was a lucid state of robust
equanimity. So it's that quietness of mind. That's a very
beautiful and profound thing. You want to experience that? Do
you want to live the rest of your life in
monkey mind? Or this deep, profound existential tranquility? You want
the tranquility? So that's very practical. Do you see how
you, when you get that you have it every single
day? You can't lose it. It's amazing. That's what you
want. That's ultimately what this whole journey is about. So
let's conclude here and some stuff some stuff up. Why
am I telling you about all this? Philosophy, and this
epistemology and specifically about these ancient philosophical systems like period
ism? Well, firstly, because I want you to see the
power of proper use of reasoning. Reasoning is chiefly useful
in realizing its own limitations. When you when reasoning is
used improperly. It hides all of its own limitations, and
it tries to crown itself as the king just like
every other ideology and that's ultimately what we're trying to
avoid is we're trying to avoid being like every other
dogmatist because guess what, being a dogmatist, you can never
be happy. Have you realized this yet? You cannot attain
Eudaimonia as a dogmatist. That's the problem. And it doesn't
matter what the content of your dogma is. Because you're
an atheist, dogmatist does not make you any happier than
if you're a religious fundamentalist dogmatist. This is where the
atheists and scientists really misunderstand. They get so hung up
on their desire to not be religious. They want to
react so much against religion, that they go to the
opposite end of the spectrum, and they don't see that
they themselves are committing the very same mistake that they
hate about religious people. What do the scientific people hate
about the religious people? Well, they'll tell you that we've
seen so much violence and closed mindedness and evil come
from dogmatic religious people that we Want to avoid that
in the future at all costs? Because it's silly and
ridiculous, and downright unethical. But then what did they do?
They commit the exact same mistake because they misunderstand the
problem. The problem is not in the content. The problem
is not that you believe in God, that's not what
creates the problem. The problem is that you are dogmatic
about your position. The problem is that your paradigm locked.
So the scientist will say and criticize the religious person,
because the religious person they'll say, is completely closed down
to evidence. They're not willing to read to listen to
reason. They're just faith based. And that's silly. In modern
society, we need to be reasonable and open to evidence.
And yet the scientist himself is not really open to
evidence, he doesn't take that standard upon himself, he has
a double standard. Because he doesn't question the very many
assumptions, the existential assumptions that science makes, that rationality makes.
Another reason I'm telling you about this is because I
don't want you to get diluted by modern skepticism. So
I want you to have a contrast to understand how
moderate skepticism is a distortion of true skepticism. Another reason
I'm telling you about this is so that you see
the power of not knowing and the power of not
holding positions. This is such a counterintuitive thing. Our culture
tells us that the more we know the better. And
actually, it's the opposite. The people who think they know
the most are the greatest fools. And the wisest people
are the ones who understand the limits of their knowledge.
And they are therefore very humble about that. And the
last reason that I tell you about this is because
I want you to see that dogma is a very
deep paradigm. It's a whole orientation, and that it cuts
through and across any particular content of one's beliefs. It's
not Islam, that's the problem. It's not born again, Christians
that are the problem. It's dogma, that's the problem. And
we have experienced a lot of horrors, millions upon millions
of people have died over the last several 1000 years.
And many people have been victimized and tortured in very
brutal ways, by religion, but really not by religion, but
by dogma. And what we need to do is we
need to learn the lessons very deeply about that. And
what I see is that modern skeptics are not learning
those lessons. Because they're failing to see that the problem
is not the content of the beliefs, but the dogma
itself, and that they themselves are now committing a second
generation of sin. So the first generation of sin was
religion. The second generation of sin is science and skepticism
and rationalism. Because it's reacting against the dogma of religion,
but it's not seeing that it itself is committing the
very same structural problems. But just now in a different
flavor. The flavors are different, the flavor is now scientific.
But the evil is all the same. It's all there.
And for those of you who say, well, Leo, surely
you can't compare Islam and religion, and fundamentalism and how
silly all that is to science, science is so much
more evolved and enlightened than fundamentalist religion. Let me tell
you this. Yes, science is more evolved, but not as
much as you think. Not nearly as much as you
think. And when you say that, you know, religious people,
they're they're very dangerous ones. No, you know what the
greatest danger these days is? Right now, in the 21st
century. The greatest danger to mankind is not religion. It's
science, and technology, and materialism run amok. Do you see
that that's what's happening. Modern Western society is eating itself
alive. It's an anon an unsustainable track, which is fueled
by science, technology and materialism. And I don't have any
problem per se with technology, or science. I love science.
I study a lot of science. I was a, I
was really into chemistry and physics, and biology. In University.
I study these things for years. I'm very passionate about
science. But I'm also cognizant of the limitations there. The
blind spots the income Consciousness, what's going to destroy the
world, if the world is destroyed in the next several
100 years, it won't be radical Islam. It won't be
the Christians. It will be very rational, secular, scientific, technologically
oriented business people, they will destroy the entire fucking earth,
and all human species and perhaps all of life on
this planet, if the trend keeps going. So, you know,
you gotta, you gotta watch out, because when you think
of the dangers over there, the danger might be right
here lurking right inside of you. That's why I harp
on radical open mindedness so much. Be very careful about
that. Law. Let me conclude by pointing out some dangers
here, about understanding this philosophy. It's extremely easy to turn
skepticism into a dogma. So when you go off, after
this episode ends, and you decide to maybe embody some
skepticism or some puritanism in your life. Be very careful
not to turn skepticism into a dogma. That's very easy
to do. What will happen is they'll start running around
and try to question everything, and using your skepticism on
every single problem out there without turning inward, and applying
that skepticism to your own skepticism. See, do not make
that mistake that will turn you into a modern skeptic,
a false skeptic. And everything I said here will be
useless to you. Because you're just going to take on
skepticism as a new ideology, you're gonna make an identity
out of it. You're not going to become truly open
minded, you're going to get paradigm locked, thinking, all the
while that you're really a good skeptic, when you're actually
not. And then you'll get stuck. And you'll get stuck
forever. So that's danger number one. Danger number two, is
to use now the skepticism as a justification to promote
inaction laziness, or nihilism, or cruel behavior. There is nothing
within paganism that suggests that you need to be lazy.
ignore your responsibilities in life, to sit on your couch,
doing nothing, not going to work not having a life
purpose. Holding the world as depressing, and nihilistic, and everything
is meaningless and pointless. To be indecisive, and to be
a dick to other people. There's nothing about Peronism that
suggests that that's a misinterpretation. That's what happens when your
ego latches on to this, and then uses it to
justify all of its lazy behaviors. See, because again, ultimately,
the point here is that you attain Eudaimonia can you
attain Eudaimonia by being lazy, indecisive, nihilistic depressed, and unable
to handle your basic life responsibilities, like not going to
work, not paying your bills, not paying your taxes, not
watching your weight, eating terrible food. If you're going to
do all that, will you get eudaimonia? Will you get
tranquility of the mind? No, you won't. Your mind will
be very agitated. So be careful about that. Yes, skepticism
is supposed to help you break this materialism cycle of
you chasing after titillation and pleasure and various external rewards.
But what it should really do if you use it
properly, should turn you inward. So that you become active
internally, you start to practice mindfulness, start to investigate your
senses start to meditate, start to inquire deeper, because you
recognize the depth of your not knowing. See, with true
skepticism, you stop waging ideological wars out there, and you
sort of now engage in internal ideological war with yourself.
You start to break down and question all of your
beliefs, all of your dogmas, all of your personal preferences,
all of your attachments. Whenever you have an emotion comes
up that disturbs you, that should be a clue for
you to say, oh, that's an attachment. That means I
must have some sort of ideological position there. Because if
I had no ideological position, why would I be attached
to this? The only reason I'm disturbed, my mind is
disturbed, my mind is not tranquil, is disturbed, because I
believe that this thing is important or it's true, and
I'm trying to chase it. Or the opposite. I believe
that this thing is dangerous and evil, and I've tried
to avoid it. And that means I'm taking your position.
And that means I need to do more work to
embody true skepticism. See, so you have a lot of
work to do. I'm not saying that you be lazy.
Don't go to work. Don't do any personal development, just
sit on your ass, not knowing anything. That's not what
this is about. Now, you might wonder, how is purism
related to enlightenment? Like I said before, I don't think
the pureness really understood enlightenment. Because enlightenment is a very,
it's a very deep place to get to. Enlightenment is
the absolute truth. But this is not something you can
get argued, or evidence for. Enlightenment is the Absolute Truth.
The connection with Peronism is that period ism puts you
in the best position possible, ideologically to go and to
pursue non duality, to do the practices. And then to
discover the Absolute Truth, the absolute truth you will discover
is actually an evident thing. You remember how in the
course I read to you, the skeptic said that we
deny everything, but the non evidence. Sorry, we deny everything,
but what is evidence appearances, it turns out that the
absolute which is infinity, infinity turns out to be evident.
But it requires raising of consciousness. If you become very
conscious, you will realize that all of this right here
is absolute infinity. This absolute infinity is Consciousness is awareness,
it is tranquility, it is the ultimate peace of mind,
it is everything that the pianist was after the entire
time, it is eudaimonia. It is the ultimate end of
this path. It is full liberation from all attachments. And
it's what you ultimately want. So the connection here is
perfect. Now, as far as whether they really realized this
2000 years ago, I don't know probably not. But like
I said, I take a very holistic perspective. So by
no means am I up here saying that Spiritism is
the ultimate one true religion that you need to now
go and practice. No, not at all. It's just a
perspective, take it as perspective. It has limitations and so
forth. Right? Not everything they say is, is is applicable
to your life. It is a pretty old philosophy, some
stuff within it is a little bit outdated. Now, you
might also say, well, Leo, is it really the case
that you're accepting this philosophy? Because it sounds like this
just leads to relativism, and false equivalency, you're saying that
everything is the same, the peroneus says that, whether it's
radical, fundamental Islam, terrorism, or science or Christianity is all
the same. This is an extremely important point. So listen
closely. There is a much deeper game here that needs
to be played. When you are getting caught up in
this nitpicking of like, oh, well, but Islam is worse
than Christian Christianity. And you know, Christianity is little better
than this. And this is this and that and science
is better than all those. And when you get into
that game, you're stuck in that game. And you don't
see the much deeper thing that we're after here. We're
after tranquility of mind. Stop small frying the small fish.
Go for the big fish land the fucking whale, the
whale is tranquility of mind is the absolute. In the
meantime, this might sound like you're going to be living
in a sort of wishy washy world of moral relativism.
It only seems that way. Because it's very counterintuitive. And
the ego is going to try to trick you. You
need to see past that and you need to see
that the bigger picture. The most important thing here is
for you to stop holding positions. Just stop holding positions,
let it go. The whole point of the ego is
to grab onto a position even the letting go have
positions, the ego will try to latch on to that
even enlightenment, the ego will try to latch on to
that. And to turn that into a position. Everything the
ego touches it tries to turn into a position, because
that's what the ego is. It's an identity structure. It
needs a position to be to exist. Don't fall into
that trap. Don't get distracted. Focus on landing the whale
to land the whale. I recommend you go out there
and read this book. The outlines appear anism study it
and then embody it. There's a lot of interesting arguments
here. more nuanced arguments which I wasn't able to present,
because they're sort of detailed, which Sextus empiricus provides to
you as ammunition against the dogmatists. Now, I don't recommend
that you go out there as for arguments with the
dogmatists because that just makes you a dogmatist is the
so don't fall into that trap. But do read some
of these arguments because it'll help to shift something in
your mind. Right, you really need to understand how deep
this problem of dogmatism goes. dogmatism is there, because it's
connected to the very deep structures of your psyche, because
your psyche needs to create identity. And it will do
that, by any means possible, unless you take extraordinary measures
to prevent it. Unless you work on developing your awareness
and your consciousness, so that it stops doing that so
that you can see through the game. That's what this
work is about. All right, that's it, I'm signing off,
please click like button for me. And come check out
actualize that org right here, this is my website, I
have some cool resources there for you have my book
list. Outlines of Peronism is one of the books, one
of the amazing books on my book list, I have
hundreds of other books there. And I'll be adding more
and updating that list in the future. So sign up
for it and keep getting the free updates. Every time
I update the list. That's free to all the other
people who have purchased it in the past my life
purpose courses there, my blog is there, I'm releasing some
interesting blog posts. So go check those out. The forum
is there, go have some discussions on our forum. And
lastly, just stay with actualised.org you can do that by
signing up to the newsletter, or subscribing just staying tuned.
Because there's a lot more important frameworks that I need
to share with you. There's a lot of other epistemic
traps, and just personal development traps that you will fall
into. If you don't learn more, you need to learn
the basics of how self actualization works, which is what
actualize that org is about. And the best way to
hold actualized.org material is not as an ideology. But in
light of what we talked about here with puritanism. Think
of it as a laxative, to cure you of your
constipation. This is the perfect metaphor for how to hold
all of my teachings. You don't worship the laxative Do
you? You take the laxative to practically solve a specific
problem that you have which is your constipation. You take
the laxative, it goes into your system, it blows all
the shit out of you. It frees up frees you
up it untangles your mind, and then the laxative exits
your system along with all this shit. That's the process
here. This material, you don't need to worship it me
you don't need to worship it. You don't take anything
on faith here. This is all practical stuff. You apply
it, you field test it, you see the results, stuff
that works for you, you keep doubling down on stuff
that doesn't work for you, you reject me throw it
away, and you just keep pushing forward. Keep pushing forward,
keep growing every single week, keep watching more content. Because
you need to undergo a process of at least a
couple of years of massive self education. Because a lot
of the stuff you think is right to do in
your life is wrong. And you're not going to learn
that because you weren't taught properly in school. And your
culture is not teaching you properly actualize that org is
teaching you stuff that is difficult, quite frankly, this is
very difficult stuff to market. So you're very lucky that
you have stumbled upon this content however you did. Because
you're not going to see this stuff on TV or
on your Facebook feed. Or your friends are talking about
it. Now they're not they're not talking about this. Your
family is not talking about this. Your coworkers aren't talking
about this. This is quite a unique time to be
alive. That we have this internet tech Knology that you
stumbled upon this content. This is life saving life transforming
content, but you do need to work it. You need
to see the record, you need to recognize the value
of what you see here. And I'm not saying like,
Oh, it's valuable, because it's me. It's Leo's stuff. That's
why it's valuable. No, this stuff I'm talking about. It's
not my stuff. These are just the rules of the
human psyche, which humanity, certain elements of humanity have known
about for 1000s of years, like the Iranians, they understood
this stuff. The gymnasts, sofas, they understood this stuff. But
most elements of society don't understand this stuff. So it's
valuable because it actually works, because it actually tells you
something accurate about your psyche, because it makes you more
aware. That's why it's valuable. It's valuable because it's completely
transformed the quality of my life. And I feel like
I'm only getting started on this journey. You won't believe
how profound and incredible this journey is, once you really
sink your teeth into it. It's tricky at first. It's
hard at first, you stumble and fall and you quit.
But you need to just keep coming back and have
faith that this thing will work out in the end.
You do need to have that much faith and then
just follow the process. So keep doing that. Stick with
me. And I'll see you soon with more.
