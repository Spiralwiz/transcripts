            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/v1yA9KbPzQ0' target='_blank'>How To Harness Your Intuition</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Intuition Importance Reaction</b>: Intuition is key to self-actualization and creates the big picture that allows for intricate problem-solving. People's logical mind cannot grapple with a large amount of data. Instead, our intuitive subconscious mind processes information, providing wisdom and creative insights.
</li><li><b>Detriments of Ignoring Intuition</b>: Modern Western culture undervalues intuition, preferring rational justifications. But significant decisions often stem from intuition. When intuition is ignored, life lacks big-picture thinking, motivation, purpose, and strategy. Over rationalization and justification can disrupt intuitive decisions.
</li><li><b>Intuition vs. Logic</b>: Intuition is more powerful than logic because it creates purpose and vision. It generates the big picture that allows your logical mind to fill in the details.
</li><li><b>The Power of the Subconscious</b>: The human subconscious can process vast amounts of data, providing decisions, wisdom, and creative insights. This intuitive intelligence makes humans remarkable.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Experiences</b>: Leo has used his intuition to guide significant life decisions, from choosing challenging college classes to switching his major, quitting jobs, and founding Actualized.org. Each intuitive decision has led to personal growth and success.
</li><li><b>Intuition Challenges</b>: Three key challenges hinder the use of intuition. Many people cannot hear their intuitive voice. Those who do hear often have too many personal impurities (like fear and craving) that prevent them from following it. Reinforcing intuition requires discipline, learning new skills, personal growth, changing belief systems, and taking practical steps  often outside of your comfort zone. 
</li><li><b>How to Harness Your Intuition</b>: Journaling, clear articulation, and strategic contemplation can empower your intuitions. True commitment means prioritizing intuitive direction above all else. Distinguishing between true intuitions and false intuitions (which defend themselves with justifications) is also critical. 
</li><li><b>Connecting Emotion and Intuition</b>: Cultivating emotional connection aids in hearing and following intuition. The Self-help field aims to connect individuals with their emotions by addressing impurities such as ego, cravings, fears, traumas, and dogmas that can distort intuition. Shedding these attachments and beliefs allows for clearer and more effective intuitive guidance. 
</li><li><b>Environment and Intuition</b>: Changing one's environment can help clear intuitive impurities. This includes consumed information, diet, and relationships. These actions create space for intuition to be heard and trusted.
</li><li><b>The Power of Body Awareness</b>: Regular practice of body awareness activities such as bodywork, yoga, and exercise can increase intuition by leading to a more relaxed state.
</li><li><b>Committing to Intuition</b>: Leo suggests committing to serving your intuition and the courage to listen, receive, and execute its messages. Connecting with this higher intelligence leads to purpose-driven decisions and an amazing life. 
</li><li><b>Shifting Perspective</b>: A mindset that views ourselves as part of the universe motivates and aids in achieving our goals. By consistently learning and taking action, we can embody intuition and realize our vast potential.
</li><li><b>Motivation</b>: Following intuition requires courage, a creative mindset, and often radical changes in life. Those who don't follow intuition tend to stagnate, while those who do see continuous change and growth in their lives.
</li><li><b>Intuition Incubator</b>: Create an intuition incubator that allows for developing and executing intuition over time. Personal impurities can hinder the process.
</li><li><b>Distorted Intuition</b>: Question and scrutinize your intuitions. False intuitions tend to defend themselves and are typically fear-based, while true intuitions remain resilient under scrutiny and are driven by love or beauty.
</li><li><b>Challenges in Following Intuition and Solutions</b>: People struggle with intuition because they cant hear it, there are personal impurities that hinder following it, and even when they can hear it, they fail to act on it.
</li><li><b>Cultural influences inhibiting intuition</b>: The inability to hear intuition can be tied to cultural reasons, including excessive distractions and a bias towards logic, pragmatism, and materialism inherent in Western cultures.
</li><li><b>Intelligence and Higher Consciousness</b>: Acknowledge that intelligence is not self-generated, but interwoven into existence itself. This comprehension often comes with higher consciousness states achieved through meditation or psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Removing Distractions and Contemplating Mortality</b>: One key solution is to reduce distractions to allow intuition to come forth. Contemplating ones mortality can also drive the focus away from materialism and towards more profound insights.
</li><li><b>Getting clear about life desires and Meditating</b>: Be clear about our life desires that extend beyond material success and cultivate a habit of meditation. This practice can enhance intuitive thinking and connect us more with our emotions.
</li><li><b>Personal Impurities</b> : The presence of ego, cravings, fears, traumas, and dogmas can distort intuition, causing it to be misguiding.
</li><li><b>Benevolent Motives and Spiritual Purification</b>: Start with benevolent motives derived from love and not from fear or cravings. Introduce spiritual purification by gradually eliminating fears, cravings, and limiting beliefs, turning oneself into an empty vessel ready to receive and act upon intuitive guidance.
</li><li><b>Releasing Beliefs</b>: Releasing self-limiting beliefs is a critical step for effectively following through on intuitions. People need to understand that they can hinder their growth and weigh them down. Letting go of these beliefs allows an individual to rise higher, more aligned with their intuition.
</li><li><b>Limiting beliefs and their effects on intuition</b>: Leo states that self-imposed limitations often prevent us from acting on our intuitive instincts. He explains that many people have the false belief that intuition is less significant or reliable than logic, a common attitude amongst scientifically minded individuals. These beliefs are a form of self-attachment that need to be released in order for intuition to be fully realized.
</li><li><b>Changing environment to clear impurities</b>: To clear up impurities that may block intuition, Leo suggests changing one's environment - this includes both physical surroundings and intake of information. Our environment, he says, continually recreates impurities within us, which can prevent clear and intuitive thought. By actively controlling what we consume, both in terms of food and media, we can reduce these influences.
</li><li><b>The importance of healthy relationships and releasing bodily tension</b>: Toxic relationships can lead to drama and emotional turmoil, taking up emotional and mental space and thus blocking intuition. It's important to rid oneself of toxic relationships and create a healthy, supportive network of relationships. Physiological tension held in the body can be another obstacle - Leo advocates for practices like bodywork, massage, yoga or weightlifting to release this tension and facilitate a more intuitive state of mind.
</li><li><b>The significance of commitment and seriousness about intuition</b>: Leo discusses that many individuals receive intuitive hits but fail to act on them due to a lack of commitment or reluctance to step out of their comfort zones. He highlights the importance of viewing service to one's intuition as their primary life's mission. This requires flexibility, personal growth, courage, change of belief systems, adaptability and, in many cases, radical changes in life circumstances.
</li><li><b>The concept of the intuition incubator</b>: Intuitions often come in a rough, unrefined form that need to be polished and cultivated over time. Leo suggests creating an "intuition incubator", which involves consistently clarifying, contemplating, and acting upon one's intuitions. He stresses that intuition should be prioritized over short-term comfort and convenience for true personal growth and transformation.
</li><li><b>Journaling Intuitions</b>: Leo Gura recommends writing down concrete and clear descriptions of intuitions to keep track of them, deepen understanding, and construct actionable plans. 
</li><li><b>Persistence in Following Intuitions</b>: He emphasizes the long-term strategic commitment to act upon these intuitive plans, even if they take years to unfold. Fractions of personal comfort or security should not outweigh following intuitions.
</li><li><b>Determining True vs. False Intuitions</b>: Leo discusses how questioning an intuition can reveal its nature. False intuitions defend themselves with justifications, while true intuitions remain silent but maintain their magnetic pull. False intuitions tend to be protective and based on fear (playing not to lose), while true intuitions are aspirational and come from love or beauty (playing to win).
</li><li><b>Surrendering to Universal Intelligence</b>: Leo describes an alignment with a vast and universal intelligence beyond the individual mind that guides all life decisions. He suggests surrendering to this force, which can transform one's life to serve greater purposes and reveal aspirational living.
</li><li><b>Connecting with Deeper Calling</b>: Gura encourages listeners to be in touch with their deeper calling and the intelligence flowing through them. To strive for this, consistent learning and action, or 'executing', is important. He emphasizes that personal acts should serve the entire universe, not just the individual.
</li><li><b>Practical worksheet for Developing Intuition</b>: Leo provides a free worksheet with practical questions to aid in developing intuitions. He prompts listeners to stay connected with actualized.org for more content on self-actualization and developing deeper connections with the higher power within.
</li><li><b>Long-term Commitment to Personal Development</b>: Gura encourages commitment to persistent education, filling the mind with right concepts and ideas, and executing actions based on teachings for consistent personal growth. He concludes by urging listeners to explore the vast possibilities of self-actualization with actualized.org.
