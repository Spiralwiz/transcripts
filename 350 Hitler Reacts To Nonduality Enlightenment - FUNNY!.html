            <ul>
    <li><b>Hitler's Initial Reaction to Nonduality</b>: Hitler initially resists the concept of nonduality, casting it off as New Age ideas and questioning how the physical world can be non-existent. He feels conflicted about the concept given that it feels real, leading to mental turmoil.
</li><li><b>Collapse of Hitler's Previous Understanding</b>: The discussion leads to a profound crack in Hitler's understanding about the nature of reality and self. His worldview undergoes a drastic turn, as he realizes it was constructed through illusions, asking why he put so much effort into maintaining it.
</li><li><b>Hitler's Acceptance of Nonduality</b>: Ultimately, Hitler acquiesces to the concept of Infinite Nothingness, acknowledging its all-encompassing nature. This realization fundamentally changes his perspective on life, prompting him to find peace in the simple pleasures, such as feeding squirrels and attending spiritual gatherings (satsangs).
