hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we are going to talk about the topic of
judgment alright so let's talk about this topic of judgment
very very critical topic for doing deep levels of personal
development so I'm very excited to break into this one
and crack it wide open what is judgment and why
should we care about it why is it good why
is it bad and what can we do about being
overly judgmental so let's let's talk about that for a
second ultimately let's get an understanding of what judgment is
judgment when you judge someone or something or some situation
or yourself ultimately what's going on there is that your
mind is bifurcating the world it's splitting it apart it's
putting arbitrary divisions into a reality that is ultimately undivided
so what's going on here is that you're seeing something
in reality that you either like or dislike and you
start to label it and usually the labels are good
and bad so you look at things in the world
and you judge them you evaluate them it could be
a person it could be that person's appearance it could
be that person's behavior it could be that person's philosophy
or politics or religion it could be what that person
does with his life the lifestyle they choose to live
or it could be a thing you could look at
a car and judge it as being pretty or ugly
or you could look at a building or you could
look at your computer or you could look at any
number of inanimate objects or even animate objects for that
matter animals the next thing that you could judge is
you could judge situations circumstances of life maybe situations that
you find self in things that are really gripping you
and troubling you and problematic maybe it's a legal case
that you have maybe it's some problem with the IRS
maybe it's the the bill collectors that are after you
or maybe it's a nice situation that you have maybe
it's a nice relationship that you're in or a marriage
that is gonna go forward or a graduation or some
sort of ceremony so those are situations into it you
could be judging and then of course the most important
thing that you judge is yourself right so many of
us go through life judging ourselves constantly every little thing
that we're doing obviously the big things that we're doing
but even the little micro things that you are doing
in your life you're judging yourself for those you're telling
yourself this is good this is good this is bad
this is bad and you're making these kinds of evaluations
so what's going on here and why is this happening
well basically what's happening is that you are using your
mind and you're using it for its survival mode right
your mind has evolved to help you survive in this
world and it's not really interested about your happiness it's
more interested about your survival in your reproduction so your
mind is always on the lookout putting valuations on things
and situations and people to make sure that they're in
line with your survival maximum fitness maximum fitness you're trying
to maximize your fitness and you're always looking around and
you're judging things and you're looking at stuff and you're
saying you know is that useful to me or is
that thing more useful to me how what's the relative
usefulness of these things or maybe you see something and
it's completely useless to you and so you disregard it
or you label it as bad or you label it
as good what is good and bad good and bad
don't exist out in reality reality just is it's neutral
it's completely neutral you might think that good and bad
exists you might think that there's someone out there who's
really truly bad and there might be certain things that
are really truly good that's not the case that's your
mind those are thoughts that are creating this division within
a reality that's ultimately under now the problem with judgment
is that if you go around judging things constantly all
the time people situations things and yourself then you're going
to be living a very miserable type of existence if
you probably know someone like this in your life maybe
a parent maybe a close or distant friend maybe somebody
at work you know that that guy or that girl
who is always looking at situations and always criticizing them
always finding fault with something there's always something wrong something
is not quite as they want it it's not as
it ought to be and you know you know those
types of people right there are critics they're cynics the
problem with that kind of way of living life is
is that you simply can't be happy with that judgment
and Happiness they they really cannot coexist because happiness is
just being content in the moment and being satisfied with
how things are whereas judgment is the opposite of that
it's making divisions and telling yourself that things ought to
be different when things always ought to be different than
what that means is that that puts you into a
certain kind of like struggle and resistance with life that
means that you have to change stuff that means things
are not perfect things are not right and so you
have to go out there and have to work and
like fix things and people have to fix things for
you in order to suit you living your life like
this it's a really a losing game it's a game
that's rigged against you you might think well but leo
you know what's wrong with with judging things good and
bad I mean clearly certain things are are bad for
me bad for my life so it's a it's appropriate
to judge those as bad things and certain things are
great for my life and it's appropriate to judge those
as good things for example a relationship a nice relationship
I would judge that as good and something like you
know someone coming and burglarizing my house while I'm out
on vacation but you would call that bad so isn't
that pretty pretty obvious common sense kind of stuff here's
the problem is that you take it from that and
you take it and then you keep going going and
going and going it's where it leads you it's like
the slippery slope and this is what's happening is that
you're thinking that you're always going to be able to
to get the good right the problem is that when
you're when you're making these divisions of good versus bad
what you're doing not only are you not being true
to reality let's even forget that argument for a second
but what you're doing there is that you're always then
on the lookout for what's better right what's better so
if one car is pretty and another cars ugly then
you're not gonna want the ugly car you're gonna want
the pretty car and then if this car is pretty
then the other car that you see tomorrow might be
even prettier might be even nicer so it's even better
so right now relative to these two new cars this
old one that you had that one is bad this
new one is good and then the next day you
might see an even better car a car that you
like even more it's got even more features it's got
even better gas mileage or whatever you look forward to
car better performance looks more beautiful conceit more people now
you have an even better car and now this car
that you thought was the best suddenly now that's a
bad car there's even a better car and now you
see where this is going it's going into a never-ending
cycle of looking for something better and what this leads
to is this leads to endless action action action action
action action and no real and no satisfaction you are
that hamster that's chasing a piece of cheese and in
a wheel and you're just running and running around in
that wheel your whole life and so when you become
very critical when you come very judgmental and you're judging
things all the time is good and bad people things
situation yourself then you're never going to be satisfied it's
a it's a big game you you trick yourself and
you tell yourself well if only I get a little
bit of this good stuff and I get a little
bit rid of all this bad stuff then I'll be
happy but honestly it's the mindset that you're coming at
it from if you train up that kind of mindset
then even if we give you all the best stuff
in the world what are you going to do you're
going to wake up the next morning and you're going
to start using that divisionary mind that you've developed over
the years you're gonna use that divisionary mind to again.we
then all the good stuff you're gonna start finding faults
you're gonna start to nitpick stuff and it just becomes
a huge trap so one thing you got to do
is you got to start to notice how much you're
judging things this is a very unconscious activity that's going
on you might see someone walking down the street as
you're driving on your way to work or you're driving
back home and you just might see someone with some
some weird haircut or some weird shirt and you just
spontaneously judge that person you know make some sort of
judgement ah sure that's ugly oh that cars is is
awful or that person over there said something rude and
he's a bad person or that idea that someone is
talking about that's a stupid idea so you're always going
through and you're and you're doing this and when you
do this ultimately what happens is that you become very
dissatisfied internally and it becomes very toxic you might know
these types of people these types of people may become
very toxic and then it's very hard to be in
a relationship with them or it's very hard to have
them as a friend because literally their toxicity will infect
you and these types of people will tend to attract
other types of toxic people and they'll form these toxic
kind of bubbles and you do not want to get
trapped into that nor do you want to be one
of these toxic people so what do we do about
this well first of all recognize the ideal situation the
ideal situation is to be with reality as it is
reality is neutral and you want to ideally treat it
as such treat it as neutral stop assigning all these
labels these labels is something that your mind is creating
these are thoughts right these are thoughts just labels your
sticking labels on stuff you see an object you stick
a label on it you see a person you slap
a label on it and all the sudden your reality
is filled with these labels and you think that these
labels are very real and these labels will then start
to influence your behaviors your your thought patterns and then
your feelings in your mood ultimately you want zero judgment
in your life you got to become very conscious of
how much judgement you're doing and then you want to
have to kind of start to retrain yourself slowly to
unhook from that to stop all the judging alright so
the next point I wanted to make is about self
actualization and so if you wash my self actualisation video
which you should it's it's titled self-actualization I go into
a deep definition Abraham Maslow's definition of what is self
actualized human being is this is basically the greatest potential
that you can unleash within yourself and a self actualized
person one of the features there are many characteristics but
one of the characteristics is that that self-actualized person he
is not judging things all the time he's not coming
at reality with a valuation mindset evaluation mindset is when
you look at an object or a thing or a
situation or a person and your relationship to it is
is distorted because you look at it through a selfish
set of lenses right I want you to notice this
is this is a bit of a freaky experience when
you go out and you start to notice yourself doing
this because it happens unconsciously notice that when you're in
a relationship with an object or a person or situation
a lot of times what's happening there is that you're
coming at it from what's in it for me right
what's in it for me so you might be typing
on your keyboard and all of a sudden you get
mad at your keyboard because it's malfunctions and your computer
is malfunctioning and now you get upset and you look
at that keyboard not as an object in the world
that is part of reality not as a marvel of
human engineering or anything like that you look at it
as purely a means to accomplish something for yourself right
that keyboard is a means to go and and search
something online or to watch some video or to write
an email or do something else but you're not really
treating that object in this entirety and so this creates
a very subtle but also significant dysfunction within your life
is when you start to treat objects and things and
people just in in a relationship where you know it's
what can you do for me what is this object
doing for me what is this what is this situation
doing for me and is it doing what I wanted
to do is it advancing my survivability is it advancing
my happiness if you comment life like this you're never
going to be happy because you're was gonna be able
to find stuff that is not doing what you wanted
to be doing and you're always gonna be constantly dissatisfied
and in fact there's a really deep pleasure that you
can get when you drop all that when you drop
all the thoughts and all the judges in the criticism
and you just kind of be right you be with
the object you'd be with the situation without needing anything
from it you know maybe your computer is malfunctioning take
a second and just like be with it without expecting
anything from it see how that changes that situation it
can be a pretty powerful thing this is something they
have to work towards as you're becoming more self actualized
because ultimately self-actualize people are very good at this this
is where they're deriving a lot of their strength and
their happiness from it's just being with reality letting it
be wow I want you to really start to notice
that as you're going through life you're making a lot
of what I call micro judgements so up to this
point we've really been talking about macro judgments these are
obvious judgment that you make of people you know someone
cuts you off you think that he's an obvious kind
of judgment so obviously want to cut that out or
someone says something at work that you don't quite like
and you judge him for it those are obvious things
less obvious is the judgments that you make of situations
and objects and this is happening on a subconscious level
almost every second of your life here's an example you
might for example go and decide that your want to
cook some dinner so you go and what do you
do well you put up you pull out a plate
and you maybe you pull out some some utensils and
some silverware then maybe you open your fridge and as
you're going through that process you're making little judgments you're
not just being and you're not just doing but you're
analyzing and criticizing so maybe you pull out that plate
and you look at that plate and you you you
look it at the plate and you you see it
as something as a utility to you right oh this
plate this is a little bit too small let me
grab that bigger plate this plate is no good I
need a bigger plate because I'm making a big salad
okay so you could have a big plate now you
got a big plate now you think to yourself okay
I need to I need to put some stuff on
this plate so you open the fridge and you're looking
through the fridge and already as you're looking to the
fridge you're analyzing you're judging you might be criticizing any
may be saying oh okay that that tomato right there
that's no good I'm not interested in tomato right now
damn it I wish I would have bought some lemons
I don't have any lemons right now okay so that's
not gonna work and you just kind of like go
through and then maybe you spot something that you like
you spot some let's say you spot some some spinach
okay some spinach so you grab that and you tell
yourself Oh spinach good that's healthy so you pull it
out see as you're going through and doing that you're
not really being in reality what you're being is you're
being in your own mind and your own head going
through all these thoughts and all this and if you
live your life like this then you become very very
neurotic you robbed yourself a lot of power and basically
you can never be satisfied so I want you to
start to notice these little judgments that you're making a
great example of this is uh have you ever have
you ever been like out in nature maybe hiking seen
a beautiful sunset or a sunrise and you just were
out in nature maybe it's like some picturesque view and
you see the Sun setting through the clouds and the
the sunbeams are shining through the clouds and it's just
beautiful it's orange and purple and and all of this
and you're just kind of standing there and you're just
kind of transfixed by at all and you take it
in and it just feels it feels beautiful feels nice
it feels very peaceful and calm and you feel like
you're you're one with the world you're one with with
reality well the reason that that's actually happening the reason
that that's making you very fulfilled inside and consent is
because you are dropping all those judgments now you might
think that well it's a beautiful it's a beautiful scene
that's why it's because the beauty of the scene you
know that's something very majestic that I rarely get to
see that's not actually why you're enjoying it so much
that makes a little bit easier for you to drop
the judgments but the reason you're really enjoying that situation
is simply because the beauty of that lets you drop
the needing of anything and when you're standing there in
relationship to that sunset you're you're not trying to to
gauge that sunsets value to you you're not trying to
get anything from the sunset you're just there and you're
experiencing it and that experience is an end in itself
it just is and you just are and that's a
beautiful thing and that makes you joyful inside and so
that's what you got to start to cultivate more in
your day-to-day life it doesn't require a sunset or some
beautiful scenery or traveling overseas to experience that you can
start to experience that right here right now with more
mundane parts of your life so the take-home here the
exercise that I'm going to give you is an exercise
on mindfulness I actually have a video that talks about
how to do proper mindfulness it's called mindfulness you might
want to search for that it'll be a nice companion
here but here's what I want you to do I
want you to be very mindful over the next few
days of how you're making both big macro judgments and
little micro judgments I want you to be mindful just
conscious of it don't judge yourself don't try to stop
yourself from making these judgments just notice notice yourself judging
what do you judge cars people situations things yourself what
you're doing with yourself start to notice that start to
notice how you're in relationship with objects and things and
people expecting something expecting utility putting valuations on different things
saying that this is good this is a little bit
better this is worse notice yourself doing that and notice
how it's affecting you notice how it's expecting the quality
of your day-to-day experience just notice don't try to stop
it don't try to control it if you do this
and you stay conscious for the next few days then
you try this out you're gonna have some some realizations
you might even have an epiphany or two as you
notice yourself putting all these labels on reality and you're
going to notice just how artificial that is that's not
natural that's artificial to your neurotic mind all right so
that's gonna be powerful exercise which will start to get
you more aware of how much you're judging things and
start to turn things around for you alright and then
feel free to continue using that in the future the
more mindful you are of how much you're judging the
you're gonna be judging so that's a really good way
to start to tackle and to turn this thing around
