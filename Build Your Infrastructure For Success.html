Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about building the infrastructure for
your success. Are you building your infrastructure? What infrastructure is
that? Well, the infrastructure for a high consciousness life. A
lot of people, when they start to get into spirituality,
or into the higher aspects of personal development, they lose
touch with the practical aspects, the infrastructure you got to
build in order to be successful in life. So that's
what I want to talk about here. What I mean
by infrastructure is, I mean, the practical structures necessary to
live the kind of life you want to live the
high consciousness kind of life, the life that is aligned
with your highest values. That's not something that happens by
accident. That's something you have to create, to construct to
architect. And you have to be very deliberate about it.
It means constructing your environment, an environment that's suitable for
living your values, which makes living your values easy and
automatic, rather than the way it is for most people,
which is a lot of effort and a lot of
resistance and a lot of wasteful energy. They end up
sabotaging themselves simply by the environment that they have surrounded
themselves with, and which they have done nothing to build
to their favor in their advantage. This is really piggybacking
on the topic that I covered in the past, in
the episode about strategic thinking. And there, I talked about
the building of strategic reserves and capacity. And that's exactly
what I mean, when I talk about infrastructure. Don't get
so spiritual, or so idealistic, that you forget about the
pragmatic, utilitarian requirements of life. And don't forget that your
spirituality and your ability to stay in a high consciousness
state, especially at the very beginning of this journey. And,
and probably, through much of it, until you get to
the very end of the journey is going to be
highly dependent upon the environment that you're in. So if
you set up yourself with a very bad negative environment,
with very low quality infrastructure, you're going to find it
very difficult to develop yourself and to live up to
your highest ideals and values. On the other hand, if
you take the effort to just do the ordinary work
of laying the foundation for your life, surrounding yourself with
the right environment, then the spirituality will become automatic and
easy. And that's what you got to be strategic about
is thinking about that, why make life hard for yourself,
make it easy for yourself. What you shouldn't be doing,
ideally, is you should be figuring out what are your
top values, once you know what that is, and if
you take in my life purpose course, I went into
a lot of effort to help you to figure out
your values. So you should know your top 10 values.
Now what you need to do is you need to
systematically go through and say okay, what can I put
in place? What processes, what mechanisms? What objects, what environment
can I stood up for myself, that will make the
following of all those values very easy and effortless and
automatic. And then you go about putting that in place.
So let me give you some concrete examples from my
life. Because I've really spent the last five years working
very hard to lay the infrastructure and the foundation that
I will need to execute on my highest purpose, and
on my values. And a lot of these things, these
infrastructure things that I'm talking about. They're very simple. They're
a lot simpler than they sound, it might sound like
what I'm saying infrastructure, I'm talking about some, you know,
some massive thing that you're supposed to build in your
life. Sometimes it is like that. Sometimes it's simple stuff.
So I'm going to give you examples of simple stuff.
But before talking about the examples, there's one other point
that I wanted to mention, which is I want to
draw the parallel between infrastructure in your personal life and
also infrastructure the way you see it around the world.
So one of the things that gets talked about in
politics these days, like, Let's build up America's infrastructure, okay,
that's a good idea and The reason that's a good
idea is because societies that have high quality infrastructure, facilitate
the growth of human beings and enable them to operate
more effectively, and to do the things that they need
to be doing, rather than wasting their time and inefficiency.
In the same way that if you have a broken
down car, that's 30 years old, and he's got a
bad engine, that's not a good piece of infrastructure for
traveling to work. If that's your main objective in life
is getting to work, then you need a good machine
to help you do that. See, so it makes sense
to spruce up your car so that I can get
you to your work on time all the time consistently.
Well, nations suffer this problem too. And one of the
problems that third world nations face, they have very low
quality infrastructure. You see, and this, of course, is not
a complete deal breaker for people's development. If you want,
you can develop yourself spiritually to the highest levels, no
matter what environment you find yourself in. But still, nevertheless,
at a social level, if we're talking about large averages
of human beings, having the right infrastructure is very helpful.
Which is why in third world countries where people don't
have access to clean water, or to clean air, or
to basic food, or basic medicine, or roads, or the
Postal Service, you know, just these very basic simple things,
you find that these people are not able to really
develop themselves. They're at a very low level of consciousness
and a very low level of development, which is why
you find a lot of corruption in these countries, a
lot of violence, a lot of theft, a lot of
rape, a lot of health problems. So all this stuff
happens there. And you don't find very many enlightened people
there. Maybe one interesting example counterexample to that is India,
where India is generally has a lot of poverty, and
doesn't have the highest quality infrastructure as a country, of
course, they have over a billion people. So it's hard
to provide that much infrastructure for that many people. But
still, in India, you have probably the highest concentration of
spiritual masters, probably at the deepest levels of spiritual attainment
that you'll ever find. One of the reasons for that
is just because when you have a billion people, of
course, you're gonna have a few who are very exceptional,
while the majority are in poverty, but also because India
has this very rich and ancient tradition, and this culture,
that it takes the spirituality and enlightenment very seriously. And
personal development very seriously. So that's interesting to think about.
So it's not so black and white, even if you
find yourself in a very crappy environment. If you really
want to, you can still develop yourself. But overall, it's
going to be a lot more difficult. Okay, so let
me talk about some examples in my own life. Let
me give you just a couple of very simple examples.
So one of the simplest examples that I just did
recently, here's an infrastructure change that I made. One of
the challenges I have is figuring out how do I
capture all the insights that I have throughout the week,
and share them with people and record them, because these
insights come up spontaneously. My best insights just come up
when I'm in the shower, or I'm in the car
or something like that, how do I capture them? So
I've been working on this problem for years now. And
just what came to me recently, one of the solutions
is that what I did is I discovered that I
just don't have a pen around, or a piece of
paper around me all the time to write down all
these insights. So what I did is I went and
I bought a bunch of pens, and a bunch of
post it notes. And so I have those lying around
the house. But what I found is that even that
wasn't good enough, because the insights can come up so
fast, and then they can get lost so fast, they
come into my mind, they go out of my mind
that if I don't record them, immediately, I tend to
find that I lose most of my best insights. So
still, it wasn't working, because I had like one or
two pens lying around the house. And I had one
or two post it note squares lying around the house.
And what I what just came to me is like,
hey, why don't I just like inundate every area of
my house and my car with plenty of pens, and
plenty of post it notes. So I'm never found wanting
for one. So what I did is I have I
have tons of post it notes lying all around my
house, all the common areas that I am in the
kitchen, by the couch, by the office, computer and, and
so forth in the bedroom. And in my car, I
have them and also have pens. I have like tons
of pens more way more pens that I need to
because sometimes I'll take a pen, and I'll use it
to write something down and then I'll lose the pen,
right? I placed the pen in another room and then
I can't find the pen. And because of that I'm
too lazy to actually write down the insight. Now this
seems like such a minor problem, right? You think like
Leo, this is this is small stuff. Why are you
sweating the small stuff? See when you when you get
the small stuff down, the big stuff becomes easy. The
big stuff is difficult because you ignore the small stuff.
The small stuff tends to snowball into add up. So
what I did is not only that I get a
ton of pens, way more pens than you would think
is reasonable, I got a ton of post it notes,
way more than you would think is reasonable. And also
I got these pen holders. So I have these just
like plastic cups that I got at The Container Store
to hold all my pens, and I got a bunch
of them, and I placed them all over my house.
So now it's been working really well. And I've been
taking so many more notes than I have in the
past years of running actualised.org. And it's like, it's pretty
amazing. I've probably doubled if not quadruple the amount of
insights that I'm able to capture just with this very
simple sort of infrastructure. So that's one example of what
I mean by infrastructure. Here's another example. And it also
goes to the same problem that I was having is
how do I capture all these insights? Sometimes I'm driving
in the car, and I can't even write anything down
because I'm driving. So what do I do? Well, I
started looking for ways to do a voice recording. And
of course, I wanted to find the right voice recorder.
So I bought I purchased like five or six different
voice recorders online, played around with all of them for
about a week experiment to try different audio formats, because
I wanted to make sure that the recordings are, are
nice and good that they don't take up too much
disk space, and so forth. So I went through this
whole process of finding the right voice recorders. And in
the end, I actually ended up settling on a voice
recorder app for my phone, I went through a bunch
of different apps tried a bunch of those. So I
went through physical voice recorders and phone voice recorders. I
ordered microphones tested different microphones, this whole process cost me
several $100 cost me a week of time, went through
some hassles with all the technical stuff that goes with.
With this, I found the right app. And now it
works for me. And I've been recording hundreds of new
insights over the last couple of months, that otherwise would
have been completely lost. And it's Wow, it's been really,
really significant. I can really feel the impact of that.
And the reason it's extra significant for me is because
my life purpose is to share insights. That's what my
life is about. So you see, not only is this
just helping my work, it's not just me making my
work more efficient. That's not what's going on here. What
I'm doing here is I'm looking at what's my highest
purpose in life? What are my highest values, which is
truth, and understanding and passion and life purpose, all of
this? And then I'm asking myself, okay, how can I
make my job easier to follow, and to stay aligned
with my purpose and my values? And then I'm asking
myself, okay, so what kind of infrastructure can I build
to help me to do that. And then I build
it, I take the time to go through the nitty
gritty, gritty details of building that. Also, in the last
two years, for my business, I built a backup system,
automatic backup systems, I have a lot of different files,
I have a lot of video files, I built a
backup system of over 36 terabytes of hard drives in
a RAID array, which automatically backs up all my my
laptop, my desktop, all my camera stuff. So that took
quite a bit of effort to research all that to
hook it all up to set it all up, make
sure it's completely automated. So I don't have to worry
about losing files. And for me, you can see how
that's a huge problem. Because if I'm taking all these
notes when I'm putting them on the computer, and then
if I lose all that, that's huge. That means my
life purpose and my values are significantly at risk and
potentially damaged just by a simple computer or hard disk
failure. You see. So these things, some, the difficulty with
them is that they're, they're simpler than they seem. But
what I find is that a lot of people don't
bother to go through the effort of systematically building up
the infrastructure in their life. And certainly, they're not clear
about their values and life purpose. So even if they
do build some infrastructure, it's sort of random. They're not
deliberately strategically saying, Okay, here's my top value, what could
I do to enable that top value to be automatically
happening every single day in my life? See. And I've
been doing this in all areas of my life the
last five years, I've had to in order to be
effective at what I do with actualize that org. I've
optimized my computer's had to research spend a lot of
time getting the right computers getting the right software on
my computer. So all that stuff is very efficient, because
it's very easy for me to to waste hours and
hours and hours with the wrong software with the wrong
computers with the wrong operating systems. And that stuff is
technical stuff. And it's not very spiritual work. You might
say, Well, what does this have to do with spirituality
or personal development? This is just like, work. Yeah, exactly.
Most of the stuff I do with actualised.org is not
super spiritual stuff. You know what I spent my last
five years doing 90% of my effort went into building
infrastructure, not in Some meditation not into, well, I've read
quite a bit of books. But a lot of time
when it's just building infrastructure stuff that is boring stuff
that's very technical, a lot of computer stuff, a lot
of stuff around the house, a lot of camera equipment
stuff, learning cameras, learning microphones, I just like this sort
of stuff, because then it enables me to follow my
life purpose. If all I was doing was just meditating,
and, and dreaming up ideas, there would be no tangible
product for me to put out there. You see. The
infrastructure that I build, the most important ones of it
is the stuff that helps me to put out the
deepest insights that I can. Because that's my number one
purpose, I don't know what your number one purposes is
probably something different. You probably don't even know unless maybe
you've taken my life purpose course. In which case, you've
got something good to go on. Now you can apply
what I'm telling you in this episode. And if you
don't know what your life purpose is, well, that's a
really huge area of your life that you're missing, which
you should probably figure out at some point, which is
why I created my course. So you can check that
out if you want. But also, I want to point
out to you that infrastructure is not just material, hard
stuff. So there's hard infrastructure, for example, roads, bridges, computers,
technology, camera equipment, voice recording apps, and this sort of
stuff. That's what I call hard, hard infrastructure. There's also
what I call soft infrastructure, infrastructure. This is the stuff
that's non material and non tangible. So what might this
be your speaking ability, for example, that's huge for me,
I've had to build up my speaking ability so that
I can communicate the insights that I want to communicate,
because one of my biggest bottlenecks was my speaking ability.
I've had to work on that for years. creative ability
is another soft infrastructure thing. creative ability, you might think,
like, well, creative ability, how do you build that up?
And it's tricky, because the soft infrastructure is the hardest
to build up. Because it's intangible. When something is intangible,
your mind has a difficult time working with it. So
it's hard to figure out how do I build up
my speaking ability, but there are tangible ways like you
can go to toastmasters or something and speak more, or
shoot more videos or whatever. How do you build up
your creative abilities? Oh, man, I've been building up my
creative abilities recently, a lot using some powerful techniques that
I'm actually going to be creating a course on. So
I can't go into depth on that here. But rest
assured that you can certainly build up something as intangible
as your creative ability, by orders of magnitude, it's quite
amazing. And for me, that's huge. Because what I do
is very creative. And creativity is one of my highest
values. So for me the ability to build up my
creative infrastructure, the mental tools that I have for how
I visualize how I think about the world, how I
put insights together, how I'm able to channel information from
higher from higher wisdom, this is super important to me.
And it's taken me a while to figure out how
to do that. And that's an infrastructure, that's an ability
that I have, once I build that up, I can't
really lose it. And then I become a much more
powerful speaker, I become much more powerful in my life
purpose, and so forth. How about humor, humor can be
an infrastructure that you build up your ability to be
humorous, and that's actually something that I'm gonna be working
on in the future is how do I present my
material. So it's not just interesting, fascinating, but also humorous,
too. That's something that would require a lot of work.
And rest assured that you certainly can build up infrastructure
for humor. Other soft, intangible infrastructure might be the right
relationships. A lot of people are really hindered by the
relationships that they have their relationships really weighed them down
and prevent you from living your values and following your
purpose. So what are the right relationships you need that
will enable you rather than holding you back? Also various
kinds of technical skills, maybe you need some computer skills,
maybe you need some language skills, maybe you need some
business skills, some marketing skills, this is all rather intangible
stuff. But once you do have the skills, you are
able to follow through on your values and your life
purpose in ways that would otherwise be impossible. So you
know, one of the ways that people struggle with their
life purpose as they find their life purpose, or they
have some big dream or goal that they want to
accomplish in their life, but then they lack the technical
skills. Do it. And so they get really down on
themselves because they think like, well, but this dream I
have, it's so lofty, it's just impossible. No, it's not
impossible. The only reason that it feels impossible to you
is because you lack the technical skills. And you lack
the strategic long term planning skills of being able to
sit down and say, okay, so I don't know how
to get to my dream yet. But if I develop
some marketing skills, and some business skills, and some language
skills, and some computer skills, and whatever skills I need,
I can use those to stair step my way up
to my dreams, and then I'll be able to realize
them. And that's always the case was an ambitious dream
was an ambitious dream, you're not going to know how
to fulfill it. But what you can ask yourself is
you can ask yourself, Okay, what would I need to
develop? What infrastructure would I need to build? In order
to do that? If I want to become let's say,
a comedian, and I have no idea how to become
a comedian, I can always ask myself, what infrastructure do
I need to become an amazing comedian. And then I
can go about building that. The most powerful internet infrastructure
is non material. So while material infrastructure is good, for
example, having those cupholders with my pens, having the post
it notes lying around my house, that's material infrastructure, that's
good stuff. But it's not as powerful. For example, as
the creative infrastructure that I'm building, in my mind, in
my mind, that's even more powerful. See. And the non
material is the most difficult to work with, which is
why I'm I'm working on resources for you, I'm working
on a course that will help you to really work
with the non material aspects of personal development. Because that's
where people struggle with the most, that's also where you
can get the highest leverage. And you can get extraordinary
orders of magnitude, more efficiency, and more results and more
power, if you get the right non material infrastructure into
place. So I'm working on that that will maybe come
out within the next six or 12 months, I'm not
sure yet. The point of infrastructure is to free you
from a lot of the busy work that you do
in your life. I don't know if you've noticed this,
but a lot of people, most people, they're super wasteful
with how they spend their time. Their time is spent
in an unfocused way. Not focusing on doing their core
values, they're not living out their core values for most
of the time in their week, most of the time,
and their week is spent on doing busy work, busy
work that really has very low yield, and low fulfillment
level. And so they have all this chronic resistance, they
keep doing the same ineffective procedures over and over and
over again, for example, if they have a buggy computer,
they're going to live with that buggy computer for the
next five years. And that's just going to make their
process harder, right? If you're a writer, and you're using
your computer, make your computer fucking efficient, super, super efficient.
So it's not a bottleneck, it's not a source of
resistance for you getting your ideas on, onto the computer.
See, and if that requires you learning some technical computer
skills, good. If that requires you spending $2,000 To get
a better computer that's going to be faster and more
efficient and free of bugs and lag and all that,
then that's a worthwhile investment. To build the infrastructure requires
an investment of time, energy and money. And this is
one of the ways in which material resources can be
effective and necessary for personal development. Sure, you could develop
yourself completely without any money. But having some money, which
you can invest strategically into yourself to build the right
infrastructure. And that's one of my favorite aspects of personal
development is when I can find something someplace where I
can just invest some money, buy a computer, buy some
books, buy a voice recorder, buy an app by buy
some, some coaching, whatever, because this is so easy, right?
This is the most effective way that I can use
my money is to reinvest it in myself. So anytime
I can find an opportunity like that I do. But
don't get don't get trapped into this idea that the
only way you can grow is by having money or
by investing in yourself. Actually, the most powerful ways to
grow are completely free, completely free. And there's limits to
how much money you can invest in yourself in an
effective way. So what I want you to do is
I want you to ask yourself, Where is my time,
not optimal? Throughout my week, wherever Am I working against
my values? Where am I lacking alignment with my purpose?
And what kind of physical infrastructure could I build to
correct that, to help mitigate that? Just imagine that if
you are building your infrastructure, and you're doing it on
a weekly basis, week after week after week, month, after
month after month, year, after year after year, imagine how
powerful you will be when you have the hard infrastructure
in place and the soft infrastructure in place. And all
of it is making living your values easy, and effortless
and automatic. And all of it is serving your purpose.
And that whole thing is snowballing decade after decade after
decade, imagine how powerful you will be how fulfilling it
will be to live that kind of life. See, one
of the problems that victims face is that they shirk
responsibility. They don't take the responsibility for building the infrastructure,
and they avoid it. And so what they do is
they just go party or they ignore it, or they
watch TV, rather than learning. Rather than building their infrastructure,
they're out there wasting their time, because they think it
can't be done. They just don't want to take responsibility
for this stuff. See, because they sort of expect that
the infrastructure should already be there for them. As if
you should be born and already have all the infrastructure
you need, not at all, you need to construct the
infrastructure you need. And you need to tailor your infrastructure
to what your objective is in life. Nobody knows what
your objective is. Probably you don't even know yet. But
once you find out your objective, well, then the job
begins of laying the foundation. Taking responsibility means that you
say, I'm not going to wait for anybody else out
there. To build the infrastructure that I need to create
some stairway to my dreams. Spiritual folks fail in this
regard, because they forget about the practical elements of reality,
they get so spiritual and airy fairy about it, that
they just say, Well, I'm just gonna, you know, I'm
just gonna, like, sit there and meditate and everything will
be attracted to me through some mystical law of attraction.
I don't need to actually build any infrastructure. It'll all
just happen. If it's God's will, then it's God's will.
Well, you know what, God helps those who help themselves.
God will help those who build their own infrastructure. And
don't just sit on their ass expecting God to build
the infrastructure for them. God's not going to build you
a fucking highway to your dreams. That's your job. Dreamers,
people who are chronic dreamers who dream up stuff and
have a bunch of visions, but aren't able to actually
show tangible results and success in life. Those people who
like to talk a lot, but don't have much to
show for it. Why is that? Well, because they suck
at building the infrastructure. In many cases, it's just as
simple. You need to develop the ability to dream big.
But then also, at the same time, get to work
on building the infrastructure that will make those dreams possible.
And that requires a careful balance, you have to balance
idealism with pragmatism. Also, I want to point out to
you that there is a danger in getting too hung
up on building the infrastructure. So like everything I talked
about a few episodes ago, about balance, with everything that
I talked about, you need to find the right balance.
Because if you build your infrastructure too much, you get
hung up on that, here's what's going to happen is
that you're actually going to lose sight of your dreams,
you can become so pragmatic, you lose sight of your
dreams. And you just start working on your business working
on your business, for example, and you spend the next
10 years doing that, and you just spend all that
time chasing material success with your infrastructure, trying to kind
of like build the perfect nest. But that's not really
what you're about the point of building the right nest
in the right environment is that so that you can
really sink your teeth into pursuing your values and your
purpose. If you spend too much time building infrastructure, and
I fall into this trap, what will happen is you'll
disconnect from being you'll spend all your time doing and
creating, thinking that that will somehow ultimately lead you to
happiness, but it won't. Because the only thing that can
lead you to happiness is being really connected to the
being level of life. So you're going to have to
balance building infrastructure and doing a lot of stuff which
distracts you from being but also there's danger that if
all you do is you spend all your time being
Then you're just going to become like the stereotypical hippie
who spends all his time being in free love, but
then doesn't have a house to come back home to
can't pay his mortgage, and can't hold down a job
can't arrive on time to a meeting, because he's so
airy fairy lost in being that he doesn't even recognize
concepts like time. See, so you got to be able
to do both, you got to be able to find
that balance. And in the past, I've, I've tended to
side actually towards the doing versus the being. And so
I get very frustrated, where I spent a lot of
time working on my business, working on my business, building
all these infrastructures. But at the end of the day,
it was just hollow, I felt unfulfilled because I would
build all this stuff, and it would be great. But
I'm disconnected from being. So you got to find that
balance. How do you connect yourself with being well, that's
a deeper talk topic that I will cover elsewhere. And
I have covered it elsewhere, but basically meditation and so
forth, techniques like that will get you more connected to
be. Another danger with building too much infrastructure getting caught
in that cycle, is that you start to identify with
the infrastructure that you build. And I've definitely fallen into
this trap as well. Like, for example, you're building your
business, building your business, and then after five years of
building up this great business, that it's successful, now all
the sudden you identify with it. And you think that
you are your business, and that your business is your
source of happiness. And if it stops earning you the
money it was earning, then now you're not happy anymore.
If there's a problem with your business, you feel like
you're being damaged personally, because now the business has become
an extension of you. Or you might feel like well,
if you're not able to fulfill on some kind of
infrastructure goal, that somehow that damages your ability to be
happy. It's like, well, I wanted to build this thing
here. But I wasn't able to, like let's say I
wanted to build a house. But because of financial problems,
I wasn't able to build the house that I wanted,
the House would have been a good piece of infrastructure
to help me to live out my values, okay, but
I couldn't do that. So now I can't live out
my values. Now I feel bad about it. Well, you
don't want to fall into that trap. Right? Think of
the infrastructure as a bonus, it's a tool that helps.
But if you're not able to have some kind of
tool, you can still do it the old fashioned way.
You don't need any kind of material stuff to really
develop and grow yourself. But it is helpful. And if
you can find some low hanging fruit, that will make
your journey easier, why not take advantage of it? what
this requires is rolling up your sleeves and getting to
work. Which is why most people don't build the right
infrastructure. Infrastructure takes time to build, you need to do
it consistently through the entirety of your life. This is
not something you do for a week or a month
and you stop, you take on an attitude of I'm
building infrastructure from now until I'm dead. I'm building infrastructure.
And that's how you get this massive snowball effect. When
you see really successful, really efficient and productive people, business
people maybe that you admire, how do they get that
way? They've spent a lot of time building their infrastructure.
That's how they weren't born that way. So how do
you do it? Well, you just make a list of
the infrastructure that you need. And then you go out
and do the work. And be careful, stay vigilant that
you don't get lost in the process of building infrastructure.
People err on both ends here, it's tough to find
a balance, they either build too much or too little.
Finding the balance is the really tricky part, which is
why I have a worksheet for you. Click down below
there's going to be a link, download the worksheet do
the worksheet to figure out what kind of infrastructure you
need to build and other subtle facets. And I have
questions here that will address certain subtle facets of this
process of figuring out which infrastructure you need to build
and how not to get trapped in it. All right,
that's it. I'm done here signing off, please click the

actualized. Org right here. This is my website. My blog
is there. I'm posting new insights that I can't share
through the videos on the blog. So check that out
weekly. I'm updating it pretty regularly. Check out the actualized.
Org forum. You can chat with people there, ask questions,
figure stuff out. They also share a lot of cool
resources that are always cropping up on the forum. I
answer questions on the forum. So it's a pretty cool
place to to take care of your self actualization needs
without getting too lonely. You know, one of the biggest
problems I hear about people who are doing spiritual development
and personal development is that it's a lonely process. It
can feel like you're the only one nobody understands you.
Your family doesn't understand you. Your spouse doesn't understand you
and so forth. So, where do you find like minded
people? Well, the forum is good for that. So check
all that out. And I'll see you next week with
more
