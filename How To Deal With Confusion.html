hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to talk about how to deal with confusion
so you're on this path of self-actualization and as you're
on this path you're learning a lot of stuff and
you're changing your life around and you're exploring different domains
of life and basically what you're encountering over and over
again is this problem of confusion and it can manifest
in many different ways for example I see people talking
about these sorts of things all the time when they
give me feedback it's like leo I'm confused should I
be pursuing my life purpose which you always talk about
or enlightenment or leo I'm confused should I go to
college get my degree or should I start my business
instead or like leo I'm confused should I be breaking
up with my girlfriend after some of the stuff you
told me in one of your episodes or it's like
leo I'm confused what is awareness you keep talking about
awareness and consciousness but what is this I don't understand
what this is or it's like Leo I'm confused what
is God sometimes you keep alluding to God as though
there's something to experience there but I don't know what
this is you keep talking about it but it makes
no sense or maybe Leo I'm confused you sometimes talk
about me not having free will if I don't have
free will then how can I self actualize and what's
the point of all this content that you're releasing it's
like Leo I'm confused you talk about meditation but which
meditation habit or method should I use because there's a
lot of meditation methods which one is the right one
you talked about the do-nothing technique and the mindfulness technique
and some other technique which one should I use it's
all very confusing to me or maybe Leo I'm confused
in this episode over here you said X and then
I read this other book over here which said why
and then I was listening to some other teacher over
there he said Zee how do i reconcile all that
stuff I'm confused and my response to all that is
good good you have now discovered the bulk of our
work here of course you're confused of course because you
don't understand understanding is something that needs to be created
you see the default position when you're born is ignorant
which means no understanding you start off with life with
zero understanding and then you build it up that's a
process and self-actualization yes you're putting a lot of habits
into place in your life yes you're working on your
relationships and maybe you're earning some money and you're doing
some of this kind of stuff and you're working both
externally and internally but first and foremost what you're doing
is you're developing understanding because you can't do outer work
or inner work until you first of all have at
least a sense of direction and understanding about what it
is you're doing and why you're doing it you see
um which is basically what all my content is about
is about teaching you the understanding you need so that
then you can properly guide yourself coach yourself to the
kind of high consciousness life that you want see it
all begins with understanding but you can't take that for
granted understanding is a challenge it's a challenge and the
bulk of our work here together is reconciling a bunch
of stuff I throw um new concepts at you new
techniques new ideas stuff that um is in conflict with
what you're already doing with what you know to be
true with what you've experienced in the past with what
you believe what your parents believe what your culture is
telling you all this sort of stuff and it's not
just me anybody who's trying to help you raise your
consciousness will be doing something similar so um yeah that's
what's happening you this is a learning process right but
see what most people do is that as soon as
they get started with the learning process they're starting to
increase their understanding but then they encounter what they encounter
confusion uncertainty uncertainty leads to confusion and that feeling of
uncertainty or confusion then leads most people astray to fall
back down and to quit the learning process and to
really not give the learning process their all because they're
afraid of confusion they run away from it you see
so what your job is first and foremost if you
want to really create an amazing life is to get
comfortable with navigating confusion this is something you gotta accept
as your primary labor in life is reconciling stuff and
sometimes it takes a while to reconcile something and reconciliation
this can be an emotionally laborious process it can also
be a lengthy process really I encourage you to reframe
it as a lifelong process this is something you're doing
from the moment you're born to the moment your debt
you're going to be dead right throughout all that time
you're going to be doing a bunch of reconciliation and
in the meantime get comfortable with confusion so let's get
a little better handle on what confusion is and why
it happens basically your mind loves certainty and order that's
like the thing that it's after when you have a
mind which is certain about everything then that's a mind
that can be at peace you can just kind of
like relax let go chill and enjoy yourself and that's
what your mind is always kind of striving towards except
this can become dysfunctional like anything that you cling to
so what happens for most people is that confusion arises
and what that is is anytime that the mind is
basically uncertain about something or is trying to reconcile two
opposing two or more opposing intellectual forces right and most
people are not able to emotionally tolerate uncertainty and what
that leads to is that leads to a sort of
knee-jerk impulse which seeks to immediately resolve the uncertainty and
to move from a state of uncertainty to a state
of certainty because it seems like well when I'm uncertain
I'm not really comfortable I feel kind of agitated I
don't feel at ease right because your mind has been
sort of programmed by school and by culture for decades
now to always have all the answers and for everything
to be crystal clear I mean that's an illusion of
clarity don't get me wrong clarity is a good thing
but the trick here is that there's real clarity and
then there's this sort of illusory sense of clarity the
problem is is that when you have this knee-jerk reaction
to resolve every single piece of uncertainty immediately what that
leads to is a sort of mechanical behavior mechanical behaviors
are the opposite of conscious behaviors it's a reaction and
this reaction actually makes you rigid because basically what your
mind does it says I'm not comfortable with this uncertainty
I'm confused let me force a fit let me take
this square peg and just Ram it into this round
hole and get it to fit by force and as
soon as it starts to fit that's it I can
say look I'm certain now I'm comfortable and now I
can be back at ease but this leads to a
false sense of clarity and it really holds you back
in or personal growth one hallmark of self-actualized individuals is
that they are unfazed by uncertainty mystery and paradox and
a lot of ordinary people are very easily fazed by
uncertainty mystery and paradox I have a whole episode called
the paradoxes of personal development encourage you to go rewatch
that one if you haven't already because it dovetails really
nicely with what I'm talking about here so um what
do we do about this well we need to develop
emotional tolerance within you for confusion and this is a
very counterintuitive move especially if you pride yourself as being
an intellectual sort of person the way that I do
and you see intellectualism as like a strength of yours
it can be very difficult to let go of this
need to know the one takeaway if you take away
anything from this episode should be this here's the key
insight for today is rather than running away from confusion
learn to embrace it train yourself to identify and embrace
confusion how do you do that here's a simple five-step
process alright so step number one is just awareness notice
that you actually are confused when you are confused and
this is not as simple as it sounds I mean
it's simple but it can be a little tricky because
it requires awareness and a lot of people don't have
this awareness so you need to develop it how do
you do that well by starting to feel into your
body any kind of mindfulness meditation practice is good but
you got to really feel for that confusion your body
and find it where is it is it in your
head is it in your chest is it maybe in
your arms in your hands how does it manifest so
start to notice that become very familiar with that feeling
so that then we can move on to step number
two step number two is labeling the confusion you feel
it like you might feel it in your head right
and then you say oh that's confusion and then you
label it you say okay that right there is confusion
I'm confused right now that's step number two now that
might seem very simple and obvious but you'd be surprised
that when you are confused I would bet that 90%
of the time when you're confused you're actually recognized that
you're confused instead what you do is you just mechanically
act to minimize the confusion and that right there is
what we're trying to avoid that's the counter to it
move then we go on to step number three which
is basically facing it and the way you can do
this is with the following question ask yourself what's really
going on here so I'm feeling confusion I have identified
and labeled it as confusion what is it really why
am I feeling this way and the answer you'll probably
come up with if you're self-honest is something like well
what this means is is that I don't really know
I haven't resolved this yet so what might that mean
let's bring in some examples so maybe you're trying to
decide for example um if you should get married or
not and you're confused about that should I get married
or maybe not and here what you're doing in step
3 is you're just asking yourself okay what's going on
oh I'm confused why because I don't know if I
should or shouldn't get married I'm not certain about it
and that's something that usually we don't like to admit
to ourselves even though it's clear that we are confused
when we are right but we just don't take that
extra step of admitting it and that's more important than
it might initially seem or maybe you're trying to decide
like should I go back to school or should I
just go start a business without any education without without
my degree what should I do and you're confused about
that and normally what you want is you want a
resolution like well I should decide right now I should
have an answer and you're not honest with yourself about
the actual situation and the actual situation is that you're
confused which means that you don't really know it's a
mystery hasn't been resolved yet you don't understand okay so
that's step three then you go on to step four
which is allowing it and the way you can do
that is with the following question just ask yourself can
I allow myself to be confused and you can answer
yes or no to that question the idea is not
to force a yes answer but simply to make you
aware of the fact that you're maybe resisting the confusion
and maybe to open up the possibility that you could
stop resisting it and then go on to step number
five which is to actually enter a state of not-knowing
and the way you can do that is by asking
fall in question can I let go of my need-to-know
this is the key right here this is kind of
like the crux of the psychological heavy lifting that we're
doing with this topic of confusion is we're basically surrendering
our need to know which we have been conditioned with
for decades by our culture and by all the habits
that we learn from school and so forth right we're
always told that we need the answers we need to
be certainly to be decisive and so forth but that
often ends up being in genuine when in fact you
don't know something when you haven't reconciled it yet so
let's just apply this process the five-step process here for
a bracing confusion now let's apply it for example if
you're doing enlightenment work let's say you're sitting there on
your couch and you're trying to get your head around
this enlightenment thing right and you've been working on it
now for weeks and maybe for months and you're sitting
at your I understand what is this enlightenment and maybe
you're asking yourself the question what am i or Who
am I and so you're kind of doing this process
of self inquiry maybe you're sort of deconstructing the ego
it sounds like what am i what am I don't
know what I am and so you're kind of like
looking everywhere and your awareness for what you are and
you keep slipping and slipping and slipping and it's just
like nothing is clicking and you're getting frustrated now and
confused by this process now normally what would happen if
you're doing this is that you would be unconscious to
the confusion and you would tend to just kind of
discount it and ignore it I mean in the back
of mine you you know you're confused but consciously you
don't really acknowledge it so here what I'm proposing is
rather than just pushing through it and just saying aw
screw that let me just keep pushing and pushing and
pushing and pushing if you apply this process of embracing
confusion then you would stop for a second you'd say
wait a minute what's happening here on the metal level
what's happening oh I'm experiencing confusion why oh it's because
I don't really know what I am I don't know
what enlightenment really it's okay can I allow myself to
just be confused without needing a resolution right now to
it oh yeah okay that sort of frees me up
and then you can ask yourself can I let go
of my knee - no and then that frees you
up even more and what I would suggest is that
that is a better strategy for doing enlightenment work than
the other way where you're just kind of like Ram
your way through and to get the answer because enlightenment
is this sort of counterintuitive thing where the more you
push for the answer a lot of times you don't
get it that's the thing that actually gets in your
way so that's just one example with enlightenment now this
topic of confusion doesn't just pertain to these advanced spiritual
pursuits it also pertains like I already alluded to two
very practical things in your life like which direction to
take your business in what kind of diet you should
eat you know if you're confused about that or you
know should you go back to school or should you
start a business or should you go with this life
purpose here or that life purpose there right so these
are very practical choices you face and usually what happens
is that you're confused by them but then this this
actually paralyzes you now let me stop here and address
a couple of objection that I'm anticipating so one objection
might be okay leo so I understand this but basically
you're telling me to accept confusion and won't that make
me stupid or ignorant cuz I pride myself on having
an accurate model of reality truth is a high value
for me and I am rather intellectual so I don't
want to just resign myself to not knowing stuff because
then I'm just going to be ignorant like everybody else
um know what I'm suggesting here will not lead to
that at all what leads to ignorance is actually what
you're currently doing it's ignoring the fact that you don't
know stuff it's having a false sense of certainty that's
what really ignorant is ignorance cannot survive if you are
in this open state of not knowing this is a
very rare thing ignorant people can't do this you see
ignorant people think they know everything so it's just the
opposite of what you might think this is why this
is such a counterintuitive move like I said actually what
will happen if you embrace confusion you will become more
robust and grounded intellectually and this will push you into
the best position possible for a revelation now this is
critical to understand we like to think that especially for
very intellectual people we like to tell ourselves that you
know we push and push and push and we get
the answers it's like I come up with the answers
I come up with the knowledge and understanding but that's
not really true all the deepest insights and knowledge comes
through Revelation not from your pushing for it not from
having this neurotic need to know curiosity don't get me
wrong curiosity is a great thing if you have curiosity
and you're intellectually curious about a lot of stuff that's
great but that's different from pushing and pushing and pushing
and needing to know in a clingy sort of way
what you really want if you want to grow if
you want to put yourself in a position where you
are honest about the stuff you don't know you acknowledge
all the uncertainty and mystery of life and you let
reconciliation happen organically okay that means for example if you
have a life purpose and you're trying to decide between
life purpose a and life purpose B and you're not
sure which one to go with you might try to
ram that through and try to force it right that
would be like you try to get an answer from
your ego as far as what your life purpose ought
to be a or B a better position is to
actually acknowledge that you don't know and open yourself up
and let the reconciliation happen organically let it unfold and
then what will happen is that you will get a
more authentic and deeper answer you might say from your
higher self or from the divine source or from nothing
I mean there's different different labels we could use from
where the answers come from that's not so important right
the best answers don't come from you hopefully you're starting
to notice that like if you're a creative person the
most creative ideas they don't come from your ego they
come from something beyond you okay so when you open
yourself up to revelation this means a couple of things
first of all this means you're going to require more
patience because it's going to take longer you're not necessarily
going to get an answer immediately might take months might
take years and you have to be patient there and
also what this means is that you're going to have
to have a high tolerance for uncertainty and confusion because
that confusion doesn't quite feel comfortable you feel a bit
uneasy so imagine being uneasy for a couple of years
about life purpose a or life purpose B but still
moving forward you see still moving forward not being paralyzed
by the confusion the way that people normally would sometimes
people would just write me an email or post a
message on the forum or something saying Leo should I
go with a or B and what that tells me
is that they're committing this mistake of not being open
to the relevant revelation because they want me to make
the choice for them which would be a mistake but
the upside of doing this even though it takes longer
and requires more patience from you requires more emotional maturity
from you but what will happen is that the insights
that you do get will come from nature rather than
ego and the insights that come from nature are much
more profound and truer than those that come from your
eco a lot of insights that come from the ego
are these shallow low consciousness self-serving insights which tend to
make you chase after things that really won't fulfill you
in life so you get that right now another objection
someone might have here listening to all this is well
Leo isn't it better for me to be adamant and
to demand the answer because if I push for the
answer I'll just get the answer and won't that be
better than just being kind of open and uncertain about
everything um it seems that way it seems that way
but that's not true that's an illusion right that's your
neurosis talking because see you really haven't resolved yet and
surrendered to mystery to uncertainty to your need to know
you got to drop your need to know because I'm
telling you that the answers that your ego comes up
with when you're forcing that fit and you're being very
adamant are usually low quality answers there's high quality answers
out there and so what you gotta become aware of
is that this constant need to get the right answer
and to not tolerate the confusion that that's actually a
mechanism that's become unconscious and it's backfiring and it's holding
you back how is it holding you back there's a
a myriad of ways so firstly it's making you emotionally
ungrounded you actually become reactive you're off your centre you're
not solid and stable when you need to know it's
kind of like you have a thirst or an itch
that can't be quenched or scratched also I've talked in
the past about your web of beliefs so one of
the ways that this backfires is that because you don't
embrace confusion you get sucked in deeper and deeper into
your own beliefs and your weber beliefs solidifies and it
becomes very rigid which then makes you defensive fearful clingy
and ideological have you seen ideological people on TV or
maybe some of your friends are it's not a pretty
picture to see a couple of ideological people bickering with
each other right these are two people who have very
solid webs of beliefs and all they want to do
is just kind of fight and clash with each other
because really they're intellectually stunted because they're not willing to
deal with uncertainty and with confusion right they're afraid of
it and you can tell that they're afraid of it
you can see it in their tone of voice in
how they breathe how they hold their body the things
they say the way they rationalize their position and so
forth you don't want to be one of those people
right so that's one huge drawback here another drawback is
that the mystery of reality is artificially suppressed when you're
not able to embrace confusion and reality is a very
mysterious thing you know we have this bad habit nowadays
in the 21st century of thinking that all science has
mastered reality and everything is known and you know all
the textbooks are basically correct and physics has figured everything
out that's not true at all that's a false sense
of certainty if we were more honest and more tolerant
of confusion then we would admit a lot more of
reality's mysterious then we normally claim and that would leave
us open to exploring new possibilities exploring new states of
consciousness researching new things that otherwise we would never research
that's very important also another drawback here is that you
become too logical when you always need answers and you
don't really create room for your intuition to function and
your intuition I have a whole episode I recently shot
about intuition go check that one out which talks about
how intuition is much more powerful and really a necessary
tool if you want to develop a high quality life
intuition is much more powerful a tool than your logical
reasoning mind another problem is that by not embracing confusion
is that you closed yourself off to the most profound
insights that are possible in life the deepest insights need
you to tolerate a lot of confusion for a very
long period of time and many people are not willing
to do that and so they don't get the most
profound insights also you're not really able to explore topics
deeply if you can't tolerate confusion um this is what
I call research a lot of what I do these
days is just research I research topics very wide and
very deep so all research stuff from you know enlightenment
to business to dating advice to psychology to emotions to
happiness to psychedelics to weird meditative technologies other sorts of
stuff paranormal stuff like I'll research so much stuff and
the only way I can do that is because I
have a pretty high tolerance for uncertainty and for confusion
I'm Reese Engle researching all this stuff and I'm confused
by it all because you know we're talking about putting
together a really large jigsaw puzzle with a lot of
pieces um and a lot of them I'm not really
sure how to fit each piece together to get the
big you know ultimate bird's-eye view of the whole thing
that can take years to do that and that's what's
happening with you if you're watching all my content or
if you're a self-help junkie and you're reading a lot
of self-help material that's what's happening with yous you've got
all these sort of little like little pockets of information
from this field from that field you're not quite sure
how it fits together and it's all in your mind
it's kind of confusing and you're not sure like well
how do I take action on all this stuff it's
just overwhelming me and I don't even know what to
do I'm just like watching videos and nothing is changing
in my life and then what that does is that
confuses you and then you're paralyzed by it you basically
quit or you stop or yourself with this this stuff
doesn't work right and that means you're not really following
through and doing really high quality research the way you're
supposed to the way I want you to you're also
not able to push past difficult decisions sometimes like I
said already with life purpose example you might have a
decision of like life purpose a or life purpose B
and you can't decide and so then you say oh
well this whole life purpose stuff doesn't really work and
you quit whereas what you would really need to do
is if you were comfortable and you embrace confusion is
you say you know what I don't know if it's
a or B but I'm still going to move forward
somehow I'm just going to push forward past this and
trust that eventually some reconciliation will happen and I'm okay
if that takes a few years for that to happen
I'm still moving forward see people who can't tolerate confusion
quit very easily they also get stuck very easily right
it may get stuck on some choice for a long
time and then not take the action it's necessary and
another big drawback here is that you're not going to
be able to do quality meditation or enlightenment work if
you can't tolerate confusion or uncertainty that's one of the
biggest things that holds people back from successfully doing alignment
work in fact I'll give you an example of how
this panned out for me recently I was at a
meditation retreat this year earlier this year and there I
was meditating for over a week straight doing a lot
of meditation reviewing pretty good and towards the end of
that retreat I was consulting with the Zen master who
was leading the retreat and somehow the topic came on
to this issue of my need to know like one
of the things he suggests to me is like you
know what just let go of your need to know
and I told him no I don't want to because
that's like my greatest strength is this need to know
I'm this intellectual person this is one of my greatest
strengths this is what I'm contributing to the world as
part of my life purpose and he said a very
important thing that really kind of um well it inspired
me to to shoot this topic because such an important
point he said no you gotta let go of your
need to know and I said yeah yeah yeah I
know I know that I'm supposed to let go of
my need to know and he said no no listen
to me this will really [ __ ] you up
in your life that's what he said those were exactly
this will [ __ ] you up in your life
if you don't listen to me right now and so
when he said that I'm like oh okay let me
pay this a little more attention he said this will
[ __ ] you up in your life if you
keep insisting on the need-to-know and so that got me
to reevaluate cuz when is then Master you know when
is then master tells you something like that then you
really start to reevaluate your your thinking on something like
this and so I start to real value and I
realize like oh yeah you know I've been sitting here
for almost a whole week meditating and doing self inquiry
and working towards enlightenment um and I was really kind
of like trying to get the answer right I really
wanted to know I was being neurotic about it and
really the right move is an emotionally difficult thing to
do in the situation was not to push for the
answer but actually to surrender and to let go of
my need to know to admit to myself that you
know what I'm just confused right now I'm confused about
what I am about Who I am I'm confused which
means I don't know which means I'm uncertain and to
actually accept that to embrace that and to surrender myself
to the possibility that I might never know and that
was difficult for me to do very difficult for me
to do because I've I've sort of pride myself I've
plotted myself my entire life especially through college and through
high school you know it was easy for me to
get the right answer all the time and so I
pride myself in being able to do that but with
something as nuanced and as as you know tricky as
enlightenment work um that doesn't work so well and so
there I just had to recognize that oh yeah I'm
running away from confusion I'm not really facing it I
keep looking for little tricks and techniques for how I
can avoid being confused I keep trying to ask the
master for the answers and I notice a lot of
people doing that who watch my cond is like Leo
just give me the answer what's the right answer and
in a sense I'm doing a disservice to you because
I feel like I spoon feed you a lot I
give you a lot of the answers but one thing
you notice about for example um really experienced Zen masters
or non-duality teachers or mystics is that they a lot
of times they just don't want to give you the
answer they're very Adam about not giving you the answer
and they actually try to force you to be confused
the whole Zen tradition of : practice where they give
you this little riddle they have to sit there for
for maybe a couple of years working on this one
little riddle like what's the hand of what's the sound
of one hand clapping that sort of thing right that's
all come on so they'll give that to you and
you're sitting there and you're confused by and you wonder
like why confuse myself with the stupid riddle fer for
years well because they want you to surrender to it
and to get comfortable with it right that's why they
don't spoon feed you ready-made answers so I felt that
that's something that's important for me to communicate to you
because I know how since I do spoon feed a
lot of answers that it's very easy for you to
fall into that trap right and as soon as you
don't have the answer your you get stuck and you
get lost right so now you know what to do
just embrace it surrender to it and take it on
that's your work here this is the bulk of the
work I want you to open yourself up to this
process of learning and discovery this is a lifelong process
you're not just doing this until the point where you
get enlightened then you can say oh yeah that's it
I'm done the learning process the discovery process is over
no it's never over there's always more stuff to learn
you can never rest on your laurels that's the bottom
line so open yourself to the up to the confusion
become aware of that confusion and actually I want you
to to do this try to do this this week
I want you to find at least one or two
examples in the moment of where you're confused and you're
trying to run away from it and then instead to
do the counterintuitive thing and to face it maybe for
the first time in your life all right that's it

try to release more content that helps you to self
actualize and to increase your consciousness and there's a lot
of powerful stuff that I want to share with you
in the future like I said I doing a lot
of research these days in fields that I didn't even
know existed just a year or two ago and some
of the stuff that I'm discovering techniques and methods and
technologies that are just incredibly powerful and effective I've already
got a pretty good handle on the whole self-actualization field
