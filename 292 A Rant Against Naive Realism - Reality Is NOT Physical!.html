            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/_APVC8AGt8g' target='_blank'>A Rant Against Naive Realism - Reality Is NOT Physical!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Naive Realism and Materialism</b>: The video host, Leo, discusses naive realism, materialism, and physicalism, all synonyms indicating a basic worldview. This worldview, deeply ingrained in human belief systems, generally perceives reality as a three-dimensional space filled with objects adhering to mechanistic laws.
</li><li><b>Fluctuating Reality Perceptions</b>: Different organisms have varying perceptions of reality based on their sensory apparatus. For instance, a rattlesnake's view of a room would differ significantly from a human's. 
</li><li><b>Phenomenal Field as Evidence of Reality</b>: The only evidence individuals have of reality is the 'phenomenal field,' essentially subjective experiences. However, there's a deep-seated presumption of an 'objective' reality, or 'stuff' existing 'behind the scenes.'
</li><li><b>Issue of Infinite Regress</b>: Attempting to explain the origins of the universe and the 'stuff behind the scenes' leads to an infinite regress problem, with no satisfactory answers. Leo uses the ancient cosmic turtle myth to illustrate this concept.
</li><li><b>Assumptions and Illusions</b>: Perspectives rooted in naive realism create the illusion of a hidden reality and bring forward the mind-body problem. These preconceived notions lack scientific proof, and it is essential to question them. Understanding that the 'stuff behind the scenes' is nothingness can be difficult for the human mind, which prefers more comforting explanations.
</li><li><b>Physical Reality Questioning Importance</b>: For personal and spiritual growth, Leo emphasizes the importance of questioning the assumption of physical reality and the 'three-dimensional linear reality' within the human brain. This brain renders sensations, leading to the creation of the physical world, time, space, matter, and energy.
</li><li><b>Phenomenal Field as Reality</b>: The phenomenal field, formed of physical perceptions and sensations, is reality itself. Accepting this can require a deep level of surrender, and may be more of an emotional process than a rational one. Acknowledging that science has never proven an external world's existence is an important part of this process.
</li><li><b>Challenge the Physical Reality Paradigm</b>: Leo advises adopting opposing beliefs to question the prevailing view of a physical reality. He warns against just accepting this new ideology without scrutinizing one's own beliefs first. He emphasizes that his discussions serve to share insights and not promote an ideology.
</li><li><b>Future Video Discussions</b>: Leo states that future videos will mix topics including enlightenment, and advises viewers to engage in the necessary self-inquiry rather than relying on him for guidance. He encourages acceptance of different stages in the enlightenment process and promises more content in the future.
</li><li><b>Problem of Infinite Regress</b>: Leo Gura describes the problem of infinite regress in trying to explain the origin of the universe. The idea of the universe resting on a cosmic turtle, the scientific explanation of the Big Bang, and the concept of God all share this issue, as explaining their origin leads to an endless search for explanation. Leo points out that the issue arises out of the assumption of something being "behind the scenes".
</li><li><b>Problem with Modern Science</b>: Gura criticizes modern science for maintaining the same philosophical foundation as the cosmic turtle analogy, despite its advancements in technology and practical applications. He asserts that, metaphysically, science struggles to fully explain the origins of the universe, falling into the same trap as the cosmic turtle and the concept of God.
</li><li><b>Unpalatable Truth of Appearance</b>: Leo suggests that the fundamental flaw lies in our belief in a world beyond the appearance, or an origin behind existence. This assumption is difficult to let go of because the mind struggles to digest the reality that appearance has no origin outside of itself.
</li><li><b>Reality as Mystical</b>: Gura challenges the mechanistic worldview that assumes a cause for every effect. He emphasizes that the only mechanism behind existence is being itself, which has no foundation under it. In a twist on Arthur C. Clarke's famous quote, Leo suggests that reality itself is indistinguishable from magic and inherently mystical, a concept that both atheists and religious people struggle with.   
</li><li><b>Atheism and Physicalism</b>: Gura scrutinizes the typical atheist's perspective, which predominantly leans towards naive realism, physicalism, and mechanistic explanations. He proposes that atheists avoid acknowledging the inherent mysticism of existence and instead resort to mechanical explanations, which are useful for manipulation of reality but do not enlighten on what reality essentially is.
</li><li><b>Non-Physical and Mystical Nature of Reality</b>: According to Leo, it is possible to have a direct empirical understanding or consciousness of reality. This realization, which tends to provoke an overwhelming sense of awe, reveals the non-physical and mystical nature of reality, described as akin to magic. He stresses that this realization is different from both the typical religious person's belief in God and the atheist's dismissal of such a concept. Both atheists and religious people deny or have not experienced the direct consciousness of the "mystical reality," which he argues is the most profound understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Reevaluation of reality</b>: Leo from Actualized.org encourages his audience to challenge their assumptions and beliefs about the nature of reality, advocating for the dismantling of ideas impeding the perception of its mystical nature.
</li><li><b>Challenging Na√Øve Realism</b>: The traditional belief in physical reality, a.k.a naive realism, is critiqued. Leo mentions how quantum science over the last century has questioned the physicalist view of reality.
</li><li><b>Debunking physicalist concepts with quantum mechanics</b>: He elaborates on the insights quantum mechanics has brought to modern physics. Concepts like particles, matter, and even energy have been replaced with the idea of fields that are nonphysical, infinite conceptual constructs.
</li><li><b>Mainstream acceptance of quantum mechanics</b>: Leo discusses that while quantum mechanics has significantly shifted our understanding of reality at a scientific level, this shift has yet to permeate mainstream thought due to the stronghold naive realism has on the majority perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Role of personal development & spiritual practices</b>: He suggests that an understanding of the non-physical nature of reality can be attained through personal development tools like psychedelics, meditation, and self-inquiry. These practices enable one to experience the 'OH MY GOD' moment - the realization of a mystical reality beyond ordinary, mainstream phenomena.
</li><li><b>The impact on personal and spiritual growth</b>: Leo argues that this shift in perspective from physical to non-physical reality changes one's life, influences values, attitudes towards life, death, and meaning, and opens up new avenues of study and understanding.
</li><li><b>Undermining the physical paradigm</b>: Leo discusses the importance of undermining the stubborn belief in physical reality, stating it as a crucial step in advanced personal development and consciousness work. Leo asserts that space, time, matter, and energy are creations of the mind, and convincing oneself of their unreal nature can radically transform one's perspective and life.
</li><li><b>Reality as a phenomenal field</b>: He emphasizes that reality is the phenomenal field itself. There is a need to accept this rather than seeking what lies behind or created this field, surrendering to the truth that reality is what it is.
</li><li><b>Transformational Acceptance</b>: Accepting the nonphysical nature of reality is presented as a deeply transformative, not a trivial process since it implies an acceptance that everything previously known about reality is wrong.
</li><li><b>Emotional acceptance of reality</b>: Emotional acceptance of reality is more significant than the rational or intellectual perception. The belief that reality consists of objects, boundaries or physical elements is illusory and unscientific. The scientific field has yet to provide proof of an external physical world. 
</li><li><b>Scientific view of reality</b>: While science is important for understanding different aspects of reality, it can often lead to misinterpretations, creating a metaphysical foundation for reality that diverges from the actual nature of existence. It's crucial to bear in mind that science primarily focuses on the practical aspects and often dismisses metaphysics. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the paradigm of physical reality</b>: One way to challenge the paradigm of a physical reality is by questioning its validity and adopting beliefs that contradict it. This approach can aid in disrupting ingrained viewpoints and promoting a freer understanding of reality. It is advised not to blindly accept these contradicting beliefs but to investigate one's own ideas about reality and question them thoroughly.
</li><li><b>Reality as a phenomenal field</b>: The ultimate aim is to see the phenomenal field as it is, without any preconceptions or interpretations. This understanding can open the mind, resulting in a transformative experience. 
</li><li><b>Communication and ideology</b>: Assertions made should not be mistaken for ideology, they are insights, shared with the intention to assist others in unlocking higher levels of consciousness. It is important to avoid adopting these insights as a new ideology, as this may hinder the process of personal growth and understanding.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-inquiry</b>: Self-inquiry is emphasized as the key to achieving enlightenment. The allure of enlightenment shouldn't distract from the broader scope of self-mastery and self-actualization. Individuals should strive to focus on their personal growth and mastering their consciousness.
</li><li><b>Content delivery</b>: The teachings are not shared with the intention to propagate an ideology but to guide individuals towards a deeper understanding of reality and self. Communication is imperfect and should not be taken literally. Rather, listeners are encouraged to read between the lines and understand the underlying message. 
</li><li><b>Future topics and discussions</b>: Going forward, a mix of topics will be discussed, including enlightenment. It is important for those already familiar with the concept of enlightenment to focus on the self-inquiry process rather than solely on the teachings provided. All listeners are encouraged to continue their journey towards self-mastery, as everyone is at different stages in this process. More content will be shared in the future to assist those in this journey.
