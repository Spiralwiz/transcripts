hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about emotional intelligence alright so
emotional intelligence why is it important well first before we
even get into that let's say emotional intelligence is also
defined as EQ kind of like you have IQ which
is your intelligence quotients well here you also have EQ
which is your emotional quotient so I'll be saying interchangeably
emotional intelligence sometimes other times I'll be saying e Q
to be compared to IQ alright so why is EQ
important well what they've actually discovered after doing lots of
research in the last really thirty years they've had so
much research about what creates performance and success in business
and in careers and what they really found is that
people who are successful the number one factor is not
IQ it's not intelligence the number one factor is EQ
it's emotional intelligence it's your ability to work with emotions
that is what's critical they've done so many studies in
colleges and universities and in corporations across the country in
the world that really document this and demonstrate this you
think we would kind of commonly think that well if
somebody is smart if they have a high IQ then
that person can get a lot of stuff done and
sometimes we even say that well he's so smart he's
got he's got like a really sharp mind he's able
to get stuff done that's not actually very true people
that are extremely smart technically speaking on the IQ scale
if they have a very high IQ actually they tend
to not produce that much they tend to be not
that successful when your IQ gets like above 150 it
does actually be counterproductive because you're so much in your
head all the time and you lose touch with the
emotions and the emotions are what really create success in
life because life is about relationships life is about being
able to be in relationship with others and it's also
understanding yourself and being able to control and manage your
own emotions so if you can do that if you
can develop strong emotional intelligence then you are going to
be successful and your relationships are going to be more
successful you're going to be happier there you're just going
to be happier alone by yourself naturally you're going to
have better control you're going to be able to do
things you're going to be able to execute on the
things you want to execute on because you're gonna have
the discipline in the wheel power and you're not going
to have those super high highs and those super slow
lows in life you're going to have a more even
keeled trajectory through life and that tends to be what
produces success and high performance so that's ultimately why you
should be interested in EQ now EQ we should clarify
what it is and what it's not let's start by
what it's not a lot of people will assume that
EQ talks about sociability and what emotional intelligence means is
that you're extroverted and that you're confident and that you're
a people person and you're very gregarious right we know
those types of people that's the cliche extrovert well that's
not what emotional intelligence is about emotional intelligence in fact
is something that dovetails very nicely with introverts so for
example I'm a very strong introvert but I also have
a high emotional intelligence and this is something that actually
measured through tests so I got I got tested for
this and you know you can take assessments online and
in both other places so the two are not opposed
at all and the two are not synonymous being sociable
and being emotionally intelligent is not necessarily synonymous so what
is emotional intelligence said let's really define it let's break
into it so here's the definition that I got from
a book called emotional intelligence 2.0 which I highly recommend
you check out because they've got a very in-depth explanation
with lots of examples and then they give you assessment
so you can actually assess yourself and get scores which
is which is nice so it's not subjective it becomes
very tangible so definition of emotional intelligence is and I'm
reading this off the ability to recognize and understand your
emotions in yourself and in others and your ability to
use this awareness to manage your behavior and your relationships
so that is e Q in a nutshell now there's
really four pillars I'm calling them four pillars of emotional
intelligence and they were part of that definition if you
notice pillar number one is your ability to understand your
own emotions being able to label your emotions and just
recognizing what you have and having a broader range of
emotions so having more awareness there that's pillar number one
pillar number two is your ability to control your emotions
because it's one thing to just know your emotions what
you're feeling label it it's a totally another matter to
be able to manage it to be able to discipline
yourself control yourself so you're not having those those crashes
and you're not having those ecstatic Peaks but you're somewhere
in the middle and you're even keeled that's controlling your
emotions pillar number two P low number three is your
ability to read emotions and other people you might call
this empathy it's your ability to understand what other people
are experiencing and feeling being able to relate to that
using your mirror neurons you're relating to that and you're
understanding their point of view it's really the ability to
step into somebody else's shoes and look at life or
a situation from their perspective that's pillar number three and
pillar number four is your ability to then manage your
relationships so how smooth are your relationships going for you
how well are you communicating and interacting within them that
is also determined by your EQ so EQ consists of
all these four pillars and actually in that book emotional
intelligence 2.0 I took tests and I got tested I
got I got a score for each one of those
pillars so you might be stronger and you probably are
definitely stronger in some of these four than you are
in others so maybe for example you are really good
at controlling your emotions but you're not so good about
managing your social relationships or maybe your you're really good
at identifying your emotions but then you can't really control
them and so you know you're experiencing you can label
it you're self-aware you're very conscious but then you're just
struggling to actually then practically manage that and channel it
into your work or the habits that you're trying to
instill in your life like you're working on your diet
or your gym so you know you can have different
levels and of course the idea is that the higher
you are in each one of these the better because
you want all of them maxed out ideally the more
intelligent intelligence you have the better you're going to do
in life the happier you're going to be so you
want them to be maximally at 100 each one at
100 all right so those are the four pillars I'm
sure you have a deeper understanding of what EQ is
let's also talk about how this actually relates to some
of the stuff that happens in our life because it
might still be a little bit abstract at this point
it might be a little bit unclear as to how
EQ can really help you and how it impacts you
already because it's already impacting what's happening in your life
in fact if you're having struggle in relationships whether you're
intimate relationship or relationships at work with your boss with
coworkers with employees then that's a really big sign that
you have trouble in at least one of these four
pillars if not all of them so let's talk about
that so here's a list of the things that EQ
is controlling or is tied to these are some of
the effects of EQ firstly is anger management are you
able to manage your anger well if you are then
you have high EQ if you're not then you have
low EQ probably because well you're failing on those first
two pillars you're not very conscious about it about your
feelings and secondly you're not able to control them very
well so that's an example right there next is accountability
how much accountability are you able to take on yourself
rather than blaming other people that's connected to EQ how
about honesty and trust that one is connected tq2 how
honest are you with yourself but then also how honest
are you able to be in social situations without having
to be pressured into into line or telling white lies
or being distrustful of people so honesty and trust are
big and those are really tied to EQ you've also
got assertiveness and confidence these are big if you're lacking
in assertiveness and you're lacking in confidence then you're also
lacking in emotional intelligence communication how good of a communicator
are you can you communicate in your intimate relationship how
about communicating at work if you're not able to communicate
effectively that shows a lack of emotional intelligence how about
stress tolerance are you always stressed are you frantic are
you anxious thinking negative thoughts always judging yourself feeling guilty
well that is a sign that you don't have very
strong emotional intelligence you're faltering on one of those four
pillars how about decision making how strong are you of
a decision-maker do you find yourself waffling all the time
making a decision then going back and going forward and
going back and going forward or not being able to
decide between two things for a long time procrastinating this
is a sign of low emotional intelligence how about flexibility
how flexible are you do you flow with life are
you able to handle the challenge in the situation that
are coming up with life or are you very rigid
and set in your ways and everything is bumping into
you and causing all sorts of pain and suffering that's
a sign of low EQ how about presentation skills probably
more related to work how well you able to give
a presentation to speak to convince people to motivate people
to inspire people especially if your manager this is very
very applicable and good managers must have high EQ to
be able to influence their employees in a you know
effective way also the next point is listening skills how
about listening skills how good of a listener are you
are you able to really listen to what people are
telling you are able to understand it to really empathize
with it and are you able to then show them
reflect back to them that you did understand do people
think that you're a good listener or do people think
that you're a poreless well if you're a poor listener
then that's tied to low EQ so that is the
list and I'm sure there's more these are just some
of the most obvious ways in which EQ connects to
your life in all these different areas but of course
it relates to your intimate relationships very much it also
relates to how you're doing at work how you're talking
to clients all of that it also relates very much
to how peaceful and happy you feel just inside by
yourself because if you're always frantic and you're always sad
or depressed we're having any of these kinds of negative
emotions you're angry all the time you're guilty this shows
a lack of emotional intelligence because you're not recognizing them
in yourself first and foremost but then you also don't
have tools and strategies for how to manage them and
then you're you're expressing them and then it's also impacting
your relationships out in the real world so it affects
you and it affects the world so that's you can
you can see how powerful this idea is and how
many aspects of your life it affects it literally the
tentacles from EQ literally spread into almost every single aspect
of your life this is why this idea is so
so so important so now we know what EQ is
we really defined it I think you have a good
strong sense of how it relates to your life with
all these examples the question now is how do you
go about developing it or even can you develop it
what can you do about this what if you happen
to be low in one of these areas what if
you don't really have a strong sense of your emotions
what if you don't have good control what if you
can empathize what if you are a bad communicator or
bad in relationships how do you manage that well the
good news is that more so than IQ EQ is
highly developable that means you can develop it you can
work on it it takes time it doesn't happen overnight
it's not a week-long process it will take you months
to do this but you can work in pinpointed ways
on those exact deficiencies that you have in each one
of these four pillars you can do things to retrain
your mind to think in new ways to make new
distinctions to understand new thing and to put new communication
skills into place so that these things are brought up
to to the maximum and that's work that you can
do I actually do a lot of that work through
coaching a lot of the videos that I share with
you guys although I don't explicitly say that this is
about EQ or emotional intelligence ultimately this is what actualize
that org is about we're helping you understand emotions we'll
help you understand your psychology and psychology is very emotion
Laden and then we're helping you understand how to master
them through all these different techniques so for example something
like meditation or something like journaling could be a technique
that you can use to reduce your stress or to
build more understanding of your emotions something like coaching is
something you can use to understand your emotions better reading
books and understand about this stuff can help you understand
your emotions better then going out there actually practicing some
of this stuff so there's a lot of different like
practical techniques that you can use and you should use
to actually go out and work on each one of
these pillars I don't really have time to go into
them it's such a deep topic there's literally hundreds of
them so I can't cover them all I'm going to
have other videos that cover how to work probably on
each one of these pillars and share more of these
techniques with you but this video the purpose was just
to show you that this is out there get you
to start to understand that emotional intelligence is important and
then hopefully give you a sense of this is something
that you should care about and you should probably have
a sense right now whether you are lacking in one
of these four pillars or in all of them do
you think you have low EQ or high EQ well
now you probably now have a better sense although you
can go out there to actually get it tested objectively
through some of these surveys that they have in books
and online which I highly encourage you to do but
ultimately now you've got a sense of this and now
get a little bit more body in to this idea
that emotions are important self-control is important it's all connected
to your success in life alright this is Leo I
