hey this is Leo for actualised org and then this
quick self-help segment I'm going to give you some practical
resume writing tips alright writing a resume it's actually a
really simple and easy process once you get the mindsets
correct and that's exactly what I'm doing here I'm going
to give you some practical ways of thinking about writing
your resume they're really gonna make it a breeze you're
not going to need to go take something expensive course
or spend a lot of time on it writing a
resume this is the whole secret you ready for the
secret it's all about understanding what the employer wants it's
about understanding who you're appealing to and what their needs
are here's what you gotta understand and you really understand
this when you become an employer yourself which is what
I did I was first starting off my career and
I was an employee like you are right now and
I was I was really scared about writing a solid
resume I was scared about what do I put in
there what do I leave out how do I make
it appealing how do I fluff it up so I
can compete with everyone else and so I was coming
at it as an employee and then later in life
I started my own business and then I got the
opportunity to hire people and I hired a few people
and I was coming at it from the opposite side
and it was like looking through you know through the
looking-glass and seeing that as an employer the process looks
totally different and here's how it looks for the employer
because once you understand how it looks for the employer
and you can empathize with that and put yourself in
that frame of mind then writing your resume is a
breeze and you are I would say in the top
3 percent of all your competitors because all your competitors
don't understand this especially if they're applying for jobs that
are kind of entry-level jobs I would say a job
that has one to two years one to five years
of experience if they've got more than 5 years of
experience they probably understand this because they've applied to many
jobs but between one and five years which is where
you're just learning how to write resumes you're going to
knock them all out of the water so here's how
you want to think as an employer an employer has
specific requirements that means that if I'm run company I
need somebody to handle a problem for me and as
an employer I'm doing math because I'm business oriented and
if my business has been in business for more than
a year then it stayed that way because it's profitable
or at least because somebody was looking out for the
bottom line and the way that that happens is someone
is sitting there saying okay I've got this position in
fact it's not even a position it's like I've got
this opportunity in the marketplace to make some money and
I need someone to do this thing for me or
to handle this part of the business or to do
the marketing or to do the sales or to do
the coding or whatever whatever is that you do and
I need someone to handle that and I need someone
that's really good really reliable really talented and also affordable
and I need this fast I need it right now
because I've identified that I have this opportunity or I
have this challenge I need help with so I need
someone to fill that position fast and I need that
person to be honest and straightforward so I can analyze
their skills and of course I want them to be
very competent in what they're doing and I want them
to be specialized I don't want a generalist well in
most cases with very rare exceptions what I want is
someone who can come in there and fix a specific
problem so for example if I'm developing a website right
and I myself am self-employed and I'm creating a website
and I know a little bit of H of HTML
and a little bit of CSS and I know basic
web design so I'm creating my site but then I
run into a problem I need to create a shopping
cart and I need to integrate that shopping cart with
my with the rest of my site that I built
to to sell my products but I do not know
all the complex programming language that is necessary to implement
a shopping cart I want familiar with shopping carts it
would take me way too many hours to learn how
to implement a shopping cart I'd rather outsource that so
that creates what an employment opportunity that's an employment opportunity
means that I can hire someone and someone can become
my employee for awhile for forever depending on how long
I need that work to handle this problem for me
and this is a specific problem now think about it
I'm going to go out there now and play along
with me I want you to put put yourself in
my shoes as the employer so you're the employer now
think about this you're going out there you're looking for
someone to create a shopping cart for you how are
you going to find that person what are you going
to look for first of all you're going to have
a very specific list of criteria that you have you're
going to say that you need this type of shopping
cart you want it to accept Visa and MasterCard and
you want it to do it in such and such
a way and maybe a couple of these features you
need to save save the users history and password and
username you want them to track orders you want a
shopping cart and you want it to sell these types
of products and you want these products in all these
different categories so you have all these specific requirements and
then of course you want someone to do that for
you at the lowest possible price you don't want to
hire a programmer who's going to charge you a hundred
thousand dollars to implement a simple shopping cart you want
to get that at the most affordable price because you're
looking out for your bottom line the reason I'm creating
this business and you're creating this website because you want
to sell a product if you're selling that product and
that product is you know your profit margin are on
each product that you sell is let's say ten dollars
on each product that you sell you earn ten dollars
but then you're going to pay fifty thousand dollars implement
a shopping cart how many products you have to sell
to pay that off it's going to be a bad
bargain so you're going to want to find someone who
might do that shopping cart for maybe a thousand dollars
then it makes sense because you only need to sell
what 100 products times ten to pay off a thousand
so that's a good that's a good deal so understand
is it an employer they're looking at the the value
but they're also looking at the skill right so on
the one hand I want a shopping cart programmer here
who's going to be fairly affordable on the other hand
I want him to be as talented as he can
be for that price so what does that mean that
means I wanted to be skilled in all the different
languages that I need for this cart and I want
him to be reliable and I want him to probably
know not just one language but two or three languages
I want to have experience actually doing what what I
need because if he doesn't have the experience that I
specifically need then how can I trust that he's gonna
be able to do it it's going to be too
risky for me right think about this your hire a
shopping cart programmer but what if you hire a generalist
programmer instead would you be happy with that so what
if I came to you as a programmer and I
said okay look I'm going to make your shopping cart
and you say okay how many shopping carts have you
made before and I said well look I have never
made a shopping cart before but what I have done
is I've worked I've worked on some databases and I've
worked on some other websites and I programmed in Visual
Basic and I programmed in my high school class and
I programmed in college but I've never done a shopping
cart are you going to want that guy probably not
not if somebody else comes to you and says hey
I've done 100 shopping carts I know them back to
front I can do it for you in a week
easy not a problem right you're going to hire that
guy so so these are some of the mindsets now
what I want you to do is to take that
mindset and flip it around and use it on you
so whatever position you're applying for think about it this
way what is the employer really want how can I
give it to them without a bunch of garbage so
when you're actually writing your resume and this is where
the tips part comes in is the mindset actually meets
the paper in this way when you're writing a resume
be very clear about what you're offering specifically get rid
of all the fancy mission statements get rid of all
the fancy jargony words trying to fluff yourself up employers
see through that really really fast in fact if you
ever become an employer and you look at piles of
resumes you get on your desk you can see people
that are trying to fluff themselves up it's just like
it's so so so apparent and they're trying to make
themselves out to be more than they are the best
resume is a simple bulleted list of exactly what you
do what you specialize in what you're going to provide
for this employer what your skill sets are how much
experience you have in them and of course some of
your personal characteristics that will create success so that means
you know are you on time are you good working
with other people are you friendly are you sociable are
you diligent and hardworking are you reliable so definitely mention
those qualities because every employer basically needs that in their
employees otherwise the employee is not going to work out
in the long run so have those qualities mentioned but
generally focus on the skills that you provide right what
can you do I can implement a shopping cart I
can create a website I can write some web copy
I can I can do some marketing I can I
can do some set sales over the phone you know
whatever your skills are list them and then list them
specifically I know HTML I know C++ I know this
coding language I know this thing I know how to
check grammar and then of course back that up with
experience so list what your experiences are to back up
your skills so for example if you've done several years
of work with HTML say that if you've created 10
websites say that if you have examples of the kind
of work that you created that's the best that's basically
a portfolio and if you have a good portfolio you're
done you're sold you don't need anything else in fact
if you have a strong portfolio I would lead with
the portfolio because once someone sees your amazing work that's
it they're sold they don't need anything else the rest
is words a resume should not be wordy it should
be very sparse it should be like a like a
skeleton just an outline of exactly what you're providing to
the employer because the employer is very selfish and they
don't have time to read through your garbage in your
flowery language and your your philosophy they don't care about
any of that all they care about is what are
you providing are you a good match for exactly what
they need and then of course they're going to be
the conversation about money and you want to figure that
out and I'll cover that in some other video about
negotiation for salary but that's basically it that's resume writing
tips for you right there I'm going to be signing
off here go ahead leave me some comments tell me
what you think about this I think you'll really find
this valuable if you just make that mental shift it's
a mental shift put yourself into your employer shoes that's
the whole secret to resume writing once you're in your
employer shoes you don't need to me to be telling
you specific tips you'll figure that all out yourself you'll
know what to do it's actually very very easy so
