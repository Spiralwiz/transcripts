            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/pGItuEai8vo' target='_blank'>The 9 Stages Of Ego Development - Part 3</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Suzanne Cook-Greuter's Contributions</b>: This detailed work was largely built upon Suzanne Cook-Greuter's research from her 90-page research paper on the stages of ego development. Leo Gura integrated her research into these videos, adding his interpretations and commentary relevant to the field of self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Process of Development</b>: Moving through the stages needs to be at a steady pace, not being rushed or delayed. Learning is a process and rushing into higher levels could lead to not fully understanding the stage one is in currently, impeding the sustainability of higher levels.
</li><li><b>Practical Application of the Model</b>: The ego development model could be used to discern the character of people in personal and professional contexts including business partners, friends, and intimate relationships. It creates an understanding of other people's levels of ego development, hence helping in encounters and relationships with them.
</li><li><b>Construct Aware/Ego Aware/Magician Stage</b>: This stage of ego development is experienced by about 1.5% of the US adult population. It signifies the post-conventional phase.
</li><li><b>Unitive Stage</b>: This post-post-conventional or transcendent stage of development is seen in approximately 0.5% of the US adult population. It is considered the most advanced stage directly experiencing 'Absolute truth'.
</li><li><b>Non-Literal Teachings</b>: Leo Gura imposes high-level advice and directions, promoting self-wisdom in individuals. He discourages literal understanding of his teachings, stressing the diversity in implementing these teachings based on personal situations and contexts.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org</b>: The Actualized.org platform offers resources like blogs, book lists, life purpose courses aimed at transforming people's lives. It facilitates discussions and Q/A on its forum, allowing exchanges between like-minded individuals. A nine-stage model to serve as a foundation for future content is available on the site.
</li><li><b>Aim of Teachings</b>: The ultimate aim of Leo's teachings is to guide individuals into post-conventional stages. To encourage introspection and deconstruction of widely accepted concepts, thus developing a deep connection to consciousness and the infinite intelligence. This connection assists individuals in transcending Leo's teachings and coming into a personal understanding.
</li><li><b>Understanding the stages of ego development</b>: This can help assess the ego development of people in one's life and develop appropriate strategies for interacting with them. It is sometimes necessary to distance oneself from individuals who are at a much lower stage of ego development.
</li><li><b>Usage of the developmental model</b>: This framework can assist in identifying the most relevant teachings at an individual's current developmental stage and, perhaps, one stage above. Trying to adopt teachings too far above one's stage can be less effective and lead to frustration.
</li><li><b>Teachings of Leo Gura</b>: Leo's teachings primarily focus on the advanced stages of ego development. While beneficial, these teachings may be beyond reach for those still wrestling with foundational stages like the 'conformist/expert achiever' stages. Leo emphasizes the importance of establishing a solid foundation at one's current stage before delving into more advanced teachings.
</li><li><b>Risks of rushing personal development</b>: Attempting to pursue enlightenment while struggling with basic survival and personal success can lead to stagnation and frustration. Leo recommends fully experiencing and exhausting the achiever stage, which deals with issues like financial independence and intimate relationships, before advancing to more profound phases.
</li><li><b>The Construct Aware, Ego Aware/ Magician stage</b>: This stage, undergone by only one-half percent of the U.S. adult population, is marked by the realization that reality is constructively intertwined with the mind. Individuals come to understand that their ideologies, beliefs, and perspectives on life have been shaped by their subconscious mind.
</li><li><b>Interplay between mind and reality</b>: Understanding this complex relationship challenges the belief in an objective external reality existing independently of our mind. Individuals come to realize that the reality they've taken for granted is actually constructed by their mind. They become preoccupied with existential paradoxes and begin to question their judgments.
</li><li><b>Shift in life priorities</b>: As individuals realize the constructed nature of reality, existential questions supersede material concerns. There is a growing uncertainty as previously-held truths are called into question. The way in which humans spin narratives to make sense of reality is also recognized.
</li><li><b>Understanding the role of language and conceptualization</b>: At this stage of ego development, individuals realize how much their reality is influenced by the mind's conceptualizations and the use of language. The mind projects its model of reality by relying on language and it's symbolic abstractions as tools, and these models are seen as human-centric, geocentric, and implicitly biased. Concepts like time, purpose, and even physical objects like beds, cats, etc., are understood to be constructions based on layers of symbolic abstraction.
</li><li><b>Awareness of ego influences and limitations</b>: There is an increased awareness of how the ego mind distorts reality, constructing narratives about reality for its survival. This understanding may make reality feel uncertain and intangible because if the constructing/deconstructing process stops, one is left unsure of what is real or certain. 
</li><li><b>Understanding of the map vs territory</b>: Individuals appreciate the difference between symbolic representations ("maps") and actual reality ("territory") more deeply. Emotional reactions and judgements about reality are questioned as possible mechanisms for the ego's benefit. Bias, as a result, is recognized in interpretations of both concrete and abstract concepts.
</li><li><b>Realization of the deep impact of language</b>: It's realized that language is a sophisticated technology that divides and categorizes the world in distinct ways, shaping perceptions of reality. Individuals become conscious of the pitfalls and the gift of language, recognizing its role in human communication, and emotion and how it can limit as well as enable cognition.
</li><li><b>Awareness of interconnectedness</b>: People begin to realize that concepts exist in relation to their opposites, such that "good" only makes sense in relation to "evil" and "self" only makes sense in relation to "other". This awareness extends to the individual's personal responsibility in creating these dualities through the use of language.
</li><li><b>Progression beyond human mind limitations</b>: Individuals start questioning what it means to be human and realize they can, indeed, go beyond the human mind. This includes questioning the taken-for-granted assumption of being human and the limitation it imposes. By doing so, they open up to explore new ways the mind can operate beyond the constraints of culture and language. 
</li><li><b>Acknowledgment of the deeper implications of human evolution</b>: Recognition of the potential to go beyond the concept of being human challenges prior dismissals of notions beyond human understanding as unscientific or nonsensical. Instead, the idea of going beyond the human mind is now seen as a possibility and even a step in human evolution.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Notion of a Permanent Objective External World</b>: At the construct aware stage, the conventional belief in a permanent objective external world begins to be questioned. The distinction between mind and body, self and reality, starts to break down, leading to the understanding of one's self as an integral part of reality, constantly evolving and changing, rather than a separate entity. 
</li><li><b>Flexible Notion of Self</b>: In this stage, clear and objective self-identification starts to be questioned. The construct aware stage develops a flexible, continuously deconstructing notion of self, seeing it as a constant amalgamation of ideas, beliefs, and concepts, not a static physical entity. This shifting concept of self results from a constant feedback process surrounding interactions with the external world.
</li><li><b>Increased Self Awareness</b>: While the construct aware stage is still largely dominated by ego, increased self-awareness allows for the recognition of ego-driven actions and narratives to be deconstructed more readily, leading to ownership of past errors or mistakes.
</li><li><b>Cross-Paradigmatic Thinking and Integration of Multiple Systems</b>: The construct aware individual is capable of integrating various worldviews, belief systems, religions, and paradigms without assigning judgment. This ability helps to draw connections between divergent systems, leading to a comprehensive and unified intellectual perspective.
</li><li><b>Responsibility for Meaning Making</b>: There is a realization of our human need for map-making and organizing experience into complex matrices at this stage. Individuals in this stage take responsibility for the meaning they assign to their experiences, acknowledging its subjective nature rather than attributing inherent meaning to external events. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing the Deceptive Nature of Ego</b>: There is an acute awareness of the deceptive quality of the ego in the construct aware stage. While prior stages may be oblivious to this deception, individuals reaching this stage become aware of their self-deception and work towards catching and correcting it. Even though they still fall into ego traps, their ability to recognize and modify their behavior distinguishes them from those at the lower stages.
</li><li><b>Reality and the Self</b>: The self is a construct arising from the constant engagement with thoughts about one's self and personal experiences. Here, reality and individual identity are not fixed, physical entities but mental constructs shaped by thought and perception. 
</li><li><b>Transcending the Self</b>: Possibilities for transcending this constructed self exist, but they are hard to realize and actualize due to attachments to self-perception and fears about self-annihilation. Self-questioning becomes a meta-process and a last-ditch effort by the ego to create comprehensive models of reality, a futile endeavor due to the infinite nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Human Understanding</b>: One becomes aware of and starts challenging the limits of human understanding, moving towards transcendence from symbolic and mental ways of knowing. The understanding that all meanings are self-invented for self-purposes arises.
</li><li><b>Attempts to Understand Reality via Human Mind</b>: At this stage of ego development, people may experience feelings of frustration and confusion as they grasp the absurdity of trying to understand reality through the symbolic and representational efforts of the human mind. Despite these struggles, the mind still clings to maps and abstract meanings, although the effectiveness of explanations starts to breakdown. 
</li><li><b>Critique of Science's Approach to Understanding Reality</b>: Science's approach to understanding reality is critiqued, with the realization that science keeps pushing the problem of ultimate explanation back, ignoring its inherent inability to fully explain reality, no matter how it evolves.
</li><li><b>Stage 9: Construct Aware</b>: A new understanding of reality comes with the realization of one's personal biases and egocentric perception. This entails a questioning of everything that was once taken for granted. They recognize ego as the lens through which reality is perceived and distorted. The understanding of thought's limitations, the duality, and partiality within each thought. This stage marks the struggle in search for the raw truth, beyond the layers of interpretation, conceptualization and self-bias. An acknowledgement of the ego's desire for transcendence, the struggle it involves to control the mind, and the paradoxical nature of the effort. They appreciate the significance of linguistic filters and the ability to shut off these filters that comes with meditation. A crucial insight at this stage is the understanding of the two sides of reality, life and death, beauty and ugliness. They become aware of the automatic judging habit and its contribution to unhappiness. They form a dynamic understanding of human nature and complexities of human interaction. This stage allows for deeper compassion in self and others. Lastly, the awareness of the essential limitations of rational thought and appreciation of the role of non-rational sources of insight. 
</li><li><b>Non-ordinary state of consciousness</b>: While people at this stage desire more of non ordinary states of consciousness and transcendental experiences, they can often be fleeting and temporary, primarily due to the ego's constant control efforts. The ego can also usurp these mystical experiences for its own glorification, sometimes leading to the development of a spiritual ego.  
</li><li><b>Role as Leaders</b>: People at the construct aware or magician stage often choose to work alone or build novel organizations to contribute to humanity. They often take on roles of catalysts and transformers within organizations, guiding humanity's developmental journey.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Construct Aware Stage</b>: At this stage of the ego development, individuals tend to become consultants, mentors, therapists, or coaches. They are comfortable with not knowing certain things and display humility about the limitations of their knowledge. These individuals do not feel the need to defend themselves or impress others and are open and vulnerable. They deal with existential aloneness and aim to create lasting meaning in their lives despite the limitations of human thought. These individuals perceive the construct of their thinking patterns and express themselves in a more complex, vivid, and authentic manner than those at previous stages. They highlight the importance of self-correction and use their self-deception as an opportunity for growth and learning.
</li><li><b>Comparing the Construct Aware stage with a Centaur</b>: The construct aware stage is sometimes referred to as 'vision logic' or 'centaur'. Borrowing Ken Wilbur's terms, individuals at this stage integrate their higher existential and spiritual desires with lower, primal needs such as hunger, sexual drive, and the need for money. The centaur represents this balance between the animalistic and higher aspects of oneself, finding harmony between basic human needs and higher ideals.
</li><li><b>View of Chaos at the Construct Aware Stage</b>: People at this stage perceive chaos as not merely negative but acknowledge it as a rhythmic element of reality. They learn to surf on the waves of chaos, thereby flowing with life. There is a realization of the infinite interconnectedness of all things, contributing to a profound and deep understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Transition to the Unitive Stage</b>: Individuals who reach the unitive stage are able to be present and witness life without trying to rationalize every experience. They attain a direct consciousness of absolute truth and are capable of apprehending it without being able to grasp it through rational thought processes. They are open to all experiences, viewing them as valuable without labeling them as 'good' or 'bad'. As such, they can observe life unfolding with compassion and equanimity.
</li><li><b>Low vs High Stages of Ego Development</b>: The lower ego stages can't comprehend the profundity of experiences capable at high stages, such as finding a simple object like a fork to be miraculous. At high stages, mundane things become profound spiritual experiences, and individuals feel one with the universe. However, the unitive stage transcends this by availing a cosmic perspective that organizes these individuals' worldview, with an underlying feeling of deep contentment and security.
</li><li><b>Self-fulfillment and completion in the unitive stage</b>: At the unitive stage, individuals do not feel a need for external elements like money, fame, a family, or even self-improvement to complete themselves. They believe that they are whole as they are, and they are part of the entire universe, experiencing a sense of deep acceptance and peace.
</li><li><b>Awareness of life's meaninglessness and paradox of passionate engagement</b>: Individuals at the unitive stage become cognizant of the meaningless nature of personal achievements, life purpose, and human endeavors in the grand scheme of things. Despite this realization, they opt for a conscious and passionate engagement with life, viewing it as a 'controlled folly'.
</li><li><b>Down-To-Earth nature and transcendence of complexity</b>: People at the unitive stage possess humility and grace, with a down-to-earth quality arising from transcending overwhelming complexities. Life becomes simpler, and individuals become non-judgmental and non-controlling, viewing all personal achievements as a tiny fraction of human evolution.
</li><li><b>Criticism from lower stages and charge of being 'too impractical'</b>: Individuals in the unitive stage may face criticism for being aloof and detached, focusing less on practical goals and human problems. This stage may be deemed too impractical and metaphysical by people focused on survival and materialistic goals. However, being overly practical is seen as a potential issue at this stage, leading to a soulless life.
</li><li><b>Value and dignity in all forms of life at the unitive stage</b>: At the unitive stage, individuals perceive value and dignity in all forms of life, irrespective of differences in development, age, or gender. People feel worthy and whole in their presence due to their non-judgmental and accepting approach, rendering this stage a powerful place from which to teach. 
</li><li><b>Caring for all forms of life</b>: A person at the unitive stage shows a compassionate and considerate approach to all types of life forms, including bugs, animals, and non-human entities, viewing all as equitable ways of life. The only difference in the way each entity is treated arises from personal egoic biases. 
</li><li><b>Teachings focussed on vertical development</b>: Individuals at the unitive stage aim to guide others not towards practical or materialistic success (lateral development) but towards understanding of the interconnected nature of all life forms and the ultimate meaninglessness of individual actions (vertical development). There is an emphasis on developing a more compassionate approach towards all life forms.
</li><li><b>Moving towards holistic, accepting, and loving interaction</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges his tendency towards authoritative and stringent ways of teaching and discusses his gradual shift towards imparting his wisdom in a way that is more compassionate, accepting, and understanding with his audience. He aspires to nurture this approach as he moves toward the unitive stage of ego development.
</li><li><b>Maturing into the unitive stage of ego development</b>: Leo notes that his transition into the unitive stage of ego development, characterized by a deep acceptance of self and a profound sense of completeness, is still ongoing. This transition is transforming the way he interacts, moving from a more condescending style to a more encompassing and benevolent manner.
</li><li><b>The pleasure derives from being aware</b>: At the unitive stage, increased consciousness brings greater satisfaction. Just sitting and being aware of awareness itself becomes a source of bliss, replacing conventional pursuits of pleasure. 
</li><li><b>Direct consciousness of God</b>: The unitive stage also ushers in a direct consciousness of God. The individual realizes that they are God, a creator of the universe, and connects directly with God for constant insights. This consciousness is not a belief but a profound realization of oneself as part of a universal mind, where everything encountered is consciousness.
</li><li><b>A holistic view of all life</b>: The unitive stage allows for a sense of deep affiliation with all manifestations of life, valuing goodness, truth, and beauty. Individuals have visionary experiences and perceive things holistically rather than through the filter of a personal ego or rational thought.
</li><li><b>The distinction between wisdom and specialized knowledge</b>: High IQ or specialized knowledge is differentiated from wisdom, consciousness, and love, which are viewed as more important at the unitive stage. While low levels of ego development or low wisdom can be associated with a high IQ, what's more beneficial is the ability to draw deep insights from the universal intelligence.
</li><li><b>Tapping into universal intelligence</b>: The ability to channel wisdom and profound insights directly from the universal intelligence is emphasized. Leo likens this to a high fidelity, or high-bandwidth, telepathic connection developed with God who is recognized as one's own self, leading to superhuman levels of wisdom and insight. He compares this to upgrading from dial-up to high-speed internet. 
</li><li><b>Valuing wisdom over IQ</b>: Leo criticizes society's preoccupation with IQ scores while underscoring the importance of wisdom. He suggests that assessments should be centered around wisdom over IQ and that specialized knowledge in certain fields does not equate to higher consciousness, wisdom, or capacity to love.
</li><li><b>Advanced Connection to Universal Intelligence</b>: People can develop a high-bandwidth connection to universal intelligence, allowing for a constant flow of wisdom and insight. This connection is not ego-driven, but rather, a humbling realization that one is part of the universe. Any wisdom or profound insights that emerge from this connection are seen as gifts from universal intelligence.
</li><li><b>Embracing All Ways of Being</b>: At the unitive stage, there's a deep empathy for the ignorance of others, stemming from an understanding of one's own past ignorance. There's a realization that all ways of being - whether it's a human, animal, or a life direction - are valid and a part of the universe. Ignorance itself is seen as inevitable and linked to a lack of perspective or understanding of differences.
</li><li><b>Releasing the Need for Control</b>: As the mind progresses towards ego transcendence, there's less need to control circumstances, people or oneself. This change can be likened to free-falling, with a mindful, non-evaluative attention to the present. There is an acceptance and experience of reality without the consistent need to manipulate, deny or avoid it.
</li><li><b>Gender Integration and Conflict Resolution</b>: People at the unitive stage achieve a profound integration of their masculine and feminine sides, addressing the gender war at an individual level. They become aware that all conflicts are, in essence, self-created which allows them to take responsibility for it and consequently, create peace.
</li><li><b>Valuing Direct Experience</b>: At this advanced stage of ego development, there is an emphasis on the importance of being in direct contact with experience, transcending the boundaries of language or theoretical understanding. This evolution helps in bridging different levels of contrasts, understanding that reality is a human construct and recognizing the oneness of self and other.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Human Behaviour</b>: At the advanced stages of development, there is comprehensive understanding of human behaviour, including all the suffering, conflict, violence, disagreements, and evil. All these behaviours stem from the unconscious ego mind and from selfishness.
</li><li><b>Realization of Ultimate Reality</b>: The ultimate reality is perceived as the self, which is identical and indistinguishable from others. This realization leads to oneness, transcending all other forms of existence. At this stage, realizations about life and existence are profound, including the notions that birth and death are imaginary, all fear is an illusion, and judgment is ignorance. 
</li><li><b>Mystical Experiences and Enlightenment</b>: At this advanced stage of ego development, enlightenment and awakenings occur more frequently, although they can also happen earlier. However, since at these advanced stages, the mind is more developed, awakenings are less likely to be entangled with the ego and are better understood and interpreted.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment's Effect</b>: This enlightenment leads to profound inner peace, true satisfaction, contentment, and equanimity. At this point, those in the unitive stage can juxtapose theoretical and philosophical with concrete and practical, the personal and the global, serious and humorous, mundane and sublime, physical, psychological and metaphysical, thereby bridging the traditional dichotomies of life.
</li><li><b>Selfless and Conscious Living</b>: People at the "unit of individual" stage understand that selfless, good, conscious living filled with love is the primary aim of life. Happiness at this stage is profound, where there is a sense of tranquility and equanimity.
</li><li><b>Absolute Love</b>: The concept of absolute love is realized at this stage. Reality itself is perceived as love, and there is a keen understanding of this concept for the first time in life. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Absolute Reality as Imaginary</b>: It is realised that all of reality, including physical, material, mundane, and sublime are all imaginary. Life itself is impersonal, and taking anything personally is considered an illusion.
</li><li><b>Continued Work and Introspection</b>: While the initial understanding of human evolution is clear, there's more work to be done to fully comprehend it all. People should use the 'nine stages model' as a roadmap and deliberately work on themselves. This process is lifelong and expected to take years and perhaps decades.
</li><li><b>Self-reliance for Growth</b>: Individuals are encouraged to find their unique ways to personal growth. They need to set a vision even without knowing how they will achieve it. They need to figure out their own solutions and take responsibility for their lives. Leo Gura's teachings guide them in the right path, but self-discovery and self-reliance are crucial elements of growth. 
</li><li><b>Enlightenment beyond the Unitive Stage</b>: Leo suggests there is more to explore beyond the unitive stage but advises individuals to attain this stage first, as it's already a significant achievement. Future exploration involves potentially transhuman and mystical territories, which may be hard to comprehend.
</li><li><b>Responsibility on Personal Growth</b>: Viewers should not rely on Leo or anyone else for solutions to their every obstacle in life as growth occurs by figuring things out independently. Using high-level pointers and advice offered, it is up to each person to take responsibility and work through the details of their own life.
</li><li><b>Harmonizing High-level Advice with Individual Applications</b>: It is important to bridge the gap between the provided high-level advice and its implementation specific to one's circumstances, desires, talents, and gifts. Leo stresses that he does not provide micro-specific advice, as part of each viewer's process is creatively figuring out how to apply general advice in line with their unique life situations.
</li><li><b>Existence of Stages Beyond the Unitive Stage</b>: There are stages beyond the unitive stage, but are not widely recognized due to limited data samples based on the average population. To comprehend these stages, an in-depth study of the most advanced humans is required, which includes individuals that are one in a million.
</li><li><b>Significance of Reaching the Unitive Stage</b>: Though stages exist beyond the unitive stage, reaching the unitive stage is already an enormous accomplishment, placing an individual at the top fraction of the global population. It implies advanced personal growth and understanding.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of Actualized.org</b>: Leo's website offers various resources that can assist in the personal transformation process such as a blog, book lists, a life purpose course and a forum for discussions. The website is designed to help viewers move into post-conventional stages of development.
</li><li><b>Aim of Leo's Teachings</b>: Leos teachings are focused on elevating individuals to post-conventional stages by jail-breaking the mind through introspection and the deconstruction of various concepts. His ultimate goal is to guide individuals to develop a profound connection with consciousness and infinite intelligence, which will eventually allow them to instruct themselves beyond his teachings.
</li><li><b>Teaching Limitation and the Power of Self-teaching</b>: Teaching is inherently limited as it relies on dualistic, linear, and logical methods. The ultimate goal is for individuals to teach themselves by attaining a deep connection to the universe, effectively learning directly from infinite intelligence. Psychedelics are presented as a powerful tool for facilitating this non-linear, infinitely intelligent, and trans-linguistic mode of learning.
