[Music] brains do not exist and if you're like most
people operating under the materialist paradigm this is the problem
because you believe that brains are real and for you
the notion of a brain is actually a secret metaphysical
postulate which makes it really difficult for you to do
some of the advanced work that we need to be
doing together consciousness work non-duality work and so on because
you're really stuck on this idea that there is such
a thing as a brain and that all of this
that you see around you that's happening around you all
of reality you think that's happening inside of the brain
if you're a materialist and this is a really big
problem because at least are a lot of confusion at
least or a lot of closed - when it comes
to listening to advanced teachings to try and wrap your
mind around how reality really works the deepest levels you
can't do it because this belief is operating under the
surface in the background without you being aware of it
and how do I know this because I was a
materialist for my entire life pretty much until recently and
I've had to work for a long long time to
extract this paradigm this framework of beliefs it's an entire
framework of beliefs from my own mind because really what
it is is it's a mind virus it's a virus
that was implanted into your mind you never seriously thought
about it until today and and you just saw the
whole world through that lens well what I want to
show you here is I want to show you an
alternative paradigm an alternative way to look at the world
so we are gonna talk about some really deep metaphysical
stuff here which I've covered in the past in certain
ways but there's gonna be a lot more nuance here
specifically designed to help you to overcome this idea that
you are brain or that everything that you experience is
happening with neurons in your brain this is a silly
and absurd notion I'm gonna take you through the logic
of why it's absurd why it doesn't hold water it
makes no sense whatsoever it contradicts itself and it limits
you in some very important ways so I've shot a
couple of episodes in the past one called a ramped
against naive realism and another one called understanding paradigms both
of those are gonna be critical to what we're gonna
be talking about here today naive realism otherwise known as
materialism otherwise known as physicalism otherwise known as the default
position that most scientifically minded rationally minded and atheistic lis
minded people take these days that's what I ranted against
in the 90 realism episode and paradigms are going to
be very important because a paradigm is this framework of
beliefs which prevents you from seeing alternatives outside of that
so we're gonna get into all that in a lot
of juicy detail so what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna roleplay I am going to basically be answering
objections throughout this entire episode that a materialist might pose
to me about this issue and this notion of there
not being brains because on the surface it sounds like
an absurd claim to make it's like Leo how can
you claim that there are no brains this is ridiculous
are you being serious are you just being cute are
you just being metaphorical like what are you talking about
how can you say there's no brains well no I'm
not being metaphorical I'm being very literal what I'm saying
is that everything you're experiencing and have ever experienced has
never took in place in a brain and we're gonna
dig really deeply into that but I'm going to bring
up a lot of objections here from the materialist paradigm
and I'm going to be answering all of those here
in a lot of detail so let's begin the way
we begin is with the following objection if a materialist
listens to stuff that I talk about for any length
of time then inevitably he will come up with the
following objection Leo isn't enlightenment in all this other spiritual
stuff that you talk about and all your psychedelic trips
aren't all those just first-person experiences and if that's true
then doesn't that mean that they're not objective and they're
not scientific after all we know that the brain is
capable of hallucinating all sorts of things we have clinical
evidence of very weird brain case studies where people Huson
ate stuff we have insane asylums filled with schizophrenic sand
psychotics and also people who hallucinate all sorts of crazy
stuff and they live in their own private universes so
doesn't that show us that we can't really trust first-person
experience which is why we need to rely on good
old-fashioned science because science goes for the hard objective facts
where as what you're talking about all your mystical experiences
and all your non-dual experiences and any experiences you might
think you've had about a god or about anything like
that that all of those are really just anecdotal evidence
so why would we rely on anecdotal evidence to develop
our worldview shouldn't we be very skeptical of anecdotal evidence
and so therefore in conclusion lay out all of spirituality
everything you talk about is just stuff that's happening inside
your brain so no matter what you think you're accomplishing
with your meditation or no matter what you think you're
accomplishing with psychedelics or what you think you're accomplishing with
contemplation all of that in the end is just happening
in the brain and when your brain gets destroyed that's
it that's the end of it you're dead and so
there you go and what you hallucinate there well who
really cares is that really gonna improve my life in
any way all these hallucinations that you talk about but
not so fast you see there's a really big problem
with this whole chain of materialist reasoning is that the
materialist hasn't really examined his or her own implicit metaphysics
that are being brought to the table see you're taking
for granted that there is such a thing as a
brain and you're taking for granted that there is such
a thing as a physical external reality you're taking a
lot of these things for granted in your worldview and
that's understandable because that's part of your culture and you
really can't help it but if you just probe the
logic of your metaphysics a little bit deeper you'll see
that it's just Payton Lee absurd so consider the possibility
that actually is no brain no brain but Leo that's
crazy after all we can take a skull we can
take a human cadaver we can cut open the skull
and we will see a brain inside do you deny
that we'll see a brain inside are you crazy here's
where you have to really be careful about your metaphysics
of course if we cut open a skull we will
see some pink squishy substance inside that we generally call
a brain but really think this through because what are
you seeing there you're having an experience of some pink
fleshy substance but does that mean that that's actually the
metaphysical brain that you believe in that's the important issue
that's not being addressed here we both agree that if
you cut open the skull you're gonna see some pink
squishy substance but your notion of a brain involves a
lot more than merely an appearance of a pink fleshy
substance the appearance is there the problem is that when
you speak of things such as brains and neurons and
atoms do you realize what you're speaking about you'd like
to speak about these things as though they're objective third-person
phenomena but really these things our first-person appearances and more
than that they're actually concepts concepts which ultimately boil down
to sensations that you're having either right now or that
you've had in the past and in fact any sensations
you've had in the past the only way that you
could access them now or know about them is because
you're reliving them right now in this moment so here's
what's really going on with the metaphysics we cut open
the skull the skull itself is an appearance a first-person
appearance you see we use let's say a knife to
cut open the skull that knife is also a first-person
appearance the skull is cut open we see a pink
fleshy substance inside that's also a first-person appearance now the
deeper question is where our first-person appearances occurring now notice
the problem you run into here you run run into
a problem of circularity because you can't say that the
pink squishy substance is occurring inside of a brain because
what you call a brain is the pink squishy substance
so when you're looking at a brain where is that
pink squishy substance that's an appearance first-person appearance where is
that occurring now of course the materialists will say in
my brain of course leo in my brain no you
don't understand the depth of this problem yet even if
we cut open your brain and give you a mirror
to look at your own brain you will see your
own pink fleshy substance but again where is that occurring
in another brain you see for the materialists the notion
of a brain is not merely the appearance of a
pink fleshy substance it's something that sits behind appearances it's
a metaphysical substrate that has never been actually experienced by
anyone has never been proven by science to exist but
it's assumed that is there it's assumed that our first-person
experiences are occurring in this organ or this thing this
physical object somewhere behind the scenes and that all our
appearances are coming from it are being generated by it
and occur inside of it but then the question is
what is this it of which you're talking about where
is it occurring you see you got to sort of
think this through notice that the only thing you have
of reality is first-person experiences there is nothing else literally
notice this this is not a speculation this is not
a philosophical argument this is just a brute fact of
your life please notice this all science is predicated upon
first-person experience because that's the only thing there is there
is nothing else but what science does because the mind
is a tricky Beast is science takes this domain of
first-person experiences and it creates a conceptual distinction within this
domain in it okay yeah we have the first-person subjective
experiences but then we also are going to create a
section within that which we're gonna call third-person objective and
what does that really mean let's think this through what
technically a scientist means when they speak of third-person objective
facts is they mean the following thing that if we
take a group of people a group of like-minded beings
and we are able to query them about some fact
like let's say we can ask them a question like
do you see that tree over there and we ask
10 people and all those 10 people say yes I
see a tree over there then what the scientists will
say is ok so then that we're gonna classify that
as a third person objective fact but notice what is
quickly forgotten in that process is that what's forgotten is
that this entire thing this entire process this entire scientific
method is occurring within first-person experience and it can never
be anything other than that so that tree that bird
all the 10 people that you queried plus yourself plus
the environment in which all this is occurring plus the
physical universe all of that is first-person experience that's all
there is and any notions of a third-person objective domain
has to be couched within the first-person subjective always and
so in a very real sense the third-person objective even
though we tend to think of it as having more
reality than the first-person subjective actually that's completely backwards because
the third-person is conceptual in nature and therefore actually it
has less reality than subjective experiences are you getting this
what the materialist doesn't understand is that everything objective is
actually subjective and that there is no such thing as
objective in fact the notion of an objective anything is
absurd it collapses it doesn't make sense it's a self-defeating
metaphysics what you can have is you can have subjective
things you cannot have objective things you can create the
illusion of objectivity by gathering a consensus which is what
science does it gathers a consensus now of course don't
take that as me saying that science is relative in
the sense that you can just make up whatever kind
of science you want no you can't because you need
to gather a legitimate consensus among people and there's only
certain kinds of things that people will consent to if
there's a tree out there and I point to and
someone sees it and I say do you see that
tree and they say they're not gonna say no I
mean they'd be lying if they said no so you're
not gonna be able to gather a consensus amongst a
bunch of people for example that the Sun doesn't exist
it's not possible to gather such consensus but nevertheless you
have to recognize what that gathering of consensus is that's
a that's a conceptual Enterprise and it's nevertheless occurring within
your subjective experience which leads us to the really big
point which is that there is ZERO empirical evidence for
an external world not only is there no brain but
there is no external world so the materialist not only
believes in a brain but also believes in a universe
an objective external universe which in within which the brain
is occurring and happening and we're at everything is basically
being generated from so what we've got is we've got
a bunch of first-person experiences and appearances and for the
materialist these appearances need to be explained by something so
his strategy for explaining it is not sighting God or
the Flying Spaghetti Monster but rather sighting an external world
even though there is no evidence for such a world
science has never demonstrated an external world and it never
will not even in theory because the idea is preposterous
because the only thing you can ever have our first-person
experiences so how can you prove an external world see
as a materialist you criticize my mystical experiences as just
being anecdotal evidence but what you're failing to grasp is
that everything is anecdotal evidence existence itself is anecdotal and
what that means is that the only reason you feel
and believe that you exist or anything at all exists
is by anecdote because you exist you believe you exist
if you didn't exist there would be no possibility of
talking about existence the physical universe is anecdotal as well
people don't grasp the significance of what's being said here
I'm not merely saying that you need to be born
in order to say that you exist I'm saying something
much deeper than that what I'm saying is is that
your critique that mystical experiences don't count because they're not
objective and because our anecdotal neglects to understand that you
are taking many things for granted about reality which are
anecdotal and the only reason you believe them and hold
them as solid is because they're anecdotal but you ignore
the fact very conveniently that they are anecdotal because you've
told yourself that actually no they're not anecdotal they're just
reality see what you've done is you've taken a concept
out of that concept you've fashioned an external reality where
there are brains and atoms and molecules and neurons and
all the sort of stuff and then you've conveniently told
yourself that none of that is a concept that is
actually reality and that is a trick you've played on
yourself because while you're engaged in that process you're not
being conscious of the fact that all of that is
occurring within first-person experiences so what I mean by the
existence being anecdotal is that unless you had a first-person
experience of life you would not be able to hold
as real existence life science rationality the universe skepticism none
of the things that you subscribe to as a materialist
would have any justification or grounding or evidence whatsoever unless
you had a first-person experience of yourself existing you see
everything absolutely everything hinges on that the existence of the
BIGBANG hinges on you existing that's what I'm saying you
don't depend on the Big Bang the Big Bang depends
on you that's a big paradigm shift that's taking materialism
and flipping it upside down and a lot of people
have a hard time wrapping their mind around that one
because a pretty big mind [ __ ] and the
reason that is because most people take all this metaphysical
stuff for granted and in fact when you bring up
conversations of metaphysics to them they will say oh metaphysics
that's some philosophical nonsense I don't care about metaphysics Leah
I don't do metaphysics or they might even say if
they're scientists they might say Leo science doesn't deal in
metaphysics we've abandoned that centuries ago that's for the philosophers
and theologians we don't care about that nonsense what we
care about is the hard objective facts but you see
the belief that there are hard objective facts that's a
metaphysical claim you can't avoid metaphysics if you don't do
metaphysics what that means is that you will have a
de facto sloppy very deeply confused metaphysics which is what
most people have including very intelligent people including atheistic people
including rational people including the most scientific people including people
with PhDs including people who are big-name professors who have
written many books who have gotten Nobel Prizes generally they
still don't grasp the significance of some of these metaphysical
assumptions that all human beings make these are just implicit
you pick them up from your culture and our culture
if you're raised in modern civilized society is just completely
permeated by materialism utterly so utterly that it's worse than
religious indoctrination because with religious indoctrination at least you're aware
of other religions if you're a Muslim you know about
Christianity you know about Judaism and if you're a Christian
you know about other religions you know about Buddhism and
you know about Mormonism and so on you don't believe
they're right you believe you're right but at least you're
open to those and you generally believe that yeah you
could be indoctrinated into some kind of religious cult but
see when you grow up in the materialist paradigm of
modern culture modern society nobody tells you it's a paradigm
nobody tells you that you could get indoctrinated into it
and that that's exactly what happens is that you're indoctrinated
into it you're not given any other alternative and if
you even dare to speak out of any other possibility
you will get mocked and criticized and actually even called
crazy as though you're just denying reality see this is
um this is the tragedy of modern culture it's not
nearly as advanced as it thinks it is what I'm
saying here is that I'm saying that reality is a
hallucination and I mean that very literally that everything you're
seeing and experiencing right now including my voice including my
face including my body is a hallucination and that there's
nothing beyond hallucinations there are only hallucinations why do I
use the word hallucination I actually use it very deliberately
because if you go to a dictionary you look up
the word hallucination here's what it'll say a hallucination is
a appearance or a perception without substance that's literally the
definition of hallucination and that's exactly what we have is
we have appearances first-person appearances and nothing else no brains
behind the scenes no hard physical matter behind the scenes
there are no physical laws behind the scenes there's no
mathematical equations behind the scenes there's nothing behind the scenes
it's just a hallucination but of course people have a
hard time buying this because what they've done is they
have well they have a silly notion of hallucination so
when I say hallucination they imagine that oh well Leo
a hallucination has something like a dream or a nightmare
or some wacky crazy thing that you imagine dancing elves
and unicorns those could be hallucinations but not this leo
this is not a hallucination what are you talking about
this is real this is hard stuff how could this
be a hallucination look at how lawful it is it's
all physical I mean are you saying I can just
jump through a wall if all this is a hole
in it hallucination why can't I just jump through a
wall why can't I just fly why can't I break
the laws of physics why can't I manifest unicorns just
by thinking about them but see that's a very naive
and silly notion of what a hallucination is hallucination has
nothing to do with that there are different kinds of
loosin ations you could have crazy wacky outlandish hallucinations where
you're flying through walls or you could have loose Nations
where the wall is solid and you can't fly through
it you can innate that if you hit your head
against the wall you're gonna crack your skull open and
die and that's what will happen in that hallucination the
hallucinations can have infinite properties some of them can be
crazy like certain dreams that you've had and some of
them can be very down-to-earth and realistic and solid-looking which
is what we tend to call ordinary physical reality and
of course that particular hallucination is governed by a certain
set of rules see people assume that if it's hallucination
that there are no rules and anything goes no why
would you assume that a hallucination can have certain rules
that you need to follow there's a certain logic to
hallucinations like in certain dreams there's a certain logic there
you might be getting chased by a monster and in
a sense that's crazy and wacky but still there's a
certain consistency to your dreams it's chasing you and you're
closing doors as you're running away so that means that
in your dream you're kind of assuming that monsters can't
just walk through doors at least they'd have to bust
through them like in the physical world and after all
you're assuming that if that monster catches up with you
it's gonna eat you and kill you that's why you're
running away from it right that's why you're afraid of
it otherwise if it didn't kill you then why would
you be afraid of it so of course there's a
certain kind of logic to your dreamy hallucinations and there's
it likewise a certain kind of logic to this hallucination
right here there's only certain things I can do I'm
bound by the physical rules of this hallucination the problem
here is that what I'm saying even though it makes
perfect sense is that it's just too radical for you
to accept given your paradigm it boggles the materialists mind
and there's this phenomenon that I call paradigm block or
paradigm blindness which means that when you're inside of your
paradigm your paradigm which is composed of the most fundamental
assumptions about how you think reality works it limits actually
it cripples your imagination your ability to imagine alternative interpretations
of reality and it limits what you think is possible
within that reality so for example you cannot talk about
ghosts with a materialist why not because the materialist paradigm
is based on the assumption that everything is material so
by definition there cannot be ghosts because ghosts are immaterial
so that is precluded by the paradigm now don't get
me wrong I'm not saying go surreal I've never seen
a ghost personally and I'm not attached to whether they
are real or not real I don't really care which
is the case I'm making a larger deeper epistemic point
here which is that your paradigm limits what you believe
is possible or impossible so for a materialist ghosts are
impossible if you step outside that paradigm well ghosts might
be possible that doesn't mean they're real it just means
that they're possible in your paradigm your imagination is also
opened up such that you can explore other mechanisms for
how certain phenomena can work because when you're under the
materialist paradigm certain phenomena are impossible and therefore you're not
even going to investigate them you're not even think about
them or take them seriously in fact you're gonna laugh
you're gonna you ridicule you're gonna judge and criticize based
on your paradigm so the interesting thing is is that
if ghosts are real let's just say just let's just
be crazy here let's just say they're real but that
they're rare and that you need to really go out
of your way to find one but they're real but
you are stuck in the materials paradigm which says that
they're not real so can you see the problem here
you're never gonna bother to get off your ass to
go find one and in fact if someone reports to
you that hey I've seen one what are you gonna
do you're gonna call them crazy stupid ignorant superstitious whatever
else you're not gonna listen to them you're gonna dismiss
them out of hand and that's closed mindedness that's the
entire problem with paradigms when you're inside a paradigm you
can't see outside to consider other paradigms but what is
possible is it as possible for you to make a
discontinuous jump out of your paradigm into a different paradigm
and then look at the world from that perspective and
if you do then a lot of things for you
can change but the problem is that people get clingy
with their paradigms they treat their paradigms like precious little
security blankets that they need to hang on to now
at this point the materials might say okay leo so
you're talking about everything being a hallucination okay but where
are these hallucinations occurring in the brain right no of
course not there never was a brain the brain itself
is a hallucination so again the materials will say but
where are these hallucinations taking place in a computer is
it a matrix sort of deal are we living in
a simulated reality where is it taking place it's not
taking place anywhere that's the difficult thing to wrap your
mind around what the brain is and also what physical
reality is is an extraneous fictitious metaphysical entity identical in
nature to the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the way that
many people hold God or the way that children hold
Santa Claus or the way that science in the past
has held certain substances that it posited were necessary to
explain physical reality for example if you study the history
of science then you will know about substances like luminiferous
ether phlogiston caloric and miasma these four substances were legitimate
substances that people and sienten telogen scientists took very seriously
just a couple hundred years ago they believed that these
substances exist why is that because they needed these substances
to explain the certain phenomena or appearances that they were
seeing out in the world for example luminiferous ether was
a substance that was believed to exist just a little
bit over a hundred years ago by many scientists it
was a substance that was responsible for light propagating through
it because back then it didn't make sense to the
scientists mind that light could just travel through a vacuum
because the way the scientists thought is like but how
could light travel through an empty vacuum it makes no
sense light since it's a wave like water or Audio
waves they need a suffocating like air or water to
travel through so light must also need that sort of
substance so they posited ether and they believe it there
is this thing called ether until more and more scientists
we're doing various kinds of experiments and ultimately they they
realize you know what guys we don't need ether we
don't need this thing called ether to explain light but
how does light propagate through FD vacuum it just does
we just accept that it does see 200 years ago
if you said that people would think you're crazy nowadays
if you talk about ether people will think you're crazy
same thing goes for phlogiston phlogiston was a substance a
few hundred years ago maybe three four hundred years ago
that scientists believed in which was responsible supposedly for combustion
because scientists didn't understand how to explain combustion the chemical
process of igniting air and that the resulting chemicals that
came from that co2 and all that and the energy
and all that they didn't know how to explain that
without again creating this fictitious metaphysical entity called phlogiston and
many of them believe in phlogiston until eventually it was
decided that you know what guys we don't need phlogiston
we can explain combustion just using more ordinary explanations same
thing with caloric caloric of course same root word as
calorie which was the substance that was supposed to be
responsible for the transfer and flow of heat and scientists
believed in that substance until it was eventually well it
wasn't discovered but it was eventually concluded or agreed upon
that we don't need a substance called caloric we can
explain heat just simply through the average vibrations of molecules
and therefore caloric became superfluous and it was dropped and
then there was a substance called miasma this is a
really old substance it existed the notion of it existed
all the way back to the Greeks and Romans because
it was responsible for contagion of diseases so it was
pretty obvious to the Greeks and Romans that diseases spread
from people to people and there's contagion but they didn't
know germ theory they didn't know about viruses and bacteria
so they didn't know how this disease spread so their
notion was that well there must be something called miasma
which was this metaphysical entity which spread disease from person
to person but eventually with germ theory that was disproven
and found to be unnecessary so why am I talking
about all this well because the brain and an external
physical reality are identical to either phlogiston caloric and miasma
it's just that modern culture hasn't gotten around yet to
dropping these fictitious metaphysical entities so consider the following possibility
that reality is a hallucination which is not taking place
in a brain but rather there is no physical substratum
for reality whatsoever because none is needed in the same
way that light can propagate through a vacuum without ether
because ether is not needed and disease can propagate without
miasma because my asthma is not needed because they're fictions
they're fictions of the mind now you might say but
leo that's crazy that's impossible how could it be that
reality is just a free-floating hallucination floating out an empty
space somewhere but actually it's very easily possible all you
have to do is drop your materialist paradigm drop the
assumption that appearances must take place within a physical substratum
that is something that you merely assumed was true about
reality but after all a deeper investigation we could come
to the conclusion where we say you know what that
assumption we should drop that assumption because it's not necessary
we assumed we needed a physical substance for hallucinations but
actually we don't but of course that's easier said than
done because you see I am talking to a fundamentalist
here when you believe in the materials paradigm you cannot
drop it just through sheer willpower you can't it's not
enough for you just to hear me talk about this
up and say oh yeah okay I agree with you
I'm gonna drop all my notions of physical reality as
if it was that easy no you can't do that
you're a fundamentalist you're not a fundamentalist like in the
exactly the same way that a Christian or a Muslim
is because the content of your beliefs is different but
you are still a fundamentalist because you know what for
the Christian his grounding substance is God for the Muslim
his grounding substance is Allah and for you your grounding
substance is a physical reality with the brain and neurons
within which all these appearances are taking place and you
are very goddamn adamant about your God see you might
think that as a materialist you don't believe in a
God and you pride yourself on being an atheist and
in fact you you have a little bit of scorn
for those people who believe in you know those are
silly silly superstitious new-age people superstitions that are thousands of
years old but what about your superstitions your God is
really no different than their God to a Christian their
God is a guy who sits up in the clouds
of the white with a white flowing beard to a
Muslim well Allah he doesn't really have a form and
to some other religious person than their version of God
might be something else you know like a Hindu their
version of God might be some elephant shaped avatar but
for you you don't believe in those kinds of gods
but your God is the brain that's your God there's
no proof of a brain there's no proof of an
external reality you take it completely on blind faith and
yet you believe it's so real you see because you're
under estimating just how tricky the mind is and the
fact that even when you don't want to your mind
is almost incapable of not holding an ideological position you
hold so many deep ideological positions without knowing it that
it's frightening it's frightening to realize that that's the case
especially for atheists and scientifically minded people who pride themselves
on being open-minded and non-ideological and non superstitious but you
see what happens when you don't properly think through your
metaphysics very carefully you end up being superstitious all the
same just the content of your superstition is different that's
it the only reason that you are a materialist is
really two reasons one is because first person experience is
very consistent for you most of the time and you
have never experienced for yourself the breakdown of the consistency
of first person experience which is for example what a
psychedelic can show you you've never experienced that though so
for you because first person appearances feel so consistent there
is the illusion of solidity to them and because they
feel so orderly and so physically determined like you can't
really break the laws of physics that that leads you
to believe that that's what the external world must be
really like that's an illusion though you can you can
shatter that illusion for yourself by by breaking down the
consistency of first person experience and you can do that
with intense meditation with certain types of breathing exercises you
can do it with psychedelics you can do it with
sensory deprivation tanks and sorts of things like that or
just through self inquiring contemplation you can do that and
the second reason your materialist is because you were just
born and indoctrinated into the materialist culture of which we
are all apart you see all your teachers all your
friends your family your co-workers everyone you know on TV
everyone you look up to all your role models all
your all your professors and pretty much anyone you've ever
interacted with has been a materialist without of course knowing
that they're a materialist and this is our culture and
you've been indoctrinated into materialism exactly the same way that
fundamentalist religious people are indoctrinated into fundamentalist religion and so
now because you weren't doctored into this from from really
the first years of your birth it is hardwired deep
into your brain so much that you can't even imagine
an alternative anymore you don't even want to imagine an
alternative and that's a big problem all right let's do
an intermission right here I need a quick break but
you don't go anywhere because I'll be right back so
let's continue the next objection that the materialist typically has
here is that she will ask below how can it
work like that how can everything just be a hallucination
just appearances without any kind of substrate to ground it
all but what you have to realize here is that
this is not a valid objection the better question is
how can anything work at all that's a really deep
mystery how can anything work at all you think that
it's absurd just to have appearances without a mechanism behind
it but then again what does it mean to say
that there is a mechanism that there is some sort
of substrate is that any less absurd of a notion
so you think that there's a substrate to these appearances
but how does a substrate cause the appearances this is
the famous mind-body problem you can't solve this problem and
anyways even if you could solve that problem you would
still have the same problem left over because how do
you have a substrate what grounds the substrate how can
there just be a substrate see you would need another
substrate for the substrate and so on and so on
and so on what you have to realize here is
that this is not a problem for reality this is
a problem for your understanding of reality and that's a
very big difference reality itself is not limited to your
materialist intuitions just because what I'm saying here sounds weird
or maybe absurd well yeah reality is weird and absurd
no matter how you slice it it is that way
and you see that in every corner of science everything
the science investigates see the weirdness and absurdity of nature
especially when you get into the very small stuff like
quantum mechanics string theory or when you get into the
really big stuff like cosmology and the Big Bang and
you look at how that is supposed to work according
to science and it's it's crazy weird absurd stuff and
just 100 years ago when these discoveries were still fresh
and being made by Einstein and the people who were
working on quantum mechanics and even people that working on
cosmological theories today there's all sorts of theories about multiple
dimensions multiverses and membranes and brains all sorts of weird
stuff like that you look at that all these theories
are extremely weird extremely paradoxical extremely counterintuitive and that's okay
because as it turns out our intuitions are really only
designed to work with everyday life everyday life just living
as a human being it's not designed to look at
the very small is very large and it's not designed
to look at the very fundamental because human minds rarely
look in that direction and anyways you have to realize
that weirdness and absurdity these are subjective notions and that
really the only thing that it says when you say
that something is weird and absurd and crazy sounding that's
not a measure of truth and that's not a measure
of reality and people forget this point that's a measure
of how well aligned you are with your culture do
you get that point this is a very big point
because this misleads a lot of people a lot of
very intelligent people even scientifically minded people get misled by
this today if I come up here I say that
the earth is flat and stationary you would say that
I am crazy and that that is just an absurd
position to take and yet if you were alive a
thousand years ago if I came up to you and
I said that the earth is moving through space at
hundreds and thousands of kilometers per second the way that
we know now you would say that that's absurd and
insane because you'd say look around do you feel like
you're moving at a hundred miles an hour or a
thousand kilometers per second no you don't so just using
common sense it says that the earth must be stationary
of course it must and that's what common sense said
a thousand years ago because that was the cultural norm
of the time and so back then it was absurd
to claim otherwise and today the cultural norms have shifted
as of course they do culture evolves and changes a
lot over time it can reverse itself 180 degrees within
just a couple hundred years and so now to claim
that the earth is flat and stationary that now is
absurd and people take this for granted so you can't
rely on your notions of weirdness and absurdity to deliver
truth to you all that they say is they say
are you in alignment with everybody else around you they
are a measure of consensus relative consensus among other human
beings that you live amongst in this particular era of
time in human civilization that's all that means when we're
talking about fundamental metaphysical topics like the ultimate nature of
reality or the substance of everything if we encounter paradox
here this should not be considered a problem or a
mistake this should actually be taken as a feature as
it must because when you're trying to answer the ultimate
chicken and egg problem well yeah that's a paradoxical thing
the fact that there is something rather than nothing is
a paradoxical thing to explain you should expect that it's
going to be tricky to explain that away and it's
not just gonna be a simple 1 2 3 ABC
ok yeah we've explained all of existence away it's not
gonna be quite that simple and also what you should
notice is that this problem of what is the ultimate
grounding for reality this is not a problem that materialists
escaped so what I'm saying when I say that everything
is a hallucination I'm saying that there is no grounding
for anything there is no ultimate substance for reality it's
just appearances appearances within nothingness not appearances within space I'm
not saying that and not appearances within time I'm not
saying that not appearances within three dimensions or ten dimensions
or however many dimensions not appearances within a universe or
within a multiverse I'm not saying any of that I'm
saying appearances within nothingness and by nothingness I don't mean
a vacuum I don't mean empty space and that might
seem like that's impossible but consider where do the materialists
say existence came from the Big Bang and where's the
Big Bang come from well we don't really know there
are a few possibilities either it came from nowhere which
is exactly what I'm telling you or it came from
something else so that's something else that it came from
that would also be an appearance and then that thing
you would ask where did that come from the thing
that caused the Big Bang what caused it again it
came from nothing which is what I'm telling you or
it came from some other appearance a third appearance and
where that would come from so again you see we're
going into this infinite regression and so if you're a
materialist you might say well yeah leo maybe there is
an infinite regression it just keeps going on and on
and on and one Big Bang is nested in some
other thing and some other thing and some other thing
in and we need to do hardcore science to get
to the bottom of that and that might very well
be the case maybe in a hundred years scientists will
find something beyond the Big Bang before the Big Bang
which caused the Big Bang and that's that's fine there's
no problem there as far as I'm concerned but there
is a problem in that even if that's true the
material is still don't grasp the significance of what this
metaphysics means because when you explain one appearance with other
appearance you don't really explain the source of appearances themselves
the very nature of appearances are not explained so if
there's something outside the Big Bang okay you can give
it a name you can call it something you can
take a photograph of it okay maybe there's something else
beyond that okay you can take a photograph of that
too or give it a name but that explains nothing
about where all of it came from or what all
of it is because all of it is happening right
now so ultimately when you say that there's an infinite
regress of appears as causing appearances you're saying the exact
same thing that I'm saying which is that all you've
got are appearance an infinite hallucination that's what I'm saying
you've got an infinite hallucination all of it grounded in
what in nothing it's not even grounded in time and
in space because those things are things and where they
come from you have to wonder so the materialist doesn't
escape what I'm saying here the materialist is just ignorant
of these consequences and ramifications because the materials doesn't seriously
think about these things like we're doing here now here's
another objection and it's a very important one the materials
will say Billy Oh aha I got you to look
at this what about brain damage what if we take
a person and we take a hammer and we hit
him over the skull with a hammer and that look
look what's gonna happen that's gonna affect the way he
thinks that's gonna damage his brain that's gonna maybe damage
his visual cortex he's not gonna be able to see
straight maybe he's gonna bleed to death and to die
and all the appearances that he sees all these first-person
appearances leo that you say are are the only thing
there is they're all gonna change so doesn't that prove
right there that damaging the brain changes all the appearances
so that tells us right that the brain causes them
all and that they are occurring inside the brain except
let's look at this very carefully because it doesn't prove
that at all and I agree with you that if
you take the brain and you hit it with a
hammer you will damage it and that will affect how
appearances appear but notice what this does and doesn't demonstrate
what it does not demonstrate is that appearances are happening
in the brain what it does demonstrate is that the
brain being an appearance can be affected by a hammer
which is how their peer so one hammer effects another
brain appears affecting appearance which then effects other appearances that's
right because when all you have are appearances all of
reality is is just a infinite collection of appearances then
it's a self interactive system appearances affect and interact with
other appearances of course they do that's reality that doesn't
prove that appearances are happening inside of a brain or
inside of a external physical world reality is a self
interactive system it must interact with itself because reality means
everything that there is which means that there's nothing else
beyond reality which means that it can only interact with
itself because it has nothing to else to interact with
you see and this is exactly what science is an
agreement about science will tell you that if you take
one billiard ball and you hit another billiard ball they
will bounce off and stuff will happen what's going on
there what's going on there is that you have one
ball that's one appearance you have a second ball second
appearance they hit each other they collide that's another appearance
and then after the collision appearances change and then they
bounce off and stuff happens and so on or if
you want to look at the microscopic level you can
say that there are atoms and electrons and protons and
they're orbiting each other so what's going on there it's
an appearance an electron and a proton two appearances interacting
with each other of course yeah it's a self interactive
system that's what we're saying and the brain is part
of that system so of course your brain affects perceptions
of course it does your brain is not irrelevant I've
never said the brain was irrelevant it's highly relevant and
important and you want to make sure you keep your
brain safe don't play football or something like that or
don't do MMA fighting but that doesn't mean the appears
that are happening in your brain it just means that
the brain is one very significant appearance which effects other
appearances which is why you want to keep it safe
so there's no contradiction there and another example you might
want to cite to prove me wrong as you might
say well Leo what if I get drunk you know
if I get drunk or I take some psychotropic drugs
really strong ones that's gonna affect how I see everything
colors might change objects might change stuff gets weird and
wavy and wonky so doesn't that prove that all these
appears are happening in the brain no not at all
because you drink a bottle of hard liquor that's an
appearance it goes it interacts with your neurons in the
brain that's also an appearance and it changes what you're
seeing also in appearance because appearances interact with each other
sometimes it's very complicated and Inter woven sort of ways
but that does not prove that all this is happening
in a brain now you might say well leo why
did the brain evolve then well the brain precisely evolved
because the brain is very important for generating the very
rich kind of appearances that you're experiencing if you're a
human being human consciousness is a very rich thing if
we compare it to the consciousness of an ant or
a sea slug or a tree we can imagine that
the human consciousness is much more robust and and rich
and complex and therefore our brains must be more convoluted
and complex have a lot more neural circuitry in there
and so forth because you need that level of sort
of self interaction very complicated self interaction to then generate
all these colors that you see all these emotions that
you experience your rational faculties ability to do mathematics which
a snail supposedly can't do right so yeah for that
you need a pretty big brain and it evolved precisely
because that's what allows you to see everything that you're
seeing here so I'm not contradicting anything there but that
still doesn't prove that there is a brain yes there's
neurons doing stuff there but the neurons themselves are an
appearance they are not inside of a brain do you
see that that's important Polly oh this is starting to
sound like magic that's because reality actually is magic and
a lot of people misunderstand this what I mean when
I say that reality is magic is that the fact
of existence itself is a mechanical and uncaused and mystical
people have a really hard time understanding this what I'm
saying is that everything you're experiencing right now is happening
right here there is no mechanism behind the scenes which
is generating all this this is the mechanism and you
might wonder well how can reality possibly do that but
the better question is what would prevent it from doing
that reality being unlimited can take the most direct route
the shortest possible route to whatever it wants to do
which means direct manifestation or magic it's not limited by
the laws of physics people really don't understand this they
tend to think that physics applies to reality as a
whole that's not true at all physics applies to a
local portion of what we call physical reality a good
analogy for this is the way that government works you
see you can set up a government and the government
can have laws now those laws apply to everything that
goes on within the government but those laws do not
apply outside of the government you see that so you
could make a law against slavery and theft and murder
and all this sort of stuff and those are all
good laws to have but nothing is preventing the government
from creating whatever other kind of laws it might want
it can create the opposite laws you see nothing prevents
that so while the government has the power to enforce
laws on you there is no authority above the government
to enforce laws on itself other than perhaps other governments
that it might fight with but outside of all the
different governments that exist anything goes you can literally come
up with any laws you want for a government and
try to make it work now of course not all
of them will work as well as certain other combinations
but it just goes to show you that the physical
laws that we take is just the only way reality
can be those don't apply to metaphysical issues which is
what we're talking about here so while in the physical
world we have limits like conservation of energy conservation of
momentum certain limits within gravitation within electromagnetism and so on
that doesn't apply to the fact of existence itself see
these are two separate issues that we're talking about what
I'm talking about here is in no way in conflict
with the basic laws of physics I'm not contradicting that
those are all still in play nothing wrong with those
but what science doesn't really tackle is the metaphysical question
of being itself this right here being being itself right
here what is it and where does it come from
what is it grounded in well what I'm telling you
is that it's a hallucination and that it happens literally
through magic but still the materialist hates this idea of
magic the materials will say but Leo why should we
resort to magical thinking this seems like a step backwards
after all human beings for thousands of years have gone
to magical thinking to help them to explain all sorts
of mysterious natural phenomena like lightning bolts earthquakes volcanoes comets
famines and floods and plagues and also this sort of
stuff and then with science science progressed and ultimately we
figured that stuff out and now we have mechanical naturalistic
explanations to account for all that so doesn't that prove
that magical thinking is uh is unnecessary why don't we
give science more time to do its job give it
time to to collide more particles and also to send
out more satellites take photographs scan the galaxies and all
this sort of stuff and maybe ultimately we can scientifically
put together a mechanical picture for how all of existence
came into being and what I'm saying is that that's
not gonna work because these are two separate issues yes
you can explain a physical phenomena like lightning bolts or
volcanoes using science you can explain it mechanically and that's
all well and good but what you need to understand
is that just because you explain the mechanics of a
lightning bolt perfectly does not mean that you've explained the
being or fact that there is a lightning bolt at
all that question is never addressed because it's taken for
granted and also because science doesn't do that that's not
what science is about the activity of science is about
using one appearance to explain another appearance it's about taking
one appearance and analyzing it or breaking it down into
its sub component appearances but in doing that you don't
explain the fact of appearances themselves and so therefore what
I'm claiming here is that if science keeps working diligently
for the next million years studying the galaxies and studying
the subatomic particles and all that it can explain a
lot of stuff it will discover more and more and
more appearances in fact it will discover an infinite number
of appear a never-ending supply of appearances appearances within appearances
within appearances within appearances millions and billions and trillions of
them but no matter how much it Maps all those
out categorizes them labels them and explores them and calculates
them it might get very good at predicting what's gonna
happen next as far as which appears it's gonna cause
which other appears to do what but it will never
ever ever touch the question of the substance and the
fact of the being of the appearance do you get
that because science is not in the business of answering
metaphysical questions and in fact any good scientist will admit
this and he will say yeah Leo you're right science
has abandoned metaphysics centuries ago because we found that it
wasn't useful signs is a pragmatic activity what we are
concerned about is we are concerned about exploring empirical data
making calculations making predictions and that's all there is to
science the metaphysical questions we live that we leave that
to philosophers and we live that to theologians but see
here's the mistake with doing that yes that can work
if all you care about is making predictions but what
the scientist does understand is that when you're doing science
you're still making metaphysical assumptions you're not doing science metaphysics
free when you're ignoring the metaphysics all that you're doing
is that you're just accepting the de facto default metaphysics
of your culture which is in this case materialism you
just take it for granted and you think that that's
not going to be a problem because it couldn't be
any other way except what I'm telling you is that
it could be some other way and in fact it
is some other way and so eventually what you'll discover
is that your metaphysics is not gonna hold water and
that's all actually already been discovered within feels like quantum
mechanics and cosmology you can clearly see that materialism breaks
down add these at these peripheries of science as it
must because it's impossible to actually escape the magic of
reality magical thinking is actually inescapable to explain the origin
of reality because there must always be at least one
mystical source so for example consider the Big Bang the
way science addresses this issue is they just say well
there is the Big Bang and beyond that we don't
know but that's the one mystical source that I'm talking
about see you give science one mystical source and they
can explain everything else well you give me one mystical
source and I can explain everything as well - you
always will need this mystical source science will never be
able to do away with this mystical source because if
they find something outside the Big Bang like we already
said well that new thing will then become the new
one mystical source but here's what I'm telling you I'm
telling you that this whole game of of chasing down
Big Bang after Big Bang after Big Bang misses the
point the point is to realize that being itself right
here this is the mechanism itself so rather than thinking
that there's some number-crunching going on behind the scenes of
the universe there's no number-crunching I want you to consider
the following radical alternative is that the mechanism of appearances
is completely and directly open to you nothing is hidden
behind the scenes this is it what you see is
the mechanism the mechanism is direct manifestation there's no like
going from A to B to C it's just a
to a a is a and therefore it is and
here you're conscious of it there is no process of
going from a thing existing and then you being conscious
of these are not two things these are identical so
what you're seeing here right now all around you this
is the actual mechanism of reality you're inside the mechanism
you literally are the mechanism therefore you cannot explain the
mechanism by citing other appearances because every other appearance you
sight misses the fact of the direct manifestation of appearances
in the first place you're missing the directness of it
so when science goes around explaining one thing in terms
of another notice it always has to be that way
because that's the only way that an explanation can even
happen an explanation is one appearance followed by a second
appearance in close conjunction that creates an explanation but here
is where language and symbolism breaks down here's where concepts
break down what you need to do is you need
to become directly conscious of the fact that an explanation
is just a couple of symbols closely associated with each
other and what are those but just appearances and what
are appearance as well that's where you need to become
directly conscious that they are just a direct manifestation pure
magic mysticism is actually the simplest explanation of reality talk
about Occam's razor you want Occam's razor here's it here
it is it's mysticism it's magic it's direct manifestation there's
no external reality there's no brain there's no atoms there's
no quarks there's none of that [ __ ] because
none of it is necessary because reality is unlimited so
why would it need that it goes straight for what
it wants and it gets it because it's unlimited since
there is only one thing in existence reality it is
its own source it must be because there's nothing else
that could be a sown source there's this misguided desire
amongst intelligent scientific and materialistically minded people to demystify nature
but this is a problem it's a problem if it
turns out that nature is irreducibly mystical see here's a
problem for the materialist is that the materialist never actually
bothered to ask the question wait a minute is reality
mystical or non mystical hmm let me actually explore the
answer to that question it never happened that way but
actually that's an empirical question because when you're born you
don't know anything about reality and you certainly don't know
whether it's mystical or non mystical you don't know so
what's required is for you to undertake a very open
and honest investigation into answering that question but that's not
what the materialist does the materialist just assumes that there
cannot be anything mystical and so therefore anything mystical that
he encounters he either rejects as being a fiction or
he says well surely we can demystify it and break
it all down reduce it down to mechanical phenomena and
that's the disease of materialism is because of course you
can if you want you can take everything mystical and
you can explain it in terms of appearances but then
you're missing the fact of its being which is exactly
the tragedy of science is that science explains a lot
of stuff but it doesn't get the essence of the
being of a thing it's a it's a very circular
kind of logic vicious circle it begs the question in
a sense that you know if we had a scientist
and I showed him an elephant but this side just
had a paradigm in which elephants could not exist so
I would show him it itself and I would say
look there's an elephant the scientists would look at and
say oh that can't be an elephant that must be
something else and I say no but look it's clearly
an elephant and he looks at he's like hmm no
it's not an elephant because elephants don't exist that's a
horse but why are you calling it a horse it's
an elephant no you can't call an elephant cause elephants
don't exist but shouldn't you think the other way around
shouldn't you like first ask yourself wait a minute do
elephants exist or not and then base your worldview on
that rather than first have your world view that there
are no elephants and then go out there and then
try to disprove it you see so the scientists will
bend over backwards to call the elephant a horse no
matter what because in his mind elephants can't exist I
mean it's preposterous but this is exactly what happens with
materialism you tell or show a materialist a mystical phenomena
which is by the way every single phenomenon that there
is every single phenomenon is a mystical phenomena you show
that to a materialist and he says no there's nothing
mystical here leo there's nothing mystical about reality none of
this stuff is mystical it's all just mechanical I mean
it's the most absurd it's the most absurd logically there
could possibly be it's beyond absurd because what's required to
to achieve that in your mind is it require it
requires you to deny being you actually have to be
ignorant of the the very essence of reality itself in
favor of symbolizing and conceptualizing reality so the problem with
demystifying nature is that you lose touch with being and
then your life suffers from that it suffers a lot
and also you don't understand where the being came from
you're mystified by it ironically because you're denying it you're
in denial about it you don't want to admit it
because for the materialist paradigm there is no such thing
as magic that's an athame to that paradigm those two
cannot coexist from the materialist paradigm all magic must be
done away with it must somehow be denied and so
the materialist is forever in this game of denial about
the very essence of reality and therefore he must always
be out of touch with the very essence of his
own existence and therefore he's gonna suffer from that and
that's why this whole material paradigm is such a big
problem now the materials will object here and he'll say
but Leo aren't you just playing word games I mean
what does it matter if you call it an appearance
a first-person experience or a third-person objective experience or you
call it an elephant a horse what does it matter
these are all word games sure you could say it's
material or immaterial who really cares it makes no difference
right wrong it makes a huge difference because to buy
into this materialist metaphysics your straitjacket in yourself this metaphysics
is very rigid it excludes the possibility for many things
and it creates closed mindedness which prevents you from exploring
the many interesting facets of life that are beyond the
gross material facets beyond the gross mature facets Leo what
could there be there's nothing beyond the gross material facets
precisely because you're stuck in that paradigm that's exactly what
I'm saying that's the whole problem is that the only
thing you know of reality is the gross material level
you don't acknowledge us a more subtle level you don't
acknowledge immaterial levels it's actually quite silly because everything is
immaterial that's what it means to say that everything is
a hallucination everything is immaterial so there really aren't material
levels immaterial levels no there's just everything is immaterial and
this is not merely a word game because here I'll
give you some examples if I start talking to a
materialist about things like past lives out-of-body experiences paranormal paranormal
yogic powers aliens spirits and ghosts and immortality just to
name a few if I start talking about these topics
the materialist will think I'm crazy they will think that
this is nonsense and now it's important you understand that
I'm not saying that these things are true per se
for example I've never experienced aliens or ghosts myself so
I wouldn't know their crew not that's not the issue
here don't get hung up on that what I'm saying
is that from this rigid materialist metaphysics you cannot honestly
and objectively explore these topics or even listen to a
person talking about them because they're gonna actually piss you
off make you emotional make you angry make you heated
you will name call these people you will call me
a New Age hack or some kook or some woowoo
guy or whatever when I start talking to you about
these topics that's right because from the materialist metaphysics none
of these topics are possible and none of them make
any sense so the only way you can explain these
things from within the materials paradigm is to call the
people that talk about these things crazy nut cases and
that does you a great disservice because in point of
fact you don't know the nature of these topics and
you've never seriously explored them because you were never open
to them in the first place now the material of
course hearsay Valeo I don't want to be open to
such nonsense are you [ __ ] serious ghosts aliens
what's next Bigfoot you want me to seriously be open
to this stuff that's a waste of my time I
don't want to hear that [ __ ] what I
want is I just want practical straightforward down-to-earth factual self-help
information that's what I want none of that other nonsense
but see the whole problem is that you don't know
that it's nonsense you assume that it's nonsense but that
is an empirical question whether these things are nonsense or
not and if you ever want to really find out
you have to undertake an honest very open investigation you
have to be willing to read the books listen to
the right people do the practices do the experiments you
can't do any of that stuff if your mind is
closed because you think the stuff is nonsense but leo
this is dangerous don't you see how dangerous it is
what you're advocating this is a slippery slope because what
you're doing is you're you're opening the floodgates for superstition
and we know how dangerous that's been throughout history how
many millions of people have died from all sorts of
crazy superstitious religions and cults and governments and conspiracy theories
and ideologies and now what you're doing is you're just
opening up the floodgates but notice that this is a
fear-based objection that you have when you make an objection
like this you're not really concerned about the truth what
you're concerned about is believing something false and I hear
you that's a legitimate fear is very easy to believe
something false but that's not what I'm telling you to
do I'm telling you to open yourself up which is
not the same thing as saying you should believe every
goddamn thing you hear gullibly like a fool it's actually
the exact opposite when you're open you don't take any
position on anything you're free you can move from one
paradigm to another paradigm freely without problems without getting emotional
about it without getting clingy not getting ideological without getting
offended without having to go crusade and kill other people
in this process our ultimate commitment must be to the
truth not reaction against fears and actually counter-intuitively you know
those people who are the dangerous ones who kill people
over silly beliefs those aren't the open-minded people those are
the closed-minded people those are the people that are locked
into paradigms those are the people that are certain that
they have the truth like you those are the people
who are certain that they know what nonsense looks like
like you so when they hear a new scientific theory
they reject it as nonsense when they hear someone threatening
their religion they reject it as nonsense when they hear
someone threatening some theory they have or some some new
theory that came out then they reject that as nonsense
which is exactly what you're doing and what I'm trying
to help you to stop doing but first you have
to see that you actually have a lot more in
common with those dogmatic ideological zealots then you like to
tell yourself the problem here is that the biggest lie
that materialists and scientists and rationalists tell themselves and also
atheists is that they tell themselves that they are above
and superior to all the other superstitious people but the
danger in doing that is that you ignore your own
superstitions and so now what you're seeing with this discussion
is that I'm turning the tables on you and I'm
lumping you with all those people who you have despised
who you have scorned because in truth you have a
lot in common with them in truth your materialism is
your religion which is why you're so goddamn insistent about
it and which is why we just hope to spend
all these hours talking about it because no matter how
long I talk about it you still don't get it
you still don't want to put your ideology down it
still doesn't compute in your head you still have all
those excuses and all those judgments and in the end
you're very likely to say after hearing all this you
know but leo yeah maybe some of this stuff makes
sort of sense in theory but I just don't buy
it I mean it sounds like you're just trying to
seek God and religion and mysticism into science that's what
you're doing here isn't it I can certainly appreciate that
it seems that way from your perspective from within the
materialist paradigm that's exactly how it looks but what I'm
telling you is that there is an alternative you can
exit that paradigm you can recognize that materialism is a
virus of your mind and you can go about extracting
it and leaving it and seeing what results when you
do and that's an amazing thing you will be shocked
at how liberating it feels to exit that paradigm it's
like leaving a jail cell that you've lived in your
entire life and discovering what's out in the real world
and there's some amazing stuff there and the benefit to
you will not just be intellectual you will not only
just be closer to truth but you'll have many advantages
to your personal development you'll have many advantages to your
ability to comprehend and practice spirituality to do self inquiry
and to experience some of the advanced subtle immaterial truths
which your current paradigm completely denies and cannot make sense
of you will actually be able to easily make sense
of them and you will have some incredibly profound direct
experiences of crazy things that materials culture thinks are impossible
yet they are possible because you can go and experience
them you just haven't because you've been so locked in
by your paradigm so in conclusion what I want you
to do from all this information is I want you
to sit down and I want you to question materialism
to death through self inquiry and contemplation actually think through
the logic of your own metaphysics until you can see
how it is self-defeating how it doesn't make sense how
you're not recognizing the full ramifications of your own metaphysics
do that and that's some of the most powerful personal
development work you can do right there the results might
not be immediate because your mind is so stuck to
your paradigm that it might take you years to break
out of it it's taken me decades I've been thinking
about this stuff for decades and just recently I've been
starting to break out it's been feeling amazing and what
I'm saying here is that you can actually discover that
the materials paradigm is wrong I'm not telling you to
believe me and to accept this on faith I'm telling
you to go discover that it's wrong because it is
and stop believing that there are brains and that all
of this is happening in a brain somewhere this is
really holding you back because so long as you believe
that you're not actually opening yourself up to the mystical
nature of all of existence when you drop the brain
God then you're suddenly open to the reality that all
of this is nothingness a hallucination with a nothingness and
then reality becomes much more interesting it becomes much more
beautiful much more profound than when you lie to yourself
telling yourself all this is just happening in a brain
some neuron somewhere no there are no brains drop that
idea from your worldview stop identifying with being a brain
if you take a psychedelic don't think of it as
a thing that you're doing to your brain it's got
nothing to do with brains but that's something I really
want you to discover for yourself all right that's the
end here please remember to click that like button for
me come check out actualized org check out my blog
check out the forum check out my life purpose course
check out my book list there are a lot of
books on my book list in various different categories that
I have there which will help you a lot to
fix this particular problem here about the materialist paradigm so
go check those out start reading that's going to be
a good way to jump start your own contemplations and
then just stay tuned with actualized org every single week
stay tuned and watch me become enlightened it's already starting
to happen it's going to happen on camera you're gonna
see the transformation in me over the next year or
two or three however long the process takes it's not
just gonna be a split second thing it's gonna be
a process and I can already feel that the process
is started and lately just recently I've broken through some
barriers and I feel like I mean you can already
see hopefully the transformation that I've personally been going through
as I've been shooting these videos for the last three
or four years just compare my video from today to
what it was like a year ago or two years
ago they're pretty different but that's just gonna keep accelerating
and accelerating and accelerating and one of the things that
I'm excited about with actualizado org which is really the
intent of it from the very beginning is that I
wanted to actually document my enlightenment as it happens because
I think that this is a pretty rare thing I
don't know of any place where you can go and
you actually see videos of someone becoming gradually enlightened over
the course of let's say 5 years it's hard to
see that usually when you see enlightened masters they got
enlightened in a cave somewhere back in the 1970s and
now they're old men and they're sitting up there on
the on a pedestal and they're lecturing at you as
though there's some sort of guru and I mean nothing
wrong with that you can get some great insights from
them but you didn't actually see them going through the
process there's something cool about seeing somebody actually going through
the process eating their own dog food I'm following my
own advice I'm I'm doing all these techniques and and
I'm having all these insights that I'm sharing with you
then I'm thinking about them myself doing it myself applying
it in my own life and then you should start
to see the transformation in me you'll start to see
how I carry myself differently how I think differently my
beliefs changing my paradigms changing you're gonna see my personality
changing my emotions changing my eye contact changing my voice
change and everything's gonna be changing well within 5 years
I'm gonna be a completely different person you're probably not
even gonna be able to relate to me anymore if
you're actually not following along and doing some of the
work if you're just sitting back and watching I mean
that can be interesting I guess but you should start
doing the work because I'm telling you I'm gonna quickly
outgrow you and the things that I'm gonna be talking
about in three or five years are gonna be so
mind-blowing that they're gonna be outside of your paradigm completely
and that's one of the whole dangers of being locked
into a paradigm is that then you're you're really not
able to listen to advanced teachings anymore because the advanced
teachings will sound like the ravings of a lunatic and
you know what I know that to some of you
that's already happened I know that many people have already
unsubscribed from my channel and stopped watching actualized org because
what's happened to me over the last three or four
years a pretty big transition from just doing more ordinary
personal development and self-help type stuff and relationship advice and
stuff like that to now doing more non-duality type of
advice and it's like for some people sickly Oh what
are you smoking this stuff is not gonna help my
life how is this gonna help me I just want
to get laid I want to earn some money and
you're talking about some non-duality [ __ ] who cares
about this sort of stuff who cares about paradigms who
cares about brains none of this stuff matters I'm just
depressed I just want to cure my depression you see
but the reason I mean I get you and you
can go and you can find advice that will that
will suit that low level of consciousness but you see
advice has to be tailored to the level of consciousness
of the person listening to it and when you're down
here and the teacher is up here there's too big
of a disconnect so if you like this stuff and
you like actualize org and you want to keep liking
it then start eating actions start growing with me and
then also just sit back and watch my own enlightenment
see how it's happening and hopefully that encourages you hopefully
that inspires you hopefully that'll a some of your fears
about how this process works and just proves to you
that it's possible for an ordinary guy to do it
and then that means it's possible for you too so
make sure you stick around to watch that unfold you
