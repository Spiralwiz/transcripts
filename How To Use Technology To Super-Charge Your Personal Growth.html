hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
what I want to talk about is ways that technology
can be used to advance your personal development so what
do I mean by this I think that I'm gonna
make this short and sweet and straight to the point
and just give a couple of examples in ways that
I've been personally able to use technology to help me
advance my growth and contrast with ways that technology is
actually counterproductive because I think that a lot of people
go out there they buy gadgets and those gadgets they
think they're gonna get a lot of benefit from and
they're gonna get a lot of personal growth from but
they end up not and so I want to contrast
compare and contrast where the differences are between using technology
to advance yourself and not and I think that there
are very legitimate uses for where technology can be used
to give you a lot of personal growth really fast
and so that's great in modern in modern times we
have so many gadgets so much technology the trick is
not so much in the technology it's not the technology
is gonna solve the problem it's the thinking that you're
gonna have to put into it to use the technology
as a tool to get you to some sort of
end so you what you have to do is you
have to you have to make the bridge between the
technology that you're buying and what you want it to
accomplish for you and then of course you have to
make that connection there so let's give a couple of
examples you know there's been a lot of times where
I've bought technology and I thought that I would be
happier because of it and I didn't get any happier
in fact I was very let down by it and
usually that happens because you just buy a gadget and
you think that just because it's sitting there on your
shelf or on your desk that it's gonna be doing
some work for you and that tends not to be
the case unless you go out there and you deliberately
think about this so let me give you an example
one purchase that really surprised me that I made a
few years back was that I bought a notebook so
I just bought a macbook air laptop and before that
I didn't really have any mobile computing I was just
my cell phone but I was doing all my computing
just on a desktop and that notebook behind that notebook
had made a huge change in my personal development because
the reason I actually bought it I didn't just buy
a notebook I bought it because I wanted to journal
and I wanted to have an extensive journal really a
commonplace book and I talked about commonplace books in the
blueprint and other videos you could find it there but
I wanted to really have one repository where I can
be putting all my ideas together because what was happening
up until that point my life is that I would
always be having ideas I'm pretty creative kind of person
so I'm always thinking about stuff analyzing having ideas having
ideas for business having ideas from what I want to
be doing with my life etc and just things that
I'm running across in books and seminars and people and
what I wanted to do was start to compile them
together actually what I was doing was that I had
just reams of paper just plain white paper like printer
paper that I was using to take notes on and
I ended up having stacks of this stuff I would
would accumulate over over the years and the months and
I just have stacks of these notes notes that I
take on books ideas that I have and what happened
was that it got so big it was just impossible
to file it it was impossible to to review it
it was just very cumbersome and clunky and therefore I
felt like I needed more organization to this whole process
and so I thought that it would be nice would
be to have this on something small and portable that
I could carry around with me and that I could
conveniently use when I'm sitting on my couch and see
this is what I mean is this was a specific
problem that I had because I was lazy and I
didn't want to sit in front of a computer like
a desktop at my desk at my chair because I
would already spend 810 hours a day working at my
desktop and I didn't want to then go back in
Journal and do my note-taking and all that also on
the desktop it was just bad for my posture I
didn't want to sit at my computer that long I
had eye strain and I wanted to be able to
be in other rooms I wanted to be able to
transport this thing so for me that was a specific
problem and I remember at that point I was wondering
is buying this laptop this notebook and this MacBook Air
was fairly expensive it was like 1,300 bucks was it
really going to lead to personal growth for me or
was that just a justification to get me to buy
a new gadget because we all like to buy new
gadgets new things and then we buy them and then
we forget about them and they just collect dust I
didn't want that to be happening especially with a $1300
purchase because I tend to be pretty frugal I want
to use my money effectively what end up happening though
was that in this case it turned out really well
and I was so surprised by how much growth I
got out of this because what I did is that
I transcribed all of my notes through a long process
from paper into my notebook and then from now on
from then on I spent the next few years really
organizing all my thoughts on all my ideas and creating
a really robust commonplace book and also journal that I
was able to use for all sorts of things from
business to my personal life to relationships just compiling all
that together and having a way to organize it for
me in a notebook was huge and I'm still using
it to this day and it's still one of my
most powerful tools right now and this is one of
the examples Evan Pegg and I kind of stole this
idea from him is he talks about using the with
the limited willpower that you get every day putting it
to use to create external circumstances in your life that
will create the necessary enforcement that is going to get
you trained and doing the things that you need to
be doing because you do have limited willpower and your
willpower runs out as the day progresses and what tends
to happen is that most people waste that willpower in
putting it into the wrong places they worry about a
relationship they worry about some petty problem that they have
they get mad at someone they bicker with someone or
they wasted watching TV instead what you want to be
doing is you want to be doing these kinds of
things where for example you're thinking about okay what do
I need oh I need a journal and if I
can get a laptop for example that's going to be
convenient for me to sit there and use on the
couch then my brain is gonna want to actually do
that whereas right now my brain doesn't want to be
sitting on a desktop for an extra two hours after
I've already been sitting there for 10 hours which would
make 12 hours it's too tiring I'm not going to
do it so you kind of have to find these
ways of making life a little easier for you and
that's not where I think technology can be great is
that it can be used very strategically to create to
create these kind of downhill slopes for yourself where you're
not bad constantly having to battle uphill to to improve
your life a couple of other examples that I'll just
throw out here just to give you a little bit
of a bigger list I think for example if you're
going to the gym and you're starting a new gym
routine and you're finding going to the gym boring and
you're finding it painful then for example getting an iPod
and putting a bunch of your favorite songs on it
would be a really great way to use technology to
get yourself to do something that is challenging at first
building a gym routine and even if you're a veteran
gym goer sometimes one of the problems you get as
a veteran is that you just get so bored because
you're always doing the same things even if you're varying
your routine up it can still get boring and tiring
and so having something on your on your iPod there
that you can play is really nice or if you're
using a smartphone that can also work but there's two
components to it it's one is having the device the
second component is really having the the music or maybe
you prefer audio programs maybe you prefer some sort of
meditation track maybe you prefer some sort of nature sounds
whatever works for you so figuring out what that is
and then actually putting it in place if you don't
have it that can make your life of the gym
much easier so I think that's another great use of
technology there a couple of other uses that I found
in my own life just and these can be very
simple things these don't have to be expensive purchases for
example for me I had a problem that I started
taking a lot of supplements I got into into taking
supplements and then if you've ever gone down that route
what happens is you start with just taking three supplements
then it goes to five supplements 10 supplements 20 supplements
right now I'm taking over 50 supplements every day so
like fifty pills and what happened with me there is
that it got too tedious literally to go to the
to the medicine cabinet and pull out fifty bottles and
get each one unscrew it take out a pill swallow
it it was just too tedious that would take like
20 minutes to do every day and I didn't want
to do that so I found I found myself not
sticking with my habits and my goals of taking search
supplements every day and so I was struggling that for
a long time until I discovered the very simple solution
which I should have really discovered much sooner of using
a pill box basically it's just like a plastic box
with seven slots in it one slot for each day
of the week where what you can do is once
a week instead of doing this every day once a
week I'll pull out all my my supplement bottles and
I'll sort all the pills put them into into their
individual compartments and then I'll have that for the whole
week and then it's really easy I just go into
my bathroom grab the pill box open one compartment and
then swallow all the pills that takes me one minute
instead of 20 so much simpler and that has really
made it very easy for me to be taking my
supplements and so now I take them fairly regularly without
a lot of problems and that pill box ended up
costing me what seven bucks something like that I ordered
it on Amazon actually interesting point with this piece of
technology is that the first time what I did is
I bought a small pill box and that was working
for me fine until it end up happening was that
literally I had more supplements that I could cram into
the slots that were there because it was it was
kind of small and what that did is that prevented
me from buying more supplements because I said well I
have like about ten supplements now and I just can't
stuff any more into these boxes into these little slots
and again it was kind of stupid on my part
because it was pretty obvious what the solution should have
been the solution should have been get a bigger box
but at that point I didn't really know that I
could get a better bigger box or that bigger boxes
existed and so it really took me months of struggle
again which kind of halted my growth with supplements is
that I was stuck there at like ten pills even
though I wanted to buy or because my box was
limiting me and so what happened was that again a
couple of months passed and I was slipping up I
wasn't as excited about researching supplements because I was already
I felt like I was maxed out and then only
a few months later did I realize after some introspection
that there's probably a bigger box out there somewhere and
it took me time to go find it because I
really needed a big one and I'm going on Amazon
researching it finding a really huge one that's like a
foot long and it can fit literally like a hundred
different pills in it in each little compartment and so
now I bought that one and for me now that's
giving me room to grow now I ballooned from ten
supplement pills a day to like fifty and I feel
I still have room to grow there so that right
there that those multiple purchases and kind of upgrading the
pill box was huge for me that really advanced me
even though those were really small purchases so the point
with this example being that you don't need to go
some outlandish route and go buy something really really fancy
or expensive to get a lot of a lot of
a lot of growth from this tool because even a
very simple tool can empower you it might be something
as simple as going out there and right right now
if you don't have a nice diary that you can
journal in and if you are the type of person
that likes the feel of a nice diary and you
like the look of a nice like leather-bound high-quality diary
then maybe what you got to do is you got
to go out and learn John one you know if
it costs fifty bucks to buy a really nice diary
so what if that's if that's what it's gonna take
to actually get you to sit down and write in
it just because you like the way it feels then
that's what it takes you know and sometimes you have
to indulge yourself a little bit because it's kind of
like bribing yourself you know it's kind of like giving
yourself a little carrot a little incentive to be doing
the hard work that you're gonna be doing by writing
this diary all this time and if you just have
a couple of loose sheets of paper you're probably not
going to be as excited and motivated to sit down
a journal everyday as you would be if you had
a really nice spiral down diary or maybe for you
you don't like writing you don't like writing with you
don't like handwriting you filled that that's archaic so maybe
for you it is that notebook or an iPad or
whatever it is putting it in a digital format right
and then of course finding the right software that makes
you feel good about using it so that can be
also an important kind of Avenue where you can go
down with with a technology route so I think those
are some good examples I could probably throw out a
bunch of other ones one one other one that actually
I will throw out there that I've been doing recently
is that I wanted to I felt like I could
better use my my time in the shower and my
my morning ritual when I'm going to the bathroom and
shaving and showering and doing all that stuff is I
felt like I could use that time for some personal
development and so what I thought I would do is
I would listen to some audio tapes seminars various programs
that I have and I was thinking about how do
I actually do that in the shower so that it's
convenient and practical and what I ended up figuring out
was that I can get one of those they sell
these little like docking stations I got a Phillips one
but they have like Bose little docking stations and you
can slide your iPod in there or you can slide
your iPhone into it and what I did is that
ona Pamela I iPod Touch that I slide in there
and this thing can run on batteries so I can
take it into the bathroom and it'll run on batteries
for a long time and I know pain like a
hundred bucks for this thing but it was really well
worth it because now I can take this little basic
it's like a little boombox I could take it into
the bathroom and if I'm showering and doing my morning
routine for 30 minutes that's 30 minutes of of listening
to seminars or audios that I can get you know
into my into my day and actually I found that
when I do that every single day it kind of
gets me charged up for the day because I'm listening
to this amazing to these amazing ideas this wisdom that's
coming from some seminar or some audio tape that I
have and then when I get out of the shower
all of a sudden I've already got ideas in my
mind about stuff that I want to be doing articles
I want to be writing videos I want to be
shooting I'm just put into like a higher consciousness state
just because I do that and to me that's really
valuable that's something that I like really forward to now
that's a really nice habit to have built in and
it's just enabled by making a simple hundred dollar purchase
so what I want to basically end on here is
the point that I want you to do this exercise
sit down after this video is over sit down pull
out a piece of paper or your journal and I
want you to write down and think about five different
ways right now that you can use some piece of
technology to really advance your own development so whatever that
is for you maybe it's getting a Kindle because you
don't like having a bookshelf full of books maybe it's
getting an iPad because you like sitting on the couch
and being able to browse Wikipedia articles there or maybe
it's about you know getting a journal a diary something
that you can do in the bathroom maybe a magazine
subscription you could buy you know what can you do
how can you use your resources to kind of automatically
put personal growth into your life I want you to
jot down five different ways really think about it and
make sure that it works for you make sure that
it's practical a lot of times I find that I
need to test this stuff out sometimes I think that
a little gadget that I'll buy or an expensive get
piece of gadget that I'll buy will do the trick
and I end up finding that it's not practical and
doesn't really work so I tend to find that you
know save those receipts make sure that you buy it
you test it out and that it actually ends up
doing what you want it to be doing right so
if you buy something for your shower make sure that
it's actually working for you and that it's convenient you
can use it and the batteries run and all that
stuff and if you're buying a journal make sure that
your journal or your diary you like the feel of
it and that it's bound nicely and that you can
actually write in it and it doesn't smudge or whatever
the practical considerations are for you so go ahead and
do this exercise find those five things those five gadgets
are pieces of technology that you could use to improve
your life and then go out there and start with
one pick the the most the one that you think
is going to be the biggest bang for your buck
and go out there and buy it and try to
implement it and just see how much you can get
from that I think that's a good way to prove
to yourself this process works then once you do it
and you have a success with one piece of technology
then you'll be able to find more you'll be able
to spot those opportunities and you'll be on the lookout
for those you'll have four more that are on this
list but then you'll also then have this habit for
the rest of your life is you're always going to
be on the lookout maybe you're going to be walking
through the Walmart or a Best Buy or you're gonna
be browsing on the internet and you're gonna see something
there that might help you with your personal growth and
your brain is gonna make the connection that oh I
can use that to get this I can use that
to make my life a little bit easier so that
I'm more likely to get this thing done that I've
been struggling to get done and the other way around
is that if you're having a problem in your life
and you keep struggling with something and you keep falling
off track you keep falling off track and you keep
struggling to make a habit then you can always ask
yourself kind of like what kind of technology might make
my ease that burden for me and you can kind
of think that way and then you can go online
and you can search for and see if something like
that exists all right so that's it go ahead and
do this exercise I think you'll get a lot of
benefit out of it I know I certainly have gotten
a lot of benefit over the last few years from
using technology for my personal development you
