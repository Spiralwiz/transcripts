hey this is Leo for actualised org and I want
to talk about your greatest demon and by extension also
my greatest demon as an example that we can generalize
here across many different cases so what do I mean
I think every one of us has at least one
major demon that we're dealing with something that keeps plaguing
us something that keeps haunting us from the past what
is that for me for me what it was is
reconciling business and the concerns of business and trying to
make a profit with business and reconciling that with upholding
higher value such as creativity or beauty and trying to
get those two to reconcile because when I got into
my first career which was game design there was this
this big tension at least in my mind between the
fact that on the one hand I see these beautiful
projects that I could be working on and creating if
only I had the capital to do it if only
I had the autonomy to create a freedom to go
out there and do it if I only had the
power so for me I always felt like it was
a real shame that there's this beauty out there that
could be created but the means to create it you
have to go and really dig around the muck to
get the beauty out of it because you have to
go in and deal with real-life business matters you have
to deal with money problems scheduling problems hiring people firing
people all that stuff that you don't want to deal
with if you're a creative artist you just want to
focus on like the beauty of your craft well you
have to do it because you can't create the beauty
unless you've got the funding for it especially with games
that's not something you can really do individually it's something
that you do in a large team environment so you
need to to really get the capital down and get
the business side down in the marketing side down and
a lot of times what happens is in that process
the business side of the marketing side and the money
actually takes over and it's like the the value of
beauty that you were after in the first place it
gets sacrificed and where it should be the highest value
and the money and the business and the marketing should
be serving that like propping it up what happens is
that there's an inversion and you get the business and
you get the money and the beauty is like it's
somewhere down below like you lose you lose sight of
the excellence of the product that you're trying to create
because it's all focused on cutting corners to make more
money or it's about the profitability of the company or
how that project fits into the larger schedule that for
example a publicly traded company has because they're not publishing
one game they're publishing hundreds of games so they need
to make sure that that one game fits into their
overall scheme of producing a certain return for the stockholder
or whatever other objectives they may have and so for
me that was always like oh that was like a
dagger in my heart when I saw the business side
overtaking the artistic side like that was literally dagger in
my heart and that's why I quit the industry is
because I didn't want to be a part of that
to me that was just totally out of integrity for
me and I think that actually that's a big problem
in a lot of creative businesses is that you can
get this inversion going and that you need to really
put in a lot of a lot of emotional labor
and willpower to make sure to stay vigilant and make
sure that that that that inversion doesn't take place so
for me that was one of my biggest demons and
what I did at that time is I kind of
I said you know what I'm gonna quit I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna put up with this and so
I went off and I did my own thing with
internet marketing and there I didn't have the problem I
kind of skirted the problem because with internet marketing either
what I saw no Beauty and I saw no creativity
in it for me it was just a means to
make money and so okay that was that but the
problem was that I really kind of ran away from
from the problem I didn't really fix the problem because
the problem in large part stays in your mind it's
a mental ship that you have to make right these
demons that we have they're internal demons and as I'm
talking about this you might be saying well how does
this apply to me well first of all if you're
creative have a person I'm sure you can find a
direct correlation between what I'm talking about and the problems
that you face at work and with your clients with
your business whatever but also this applies to other demons
that you might have whether you have demons about your
health or you have some demon from the past about
not being able to to get the kind of relationship
that you want being unlovable or whatever that might be
or maybe some kind of demon that you have about
about how how you're using money how you're hoarding money
or how you're spending it too too liberally or maybe
a demon about about family or something in the past
from your from your family life and how that maybe
is impacting your family now how you're raising your kids
whatever that might be the point here being is that
sometimes we get these choices where we can run away
from our demons and we can kind of ignore them
where we can sweep them under the drug and you
know I'm not gonna say that you should never do
that sometimes you have to do that because you are
not strong enough to face that demon and sometimes your
mind and your body recognize that that you're just not
strong enough to face it and then you have to
go away and you have to build up your strength
go into training mode train yourself up and then come
back and face it you know Joseph Campbell and is
a hero with a thousand faces he talks about the
hero's journey and that's really what each one of us
is going through is this hero's journey and on this
hero's journey the hero has some ideal that he's fighting
for but he's faced with obstacles and Joseph Campbell's calls
them threshold Guardians and these are the things that you
run up against that are really like serious roadblocks and
make you seriously doubt whether you're going to be able
to go through on on whatever it is that you
were trying to try to achieve and so that roadblock
that threshold guardian can take the shape of many different
things it could be lack of finances running out of
money when you're starting a business or it could be
that that killer craving for chocolate that you get or
ice cream when you're on on like a 30-day diet
and you're trying to maintain a clean diet for 30
days and then on that last day you get that
big craving and you can't resist and you succumb to
it right that's a threshold Guardian that's keeping you from
from achieving your weight goal or maybe you've got some
sort of Guardian threshold Guardian with with people maybe there's
a person in your life that's holding you back or
maybe there's someone in your life telling you that you
can't if your parents told you that you can't do
that you can't do this you're not capable you're not
going to be smart enough you don't have the skills
you're too crazy it's too risky so maybe there's someone
just feeding you with disempowering beliefs and different disempowering thoughts
and so you have to somehow counter counteract a circumvent
that in order to get through otherwise you're gonna stay
stuck so we always have these kind of moments and
you know you don't know if you can surmount that
threshold not always will you surmount it sometimes you get
defeated by that Guardian and what you do is you
have to go back kind of lick lick your wounds
rethink your approach train yourself up and then go back
and try it again or maybe there's an alternate path
that you can take that's what I kind of did
is I went on an alternate path but you got
to realize and this is what I just realized today
is that like now is this like this thing is
cropping creeping back up for me because now I'm starting
a new business with this personal development stuff that I'm
doing with actualised org and I'm starting to see again
this tension because now this is something again that I
really care about so I see the beauty in it
and higher-value here is to produce amazing content and just
if I could just like produce amazing content and have
it spread itself like that would be awesome I could
focus all my energy on that and that would be
upholding this like pristine ideal value of beauty and excellence
that I'm going for on the other hand then I
see the nitty-gritty of what has to happen for that
beauty to actually shine through for these videos to go
out there and to become popular and become successful in
to the site to become profitable and sustainable for that
to happen I have to worry about the marketing side
and the business side and lately what I've been doing
is I've been focusing so much on the marketing side
the business side and starting to get the same worries
that I was getting five years ago when I was
getting into game design it's the same problem basically creeping
back up because I never really dealt with it in
the first place I just kind of changed directions so
now I'm running up against it here because now it's
like well if I'm putting all my time into the
marketing that in the business I might have to cut
corners and sacrificing the quality of what I'm producing I
don't want to do that that would be an inversion
of what I'm going after on the other hand I
can't just be focusing only on on the beauty of
the quality of the product because you can create an
amazing product and nobody is going to know about it
and I don't want that to happen I've been down
down that road before the past various projects so I
recognize the importance of the marketing it's making that thing
balance out that's tricky and I'm starting to realize this
is something I still have to work through internally because
no matter where I'm gonna go even if I quit
this endeavor and I go do something else I can
see that because I do have this value of upholding
beauty and excellence and producing really high quality material it's
always gonna be a problem no matter where I go
no matter what business or career I'm in there's always
gonna be problems and then the kind of nitty-gritty get
your hands in the mud aspects of business and marketing
that I'm have to deal with there's gonna be money
issues I have to deal with there's gonna be maybe
hiring issues partnering up with other people and getting relationships
into place all of that and I need to figure
that out for myself so that's something I'm still working
on that's one of my biggest demons so in conclusion
what I want for you is to take this example
and say what can I draw from this and what
is your biggest demon right now think about that and
think about where you've been avoiding it and sometimes it's
okay to avoid it but you don't want to avoid
it for too long or you don't want to turn
away from it too many times you have to avoid
strategically if there's a strategic reason for you to avoid
something right now then that's fine but I don't want
you to use that as an excuse and to just
like settle into your comfort zone now and say that
you're never going to come back to it because chances
are that this thing is gonna come back and it's
gonna bite you in the ass again and again and
again and if you think that just because right now
you can stick your hand head in the sand like
an ostrich that you can do that for the rest
of your life no you're not gonna be able to
do that at least you're not gonna be able to
do that and stay fulfilled at any kind of reasonable
level you're not going to be happy because you're going
to know that you're out of integrity with what you
want to pursue I think this is one of the
challenges of living to your full potential and living a
really charged kind of life is that you have to
tackle these obstacles sometimes they're really big and they require
real mental shifts real changes to your mental reality model
of the world because you have a mental model of
how you think the world works how things should be
how your values are and that that thing is gonna
have to change you're gonna literally have to evolve into
a new you your ego is gonna have to take
some bruises to get you to that next level and
I don't want you to be putting that off too
long because sometimes you tend to put it off and
then you sweep it under the rug for too long
it becomes really difficult you procrastinate on it and you'd
lose years of your life not living the kind of
life that you want not getting the kind of results
that you want right and you're really kidding yourself if
you think they're gonna have a happy life if you're
going to just forget about that if you're just going
to brush it under the rug it's not gonna happen
it's not it's gonna happen is it you're gonna keep
keeping your head against the wall again and again and
again and again maybe let's say let's say it didn't
figure this problem out with with the business and the
beauty thing if I didn't figure that out right now
then I would probably really hurt my business and then
eventually maybe I would quit the business and then maybe
a few years later I would have to like start
a new business or go work for somebody else or
do whatever to to make money and eventually I would
run into that same problem again and so I would
have wasted a couple of years killed a good project
by avoiding that and that would be me kidding myself
because right now it's kind of easy to say I
you know I can just like put that off I
don't need to deal with it but no I have
to deal with it to move on to the next
level for me so I want you to figure out
what is it that you need to deal with that
can get you to the next level for you and
get really serious with yourself see yourself I want you
to picture this like fast-forward 10 20 years and picture
yourself hitting your head against that wall again and again
and again I guess is this problem you're doing it
because you didn't fix it and so stack up all
the pain that you're gonna get from that and all
the potential that you're sacrificing and leaving on the table
over the course of the next 10 20 years and
weigh that against the pain of dealing with this problem
right now right the pain of 10 to 20 years
is gonna be much larger when you add it all
up than just nipping this thing in the butt right
now so deal with it now if you can if
you're in this position of strength and you're feeling relatively
comfortable right now go ahead and do it fix it
so that it doesn't keep haunting you and then you're
advancing to the next level and then you're gonna feel
amazing you're gonna be giving your gifts are gonna be
sharing what you what your potential is and then you're
probably gonna have some other demon that's gonna crop up
after that but don't worry about that now focus on
slang one demon one threshold guardian at a time all
