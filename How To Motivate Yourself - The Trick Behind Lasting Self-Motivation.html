hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I'm going to tell you how to
motivate yourself okay welcome back so let's crack into this
topic of motivation and I have a lot of videos
about motivation so I'm going to cover different aspects here
I've got a video already that talks about the distinction
between intrinsic extrinsic motivation in this video I really want
to come at this from the angle of how to
motivate you how do you get to motivate your self
more so it's one thing to watch a motivational video
it's also another thing for somebody to be kicking you
in the ass like your boss or your your parents
or even me giving you instructions or giving you drive
basically but it's a totally different thing to be self-reliant
and to be generating this motivation within yourself so let's
talk a little bit about what is involved there so
let's right at the beginning create this distinction between really
two levels on which you might want motivation so you
might be watching this video right now and you might
be looking to motivate yourself to do what I would
consider a chore or some sort of like side activity
in your life so what might that be that might
be maybe you have trouble going to the gym so
you want to motivate yourself to do that you have
trouble with your diet so you want to get more
more on track with the diet goals that you have
maybe you have trouble starting that that that report that
you need to do maybe you have trouble getting yourself
motivated to do the taxes or do some sort of
chore around the house or some chore for your business
whatever so those kinds of things there's that kind of
lack of motivation and then I would say there's a
much deeper lack of motivation this is a much deeper
problem is the problem of lack of direction in your
life when you feel like your whole life is just
slow your whole life doesn't really have much energy or
zest behind it feels passionless feels like it's really not
going anywhere you feel like you're just kind of in
the doldrums you're like a ship that is in the
middle of the ocean with no wind around it's just
dead quiet and you're not going anywhere sail ship with
no wind around you're not going anywhere so that's a
lack of direction so these two are connected so we
can't just draw a clear-cut line and say that certain
activities are just chores and other activities are related to
the direction of your life all of it is your
life so in some sense this distinction is tenuous and
arbitrary but I think you can serve some some use
so we'll make the distinction but the point that I
want to make to you right now is that if
you're actually having problems get them getting motivated to do
things in your life like maybe you're having trouble getting
to work on time maybe you're starting to notice that
you're just not putting in as much effort into the
work that you used to maybe you're starting to notice
that your gym routine you're just falling off track there
or your diet you just can't get yourself engaged to
to get your diet cleaned up this might actually be
a sign that you have a larger problem and the
larger problem here is that you might be doing a
bunch of little things that you think are important that
you think are necessary that you think you could not
live without and you don't even imagine what your life
would be like if you stopped doing them but you
think they're so important and in fact they're not so
what this is is this is a misalignment with your
really your authentic self so your authentic self wants one
thing and you're let's say conditioned self you're socially conditioned
self or maybe even your lower self your subconscious mind
or just the routines that you've been running on they
are pointing you another direction so very obvious example of
this is maybe you have a dream of becoming an
artist or maybe a musician and that's something that you're
really passionate about and you do this on the side
so maybe you play a little bit of guitar or
compose some music let's say on the side and then
you have a nine-to-five job your real job that you
do now if you're starting to lack motivation at your
9 to 5 job but what your real passion is
is the music stuff then you can see what's really
going on here the solution for you is not to
receive a tip from me for how to get more
engaged with your shitty unengaging nine-to-five job the ultimate solution
there I hope you can see this is that you
got to take a look at what you're really passionate
about the problem is that your passion about music that's
what you really want to be doing so when you're
at your 95 job you're so eager to get home
and play around with your music and do some composition
there maybe interact with your little fan base that you've
got going on online or whatever that that's what you're
really excited about and the rest of your day and
everything else that you're doing is is just a distraction
from what you really should be doing which is your
music composition but your life is so inverted it's so
up that the thing that is your passion that that
is supposed to be your motivator in life is it's
like very deep beneath the surface and really what you've
got is you've got a bunch of activities that you're
doing that you think are important that you think are
holding your life together but are really not important and
this will be a big transition for you is when
you can make the shift and finally realize and then
start to actually realign your life so that the thing
that's on the bottom becomes the thing on the top
and the stuff that's on the on the top right
now maybe just completely dissolves or gets reprioritized to the
very bottom so I want to get that out of
the way so this is a much deeper topic that
we'll go into this is really finding your life purpose
how to get on track with it such as such
a deep topic I'm not going to cover that here
but I just wanted to say that because it's important
that if you're struggling with motivation those can be very
powerful signs from your highest self and your science self
your highest self can be a very subtle influence in
your life it can be a very quiet mellow kind
of voice very subtle very subtle what your highest self
does your highest stuff will tell you little whispers in
your ear hear a little whisper in your there will
tell you what you should be doing but that can
very easily get drowned out by the overall noise and
volume of your day-to-day activity so you have to be
conscious of that and I don't want you to be
fixing a deep motivational problem by covering it up with
a little technique that's not what we're about here we're
looking for root solutions root causes and then solving those
permanently not banded bandaging putting bandages over that and just
bandaging it for a little time it's going to come
back to bite you in the ass so let's move
past this point though and really talk about how you
need to motivate yourself what it takes to motivate yourself
so to motivate yourself you really need to have a
big goal vision I talk about vision in many other
videos I've got videos where I share my own vision
I tell you more about vision but here I'm just
going to say you need this is when I say
vision I mean literally you need a picture in your
mind of what you want you have to want something
by definition that's what motivation is it's a drive towards
something it's an impulse it's motive motive meaning motion to
get into motion you need to be moving towards a
point towards a destination you don't just get in your
car and just drive around aimlessly you go somewhere you
have a target in mind well the same thing with
your life and the same thing with every sub-domain of
your life so if we're talking about motivation for example
for losing weight or getting into shape well you need
to have a picture of that a picture it needs
to be vivid and I know what a lot of
you do because I used to do this myself and
I still do this to some degree but we really
discount that we discount the value of the picture and
we just say ah you know I I just I
just want to be fit but that's a very vague
image of what you really want and it's also probably
not very ambitious not very compelling so your picture needs
to be vivid your picture needs to be specific your
picture needs to be ambitious if it's amber you're gonna
you're like you're going to feel like wow if I
accomplished that like that would be cool that will be
something worth accomplishing for example when I started going to
the gym my my vision for myself was to drop
sixty five pounds that's a that's a really drastic change
my vision for myself was to change my whole relationship
with nutrition my vision for myself was getting into amazing
relationships having amazing sex those were powerful motivators for me
and without those I guarantee you that I could not
have done it I lost 65 pounds at about five
months working really hard towards it but the only reason
I could do that is because I had that picture
I had the end in sight this is really important
so once you've got that whatever it is you're working
on right now if you want you can pause the
video and come up with a with a picture the
best way to do this is to actually get a
piece of paper and write it out write out all
the little details that you imagine yourself having and wanting
and what this will produce for you and you can
even literally start drawing little pictures little diagrams so you
can literally example if you want a six-pack actually go
and draw a little little picture little stick figure picture
of you with the six-pack you won't believe how powerful
just that little technique can be right there so you've
got your vision let's say the next thing I want
you to do is I want you to put this
into the larger context of your life too many times
we come up with a vision and then we don't
really see how it actually effects and ripples through our
whole lives and into the future too so this is
called kind of future projection you project forward so picture
yourself picture yourself being fit picture yourself being able to
eat clean foods without having to guilt yourself picture yourself
never having to worry about what you're eating anymore picture
yourself free of all the negative emotions picture it and
actually try to like live into a little bit feel
it and and imagine to yourself what that will look
like projected one year into the future two years into
the future five years into ten twenty years into the
future what's your life going to look like if you
put this thing into place if you actually realize this
if you work your butt off and you make it
happen and then of course the flip side of that
is to picture what will happen to your life if
you do not take action and you do not pursue
this goal and you do not keep yourself motivated what's
going to happen to your health a year from now
if you do not follow through and clean it up
clean up your diet what's going to happen to your
body five years from now if you don't go to
the gym what's going to happen to your performance at
work what's going to happen to your sex life what's
going to happen to your relationships what's going to happen
to your marriage what's going to happen to your relationship
with your kids when you don't have the energy that
you want to anymore what's going to happen 20 years
from now when all of a sudden you get hit
with some sort of cancer diagnosis or heart disease diabetes
or something else like that project those things and make
them vivid this is kind of a mindfuck that you
run on yourself because you have to go into your
own head and do this work and it's good to
sit down and do this once to get a really
powerful effect going so maybe dedicate 30 minutes 60 minutes
to write out your vision maybe even picture a little
bit draw a little stick figures really think about it
decide what you want get yourself really soaked into that
vision feel it visualize on it it's good to do
that once but I guarantee that's not going to be
enough to really motivate yourself you have to do something
to reconnect with that vision on a continual basis I
guarantee that if you've done visioning exercises with you know
with other books or other self-help gurus that have shown
you this stuff the reason that maybe they haven't really
worked the way that you wanted them to or the
way that it was promised was because of this last
point is that you're not reconnecting with that vision on
an everyday on an everyday basis this is so so
so critical so this is why for example add I
advocate journaling journaling is very powerful to help you do
that I have other videos I talked about journal I
also advocate visualizations and affirmations and meditation so there's lots
of different techniques for you what I want you to
decide right now because Jesus are you already have a
goal maybe even already have a vision of what you
want to accomplish what you want to motivate yourself towards
and what you have to start doing commit 4:30 for
the next 30 days do the following commit and decide
right now what activity or habit you're going to put
in place it's going to reconnect you with that vision
what's it going to be is it going to be
looking at that vision document every morning for five minutes
that can be effective maybe it's that is it going
to be thinking about it in the shower but you
have to make sure that you are actually are thinking
about in the shower so I have some sort of
reminder there in this when you're in the shower that
you're going to be thinking about it while you're showering
or is it going to be talking with somebody maybe
you have a buddy or a friend who's also into
doing what you're doing maybe a gym partner a business
partner and you will commit to spend maybe just five
or ten minutes every day talking to that person about
what you're trying to accomplish maybe it's going to be
your mom maybe it's going to be your dad maybe
it's going to be your your brother your sister or
your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or whomever
but you have to you have to be specific here
so sit down identify what is going to be that
thing that is connecting you back to that vision again
and again and again I'll give you a really quick
example for example for me when I was really hitting
it hard at the gym even after I lost all
my white then I started doing weightlifting and just for
bodybuilding purposes and I wanted to get a six-pack and
I just wanted to put on some nice muscle mass
and what I was doing there what really got me
motivated I had the original vision like I said but
then this was so powerful but so simple to is
I just started flexing in front of the mirror every
memory every day before I went to the gym I
would literally take off my shirt this sounds vain but
this is this works this is what you have to
do so this is why I'm actually sharing this example
and it's good is that it sounds silly and vain
but this is important literally take off your shirt and
you flex in front of the mirror before you go
to the gym and then you come back from the
gym after you're you're done with your your extra sizes
and you flex again and you look you look at
yourself you see where is the muscle growing like for
me that was really that was powerful because a couple
of weeks would pass and I would see like bigger
biceps bigger chest and I'd be like yeah that's that's
yeah that's motivating right so this is what it takes
and this is just an example with physical body so
if your bodybuilder you should be doing this if you're
not doing this you're missing out on so much potential
motivation now but think about the equivalent of that to
your business think about the equivalent of that to improving
your relationship think about the equivalent of that to anything
else that you want to get motivated on that's what
you got to do is you literally have to do
this flexing exercise a lot of times when I'm shooting
these videos and I'm putting up on line and I'm
creating my business I'll just take time at the end
of the day to kind of sit back and just
kind of soak it in soak in the work that
I did to me that's motivating that's inspiring that's like
oh damn yeah I really like what I did right
there that was cool it it's me reconnecting to my
vision and it it triggers me to think about okay
okay so I got this piece into place what's the
next piece right what's the next piece and that's what
that's what visioning is about it's an ongoing process so
this is really the core of how to get yourself
motivated if you actually take action on this I guarantee
you're gonna have some really big improvements and your motivation
levels all right so this is Leo I ought to
