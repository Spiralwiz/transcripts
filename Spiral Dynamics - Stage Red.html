[Music] welcome to spiral dynamics stage red this is a
continuation of my multi-part series on the psychological developmental model
known as spiral dynamics i'm not going to introduce that
whole model here we're just going to jump right into
stage red i've already covered stages blue orange green yellow
and even turquoise and so we're sort of moving backwards
here down the spiral and we have a lot of
material to cover so let's get started i want to
make sure i give credit here to some important people
who develop spiral dynamics this model it's an amazing model
and they did some amazing work here they really devoted
their lives to to flushing out this model and making
it popular so credits go to claire graves who was
the original developer of the the value system underneath the
model and then don beck and christopher cohen for popularizing
it and fleshing it out and giving it the label
spiral dynamics i also want to give credit to a
website called spiral dynamics integral dot nl from which i
pulled some information here that i'll be quoting directly and
i also pulled a lot of material from the spiral
dynamics book written by don beck and by christopher cohen
sometimes i just rip out entire phrases or words or
sentences from that book and i'll be uh quoting a
lot of that stuff here so by no means that
i make all of this up myself so the way
that sproul dynamics works just to refresh your memory a
little bit uh and i'm going to show you here
uh a chart of of this broad dynamic basis model
basically what it is is it's a series of stages
that humans evolve through both individually and collectively as society
our culture evolves through these stages it goes from beige
to purple to red which we'll be talking about now
then to blue orange green yellow and turquoise so now
we're starting to talk about the the lower stages this
episode is going to be on red i'm going to
have a follow-up episode soon on purple i'm not going
to talk about beige but red is an interesting it's
an interesting stage because it's one of those stages which
is active in many parts of the world in third
world countries in developing countries that most of us in
advanced western democracies and in the first world aren't too
familiar with so we can easily get tricked by stage
red because we don't see a lot of it in
our everyday lives even though there's still plenty of it
present in america in europe and other advanced developed countries
so we have to be careful because we can get
tricked by red and and red can be a very
very dangerous and problematic stage as you'll start to see
here so again just to give you the big picture
of what is spirodynamics really modeling or explaining it's explaining
the evolution of the human psyche it's explaining human value
systems as they relate to the environment the social environment
that we find ourselves in having to survive in as
humans so what's unique about humans is that unlike other
animals which just live in some static environment like you
know a monkey is living in a rainforest somewhere or
a zebra is living on the savannah or a bear
is living in the woods their environment has stayed the
same for hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of years
and those animals haven't changed like crocodiles for example have
existed for for tens of millions of years and even
longer basically since the age of the dinosaurs and they
haven't changed very much because their environments are basically the
same and so it works for them but for humans
what's unique about us as a as a social species
that we have a symbolic system which we can use
you know writing talking ideas philosophy culture uh education books
entertainment media art all of this all of these cultural
artifacts that we have so we are literally transforming our
own environment because we're constructing cities and societies we're not
only engineering the physical environment by building roads and bridges
and you know clearing forests and things like this but
more importantly we're building a sort of a culture a
sort of a software environment not just the hardware of
the enviro software in many respects the software is even
more important than the hardware for us humans and so
as it turns out societies evolve through these stages in
a particular specific order you can't just jump over a
stage every society basically evolves up the spiral stages in
a particular order and that's very useful to know because
you can then predict what the next stage is and
help people to navigate the various traps and problems of
each stage see so these are like cultural soft pieces
of software that that are programmed into our minds as
part of being civilized animals which is what we are
now unfortunately red is not that civilized as we'll see
here so uh you can see the spirodynamics chart you
can see the different stages basically what's happening is that
the higher you go up the spiral your circle of
concern for others expands your sense of ego becomes more
diffuse and it also expands the lower the stages the
more contracted the ego the more selfish the person is
and generally all of the problems that come with ego
become more pronounced at the lower stages and at the
lower stages you have lower levels of consciousness basically at
the very lowest stages it's more like humans behaving like
animals and then at the higher stages these are more
civilized humans more developed humans uh who have more compassion
and a larger sense of concern a deeper broader morality
and they behave in more humane ways more like like
saints than animals so what is the essence of stage
red it's this we could call it egocentric and domini
domineering it's power hungry it's a mode of survival which
is very animalistic in the sense that in the animal
kingdom might makes right if you can physically attack somebody
or you can chase them down and eat them bite
them scratch them trick them exploit them then you do
it as an animal that's just survival of the animal
kingdom and that's very much what survival looks like at
stage red in stage red societies it's very exploitative this
stage is individualistic if you remember spiral dynamic stages they
oscillate and swing back and forth like a pendulum between
individual stages and collectivist stages so stage red is individualist
then it's going to swing to stage blue which is
going to be collectivist then back to stage orange which
is individuals to get in so it oscillates this way
so uh what this means is that stage red is
about taking charge without taking into account the suffering of
others it's very very egocentric that's why we call it
egocentric it's all about me and my ability to survive
and reproduce and maybe my immediate circle of friends and
family but even there at stage red you might be
shocked to learn that stage red is so egocentric that
it might even hurt and cause suffering to its uh
to its family members and even to its closest friends
because it's just so self-absorbed stage red views life as
survival in the jungle the strong will win and the
weak will lose they tend to see the world as
a one divided between victims and predators and that there's
no other alternative but to compete and stage red wants
to be the predator not the victim of course it's
pretty natural right i mean if you were forced to
choose between being a victim and a predator wouldn't you
choose to be a predator at least that's how stage
red thinks about it stage red is impulsive and it
looks for immediate gratification of its desires so if it's
horny it's gonna immediately want to have sex damn the
consequences if it's hungry it's gonna throw some lavish banquet
and gorge itself full of you know delicacies and the
the best food that it can without thinking of the
long-term consequences and so on for the way that it
generally approaches life stage red has neither guilt nor concern
for others this can be a little bit difficult for
some of us in developed democracies to appreciate those of
us who have a higher sense of morality those of
us like most of you who watch me are probably
at around stage green maybe high orange low green somewhere
around there maybe a little bit above green so if
you're coming and looking at red from that vantage point
the difficulty with this entire episode is for you to
understand red is going to be difficult because to you
this this seems like uh psychopathy it seems like craziness
it seems like insanity it's gonna seem like red is
uh is just brutal and criminal like how how is
it possible that a a human could have no guilt
or that a human could not care about causing suffering
to its immediate family members or to its friends or
to to others how is that possible well that's because
society has inculcerated you so well because you had the
luxury of standing on the shoulders of giants and growing
up in an advanced society which has been evolving for
hundreds and thousands of years that now you just take
that for granted and you think well humans just always
were compassionate and always were you know capable of guilt
and they always you know treated each other nicely and
so forth no no what you have to understand is
that the software that runs the human mind and all
of human society this software has been upgrading for hundreds
and thousands of years and it's different in different parts
of the world at different times in different eras and
it transforms how you see the world completely it's almost
like we're talking about living in different realities here right
so the challenge for you here as you're listening to
me is that it it might seem like what i'm
talking about here is is exaggerated or that it's hyperbolic
or that it's grotesque and that it's evil many people
would consider stage red evil and yet it's not evil
it's not even bad it just is what survival is
like in certain parts and times in the world and
so what you have to really appreciate about red is
that red is an effective survival strategy given a specific
type of environment so red usually exists in very brutal
environments very underdeveloped parts of the world where there aren't
effective court systems there is not effective and fair police
there is not a democratic government at stage red there
are not human rights there is not even a notion
of morality there is not a notion of of the
ten commandments there's not a notion or a value of
compassion these sorts of things are luxuries when you're living
in a certain type of environment certain parts of the
world which are very underdeveloped which all of the world
was 500 years ago or a thousand years ago or
2 000 years ago right so you have to appreciate
that so one of the things that many stage green
and above people fail to appreciate is that the only
reason you're at stage green is because your society has
developed the infrastructure and the kind of government and culture
thousands of years of cultural evolution have happened to allow
you to stand on the shoulders of giants so that
you live in this nice comfortable society where you can
have the luxury of compassion for others and where you
don't have to worry about somebody stabbing you in the
back as you're walking down the street you don't have
to be worried about being robbed at gunpoint while you're
driving down the highway by some high women you don't
have to worry about pirates because there's police that protect
you but in many parts of the world there isn't
such a thing or if there is police these police
themselves are stage red and they're part of some criminal
mafia and they've been paid off and they're very corrupt
and so unless you're able to pay them off or
you're friends with somebody in the in the police then
they're not going to help you and in fact they
will they will abuse you themselves and exploit you themselves
so we'll get into a lot more of that as
we keep going stage red has this attitude of challenging
death and coming out on top prevailing so it tends
to be very risk tolerant because it has to be
because the environment it grew up in to survive it
had to take some bold and daring risks so when
does stage red emerge on the spiral basically if we
kind of situated historically in the evolution of of human
societies stage purple is the stage that comes before red
and so stage purple is very tribal think of it
as the prototype is basically uh tribes of 100 or
200 people living deep in the amazon jungle which still
exists today that's how humans lived five thousand years ago
or so so there are these tribes and then we
tend to have this kind of myth about these tribes
that these tribes are very peaceful this is sort of
the stage green romanticization of these tribes they're peaceful they
live in harmony with nature and some of that is
true uh but they also tend to be uh warlike
amongst themselves there's a lot of tribal warfare and so
what starts to happen is that as these stage purple
tribes as they start to expand and grow there's more
of them you know at first if we just you
know roll the clock back a hundred thousand years then
these tribes could live more or less peacefully because they
were so isolated from each other and they were the
the environment was so huge there were so few of
these tribes the population of humans was generally so low
there were so many abundant natural resources animals to hunt
but you know buffaloes and and mammoths and all these
sorts of things that you could hunt and eat and
it was all plentiful you could fish and you could
you know pick fruit and all this and so there
wasn't a lot of need for tribal warfare but then
as these tribes grow they start to encroach on one
another and then of course naturally they have to fight
over resources and they have different culture different languages different
ethnicities and so forth and so that you start to
get clashes and fighting now at stage purple this is
a very collectivist stage and basically when you're living in
this tribe there's no sense of individualism the way that
we have today there's no sense of like this libertarian
i'm an individual and i have personal freedoms and rights
this is not how tribal life works in a tribal
culture you're basically living as part of the tribal identity
you're basically part of this tribal hive mind that is
your identity as the tribe it's not about you because
that's what's necessary for a tribe to survive they have
to work together effectively but then with stage red what
starts to happen is that once the tribe becomes successful
and it it becomes stable and you've sort of mastered
cooperating within the tribe that safety of the tribe the
success of the tribe then sort of leads the next
stage which is now the emergence of red now you
start to develop a certain sense of individuality and personal
ambition now you've sort of lived in the tribe then
you realize well okay the tribal life is nice but
then what do i get for myself and now i
want something for me i want to control the tribe
what if i become the chieftain of the tribe what
if i overtake and overthrow the chieftain who's already there
because i'm more powerful then i could get all the
women i could get all the resources i can get
all the money i can get all the weapons and
i have all the power for myself and that would
be great right that's the sort of attitude of red
and uh and also it might not just be purely
selfish like that but there might also be sort of
an altruistic component to it indirectly in the sense that
if i have a tribe here my tribe and the
chieftain of my tribe is not very effective not very
decisive not very strong and we have a neighboring tribe
that's stronger than us who already has a stage red
chieftain who's very powerful and bloodthirsty and domineering the problem
is is that now my tribe is at a serious
survival disadvantage if that tribe overtakes my tribe my entire
tribe will be enslaved or wiped out so in a
sense there's like an arms race where i am compelled
for purposes of just survival i am compelled to rise
and it's in a sense my duty to overthrow this
weak feeble ineffective chieftain and to be strong and to
fight for my people and to rally my tribe together
maybe rally multiple tribes together unify them so that we
can put up a strong front against this other stage
red tribe that will conquer us see so there's this
pressure to you unify squabbling tribes for the greater good
for the survival of the tribe and that's really what
stage red is all about it's just about pure survival
if you're sort of shocked by some of the brutality
and cruelty of red as we'll be talking about going
forward don't be because if red wasn't this brutal given
the environment it has to grow up in it would
probably die or it would be severely victimized and its
family would suffer deeply so in a sense you can
start to empathize with red and start to see why
red has this appeal you know if you're going to
be put into a corner if someone's going to put
a gun to your children's heads and threaten to pull
the trigger you can see how that might spur you
to stop being a victim stop uh being nice take
off the kid gloves and uh and you know go
get your baseball bat sort of thing and so red
red's form of government is going to be a unification
through ruthless domination and that's how red emerges from from
purple here's a list of stage red values i give
this list in every one of my episodes these values
are the core of what defines the spiral dynamics stage
any stage a stage is basically a collection of values
so here's what stage red values personal power strength might
and brute force displays of toughness brazen courage valor heroism
and daring being the boss being number one winning at
all costs conquering one's enemies domination and furthermore it's the
thrill of conquest they actually get off on this there
can be a sort of joy to being strong and
powerful and being able to bully others stage red has
a warrior mentality death is glorified it's not something that
stage red fears very much one of the qualities of
stage red is that it tends to be fearless it
tends to be daring and bold it loves heroic deeds
it loves to challenge death and win it loves competition
it loves to crush its opponents it values resolving disputes
through ruthless force or through intimidation rather than through diplomacy
or any kind of soft means like that so if
you want to think of stage green as the soft
hippie stage stage red is sort of the polar opposite
that is a very hard brutal physical force stage if
you want to think of stage green as having a
lot of compassion and being very centered stage red is
very much sort of groin centered we might say it's
chakra too in this sense uh it's it's very lusty
it's uh it's very primal it's sort of brutal it's
physical it's material stage red values winning victory conquest and
triumph against difficult odds it values ambition and playing it
big it values revenge respect receiving respect loyalty loyalty to
me to the boss decisiveness assertiveness passion action it's a
very action oriented stage it's pragmatic it's direct it's no
nonsense it's about taking initiative and ownership and personal willpower
getting things done and sort of just do it mentality
so sage red is not going to sit around and
think things through very deeply it's just going to say
[ __ ] it let's just do it let's just
do it and deal with the consequences whatever they are
and sometimes the consequences are are very bloody and terrible
and catastrophic and and then red adjust to that it's
a very much sort of a fly by the seat
of your pants uh shoot first ask questions later sort
of mentality stage red values unilateral control and executive power
it values glitz ostentation dis ostentatious displays of grandiosity it
wants to be bigger than life so what i mean
by glitz and oscitation displays of of grandiosity is uh
think of a roman emperor who has conquered some some
barbaric tribe and then they build you know the roman
empire builds this giant uh elaborate very expensive monument that
takes 10 years to build so you know some sort
of obelisk or some sort of giant statue where it
shows the emperor you know with his muscles and a
spear and he's standing on top of the corpse you
know a pile of corpses of his enemies that he's
conquered that sort of display of ostentation and grandiosity and
of course he's depicted as this larger than life hero
with giant muscles the perfect physique and you know big
weapons and it's all covered in gold made out of
solid gold something like that and just imagine imagine the
most grandiose uh sort of uh monument to to conquest
and and you can see this all throughout the you
know the roman empire for example or other ancient civilizations
we see these sorts of sculptures and reliefs and monuments
and of course this will come with myths and stories
that glorify the conquest of of our enemies stage red
values status and recognition of prowess it values machismo pride
and bragging charisma and it tends to be a plain
talker rather than being very intellectual like some of the
higher stages this uh this this stage tends to be
plain spoken and very blunt and direct and brutal tends
to be quite vulgar in its speech it's not very
refined or educated a stage red person probably doesn't have
very much education it values intimidation manipulation and exploitation as
survival and it actually gets off on this it sort
of delights in being able to intimidate or manipulate or
exploit somebody who's weaker than it it values sexual conquest
and exploitation and it tends to use sex not just
for sex or procreation but for for power and vanity
it tends to value sadistic forms of sex sex that
involves torture and domination and exploitation and inflicting suffering it's
about enjoying life to the fullest damn the consequences it
tends to value adventure thrill seeking and living boldly it
values power contests like uh arm wrestling face slapping there's
this interesting trend on youtube i heard about it on
joe rogan um he showed some clips of of the
these guys these russian guys who will do these uh
slapping contests you can you can google it type in
slapping contests something like that and you'll see it basically
it's like usually two giant beefy dudes standing face to
face across from each other in front of a little
table and they just take they basically get one turn
after another just to slap each other across the face
as hard as possible sometimes they will slap each other
so hard that they will knock the other guy out
just from from the sheer force of that slap so
that that's an example of a very sort of uh
stage red sort of mentality and you can see the
people who are there just you can look at their
complexions like the tattoos they have and just the way
they talk and everything you could just tell it's a
very stage red vibe stage red values breaking rules and
finding loopholes it's not very good at following rules or
obeying or being orderly that's something that comes with stage
blue which hasn't emerged yet and it values breaking with
the pack and pushing the envelope so here are some
more characteristics of stage red it strives for self-preservation and
respect it feels very insulted when it doesn't get the
respect that it deserves it enjoys itself to the fullest
without regret or remorse it's free of guilt and shame
it's indifferent to the collateral damage or suffering caused to
others and this is one of those points where this
is one of these points that will be difficult for
for many of you to accept how is it possible
that someone can just go through life and not think
about the suffering that one's actions inflict upon others to
a staged green person this seems like insanity this seems
like a mental disorder but it's not necessarily a mental
disorder in many parts of the world it's just not
a luxury that you have you have to survive no
matter what because in many parts of the world if
you're living in a difficult environment like you're living somewhere
in some very impoverished part of africa or in the
middle east the reality is that if you do care
about the suffering of others too much and you care
about the collateral damage that your actions inflict you're simply
not going to survive your family is not going to
survive so in a sense you're forced into it you
don't really you don't have very much options um another
characteristic of stage reds it tends to be narcissistic and
uh sometimes narcissism in our society is thought of as
this mental disorder but not necessarily is it just a
mental disorder it could just simply be a fact of
a lack of development many people who for example might
immigrate from a third world country into a first world
country they might appear narcissistic because they simply come from
an environment where they had to be extremely selfish and
ego centered in order to survive in order to get
to where they are so it's not necessarily a mental
disorder don't think of stage red as a mental disorder
the reason that is is because if you if there
are societies where stage red is just prevalent and it
makes no sense to say that these people have a
mental disorder because they can evolve out of that if
they do work and if you know society is given
more time to develop and infrastructure is built they grow
out of it so it's not just a mental disorder
another characteristic of red is that it tends to be
impulsive rather than strategic so there's no deep strategy behind
stage reds actions it tends to go by its gut
feel it tends to be intuitive and not so much
analytical or academic it doesn't make very long long-term deep
plans and of course that can get into trouble because
its time horizon is very short it tends to be
very myopic it tends to be very opportunistic and it
tends to just try to do whatever it can do
now in order to survive because that's do you see
how when you're living in a very challenging survival situation
it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of your
energy thinking about what's gonna happen five years or ten
years down the road because you just have to survive
this week that's all you're concerned about in these kinds
of environments now if you're living in a first world
country then you have the luxury to think about what's
going to happen in five years and 10 years you
know to plan out your life because you can predict
life is more stable and predictable in society is not
all chaos and it's not war um but when you're
like living in the mafia for example you don't have
some five-year 10-year plan you're just living for tomorrow you're
just trying to make sure you don't get caught by
the cops tomorrow you're trying to make sure you don't
get hit you know some hit isn't issued on you
next week and as long as you can survive that
then you'll deal with the next problem you know when
it arises but of course the problem with this approach
is that you can get yourself painted into a corner
very easily you can sort of go down and down
a downward negative spiral which then just completely spirals out
of control and it's it's unsustainable and then you just
get killed another characteristic is that red uses power for
personal gratification and enrichment it uses force fear and intimidation
to govern there's no democracy at stage red this is
absolute totalitarianism tyranny authoritarianism strong-arming others there is a glorification
of absolute rules and vengeful gods stage read can believe
in god a lot of stage read dictators and so
forth they actually do believe in god but the gods
they believe in are the sort of gods that are
convenient to their lifestyle so this is a god that
actually encourages war this is a god that encourages celebration
of conquest and things like this so their theirs is
not some peaceful loving god theirs is a god who
respects others who are strong and who conquer their enemies
and then therefore they now they deserve the respect of
god because to them that's what god is god is
this vengeful authoritarian ruler of the universe and of course
they're trying to emulate god in that sense there is
a glorification of war rape genocide and enslavement these things
are not considered to be bad and uh that's that's
a very difficult one for many of us in developed
parts of the world to wrap our minds around you
know like how could someone consider rape to not be
bad how could someone consider enslavement uh you know how
to be a positive how can someone glorify war these
things are horrible but these things are also extremely common
at stage red they're just a way of life that's
how you survive in a stage red society in many
places life is cheap and people are expendable to stay
dread survival is so difficult that people are dying all
the time for example if you're part of the mob
you know many people who your your friends and so
forth and your bosses who have been killed put in
jail and this is just a normal part of your
life you're in a sense you're sort of jaded and
desensitized to it because there's no other way stage societies
are not peaceful societies and the people you hang out
with stage red people you know they're generally violent uh
narcissistic sort of people and so it's all about you
know how do i use somebody else to get myself
ahead relationships tend to be transactional and expendable so stage
green you know puts a lot of effort into actually
cultivating relationships and getting satisfaction value out of just the
relationship itself a relationship for its own sake red doesn't
think this way red doesn't have that luxury a relationship
is something i'm using in order to advance my survival
red tends to be oblivious to other sentient beings with
rights and personal worth red basically treats other humans in
the way that humans treat animals that they eat in
the way that we treat factory farmed cows and pigs
and chickens right how much time do you spend thinking
about the rights and personal worth of a chicken not
very much you just kill it and you eat it
and that's generally the sort of approach that stage red
takes to other humans now of course if you're a
stage green you say no leo but i'm a vegan
and i care so much about animal rights and the
worth of animals and they're they are sentient beings well
good good for you you've evolved to a certain level
of consciousness but don't expect others to be at that
same level and you have to understand that that what
you're doing is not some you know it's not some
absolute truth that that's that that's part of your value
system that's part of something that you're constructing is you're
constructing this sort of idea that that sentient beings have
value and personal worth that we need to respect life
this is a this is a relative value system there's
no reason that you need to respect life it's just
a i mean it's nice if you do it creates
a nicer society it's easier to live that way but
but but don't go thinking that there's there's some sort
of absolute truth behind that there's not it's relative another
characteristic of red tends to be that they're they're gutsy
they're ballsy they're cocky and they have a very high
risk tolerance so a lot of gamblers you know like
degenerate chronic gamblers will be stage red because they don't
they don't think about the consequences uh they don't think
about the odds and they get a thrill out of
at you know placing these high stakes bets and then
winning even though they're probably going to lose but if
they do win you know that that gives them that
sort of adrenaline rush and gives them that sense of
of power sort of beating the system beating the odds
um a lot of red survival strategy is about winning
through sheer audacity it's an interesting survival strategy have you
ever maybe experienced this in your life sometimes you think
like well i can sort of take the safe road
in this situation like you could say it's a dangerous
situation here so i could be conservative and take the
safe road or i can you know do the very
risky thing and you think about the risky thing and
most of us think about it like nah it's just
too dangerous because if it goes wrong it will really
really go wrong um and so we generally go the
conservative direction and we stay safe that way but stage
red in a sense it's so bold it's so daring
it's so shameless that a lot of times it can
win simply through its sheer shamelessness have you known people
like that um yeah it's definitely a survival strategy that
sometimes works you know i've heard stories of people stage
red people you know who describe some of their you
know daring risk-taking audacious uh you know things that they've
done and you know i think about like damn you're
crazy that that's insane you could have killed yourself you
could have gotten arrested you could have you know overdosed
you could have um you could have killed yourself you
know you whatever uh but uh but the reason that
they didn't is precisely because they were so audacious a
lot of times you can exploit people that way because
a lot of times people don't expect you to be
suicidally daring and yet when you are for example you
could win on the battlefield if you're if you're fighting
a battle against some opponent and you're completely outnumbered what
do you got to do well you don't have much
to lose because you know you're so outnumbered you know
they're going to come and kill you so you might
as well just go for the most bold and daring
plan and sometimes it works out precisely because your enemy
doesn't expect you to be so daring and so bold
and that's exactly why red uses this strategy because it
works in a certain type of environment you have to
really appreciate that the environment that these strategies are played
in is is is completely fundamental because if you have
a mismatch between the environment and the strategy you're using
then it's going to turn out terrible but if the
environment and the strategy is the right fit then it'll
work even if it's brutal or it seems insane to
you another characteristic of red is that it tends to
only trust itself because of course everybody is in this
sort of dog-eat-dog world it's it's a jungle out there
and so who can i really trust well nobody because
anybody could stab me in the back and everybody's going
to try and exploit me just the way that i
exploit i expect them and so one of the ways
in which red justifies its predatory and exploitative behavior is
because hey everybody else is doing it so why should
i be the only one who disarms when all of
my enemies are arming themselves up well i have to
as well it's an arms race another characteristic is that
whatever i can take is fair it's this attitude of
i am the law i set the law might makes
right if i can do it then that means it's
justified i don't have to hold myself back with guilt
and morality and artificial rules of what's right and what's
wrong if i can do it it's right red has
a high sense of entitlement it feels like it owns
the world it deserves women and sex and money and
fame and respect all of this is deserved which makes
red very confident it's decisive and energetic it's very direct
and blunt it's quick to action red tends to be
hot-blooded emotions such as rage anger mania red will fly
off the handle if it's triggered enough red will throw
objects at the wall you know those people who you
know they're in a fight they get angry they take
some vase or something and they they smash it against
their partner's head or something like that where they will
throw a glass in their face these sorts of things
a lot of domestic violence comes from stage red men
and even stage red women a straight a stage red
woman and by the way stage red is not just
exclusive to men women of course are also able to
be at stage red i'll give you some examples of
that as we get to the examples portion of this
episode but you know there's examples of of crazy women
who are alcoholic and do drugs and they they are
abusive to their boyfriends and husbands and they will try
to stab them or throw something at them or shoot
them so there's there's there's plenty of these examples to
go around stage red tends to be materialistic and hedonistic
it it values tangible things gold diamonds drugs uh sex
uh you know trophy women and wives and like this
sort of stuff stuff that you can that you know
that you can that you can use directly for your
survival red likes to flex its muscles as a show
of its strength it likes to puff itself up you
know puff up its chest and it's just this sort
of attitude it tends to be pragmatic action oriented and
results oriented it's very opportunist opportunistic and expedient whatever is
expedient whatever will work in this situation it tends to
to do because it's forced to it expects personal loyalty
and respect uh it uses shows of power and guts
to gain respect from others it delights in cruelty torture
revenge and violence so not only is it that red
can be very violent and do all these sorts of
criminal things but it actually takes delight in it not
always but oftentimes it can it tends to be very
vindictive and delights in the suffering especially of its enemies
so if some enemy did me wrong uh stage red
people will have very long-term memory they will hold a
grudge for any insult that they received and they're easily
insulted because they value respect so much you know they
can be disrespected easily and then they will hold that
grudge for years for decades until they can re exact
their revenge on their enemies and make it as as
painful for them as possible and they will gloat and
delight in that and then they will they will glorify
that and they will share that with their you know
with their friends and their enemies so that it's like
a threat you know if you mess with me i'm
gonna cut off your head and put on a spike
sort of idea there's no altruism at stage red there's
no forgiveness there's no compromise there's no mercy it tends
to be ruthless and bloodthirsty there's celebration of conquest rules
and regulations are to be tested and ignored not to
be followed red likes to bend nature to its will
so not only is red about dominating humans but also
dominating the environment physically you know raping the earth so
to speak extracting resources dominating animals as well red doesn't
have the capacity for self-reflection all problems in the world
are perceived to be external so there's no inner work
going on at stage right there's no consciousness work it's
not like stage red will stop and will ask yourself
well did i do the right thing in that situation
when i killed that guy or when i robbed that
bank or when i did those drugs it's like no
the problem isn't me the problem is never me the
problem is always that oh it's the police who are
the problem it's the government who's the problem it's the
woman who's the problem you know she made me slap
her and rape her because of what she was wearing
because she was disrespecting me so of course i raped
her because she was disrespecting me she got what she
deserved that's the sort of idea it's never like well
what about me what about my is there anything in
my psyche that i should change should i do some
self-improvement like no not a stage right problems are always
somebody else's fault and stage red doesn't learn through punishment
so a lot of criminals will be repeat offenders and
they will be sent in jail over and over again
they get released they get caught again because they just
go back to doing what they were doing because punishment
doesn't deter them and they don't think that far ahead
when they're thinking about holding up you know a liquor
store at gunpoint for a thousand dollars or something all
they want is that thousand dollars because they need a
thousand dollars you know to buy some heroin to feed
their drug addiction or whatever and they're not thinking about
well what are the consequences what if cops come and
then you know the the judge throws the book at
me and i get 10 20 years in jail it's
like they no they don't they don't make those connections
so of course they're going to just um uh they're
gonna seem very unintelligent to higher stages and in a
sense they are and you know they're impulsive so it's
like if i'm horny and i want to have sex
and you know there's that that girl walking by well
i'm just going to rape her and i'm not going
to think about the consequence i'm going to think about
will i get caught how many years am i going
to go to jail for rape you know i'm not
going to go google that and try to figure it
out and see like well is it worth let me
do a cost benefit analysis on you know well i
could get five years for raping her but on the
other hand i'm really horny like which one of those
should i like no it's like oh i'm horny i'm
just gonna rape her and then if the cops come
i'm gonna i'm gonna you know i'm gonna i'm gonna
find where those cops live and i'm gonna go and
break the kneecaps of their uh of their children with
a baseball bat teach them a lesson this kind of
mentality because there's no self-reflection here there's an instant defensiveness
when ideas are challenged because stage red is so brashly
self-confident that it doesn't recognize the weakness of its own
plans or ideas so when someone tells stage read like
hey you know that's a bad idea maybe you shouldn't
go through with that stage red is gonna is gonna
tend to not introspect and say yeah you know maybe
you're right maybe i shouldn't rob that bank maybe i
should get out of the mafia it's like no it's
like who are you to challenge me you're questioning my
ideas you're disrespecting me you're telling me there's something wrong
with me it's like no something's wrong with you because
all problems are external nothing's wrong with me of course
there's very high ego at this stage and because there's
high ego stage red is not capable of looking at
itself objectively objectively evaluating its own weaknesses and trying to
improve itself and so that's a big problem how do
you get people out of stage red how do you
get them to to rehabilitate themselves like as criminals or
as drug addicts for example how do you get them
to change when they don't want to do any self-improvement
work and everything at this stage is taken personally so
if you tell a stage red person to do some
self-improvement work they're going to take that personally like there's
something wrong with them they're going to get angry and
they're probably going to lash out at you and they're
probably going to hit you over the head and they're
going to be happy about it stage red is unable
to exercise restraint there's a lack of self-control self-control and
discipline is something that's developed at stage blue which comes
next after stage red but we haven't gotten there yet
so there's a lack of self-control a lot of the
stupid stuff that stage red does tends to end up
boomeranging on on it because it just acts impulsively on
on some craving or some desire it has and then
it gets itself into a bad uh dangerous situation which
ends up harming its survival it's unable to plan well
it's unable to save for a rainy day or do
preventative maintenance work it tends to be very corrupt and
it sees corruption and violence as the norm it doesn't
see corruption as a bad thing that needs to be
reformed it's just the way of life because some countries
and societies are so corrupt that the idea of ever
correcting that corruption is so far out into the future
that it doesn't even make sense to think about it
because it won't happen in your lifetime so why think
about it join the corruption and try to win that
game of corruption and come out on top be the
most corrupt that's how red things you don't deal with
corruption by by being nice you deal with corruption by
becoming even more corrupt than everybody else red tends to
be about controlling and expanding turf and territory that's what
a lot of gang warfare is about you know different
rival gangs in inner cities are fighting with each other
for control of territory in order to sell drugs for
example and if you disrespect a gang member you get
killed by it through like a drive-by shooting or something
stage red can get off on controlling people because it
loves to be dominate domineering and so just its whole
approach to life is to control others to make them
do what red needs and wants for its survival aggression
and violence are seen as legit tools to get what
red wants red tends to be passionate it tends to
have a a passionate sense of mission it tends to
be a sort of alpha male mentality although that doesn't
mean that red is exclusive to males females like i
said are also capable of it it tends to be
very confrontational it doesn't back down it creates enemies and
it sees the world in terms of friends and enemies
enemies are not seen as something that my mind is
projecting or creating enemies are not relative or subjective things
the way that you realize they are at higher stages
enemies are real tangible and they must be destroyed red
tends to be independent it tends to like a strict
hierarchy where red is in charge or red is climbing
the hierarchy to the top to become the boss now
don't make a mistake think a mistake here of thinking
that you must be the boss in order to be
stage red for example in a gang or in a
mafia everybody in in a sort of you know soprano
style mafia situation everybody not just tony soprano but everybody
in that structure is stage red you have the highest
boss maybe tony soprano of course he's red but there's
lower you know his lieutenants they're also red and and
everybody underneath them is also red but then of course
you know it's it's a vicious sort of hierarchy where
one is trying to climb the ladder and trying to
take out the guy above or if one respects the
guy above you then you sort of respect his power
and so you know red is not totally stupid red
can understand that you know maybe i'm not the strongest
one in this hierarchy maybe i have to bide my
time a little bit i can't just go challenge the
boss right away maybe right now i'm just sort of
a newbie i'm sort of just a lieutenant i can
i can respect the boss because the boss is powerful
so don't think that red will never submit himself to
some higher power he will he will submit himself to
a boss but of course red respects the boss precisely
because he wants to sort of be in that boss's
shoes now that doesn't mean that he will ever get
there he probably won't because there's not that many bosses
there can only be so many bosses relative to everybody
down lower on the pyramid but you can sort of
maintain that structure and then the boss the way the
boss enforces that structure is through an iron fist through
you know brutal torture and domination such that that keeps
others in line and red respects that another feature of
red is that it tends to view conquest as equivalent
to worth value truth goodness and beauty so for most
of us if we're a little bit more developed than
that we can have values like truth and goodness and
beauty and we can value these and we don't equate
these with conquest and domination of other people but stage
red does and you can see how problematic that can
be and lastly a characteristic of stage red is that
it tends to exploit the superstitions of stage purple so
stage purple which we'll talk about in the future not
only is it deeply tribal but it tends to have
a sort of a magical animistic mystical spiritual component to
it a lot of sort of superstition witchcraft voodoo this
sort of stuff which can be exploited by stage red
for its own purposes because stage red is not going
to be loyal to some you know mother earth spirit
or some some [ __ ] like this but it
could exploit that in order to to dominate and to
control other people all right so now it's time to
get to my giant list of examples of stage red
a lot of examples here we're going to go through
them quickly i'll pause on certain examples in order to
elaborate because some of these examples are really illustrative of
red so let's start with the first one which is
donald trump so i've alluded to this in the past
but it really bears to to double down on it
here hopefully if you're conscious and you've been following sprawl
dynamics and you've been following what's been happening in politics
over the last four years you've been sort of psychoanalyzing
trump uh and a lot of the stuff that i
already mentioned all these values and qualities as i was
mentioning them i hope in your mind you were seeing
an image of trump because i was describing him almost
word for word in many ways he loves to brag
he loves displays of power military parades he is friends
with other dictators and authoritarians around the world he's extremely
impulsive he has no self-control he has no discipline he's
very manipulative and exploitative opportunistic he doesn't have long-term plans
he's not a strategic thinker he's not a systemic thinker
he's just flying by the seat of his pants he's
very intuitive he's driven by his gut he's simple-minded he's
not very educated he will say the dumbest things he
wants respect more than anything he gets easily offended he
has a very fragile ego he's extremely narcissistic he doesn't
care about anybody not even his own family members many
of them he doesn't care about um not even his
own sons uh if you've read you know stories inside
stories of how the trump family operates it's a very
stage red sort of mentality now of course trump is
not exclusively stage red he's also got elements of some
blue and he's got plenty of stage orange in him
as well but he's got a lot of stage red
and the problem with trump is that he got elected
by people who are not very bright and are not
able to make these distinctions they have no idea what
sprout dynamics is and so they elected him including most
of the republican party they started to support trump uh
thinking that he's at stage orange i mean they don't
understand what stage orange is but if they did they
would think oh yeah he's just a stage orange like
ceo successful business guy likes money you know has a
has giant high rises with golden toilets and stuff like
that yeah you're sort of like an excessively staged orange
sort of guy we can deal with that you know
because almost most republicans and most people who um you
know neoliberals and capitalists they're stage orange but what they
don't understand is that trump has a thin veneer of
stage orange but deep down at his core in his
psyche he's staged red which is two stages lower than
oranges it's far more dangerous and so now four years
into it republicans have sort of been shocked themselves to
see how incompetent and reckless and dangerous trump is how
uncontrollable he is how little discipline he has and to
many republicans it's kind of like they've they've gone all
in on trump because they want to maintain power but
they're not quite able to reconcile like why does this
guy act like such a monster sometimes why can't he
just like be normal why can't he be a normal
republican why can't he just be the sort of normal
stage blue slash orange sort of republican the way that
most of them are well because he's actually got a
very deep red core and and see you can't you
can't train him you can't teach him he doesn't learn
lessons he just keeps acting impulsively from his narcissistic impulses
and this offends some conservatives the good conservatives the sort
of never trumpers they saw through it they had some
morals and some integrity they saw that this guy is
not a standard republican this guy is actually hijacking the
conservative movement uh you know he's not truly religious he
doesn't respect mur he doesn't have any morality he's a
serial you know womanizer and philanderer and you know there's
rape accusations against him and blah blah blah blah and
so you know he you know he he he engages
in in criminal business activity he's not really able to
run a successful business so he's not he's not going
to lead us to any kind of you know um
sort of neo-liberal ideal that many conservatives have it's not
going to happen so the narrow trumpers saw through that
credit to them um but many conservatives and republicans haven't
and in fact they've they've sort of been pulled by
trump deeper into red themselves trump brings out the red
in in many conservatives and i think many conservatives do
have a tinge of red in them you know some
more than others but the danger is is that trump
stokes that up and because birds of a feather flock
together other stage red people you know they get activated
so we have more hate crime racism has now sort
of started to to to come out from from the
shadows into the open with trump because you know he's
been kind of encouraging it and he's been so sort
of brash and blunt about it um and you can
tell i mean the biggest problem with trump is simply
he has no compassion he has no concern for the
collateral damage or suffering that his actions caused towards anybody
not even his closest friends and and colleagues and family
members right so that's the biggest problem with trump um
you can't run an effective society and community at the
sort of level of complexity that america is at now
you know we're not some some banana republic uh we're
not some some underdeveloped country in in africa you know
we're a country with nuclear weapons and you know space
travel and satellites and complex military systems and all the
sorts of stuff so you know as americans we need
a leader who's able to think strategically systemically trump is
incapable of this he's utterly incompetent at this he doesn't
understand how government works he doesn't care to understand how
government works you can't even brief him on anything because
you need to you need to you know whittle down
a 20-page report to like a single one-page sheet and
half of it has to be graphics and the other
half has to be telling him how good he is
how great he is you know praising his ego stoking
his ego and because he has no compassion he doesn't
understand what a leader needs in america is the leader
needs to have compassion for the suffering of others trump
doesn't doesn't give a [ __ ] about the suffering
of the poor minorities the middle class like he doesn't
care about any of this stuff it's all just pretend
and he's a great con artist you know he he
likes to talk about god and protecting um protecting religious
freedoms and being anti-abortion and all this he doesn't this
isn't this is just it's just a he's just running
a con he's saying these things because he's done some
a b split testing to figure out that that's what
these suckers want that's what you conservatives want is him
to talk about this stuff he doesn't actually care about
these things but hey you know conservatives are in denial
about it if you're a trump supporter you're gonna deny
everything i said here uh you know but um it
is what it is that's why spiraling was such a
powerful model really one of the greatest disservices that the
media mainstream media did during the election leading up to
trump in 2015 and 16 is that they didn't properly
make these distinctions for ordinary people really what should have
happened is that cnn msnbc even fox news should have
basically been running and saying look this guy he seems
like he's a stage orange successful businessman ceo type of
person he's not he's actually stage red so be very
very careful not to confuse him with that see if
this distinction was properly made to to mainstream people then
trump wouldn't have gotten elected because people would have foreseen
all the challenges that that came and all the problems
you know and how reckless he would have been as
a leader but the reason these distinctions weren't made is
because the people at cnn fox news and msnbc and
other places they themselves are just completely ignorant about spiral
dynamics they themselves are incapable of making this distinction it
still baffles me to this day four years into it
i see people you know on cnn or so forth
or even on youtube i see progressives even talking about
trump but they're still not able to clearly differentiate trump
from standard conservatives and republicans who are more stage blue
orange than red and then they're shocked by some of
the stuff that trump does it's not shocking when you
understand he stayed red he's behaving exactly as you would
expect him to behave and this is why a lot
of times progressives will tend to call trump a fascist
and trump call trump supporters fascists um it's because the
reason they're calling him a fascist is because they're they're
intuiting they're sort of seeing his stage read qualities but
they don't know what red is they don't have that
label in their mind so the only label they have
is fascists so they call them fascist or they call
them a nazi or something like this which is not
strictly correct in a sense trump is is in a
sense he's almost like below a fascist um in his
development but also somewhere around there i mean he's too
he's too uneducated to really be an effective fascist but
he certainly has has the stage read authoritarian narcissistic tendencies
which is basically where fascism stems from but also fascism
incorporates a lot of stage blue elements into it as
well so that's just trump as an example saddam hussein
is another very good example i have a book on
my book list about is a biography about saddam hussein
and it clearly illustrates saddam hussein's rise from a stage
purple tribal culture into stage red and how he took
power it's an amazing book go read it and you
will learn a lot about stage red and saddam was
saying very very interesting i also shared recently on my
blog an hbo slash bbc uh miniseries uh it's sort
of a fictionalized but also sort of a true uh
dramatic reenactment of saddam hussein's rise to power amazing one
of the one of the best shows that hbo and
the bbc has ever produced um that sort of flew
under the radar not many people know about it go
go check it out it's called house of sodom amazing
show it shows you how how stage red works and
in that show also you get to see saddam hussein's
sons especially one of his sons i forget was it
uday or kusey i don't know exactly which one of
them but one of them was like just utterly brutal
like he he ran saddam's torture to a torture division
um and this guy was just like a a bloodthirsty
psychopath there's this one scene in house of sodom where
uh in the royal compound you know some of some
of one of saddam's you know younger friends and and
sort of collaborators and colleagues he's throwing this party it's
like a wedding party or something and it's late at
night and they're kind of rowdy and they're they're drinking
and they're dancing and all this and then saddam's sons
are like sitting upstairs in in the building in the
palace just like talking i mean they get annoyed by
this by this noise coming from this wedding party down
below so they go down there and um and the
guy is just drunk the guy is drunk and he's
you know he's singing loudly um and uh and saddam's
son you know the torture guy he says you know
turn off the music this party is over uh shut
it all down you know we want to sleep or
something like that you guys are making too much noise
but the drunk guy is like no we have permission
from saddam to hold this party so we're going to
enjoy ourselves you know blah blah and uh and so
the son takes his cane and just beats the guy
over the head to death and just like cracks his
skull open just like it beats him his brains just
are splattered all over like the uh the concrete there
and the crowd you know the wedding party crowd is
standing there just aghast at what's happening the guy just
beats his brain into a pulp on the concrete floor
there you go and and then and then he goes
back upstairs uh you know saddam's son and he he's
now he's terrified because this was this was saddam hussein's
like top favorite advisers and now he knows saddam hussein
is going to be pissed off that he killed this
guy for such a stupid reason so this is an
example of sort of stage red you know impulsive uh
anger and and just you know hot temper that hot
bloodness and so then he tries to saddam's sons you
know he's trying to figure out a way now how
am i gonna how am i going to deal with
this because saddam hussein is going to be you know
like coming here and kicking my ass for this he
thought saddam would kill him for what he did so
he took a bunch of sleeping pills and then he
wound up in the hospital he survived but anyways you
know he he himself was was terrified of what he
did so he sort of recognized after the fact that
what he did was was very dangerous and problematic so
uh regions in the world that are stage red or
have a lot of stage read in them is iraq
syria uh liberia i posted a video about liberia on
my blog a while a while ago uh vicious vicious
vicious go go check out the liberia video it'll it'll
shock you how how um wow very stage red uh
somalia north korea myanmar turkmenistan haiti many parts of africa
that are underdeveloped uh the middle east many parts of
the middle east that are underdeveloped palestine leaders like hitler
stalin basically any kind of warlords mafia of course i've
talked about tony soprano al capone pirates marauders gangs of
various kinds yakuza which is the japanese gang violent prisoners
tend to be stage red people prison culture in general
a stage read you know they tell you know when
you go into prison there's that whole kind of i
don't know if it's true or not i guess it's
true when you go into prison you're supposed to like
beat somebody up on the first day in order to
gain the respect of everybody else otherwise they're going to
make you your their [ __ ] it's probably true
i don't know uh sounds true for stage red uh
freedom fighters tend to be stage red revolutionaries criminals rapists
con artists thieves terrorists juvenile delinquents ancient rome had a
lot of stage red in it gladiatorial combat every stage
red emperors like caligula nero and there are others other
roman emperors who qualify stage red the spartans were very
warlike militaristic as a people chinese emperors certain ones japanese
emperors that sort of samurai code it was deeply staged
blue as well samurais are sort of in between red
and blue i would say alexander the great who is
a great conqueror achilles who was a great fighter if
you've seen the movie troy the depiction of achilles there
is really good he's he's this amazing fighter and warrior
but on the other hand he has a hot temper
he's very sort of proud of his victories and conquests
um so he sort of exemplifies sort of the noble
image if you want sort of a noble archetype of
stage red it might be achilles or alexander the great
klingons the klingons from star trek i've mentioned this before
but star trek the different races in star trek were
actually created by the creator of star trek gene roddenberry
he studied spiral dynamics the early version of it developed
by claire graves he studied claire graves and he knew
the different stages and he basically built these different alien
races like the klingons and the romulans and so forth
based on different spiral stages and so the klingons were
the red ones they have this very warrior culture they
love to be rowdy and rough and they drink and
they sing and they um you know they're sort of
these barbarians they're not very educated they they tend to
act from the gut shoot first ask questions later online
hackers who do all sorts of hacking scams and schemes
or stage red toxic narcissists sociopaths psychopaths now i don't
want to say that psychopaths and sociopaths are necessarily not
necessarily automatically read but there's definitely overlap there i'm not
quite sure how to distinguish those honestly my specialty is
not pathological psychology so i don't really know and you
could probably draw a lot of very fine distinctions between
sociopaths psychopaths and stage red but that would be a
topic for another day lone shooters and mass shooters these
gunmen that we see on the news in america so
often these days these are mostly stage red folks who
get very angry and then they they take it out
they take their anger out on others conan the barbarian
that movie and that uh fictional character joe pesci from
casino oh man if you want a rendition of stage
red which is just perfect prototypical stage red joe pesci
from casino i posted some uh some videos of this
on my blog and also on the forum in the
mega thread of sprawling dynamics examples we have some some
clips of joe pesci viciously read the russian mob toxic
masculinity some elements of the red pill philosophy is stage
red vikings genghis khan mongol hordes drug addicts gamblers criminals
uh the criminal underground war criminals massacres torch torture rape
gangs wild rock stars tend to be red they do
a lot of drugs stuff like that um i think
uh russell brand in his early days when he was
like doing heroin and stuff like that that was probably
stage red and now he's evolved very beautifully so if
you want a really good example of how you evolve
out of stage red uh look at russell brand jules
from pulp fiction samuel l jackson character from pulp fiction
is a great example of red and he has a
nice story arc basically jewels a story arc in pulp
fiction is going from red from a red gangster to
a stage blue finding god joffrey from game of thrones
ramsey from game of thrones cersei from game of thrones
the dothraki from game of thrones the joker cult leaders
like jim jones and charles manson and david koresh aztec
human sacrifice pimps hustlers prostitutes sex trafficking brothels strippers porn
stars not all porn stars but porn stars are going
to tend to gravitate in that direction so will strippers
that's why strippers have a sort of reputation of being
crazy and psychotic because you sort of have to be
to be involved in in prostitution or stripping or pornography
violent porn will appeal to stage red snuff films stage
red king's harems stage red absolute monarchs feudalism heads on
spikes vlad the impaler crucifixion cutting off body parts as
legal punishment for violating crimes cruel and unusual punishment of
various sorts um you know in in modern democracies we
explicitly ban cruel and unusual punishment in the constitution and
in certain bills of rights and so forth um just
because it was so vicious most pre-democratic societies have cruel
and unusual punishment like in saudi arabia by the way
saudi arabia staged red as well saudi arabia what do
they have they have like honor killings and they have
uh beheadings for criminals in the public square you can
see how that that's the sort of cruel and unusual
punishment uh vil many villains and movies are stage read
bullies colonial exploitation sweatshops slavery the wild west many wild
west movies usually the villain and wildest movie will be
stage red uh the terminator rambo throwing objects when you're
angry cocaine heroin crack and meth users these are like
the very hard drugs suicide bombers the lesser jihad from
islam isis domestic violence mma and ufc tend to attract
and appeal to a lot of stage red people they
they appeal it's sort of like a modern day gladiatorial
combat they appeal to that stage red within us now
i'm not saying that just because you practice mma or
just because you're interested in ufc that you're automatically full-on
solid stage red i'm not saying that because like for
example joe rogan loves mma he does jiu jitsu uh
he he commentates on ufc uh and yet he's not
red he's he's stage green i would put him at
stage green but still there is you can tell there's
a there's a little kernel at least a little kernel
of stage red within him probably more so in his
younger days which is why that sort of stuff appeals
to him see um and a lot of guys who
watch that they you know they love that that bloodlust
that you get to see it appeals to that animal
part of you which is locked away you know usually
you're working at the office as a computer programmer you
can't you can't tap into that stage red you know
warrior blood thirsty conquest sort of thrill but when you're
playing a video game or you're engaging in one of
these extreme sports or something like ufc then you you
get that that stage red nerve titillated uh boxing also
has a lot of stage red in it many boxers
are stage red for example like mike tyson um you
could see some interviews i mean he's evolved now he's
probably moving towards orange and green more he's done five
meow dmt which is good to see that probably helped
evolve him a bit um you know he's he's much
older now but when he was in his early 20s
uh he was just vicious he was a vicious animal
in the ring don king his his boxing promoter also
a very stage red sort of guy of course they
have plenty of stage orange in them as well conor
mcgregor stage red and orange um that's why you see
conor mcgregor throwing stuff you know yelling at stuff yelling
at people you know threatening to to rape their mothers
and like all this nasty stuff that he says to
promote his fights you know only a stage red person
would behave that way bank robbers bully and tyrannical bosses
if you have a boss who's just a complete dick
to you and actually gets off on on dominating you
that's a stage red boss bribery bling you know that
pinky diamond ring uh gold teeth and chains which are
popular in the hood the hood itself a lot of
black culture like rap and so forth comes from a
sort of stage red culture which is why you know
a lot of conservatives like to say like oh well
the biggest problem with racism is black on black crime
you know black people are just shooting each other in
the hood other black people so it's not white people
who are hurting black people's other black people but that's
a function of the systemic racism and the income inequality
which is a legacy from slavery which of course has
created these these parts in urban areas which have been
redlined and then they don't have enough resources there to
actually give opportunities to these young black people so they
just join gangs and it becomes the hood culture and
they're dealing drugs and they're shooting each other of course
but that's not because that's black culture that black culture
came from the fact that there was 200 years of
slavery and then there was jim crow and then there
was not any like any sort of reparation any sort
of help to these black communities and their wealth is
like five percent of what white wealth is overall because
wealth is accumulated over generations they just don't have the
generational wealth so of course they have a sort of
stage red culture that that's not that's not a feature
of being black that's a lack of spiral development which
is again another common failure to make a distinction that
many conservatives have when it comes to understanding racism they
tend to think that all blacks have low iq and
that's a genetic problem it's not a genetic problem it's
a problem of spiral development which is actually a very
optimistic thing because that means that if we equalize the
income inequality and we help them out then they're going
to be able to evolve their culture and then it's
not going to be a genetic thing it's not going
to be a function of iq their iq will actually
increase as we create safety net programs for them and
as there's more job opportunities for them and so forth
the iq will equalize which is what these uh sort
of uh race iq people don't really understand because they
fail to see how culture how significant culture is and
how it shapes our psyches and minds and how it
evolves and changes drive-by shootings blood sport it's interesting i
mentioned this example on the forum um there's a story
online that i saw about trump which said that his
favorite movie is bloodsport it's a old 80s fan damn
movie a great movie by the way um i think
it's probably van damme's best movie but but this is
just so typical of stage red mentality so what trump
did the movie is like two hours long uh and
there's a story to it there's a lot of fighting
you know van damme goes to asia to china i
think and he does some underground martial arts competition so
there's a lot of fighting and blood and so forth
but there's also story he has like a love interest
there's relationship stuff going on uh so trump told his
son that he was sick of watching bloodsport in its
entirety because there was like love scenes and other sorts
of stuff that he didn't like he wanted to just
fast forward through all that so he told his son
to edit the movie such that it was just pure
60 minutes of just people punching each other in the
face cutting out all the story and everything else and
then to him that was like the best movies that
just perfectly exemplifies stage red thinking other examples include [
__ ] fighting dog fighting animal cruelty sports fights when
you see like in hockey you know two guys or
a bunch of guys they start you know taking off
the gloves and punching each other that's a very stage
red sort of activity pro wrestling appeals a lot to
stage red they sort of play it up with drama
uh the movie lord of war actually one of my
favorite movies oh my god it's an amazing movie with
nick cage if you haven't seen lord of war go
buy that [ __ ] movie and watch it it's
amazing watch it twice think of just like man i
can't say enough positive things about that movie it's so
well done it's definitely nick cage's best movie and i
think it's probably my favorite movie of all time uh
in addition to ex machina and her i like the
movie her as well like really well done movies but
lord of war it shows nick cage as this weapons
dealer he himself is more stage orange he's not so
much red but he he goes to these war-torn parts
of the world he's like a stage orange sort of
vulture capitalist who goes and sells weapons uh like ak-47s
and m16s to uh to like warlords in africa and
in eastern europe and he does all this drug running
and uh and sorry weapons running uh and it just
shows all the intricacies of that and then he deals
with these like african dictators who are just totally bloodthirsty
and that's where you get to see the stage red
it's it's amazing alex jones very stage red l ron
hubbard the guy behind scientology he was sort of a
con artist swindler he also had like rape charges against
him and uh the government was after him for all
sorts of weird reasons i don't even know the full
story and then his uh his protege his successor was
david miscavige who runs the scientology cult now he's also
a very stage red guy there's there's stories you can
read of him like beating uh beating people down that
don't listen to him is very sort of he runs
the scientology organization basically as a cult and as like
a totalitarian organization he's the one in charge he took
over after l ron hubbard died 911 was stage red
the oklahoma semi city bombing with timothy mcveigh stage red
some insole cult in cell culture not insult in cell
culture is uh stage red there's like this deep deep
deep misogyny there's a sort of glorification of rape within
that culture uh also some aspects of the pickup community
i was involved with the pickup community i'm very intimately
familiar with it i've met many pickup artists some of
the world's greatest i've interacted with a lot of folks
from rsd and and others um personally i never i
never indulged in the red aspects of it i was
too conscious for that i was just basically doing pick
up to learn the techniques the techniques are effective and
they're great and i recommend you learn them but if
you know if you're a guy and you want to
learn to get good with girls but uh but i
noticed some very very toxic stage read aspects to pick
up a lot of pickup pic a lot of people
who get drawn to pick up very heavily who tend
to become coaches they get drawn to it from a
sort of a stage red place they're they're very misogynistic
uh they have this toxic masculinity to them uh they
glorify rape um they don't take like rape as a
serious problem they treat women just completely as objects it's
about sexual conquest more than even the pleasure of sex
or trying to find a girlfriend it's just about like
sexual conquest usually these people were beaten or abused in
their childhoods um you know i i've met a few
and these are not all pickup artists so i don't
want to smear them all some of them are good
some of the some pickup artists are actually stage green
um many of them are orange but a few of
them are red like i've seen and i've i've interacted
with some pickup artists who literally had rape charges like
pending rape charges in court like they had a court
date like they're going to court next week because they
have a rape charge against them um and yeah that
that's that's very like that breaks my heart to see
that because it's important that we teach men how to
be strong men and how to attract women these are
important skills that need to be taught otherwise we get
something even worse we get in-cell culture which is even
worse than pick up culture uh but there is sort
of a glorification of rape within the culture like uh
i know a pickup coach who who has something called
a rape van he drives a van he bought a
van and if you're into pickup you know what i'm
talking about here but i won't name his name but
uh he actually bought a van this guy bought a
van like a used van for five thousand dollars he
drives around to the club to like a nightclub he
will pull girls from the club into the van in
the van he has set up like a bed of
basically a mattress and he just [ __ ] girls
in the van and um and then and then what
he does is he has he actually paints a little
picture of he like sort of puts a little picture
of of a woman on the back of the van
for every woman he [ __ ] he has like
a hundred of these on the back of the van
so this sort of and then he makes light of
it like the whole thing is sort of done as
a joke um so that sort of attitude is a
very stage red attitude and on the other hand i
have compassion for him because i've read his life story
this guy comes from a from like a terrible situation
where his his father when he was yet when he
was a teenager his father actually raped and murdered his
mother with a shotgun because he found out that she
was cheating on him and so of course that that
kind of situation will will definitely send you into sort
of a stage red spiral uh kanye west kanye talks
about that dragon energy and then kanye west you know
kanye west uh resonates with trump why does he resonate
with trump because they're both when he says dragon energy
he's talking about stage red values and energy rap music
heavy metal music punk music these tend to be stage
red uh there can be higher forms of it i'm
not saying it has to necessarily be stage red people
like to debate me on heavy metal like oh leo
heavy metal actually is green most of it is probably
red maybe there's some green mexican drug cartels are very
red el chapo if you watch some of his how
he ran the sinaloa drug cartel he got arrested recently
some some years ago but this guy was a vicious
vicious stage red mobster the gran the game grand theft
auto sort of glorifies stage red and in fact many
video games are glorification of stage red in a sense
many of these violent video games they let us play
out these stage red fantasies in a safe way so
that we don't have to do it in real life
you know you can get a sort of a thrill
from curb stomping somebody in one of these video games
or you know shooting them in the face with a
shotgun and blowing their head off yeah that stage red
imagine what a stage green video game would look like
a lot fewer of those graffiti is stage red no
country for old men the villain in that movie stage
red the old testament has a lot of elements of
stage red where you have a vengeful god who punishes
others see the old testament was written for a time
and a culture in which most of it was stage
read and so spirituality and religion at that time had
to appeal to that you couldn't market a stage green
version of religion or christianity back then because there was
no stage green that's why there's such a sharp contrast
between the old testament and the new testament in the
bible people say they have a different feel you know
the old testament is very vindictive god is sort of
angry and judgmental and and and violent whereas in the
new testament you sort of have a more softening of
the approach it's more of the sort of effeminate approach
of jesus you know having love and compassion and turning
the other cheek very different the jesus example is more
stage green whereas the old testament is more stage red
the sith from star wars is very stage red fight
club stage red a clockwork orange stage red uh dan
pina he's sort of a motivational business leader coach teacher
he's got a lot of stage red elements to him
also state orange hunting homeless people for sport that cliche
is stage red the black panthers had a bit of
stage red in them the kkk lynchings and the sort
of torture that they inflicted upon slaves and black people
and the sort of terrorism that they they they did
and i guess they still continue to do although less
so these days machiavelli and treating women as chattel and
literal physical personal property the way that they do like
in saudi arabia or in certain islamic parts of the
world where women are you know basically kept as prisoners
they can't get a bank account they can't travel without
a male companion they they can barely go to the
store and do shopping without a male companion um they
certainly are not they don't they don't have the freedom
to divorce the husband and a lot of other freedoms
that women enjoy in the developed world they don't have
so that's my list of examples for you if you
want even more examples or you want videos of these
examples go to actualize.org forum go to our forum uh
go to the self actualization sub section and there you
will find a mega thread that we started called spiral
dynamics stage red examples mega thread in there you will
find dozens and dozens of pages and hundreds of examples
of all this and you can post more of your
examples if you want so for each one of the
spiral stages we have a dedicated mega thread on the
forum there these are very useful mega threads go check
them out we put a lot of work into them
hundreds of hours went into developing these mega threads to
give you concrete examples videos links articles that show you
you know photographs images memes and so forth that that
show you and teach you how these stages actually look
in the real world so don't miss that opportunity it's
there for you it's free don't have to pay anything
you don't even need to sign up to the forum
you can go look at it it's public and open
to everybody here are some common phrases and sayings that
exemplify stage read might makes right desperate times require desperate
measures no guts no glory you have to break some
eggs to make an omelet an eye for an eye
a tooth for a tooth it's a dog-eat-dog world survival
of the fittest to the victor go the spoils the
world is a jungle if you're not with us you're
against us fight tooth and nail take no prisoners and
offer he can't refuse what's in it for me off
with his head and you scratch my back i scratch
yours now let's talk about how to distinguish stage red
from orange because for many newbies who are just learning
about this model it can be confusing so here's the
difference stage orange for example will manipulate an exploit on
wall street to get money stage red will not just
manipulate to get money he will get a baseball bat
and break your kneecaps if you piss him off that's
the key difference between orange and red because a lot
of stage green people might look at it and say
well leo what's the difference really i mean stage orange
is very exploitative too you know the stage orange capitalist
you know they're so money hungry and they're all sociopaths
these guys like jeff bezos and bill gates and who
else elon musk or whatever you know they're just these
shameless sociopathic capitalists all they want is money they're just
greedy so their stage red no they aren't they're stage
orange and even a little bit of green as well
you don't appreciate how more how much more vicious stage
red is than stage orange stage orange is capable of
guilt and shame stage orange might commit some white-collar crime
stage or ensure they'll be very capitalistic they will be
very competitive they can be exploitative in the sense that
they might you know not pay their workers a fair
living wage or something like that and they may not
be socialists or communists or marxists or agree that we
need high taxes stage orange will not agree with those
things they're generally neoliberal okay but they are not joe
pesci or tony soprano right they're um uh they generally
follow the rules they're not violent criminals so you got
to make a distinction here between sort of white-collar crime
and violent crime red is more than violent crime red
will actually enjoy hurting others enjoy the suffering of others
the ceo like you know of amazon jeff bezos he
doesn't take pleasure in the suffering of his employees he's
just you know he's just a full-on capitalist okay but
he's not stage red red cannot control its impulses and
it cannot follow rules orange usually can orange is rational
and strategic orange can make plants orange can be patient
orange doesn't fly off the handle into some rage and
beat someone with a cane orange is capable of remorse
and shame orange is usually not physically violent and orange
tends to be democratic at least in principle like if
you ask elon musk or jeff bezos or bill gates
should we have a democracy they'll tell you yes if
you ask a stage red person no he wants a
totalitarian regime he wants to be the boss stage orange
is scientific and it tends to be fairly well educated
and it values science and education so there's quite a
significant difference what triggers stage red signs of weakness softness
and emotional vulnerability stage red doesn't respect that and it's
not open to exploring that within itself especially as a
as a man a stage red man is not going
to want to explore his feminine side or be emotionally
vulnerable that's a liability he can't afford he thinks that's
feminine he thinks that's emasculating he thinks that's not how
a man should be he's also triggered by disrespect insult
ridicule disloyalty and betrayal with donald trump you can clearly
see how triggered how easily triggered he is by disrespecting
by ridicule it gnaws adam you know it gnaws adam
and disloyalty everybody around him is disloyal i mean there's
a few maybe mike pence is loyal but but many
around him are disloyal because they're vultures just like him
and they betray him you know they come out with
tell-all books and all sorts of and this you can
tell this hurts him because it hurts his reputation it
hurts his fake facade of being the uh the successful
rich billionaire wealthy ceo you know competent ceo like that
whole facade gets crumbled by all these people who come
out and then you know betray him and tell the
true stories of of how of how he behaves and
how incompetent he is how narcissistic and selfish he is
red is triggered by anyone threatening the boss's authority which
you can see in trump for example the surest way
to get fired by trump as we can tell from
the stories is to try to outshine him anybody who
works for him has to make sure that they don't
outshine him because as soon as they do he's going
to fire them because he's so insecure and he needs
to be the boss his entire ego is built upon
that that's what his whole life is about stage red
is also triggered by losing the fight you can see
that trump's whole identity for example is built upon being
a winner so for him the greatest blow will come
from losing an election that's going to piss him off
the most that's going to make him the most vindictive
and when trump loses the 2020 election as i predict
he will it's not guaranteed but i predict he will
lose it he is so narcissistic that he's gonna go
down swinging and he's gonna try to take the entire
ship down with him you see a more evolved person
to trump he would lose the election he would be
sad about it it would hurt his ego like a
stage orange person and then he would just move on
to other things maybe he would go on and start
a business or you know whatever move on with his
life if trump loses this election especially if he loses
in a landslide which is looking like it's likely given
the recent poll numbers uh he's going to take it
extremely personally and he is going to devote the rest
of his life to exacting vengeance upon stage green and
the democrats and progressives and liberals for for costing him
this election he's going to take very very in fact
i think one of the reasons he ran in the
first place in 2016 is because he was at the
he was at some dinner where barack obama like insulted
him in front of everybody and he took it so
personally that then he made it like an agenda to
just to to stick it to obama by by winning
and then undoing everything obama did and that's that's what
he's been doing he takes delight in undoing obama's work
because for him it's about conquest and victory and vengeance
he enjoys the vengeance and there are stories of trump
where he enjoys destroying people who have stood in his
way that's his style see a stage orange person wouldn't
be into that so much what else triggers red is
a lack of action indecisiveness and making excuses over analysis
and an academic approach to life see we know this
about trump as well he's easily triggered when he's asked
to like read uh a report about some intelligence it's
a 20-page report he's not going to read that he
wants like a simple powerpoint presentation with pictures because he
doesn't he doesn't take an academic approach to anything and
you can see in his speeches all of his policy
proposals they're all just coming purely from the gut there's
no research about it there's no science to it there's
no asking people's opinions or expert count getting expert counsel
from advisors it's all just purely his own gut and
whatever serves him at that moment it's pure opportunism and
that's why he changes his policies all the time and
he says one thing then one day then he tweets
something the reverse of it the next day he changes
his mind it's impossible to negotiate with him because he
has no ideology he has no principles he's purely acting
out of self-interest uh what else triggers red is a
doubt about one's power and uh and basically stage green
triggers red hippy values and you can see this in
trump as well he's very triggered by feminism uh social
justice warriors basically democracy homosexuality this this all this sort
of stuff triggers stage red because it's seen as soft
fundamentally red wants power and it respects only brute physical
power not the softer aspects of life it doesn't value
relationships and love and compassion and generosity and goodness and
beauty and truth no it's just raw power truth is
raw power and you can see that in trump as
well he has no sense of truth for him truth
is anything that serves him that's what truth is and
it changes on a daily basis now let's talk about
the unhealthy manifestations and excesses of red now of course
we've been talking about it in a sense all along
um but there are healthy aspects to red which we'll
get to here in a minute but first let's cover
the unhealthy ones remember red is not bad it might
seem bad given all the examples i've given you but
it's not bad but it is pretty brutal and that's
its biggest problem is that it easily leads to violence
war dictatorship abuse slavery genocide mafia gang warfare it leads
to a sort of a downward cycle of abuse and
violence where i'm violent to you and then you're violent
to me and i'm even more violent to you and
then you're even more violent to me and it's just
this downward spiral it tears apart it tears apart families
and communities uh now you might say well leo if
it causes all these things then surely red must be
purely bad but what you have to understand is that
strictly speaking none of these things that i mentioned are
bad again it's bad because you're judging it from your
survival agenda given where you are at the spiral bad
here is purely relative stage red is a step up
from purple for example so you can't just say it's
bad because if you say stage red is bad how
is the stage purple society going to evolve to stage
blue or orange or green if it can't get through
stage red because it has to go through it see
other unhealthy manifestations and excesses it it causes cruel and
unusual punishment and torture a lot of sexual exploitation and
rape it treats women very horribly oppression of women and
minorities gross human rights abuses uh it's criminal it's barbaric
it's harsh it's brutal terrorism comes from it corruption and
theft especially corruption comes from it's very problematic many third
world countries are crippled by the corruption of stage red
it makes it impossible for that country to have a
decent style of living or job opportunities so goddamn corrupt
other excesses include irrational megalomaniacs irrational action lack of analysis
and oversimplification lack of a bigger plan no systemic thinking
trump is a perfect example of a zero systems thinking
sometimes conservatives push back and say that no leo trump
is a strategic genius he's playing the democrats he's playing
the media he's playing dumb actually he's smart no he's
not smart he's purely impulsive he's extremely good at exploiting
systems do not confuse the exploitation of systems for purely
selfish benefit out of uh irrational megalomania and narcissism do
not confuse that for systems thinking systems thinking go check
out my episode called intro to systems thinking systems thinking
is about understanding and studying how systems works the careful
mechanics of it and then nurturing that system for the
benefit of all in a selfless way stage red is
utterly incapable of this which you can see in trump
other excessive aspects are narcissism sociopathy and psychopathy as we've
talked about stage red tends to be like a bull
in a china shop i once posted a video on
my blog about trump it's a 30-second clip that shows
a deer accidentally walking into uh a barber shop like
a hair salon and this the deer just sort of
stumbles in through the glass door it breaks through the
glass with a door with its horns and then it
just it just it literally it's a it's a deer
in china shop sort of situation it just runs around
you know everybody is screaming and going crazy because it's
got his sharp horns and it's like it's hitting its
horn against the couches and the tables it's just knocking
everything around and then 30 seconds later it just runs
out the other window and it's gone and so i
said that this is the perfect illustration of the trump
presidency he's just a bull in a china shop and
what he's going to do ultimately the legacy of trump
is going to be you know when you look back
20 30 years later uh in the history book literally
it's just going to be the way it's going to
look is that trump came into government as a bullet
china shop he did a bunch of crazy irrational things
in all sorts of different directions none of it really
worked none of it was effective he broke a bunch
of institutions and norms and things and then he exited
he left and then we moved on and we had
to pick up the pieces and rebuild that's that's basically
he's a he's a chaos agent that's that's his that's
his role that's going to be his role he's not
capable of anything else because not only is he stage
red but he's deeply incompetent stage red if he was
competent stage red he would be sort of a hitler
stalin type of figure he would be very brutal but
at the same time you know he he could get
some stuff done but but he's too incompetent for that
so he's a unique mix of of red and stupid
at the same time uh he's also just very lazy
you know some stage red is like hard working you
know you take a look at someone like putin in
russia he has many elements of stage red in him
i think uh but he's well put together you know
he takes care of his body he exercises he um
he's smart he's intelligent he's very strategic he's cold he's
calculating he's he's he's he you know he's a brilliant
sort of geopolitical chess player um and brutal as well
bloodthirsty and ruthless at times as well corrupt as well
but uh but he he also is getting stuff done
for russia um trump unfortunately is not that and also
trump uh i mean russia is at a much lower
level of development than than america so putin for russia
is a relatively okay fit but trump for america is
is a no-go fit doesn't work uh stage red is
also a blabber mouth engages in a lot of bragging
as we see with trump uh only things about oneself
can't build quality relationships uh and ultimately the problem with
stage red is that you can't build a stable decent
peaceful civilization with stage red it's too unstable and one
of the problems with these dictators and tyrants is that
of course there's a lot of nepotism at stage red
which of course trump is very guilty of by appointing
his sons and daughters to positions that they have no
business being in because they're utterly unqualified and ignorant and
competent about how government works but this nepotism ultimately it
breaks down because it becomes a government of the ignorant
and the incompetent and uh and then how do you
transition even if trump became ruler for life he's pretty
old he would probably die in 10 or 20 years
anyways of natural causes and then and then what how
do you transition this is the age-old problem of every
authoritarian and dictator and monarch who's ever lived is that
even if you have an amazing king who does great
things and is very effective and very competent at the
cost of being a little bit you know too ruthless
and bloodthirsty that can still be tolerated but what happens
when the king dies of old age you have to
replace him but who do you replace him with you
have to elect somebody but with a king there's no
elections so he just picks some crony of his or
a child of his some some relative but that relative
is not going to be ever as good as the
king himself and so it devolves into utter incompetence and
then eventually they have to be kicked out there has
to be a coup because for a stable society it
needs to be competently run using reason strategy systems thinking
and science one of the problems with stage red is
that it's utterly unscientific which of course we also see
with trump you know when you have a serious scientific
problem like climate change or covid19 uh trump's response and
a stage reg response is to try to like bully
your way through this scientific problem but really it's a
problem for scientists to solve and you've got to listen
to the scientists and follow their suggestions here with these
sorts of issues you can't just bluster your way out
of climate change or a bad economy or uh or
some sort of pandemic doesn't work so ultimately red ends
up exhausting itself and undermining itself and that's what leads
it to then try to evolve into blue because it's
so chaotic that from red then we need to we
need to we need to build a stable civilization which
comes with discipline which comes with a sense of morality
which is what is developed in stage blue and lastly
the problem with red is uh the sort of toxic
masculinity and patriarchy that uh that be that that ends
up oppressing women so then you might wonder what are
the healthy and good aspects of red here are some
of them first of all it allows unification of squabbling
tribes so as bad as you might think saddam hussein
was as vicious as he was gassing his people and
so forth as they say removing saddam hussein as we
can see now has proven to be even worse led
to the rise of isis and uh you know terrorists
who run around beheading others what is that it's it's
an even further it's basically a fragmentation iraq used to
be a unified country under saddam hussein's rule he had
to rule with an iron fist and torture people and
murder people in order to maintain that cohesion there was
a certain benefit that came from that most people don't
don't appreciate the the value of that benefit but when
it falls apart and it all just turns into a
bunch of stage purple squabbling tribes who are trying to
do genocide on other neighboring tribes you can't even have
a state without a state that that country falls apart
and it gets eaten up by other countries who are
unified you know around the region like iran and um
you know israel is unified in that region and and
other you know turkeys unified there and so now they're
picking apart the carcass of iraq and syria and so
really what's going to have to happen in iraq and
syria is somebody else like saddam is going to have
to come together and unify them into a cohesive sort
of nation otherwise they're going to stay at stage purple
and that's not going to be good there's going to
be a lot of violence and um they're not gonna
be able to develop as a nation see a lot
of people today they don't appreciate that nations countries this
is a relatively new invention america is only like 250
years old as a country and other countries are even
younger than that italy germany we talked about these countries
as though they've existed forever for thousands of years no
they haven't there was no germany there was no italy
these were small city-states and regions that were always fighting
with each other someone had to unify these into into
solid countries and this was done only recently most modern
countries have only existed for like two three four hundred
years if even that some countries have only existed for
100 years try to really appreciate how innovative this idea
of a country is it's amazing that conservatives today a
lot of conservatives are so nationalists and they talk about
like loving our country loving america or whatever country you're
from uh but this in a sense this is the
idea of a country is such a progressive modern liberal
development if you were alive as a conservative 500 years
ago you wouldn't glorify the idea of loving your country
the idea of loving your country would be seen as
a radical utterly leftist utterly progressive uh oppressive tyrannical thing
because a country after all has to be unified by
some sort of higher power so the paradox of some
of these libertarian philosophies is that they they talk about
how um we want america to be free and all
this you know free from government oppression but the very
notion of a united states is already in a sense
the thing that the the the the libertarian would have
opposed when it was being built in the first place
i've talked about that in my lengthy video about why
libertarianism and not is nonsense so go check that out
if you want to know more uh other healthy aspects
of red so so anyways getting back to the healthy
aspects so why is that healthy unifying these tribes ultimately
is healthy because it allows us then to develop to
blue and to orange and to green into higher stages
it's necessary we can't live as little tribes that are
all fighting each other we need to unify so that's
very valuable even though it has a high cost you
have to appreciate that just because something has a high
cost doesn't mean that it's bad because the cost of
not doing anything might be even higher you see it's
all relative a cost is only high compared to something
else so sometimes you're forced to choose the lesser of
two evils which is what stage red is other good
aspects of red is that it's fast and decisive in
its action it's not a victim it doesn't sit around
and mope and and cry and talk about how it
can't do anything in a sense being a victim is
even worse than being a little bit hot blooded and
angry uh because at least when you're a little bit
angry and hot-blooded you're not in like the suicidal depression
you're able to accomplish things in the world which is
important you don't feel helpless the worst thing is when
you're utterly utterly helpless you can't even get out of
bed in the morning you're so helpless and then your
only option is basically to kill yourself so at least
red is not that also what's good about red is
that it stands up against bullies it protects against bullies
when you have a big bully you need another bully
to protect you against that bully so that's a valid
function of red appreciate that like if saddam hussein didn't
defend his people his people would be conquered by neighboring
countries like iran israel saudi arabia i don't know who
else is in that region turkey they would they would
pick that country apart so in a sense saddam hussein
was doing a favor for his people by being strong
even though of course it hurts them as well but
you know what hurts even more when some foreign bully
strong man comes in and then devours or exterminates your
people completely that hurts even more red can have a
sort of a noble warrior spirit at its best that's
also a positive aspect that you might want to even
deliberately cultivate so this list of positive stuff i'm telling
you because a lot of you guys who fancy yourselves
to be very advanced at stage yellow or green or
or orange you might think oh i have nothing to
learn from red red is just some evil bad stuff
that i i shouldn't even study no there's there's probably
aspects of red healthy aspects that you haven't fully realized
and developed within yourself so start developing these these are
good for example if you like to play victim a
lot or you're very indecisive then you might benefit from
from a bit more development of this stage red aspect
of yourself develop that noble warrior spirit stand up to
bullies be decisive rather than getting lost in analysis paralysis
uh take action more think less act from the gut
these can be positive things perhaps the most important function
of red is simply to survive and to thrive in
brutal environments when you find yourself for example in prison
if you do you might need to rely on red
to survive and to thrive in a prison environment there
are certain parts of the world certain eras you might
be born into maybe in a past life maybe in
a future life where you're going to have to rely
on red to survive and not just to survive but
thrive red is not just survival it's thrival in brutal
environments also what's nice about red is that it tends
to be pragmatic rather than superstitious and deeply religious it
doesn't tend to get stuck in religious fanaticism so much
although it can you know in in the middle east
for example uh with isis you know it's it's a
very toxic combination of both stage red um viciousness but
also sort of stage blue religious fanaticism is a very
toxic mix uh oftentimes red and blue mixed together like
with nazi germany that was a mixture of red and
blue um but also red can be secular like in
the mob uh it's not so much about religious fanaticism
another healthy aspect is that red offers rapid expansion of
civilization and conquest of territory this can be good it
develops a stronger nation of course comes at great costs
red can also be creative innovative and non-conformist so that's
good it's independent it can take care of itself it
doesn't mooch off of others it can find innovative solutions
to to survival challenges because it tends to have a
lot of ambition and it tends to just be very
opportunistic and to find find new ways of doing things
that a conformist society wouldn't be able to do the
statistics on stage read are as follows these statistics are
from the spy dynamics book it says there that roughly
twenty percent of the adult global population is stage red
and that this percentage holds five percent of the world
influence twenty percent of people with five percent of world
influence the style of government of stage red is clans
led by warlords and dictatorships an exploitative empire absolute monarchy
or tyranny totalitarian states it's very power driven conquest driven
very much about enslaving others rule through intimidation and stage
red tends to surge in times of uncertainty and crisis
for example if a giant meteor hit the earth and
wiped out half the population stage red would probably come
into resurgence because things would be very uncertain we would
be in a panic and in a crisis we would
need rapid action there's no time to sit around and
to deliberate and to be democratic and to care about
people's feelings because there's a lot at stake people are
dying it's an emergency situation there are loose nuclear weapons
we need order restored quickly so in this case most
likely what's going to happen is we're going to have
a military dictatorship for some period of time maybe for
a few decades in order to restore order it's going
to be bloody but it will be better than having
you know stage purple tribes running around with loose nuclear
weapons trying to exterminate each other and now let's talk
about how to transcend red what do you do if
you're at stage red or you have stage red elements
within you that you notice and you want to move
beyond them because you find them limiting or problematic well
like i mentioned in pulp fiction the character arc of
jules samuel jackson's character is is is actually a very
realistic example so the way it worked in pulp fiction
is that at the very beginning it's samuel jackson and
john travolta and they're basically uh bullying some some some
guys who owe their boss money they shoot a couple
of them um and then uh both of them almost
get killed because there's some guy hiding in the closet
he jumps out he fires his giant hand cannon as
they call it and all his shots miss he he
takes like six shots he surprises uh he surprises samuel
jackson and john travolta uh but he's such a terrible
shot that he misses all six shots from that revolver
and then they end up killing him and uh and
john both of these john travolta and champion jackson they're
both sage red gangsters but samuel jackson he has sort
of a religious you know he says that he says
that religious uh passage before he shoots that guy you
know um in that sort of flamboyant tarantino style but
anyways samuel jackson sees that he's a bit religious he
interprets this as a as a new lease on life
and he interprets that as a miracle and at the
end of the pulp fiction movie uh jules and john
travolta they're sitting there in the cafe and they're just
talking and then jules tells john travolta that you know
what happened to us is a miracle and i'm getting
out of the business and john travolta is sitting there
and he's like really no well i mean what are
you going to do we've always been gangsters how are
you going to make a living and jules just sitting
there he's like i don't know but i just i
just feel called to walk the earth and i feel
called to um you know to to raise myself to
a more you know moral higher standard and so basically
his arc was that he discovered that stage red is
too limited god gave him an uh you know a
second chance at life he was supposed to die this
was a miracle and that now this pushes him into
stage blue and then the movie ends there it's actually
a quite beautiful arc uh i think actually for many
people the way they get out of stage red is
they suffer so much they almost kill themselves or they
almost end up in jail or they almost maybe they
even get sent to jail when they get released or
they almost you know die of a drug overdose something
terrible like this and but then you know it it
shocks them awake and it awakens them to the next
level where they realize that their life is too chaotic
and that they need some discipline and order in their
life and so they commit themselves to a more ordered
existence they just say enough is enough and one way
in which that might happen is that they they find
god or religion i put god here in quotes because
it's not the real god this is the fake the
fake god the sort of judeo-christian god the anthropomorphic father
figure god of the old testament of religion of organized
religion so they find that maybe they join some church
maybe they they they have a born-again experience uh and
they sort of commit themselves to a more stable life
maybe they have a they get married maybe they have
a child and then that you know when they have
their child they sort of realize like what am i
doing all this violence and criminality and all this narcissism
now i have a little child i have to take
care of that and that might elevate them to stage
blue basically to to rise out of stage red into
blue uh you need to find some sort of higher
power than you a higher purpose a higher set of
principles or ideals a higher truth even if it's not
real truth it's not the you know truth of enlightenment
but some sort of truth whatever it is for you
maybe it's a sense of life purpose maybe it's volunteer
work maybe you wanna you wanna help addicts recover because
you used to be an addict it might be that
um maybe you used to work for the mafia and
now you're gonna go work for the fbi in order
to be an informant or to work with them you
know to dismantle the mafia you reform yourself that way
maybe you used to be an ex-convict and then or
a thief now you go work for a security company
helping to protect against other thieves like you maybe you
used to be a soldier or whatever and now you
reform yourself and now you start to advocate for peace
things like that some higher purpose uh you need to
open your mind to some kind of morality this is
not going to be some super advanced spiritual morality this
is going to be a morality that's very stage blue
a very rigid uh set of right and wrong black
and white morality it's not super advanced it's got its
limits which i discussed in stage blue but is sure
as hell better than than being this sort of reckless
bull in a china shop that you've been at stage
red if you want to evolve beyond stage red recognize
the limits of an egocentric life start to see the
collateral damage and suffering that you're causing to others start
to see that if everybody lives life like you do
if everybody acts like a bully the problem is that
there's always a bigger bully sure it feels great to
dominate others but what happens when somebody else becomes stronger
than you has more guns than you has more soldiers
than you has more power than you and then they
dominate you and dominate your family how are you going
to feel then not so good so after all this
fighting and violence at some point we have to come
to a truce and we have to realize you know
what i've hurt you you've hurt me this lifestyle can't
continue it's unsustainable otherwise we're going to annihilate each other
so let's just calm down let's set some rules let's
follow some moral principles so that we can create a
stable civilization and when you start to see the power
of that that's how you evolve beyond red recognize the
limits of violence and force as solving problems recognize that
really to create a quality society to have advanced things
to have complexity we can't use the tool of violence
and blunt force to deal with complex systems which an
advanced society needs uh you can't just deal with everybody
in a forceful way you can't deal with your children
in a forceful way you can't maintain a quality marriage
by using force and by controlling you know your wife
and so forth and getting angry at her and throwing
stuff at her and beating her it doesn't work you
need a softer approach also start to develop a sense
of guilt shame and remorse if you hit your wife
and you don't feel guilty about it you're still stuck
a stage red when you start to feel a little
guilty about it the reason you feel guilty is because
you actually use your awareness to realize like ah she's
crying she's suffering my children are seeing this they're also
suffering you know my friends are suffering this this sort
of lifestyle that i'm living it's so self-centered that it's
causing suffering then that causes me suffering to see other
suffering that causes me guilt and shame and remorse and
now that allows you to start to self-reflect and start
to say like ah yeah maybe there's some maybe i
am being a bit of a monster here uh maybe
i need to start to discipline myself start to mellow
myself out and a lot of times i think that
that's what happens with stage red people is that stage
stage red i think is very prevalent amongst teens you
know angsty teens and people in their early 20s maybe
30s once you start to mature past your 30s into
your 40s and 50s the testosterone comes out of your
system if you're a young male you you just you
calm down you become more pacified you've you've expended a
lot of your energy uh you've seen that it's only
led to misery and chaos and you just you're tired
of it and you just want to like settle down
and live a more peaceful life you you don't want
to be on the streets doing drugs anymore you don't
want to be involved in gangs anymore you're over that
you don't want to be you know punching people in
the face or getting into into bar fights anymore you
just want to calm down you want a nice family
a decent job a community church you can go to
have fun with your friends at the park whatever that
kind of stuff and this this comes a lot of
it comes just with age i think a lot of
people they grow up in abusive families and childhoods and
they don't get good educations they don't get good parenting
their parents are aren't there for them they're drug addicts
or they're violent or they molest them or rape them
and so forth and so coming out of this of
course in your teens if you have that kind of
childhood in your teens and 20s you're going to be
so lost you're going to be looking so desperately for
ways to survive or you're just living in a country
which is so underdeveloped and so corrupt that you have
no other way to survive so in your early you
know teens and 20s you're going to be just finding
a way to survive and you're going to be using
red for that and once you achieve you you either
exhaust that or you achieve a certain level basic level
of success material success or maybe you move out of
that environment that will allow you to to move into
blue develop compassion of course see the limitations of authoritarianism
start to see the importance of rules start to develop
discipline and work ethic a lot of times for example
parents will send their unruly children to a military academy
or a boarding school which is very strict or like
a strict religious institution why does that work of course
it doesn't always work but it can work because it
builds a sense of discipline work ethic and morality into
an otherwise stage read person basically they're sending a stage
red child or teen into a stage blue environment that
can be problematic but also it can work you know
it's better than having your child out on the streets
prostituting herself and doing crack set her to a boarding
school which is very strict teach her some you know
good old-fashioned christian morals you know scare scare the [
__ ] out of her with with talk of of
damnation and going to hell and and how the devil
is gonna you know burn you with fire if you
if you're a bad girl this sort of stuff it
can work it's it's crude but it could work uh
maybe study stoicism and stoicism might be sort of a
philosophy you can get into marcus aurelius is a good
example of a sort of stage blue stoic um stage
blue can be quite healthy when it's about work ethic
and discipline maybe join the military if you have no
sense of direction if you're hanging around in a bad
neighborhood where your only option is drugs and joining a
gang if your option is between that and going into
the military and the military you know sends you off
to some some other country you get to explore the
world you get camaraderie and friendship you're out of some
you know terrible drug drug filled neighborhood you don't have
access to drugs when you're in the military hopefully and
so forth and so maybe that's how you get your
way out and then of course also you can you
can parlay that military um uh stint you know five
years in the military whatever and then you can maybe
they pay for your college and then you can use
that to educate yourself so education is actually a very
good way to move up from red into blue and
orange start reading books consider going to a community college
or to a four-year university if you can maybe use
the military as a leverage to do that but of
course you could also just educate yourself you don't need
to go to college you can do it all yourself
if you're really ambitious and you're dedicated change your environment
that's a huge factor for many people stuck in red
if you're living in a deeply stage red country like
iraq or syria uh one simple fix is to find
your find your way out of that environment do whatever
you can to move to a high more highly developed
country whether in europe or even just within the middle
east maybe there's a more developed country in the middle
east you know if you're living in syria maybe you
can move to turkey i don't know i don't know
the details of that i understand it's difficult to move
and a lot of people don't have that option it's
expensive you need passports and visas and so forth and
permits um but you can also look for those opportunities
and if you could find it change your environment or
if you're stuck in the hood somewhere where there's gangs
and drugs you got to move out of that if
all your friends are heroin addicts you've got to change
your friends move to a different city different state different
country hang around with a different crowd that's huge huge
huge huge especially if you're an addict or a criminal
you know if you're if you're in the new york
mafia you've got to move out of new york move
to california where the mafia won't affect you where they
won't find you or they won't even be interested in
looking for you another thing you can do is you
can soften and explore your emotions more and explore your
feminine side more realistically this will be a difficult thing
for you to do because probably you're going to have
to go or you have to go to blue and
then even to orange before you start to really start
to explore your emotions and your femininity but if you're
if you're bold you can try it even at red
it would certainly help and try to find some community
support groups to move into blue oftentimes what helps is
support groups such as alcoholics anonymous or other kinds of
support programs or maybe joining a local community church where
you're able to interact with people in a more sort
of peaceful less violent less brutal way and their stage
blue values can rub off on you they can teach
you some discipline they can teach you how to fit
in and be a normal functioning member of society this
is basically what you have to do if you're a
criminal who's trying to reform himself and not get sucked
back into that kind of criminal lifestyle so there we
are that's stage read for you in conclusion remember that
stage red is not good or bad it's all relative
it has its pros and cons the reason it looks
so bad to us is because we're living in a
developed part of the world if you're watching my videos
you're an exceptionally developed person already just statistically speaking otherwise
you wouldn't be interested and you wouldn't stick around so
yeah for us for you and for me stage red
looks unconscionably evil but it's not evil at all it's
just survival remember everything you call evil is just survival
somebody else is using what you call evil to feed
his children and send them to school so red has
healthy and unhealthy manifestations of course in a highly developed
complex society like in america or in western europe a
stage red individual is not going to fit in most
of the stuff that stage red does is going to
look very unhealthy because it's so incongruous relative to the
level of development of of this part of the world
that we live in also remember that red is important
to evolve through people and societies have to evolve through
it you can't just skip it and also remember that
there are probably aspects of you even if you consider
yourself orange or green there are probably aspects of you
which are not fully integrating red if you're judging red
people and red actions if you are judging and demonizing
and calling red societies evil that shows that you haven't
really integrated understood red so there is more work for
you to do and the next stage of course after
red is going to be stage blue i already have
that episode published online you can go look for it
watch my entire series if this is the first one
that you're seeing and the last warning i want to
give you here before i sign off is this remember
that red is not a function of race ethnicity or
religion this is a common mistake that simple-minded people make
who have not made these careful distinctions in spiral dynamics
people will often blame black people or muslims or islam
or whatever they will blame them for being inherently less
developed inherently evil inherently barbaric inherently uncivilized this is the
sort of myth of you know western culture is the
greatest this conservative myth this is this is completely wrong
completely wrong yes generally speaking western civilization is more advanced
and more developed spirally than other regions and cultures in
the world let's say compared to the middle east but
this is not a moral superiority you have to be
careful not to turn this into a moral superior and
you have to be careful not to essentialize this and
to link it to something like genetics or dna or
you know the aryan race sort of myth um and
you want to be careful like with this thing about
you know black people just they don't have a high
enough iq or whatever and that they're they they are
just red because that's how they are black people all
black people are red no black culture is not red
parts of black culture is red because they've been very
oppressed for hundreds of years so that's very natural but
it can all evolve and change and remember cultures are
growing at different rates so just because western culture right
now is relatively advanced that doesn't mean that african culture
and middle eastern culture and black culture can't evolve relatively
quickly in the next 50 or 100 years to to
match up or even to rise beyond see so that's
very important otherwise you're going to be racist so don't
don't be a racist and also don't link it to
religion the way that sam harris does so sam harris
makes this mistake is he he says that islam is
a uniquely violent religion more so than christianity and all
others this is not this is not i understand what
he's saying and in a certain sense it's true but
in a deeper sense it's deeply misleading the reason it's
misleading because it tends to characterize all islam as being
stage red without acknowledging that there even is different stages
and it doesn't acknowledge that islam can rise above red
to blue and orange and green and and even turquoise
not only can it rise but it already exists at
these various stages of course in lesser degrees uh lesser
percentages um but but but this idea that islam is
inherently red because there's a couple of passages in the
quran which you know talk about violence this is this
is this is just scientifically and historically incorrect and that's
why people are pissed off at sam harris muslims are
pissed off at samaras because muslims know that there's different
gradations of islam and there's toxic versions of it and
there's more healthy versions of it and when you say
that all of islam uh or a large percentage of
islam is toxic stage red and has to stay that
way in a sense you're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy you're
dooming them to that and then you're getting a backlash
because of course there are many there are millions of
muslims in the world who practice islam at a more
advanced stage of blue or orange or even green and
yet sam harris would deny really islam the possibility of
rising to green which which is problematic because in practice
you're not going to be able to wipe islam off
the face of the earth in practice the only thing
that's going to happen is that you can evolve islam
out of red to blue to orange and to green
and then beyond and you're not going to do that
by demonizing islam you're going to do that by actually
explaining this stuff imagine for example if everybody in the
in the islamic community understood sprawl dynamics and understood the
different levels of islam and then they could clearly make
distinctions like oh those isis guys okay yeah they're stage
red you know the wahhabis but then you know in
iran most of them are stage blue and then in
maybe even other parts of the world or whatever um
other segments of islam are more like the sufis and
they're more green or more even turquoise and that's a
beautiful thing and there's you know there's value in that
and and then they could see like oh yeah so
what we have to do is we have to help
people at stage red and stage blue start to interpret
islam in a more stage green stage turquoise sort of
way how do we create systems that help to evolve
them and move them up because you're not going to
be able to to convince them to drop islam entirely
so that that's a more that's a more strategic sort
of spiral wizardry approach to that sort of thing so
you can you see how making these more nuanced distinctions
how how it is the solution to all of our
geopolitical problems we're not making nuance enough distinctions we're not
employing the correct models we're misdiagnosing the problems and then
people are fighting and blaming each other there's these culture
wars that are happening because we're not really understanding what's
going on at the psychological level in terms of developmental
psychology and consciousness and spirituality so this this is what
we're talking about here is the operating system which will
allow us to develop a more peaceful world so that's
that's the ultimate value of the spiral dynamics stuff all
right that's it i'm done here please click that like
button for me i put a lot of research and
work into this episode um and you can support me
on patreon with your donations patreon.com actualized you can come
check out my website right here at actualize.org you will
find um some useful resources you'll find my blog where
i post examples i post many many examples of spy
dynamics on my blog so check those out uh you
can also find the forum where i also i have
those mega threads go check those out with examples for
dynamics and you can discuss that stuff there we discuss
politics and other cool things there spirituality and so forth
uh check out my life purpose course check out my
my book list on my book list you will find
many books about politics development psychology and spot dynamics which
will take you deeper into understanding this material so that
you can see that i'm not just making this stuff
up i am pulling a lot of information from books
and from high quality resources that book list has some
of the most important books in the world that you
can read it will completely transform your life it's it's
totally worth the price go go check out my book
list so that's it for this one i just want
to remind you of a couple of final points about
spider-dynamics spiral dynamics even though i talk about it a
lot and i use it a lot i get the
sense that people fall into the trap of thinking that
i am just obsessed with spiral dynamics and everything is
all about spiral dynamics no spiral dynamics is a single
lens that i use to look at the world with
it's limited like any other scientific model uh i'm certainly
aware of its limitations maybe i'll shoot a whole episode
in the future talking about its limitations but it's just
one lens and ultimately you're gonna have to drop this
lens to really get to the highest levels of understanding
that i want to lead you to that i hope
you get to you will have to ultimately drop spiral
dynamics but still even though you transcend it remember it's
that old ken wilbur um saw of like transcend and
include you're transcending it but you're still gonna have it
in the back pocket to use in certain situations especially
when we're dealing with social and political situations and cultural
situations spiral dynamics will be very useful for that going
forward but also as you do your spiritual work and
you have awakenings and so forth we're going to go
beyond and i'm going to share other models with you
in fact i have uh several more episodes that i
want to shoot which i know you guys will love
which are going to be about developmental psychology but not
spiral dynamics so see spider-dynamics is one model within a
larger field called developmental psychology which is again just one
subfield of psychology as a whole so the developmental psychology
subfield has some amazing academics and authors who have talked
about other models not spot dynamics which in a sense
mirror what spider dynamics is talking about but they talk
about it from different perspectives like there's moral development we'll
we'll have an episode on moral development we'll have various
episodes about ego development so there's like six or ten
authors and academics who i want to introduce you to
and teach you about which will have different kinds of
developmental models which will hit upon different facets that spiral
dynamics either ignores or it will reinforce some aspects of
soil dynamics it'll just give you more lenses that you
can use to get an even more complex and more
nuanced understanding with more distinctions about how developmental psychology works
sometimes people criticize me and they say oh leo spiral
dynamics it's not very well peer reviewed it's not very
popular within academia it's not really truly scientific it's more
like pseudoscience um and that's partially true after all it's
a very complex model so it's it's difficult to quantify
it and it's difficult to measure it with formulas you
know the way that you can with physics or something
like that or with chemistry or biology even you know
the more the more abstract our models get the more
powerful they get in a sense the the more difficult
they are to prove in a strict you know laboratory
study the way that you can with lab rats or
something when you're testing a simplistic physical model so that's
just the nature of the beast but but also there
has been quite a bit of research done by other
academics and researchers outside of spa dynamics which validate and
mirror what spider dynamics basically is talking about and i
will be introducing you to that research there's papers and
books and and research that has been done on that
so um so the field of developmental psychology itself this
is a legitimate field this is a serious field with
serious academics in serious reputable institutions sitting around doing work
on it and this field is going to grow even
more in the future and there's very important insights from
developmental psychology because what we're talking about is personal development
how do you develop the human psyche what are the
different levels what are the different facets how does it
actually work what is the progression that typically happens that's
the value of developmental psychology that we can rely on
it to give us sort of a road map and
a preview of where we're going to go next and
where we were before and how we take people who
have not developed themselves and how do we help them
to develop themselves to the highest levels so if you
think about it this is like a new science which
is based upon the question of how do human beings
develop and what is the most optimum way to develop
human beings both individually and collectively as societies there's a
lot of science that can be done on that we
can spend the next 500 years researching this science coming
up with principles technologies ideas models and so forth all
of which will be crucial to get us to the
next level of human development and evolution also remember that
no individual person is purely one color so if you're
gonna go out there in the world looking for a
purely red person you're probably not gonna find it although
trump trump trump does a good job but uh but
even trump he's not purely red nobody is purely red
nobody is purely orange or anything it's a mixture it's
a mixture of this model is a is a mixture
of of nuanced layers so someone might have a red
core but then with a like a you know an
orange shell or aspects of blue mixed in there and
so forth so everybody has a certain percentage but also
people have a center of gravity so what you're really
talking about when we call someone red like when we
say trump is red what i really mean is that
his center of gravity is red that doesn't mean he
doesn't have orange aspects he does it doesn't mean he
doesn't have blue aspects he does he probably even has
a little bit of green aspects but mostly a massive
green shadow all right so there you go um i'm
still gonna do one more spiral dynamics episode which will
be the stage purple i will not be doing beige
because it's just so primitive that i don't think it's
it's worth our time uh but after i do the
purple one basically i'm gonna have all the stages um
the stage turquoise episode what happened with that one is
you can't find it on youtube because it actually got
taken down um for trademark violation and that's simply because
spiral dynamics that that term has actually been trademarked by
this biodynamics people and so i think what happened was
that they they disagreed with some of the ways in
which i characterized stage turquoise so they they forced youtube
to take it down uh it's a bit of a
dick move on their part um but uh i still
have the audio available on my website so if you
go to my website and you sign up to the
newsletter you will get a login to the actualize.org site
where you can log in and there you can access
all the audios and you can find spider-dynamic stage turquoise
and also try to re-upload that video to vimeo and
post it on my website so it'll be exclusively on
my website that will that will come probably in the
weeks to come so that stage records and then i'll
probably have a few more episodes that talk about spiral
dynamics not from an individual stage perspective but i will
just talk about more of the nuances of how to
apply spiral dynamics and how you can use it in
different situations like politics relationships business so forth so stick
around for all that and stick around for those developmental
psychology episodes those will be very illuminating for you you
