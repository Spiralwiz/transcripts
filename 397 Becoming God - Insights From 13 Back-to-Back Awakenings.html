            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ywHfNSwcCS8' target='_blank'>Becoming God - Insights From 13 Back-to-Back Awakenings</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Summary of Section 1</b>: 
</li><li><b>Leo's Solo Retreat Experience</b>: Leo shares his transformative experiences during his solo 30-day meditation retreat. He meditated 10-12 hours daily using various techniques and encountered significant struggles and boredom. However, he describes this period as extremely beneficial for spiritual purification.
</li><li><b>Incorporation of 5-MeO-DMT</b>: Seeking deeper experiences, Leo began using 5-MeO-DMT during the latter half of his retreat. His trips led to powerful awakenings that he describes as involving 'superhuman' levels of consciousness and surpassing previous spiritual insights. Each awakening felt progressively more total and profound.
</li><li><b>The Depth of Awakening</b>: Leo emphasizes the vast depth of awakening that isn't captured by simplifying it into stages. Experiences can greatly differ in their flavor and level of totality, and each awakening feels complete.
</li><li><b>Realization of God Consciousness</b>: Leo had a significant realization that he is God, not in a narcissistic or egotistical way, but emphasizing the unity of all - "I am God, you are God, I am you, you are me". This involves feeling and understanding oneself as God at a deep, cellular level.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Mechanics of God</b>: Leo explains that awakening does not only mean realizing oneself as God, but also understanding 'what' and 'why' God is, and the way reality is structured. Leo's awakening led him to perceive that he is eternally creating his reality through infinite intelligence and will, thereby embodying God-like qualities. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Accepting Oneself as God</b>: The concept of awakening for Leo involves radical identity shift from being a human born into society, to fully accepting oneself as God. Therefore, any spiritual teaching not explicitly guiding individuals towards understanding oneself as God seems lacking.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Highest Teachings</b>: Leo emphasizes that the highest teachings in spirituality comprise of three aspects: recognizing that you are god, acknowledging the infinity of god, and understanding that god is emptiness or nothingness. Investigating the various aspects and mechanics of god forms the basis of this teaching. Leo believes a profound understanding of these teachings is lacking in many spiritual teachers as they tend to underplay or hold back these insights.
</li><li><b>Undergoing Profound Awakenings</b>: Leo shares his experiences of profound and increasingly deep awakenings during his spiritual practice, enabled by the use of 5-MeO-DMT. These awakenings were so vast and profound, he believes they are equivalent to the levels of consciousness achieved by secluded yogis who practice intensely for years.
</li><li><b>Significance of 5-MeO-DMT</b>: Leo asserts that he would not have reached his current level of understanding through traditional meditation and self-inquiry techniques alone. In his experience, 5-MeO-DMT proved instrumental in accessing incredible states of consciousness that allowed him to gain deep metaphysical and existential insights.
</li><li><b>Addressing Psychological Obstacles</b>: During the process, Leo encountered two trips that were psychologically impactful rather than metaphysical. These journeys shed light on personal issues and obstacles in his path to self-realization, particularly his tendency to lie and be inauthentic.
</li><li><b>Honesty and Authenticity as Spiritual Necessities</b>: Leo realized the critical importance of honesty and authenticity in the path towards spiritual awakening. He became aware of the subtle ways he had been lying and being unauthentic, which included exaggerating, people pleasing, and holding back authentic feelings. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, he made further progress on his spiritual journey. 
</li><li><b>Issues With Conventional Spiritual Practices</b>: Leo expresses his belief that conventional spiritual practices such as meditation and self-inquiry, while valuable, are not sufficient to reach the deep levels of understanding that he achieved through the use of 5-MeO-DMT. 
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics in Understanding Reality</b>: Through his experiences, Leo posits 5-MeO-DMT as an ultimate tool for understanding reality at a metaphysical and existential level. He asserts that properly using 5-MeO-DMT can be more enlightening than numerous spiritual teachings. 
</li><li><b>Outlining Higher Spiritual Teachings</b>: According to Leo, the highest spiritual teachings consist of understanding that you are God, that God is infinite, and that God is nothingness. These teachings involve exploring the facets and mechanics of God and understanding why everything is the way it is.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Honesty and Authenticity</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the significance of being truthful, authentic, and honest in one's journey to realizing and embodying God, as God is pure truth. Individuals lie due to a fear of death, consequences, and struggles of survival. This fear clashes with the concept of God, who has no fear and is entirely truthful, leading to a need to surrender these survival instincts so one can become God.
</li><li><b>Purification Leading to Awakening</b>: Gura shares how confronting his own dishonesty and understanding the necessity of authenticity at a cellular level led him to experience a major awakening the following day. He believes total authenticity, in speech, actions, thinking, and more, is key to transcend to metaphysical experiences of higher consciousness where he could fully recognize himself as God.
</li><li><b>Insights on Awakening and God</b>: Continuing his regular practices such as meditation is recommended while experimenting with psychedelics. Although Gura feels 5-MeO-DMT offers more potent experiences, he recognizes that meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry are beneficial techniques for those who can't access the psychedelic. He stresses his understanding has surpassed even advanced Zen masters, acknowledging various degrees of awakening and comprehension.
</li><li><b>Reality and God</b>: For Gura, reality is divine, absolute, and infinite singularity. He likens reality to an eternal explosion, frozen in time, that extends to infinity in all directions, referred to as a fractal. God, seen as formlessness, is within which this fractal takes places. Perception of current existence as 'heaven' is also highlighted, emphasizing that 'heaven' is not a fantastical place, but the present moment, regardless of the perceived negative aspects. This viewpoint acknowledges the divinity and goodness of existence, despite human judgments and interpretations.
</li><li><b>Concept of Heaven</b>: Leo challenges the conventional idea of heaven as a physical place where everything is perfect. He emphasizes that heaven or hell is a product of an individual's state of mind or ego. If an egotistical person is placed in physical heaven, they will still experience dissatisfaction due to their judgmental and critical mindset.
</li><li><b>Ego and Perception of Reality</b>: The ego mind creates our perception of reality. Its nature to judge and criticize can prevent an individual from recognizing the perfection of their current existence. This understanding highlights that heaven or hell is largely self-imposed, based on our state of mind rather than our external circumstances.
</li><li><b>Everything as an Infinite Fractal</b>: Leo posits that everything in existence, from objects to the universe itself, is an infinite fractal with no beginning or end. This means an object or individual is always at the center of the universe, no matter where they are.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Infinity</b>: Conventional understanding of infinity often relates to numbers, but Leo insists that everything, from objects to concepts, is inherently infinite. Every moment of your life exists eternally, like one frame in a movie reel.
</li><li><b>No Limits of the Godhead</b>: The ultimate truth or "godhead" is characterized by total lack of limitation, as it exists prior to any physical or logical laws. This unlimited and unconstrained state is meant as a literal description beyond metaphorical or poetic renditions.
</li><li><b>Implications of Unlimitedness</b>: An unlimited object, according to speaker, could possess consciousness, intelligence, and life. It can will anything into existence and is infinitely intelligent. It also has the capacity to be formless or take any form it wishes. This is suggested as a precise description of God and our ultimate nature, implying that if we were truly selfless and unlimited, we would create an infinitely good, loving, and beautiful reality for all.
</li><li><b>Limited Perspective and Sense of Goodness</b>: Our limited perspective and self-interest often prevent us from recognizing the absolute goodness and beauty of the universe. Leo posits that God, existing outside our limited perspective, designs everything for the greater good, and any existing thing is inherently good.
</li><li><b>Non-Existence Doesn't Exist</b>: The concept of non-existence is merely a mental construct; in reality, everything that exists is inherently true. God is considered synonymous with existence.
</li><li><b>Intelligence Outside the Brain</b>: Leo contends that intelligence isn't limited to the brain. Instead, consciousness itself is intelligent. Consciousness is depicted as both unlimited and all-powerful, reinforcing the concept of no limitations.
</li><li><b>Infinity and Nothingness</b>: Leo suggests that infinity and nothingness are identical, though our perceptions can render them distinct. This is similar to interpreting a glass as either half-full or half-empty, showing that our understanding of reality is not black-and-white.
</li><li><b>Recognizing God in Our Bodies</b>: Leo emphasizes the potential to become conscious of how the will of God manifests into our physical forms. This realization is alluded to be a part of the awakening process.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Unlimitedness</b>: An unlimited object or entity is all-powerful, conscious, self-aware, intelligent, and sentient. It has no form or physical limitations, making it infinitely intelligent and capable of anything, including creation and alteration of reality. Leo emphasizes that this concept refers to the ultimate nature of individuals and God. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence and Power</b>: This refers to the capability to instantly materialize anything into existence through sheer intellect and willpower. An infinitely intelligent and all-powerful entity, such as God, operates without any limits. Such an entity is inherently selfless, creating a reality that is infinitely good, intelligent, and beautiful for everyone, not just a single organism or for its own self.
</li><li><b>Reality as a Product of Unlimitedness</b>: Reality, according to Leo, is meticulously designed and engineered for the greatest good of all. Nothing in the universe is arbitrary or random, but everything is part of an infinite design process governed by an infinite intellect. Even seemingly negative events are necessary components of this greater good. 
</li><li><b>The Influence of Myopic Perspective</b>: Leo argues that humans often view and judge the world through a narrow, subjective lens. This perspective, shaped by personal survival needs and egoistic tendencies, prevents individuals from seeing the absolute goodness and beauty of the universe and often leads to misunderstandings about seemingly negative events. 
</li><li><b>Existence as a Design Challenge</b>: Creating a universe with infinite interconnections and elements working seamlessly for the greatest good of all is an enormous design challenge that requires an infinite intellect. Drawing parallels to human professions like architects or web designers, Leo highlights the intricacy and difficulty involved in such a design process. Leo encourages viewers to appreciate the meticulous design of the universe as an illustration of God's infinite intellect. 
</li><li><b>The Butterfly as an Example of Design</b>: Leo uses a butterfly as an example to demonstrate the infinite chains of causation in the universe and the intricate, interconnected design of reality. The butterfly's existence is influenced by countless factors, like the gravity of every rock on Earth, temperature and pressure differences across the globe, and the trillions of living cells that constitute the butterfly itself. All of these components underline the complexity and precision of the universe's design.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of the Universe</b>: Leo discusses how every entity and event, no matter how minute or lofty, is intricately related. Every object, including butterflies, rocks, and stars, interacts through gravitational forces across vast distances, establishing an intricate network of cause and effect. Each object or event can be considered as having a seemingly infinite chain of causation, extending in all directions. Furthermore, these chains of causation affect even the smallest details of our daily lives. 
</li><li><b>Design of Universe Indicates Intentionality</b>: According to Leo, the complexity and interconnectedness of these chains of causation and the seamless functioning of all elements suggest an intentional design rather than mere accidents. This design extends to everything from the gravity of the Earth to the thickness and material of one's clothing.
</li><li><b>Investigation of Causation</b>: Leo explains that we could trace the reasons for any event or choice, such as choosing to wear a white shirt, through numerous interrelated causes, historical, geographical, and personal, all the way back to the Big Bang and beyond. Leo emphasizes that all events are effects of an infinite cascade of causes.
</li><li><b>Critique of Science's Limitations</b>: Science, Leo argues, usually analyses simple linear chains of causation, overlooking the complex network of causation that comprises reality. It fails to appreciate the holistic design and integration of trillions of chains of causation at work even in seemingly simple functions, like the flexing of a finger. Leo suggests this intricate and interconnected design points to an all-intelligent, all-powerful designer, or 'God.'
</li><li><b>Power and Design of God</b>: Leo proposes that God, configured as an object of infinite power and intelligence, has designed an optimally functioning, wholly good universe. Leo disputes the notion that God could be neutral or produce anything bad. They affirm that infinite intelligence aligns with infinite goodness, implying that any seemingly bad or evil event is a product of the viewer's limited perspective, not of God's design.
</li><li><b>Human Limitations and Misunderstandings</b>: According to Leo, human limitations, selfishness, and lack of consciousness prevent us from recognizing the absolute goodness of the universe. Humans' perceived necessity to survive and compete leads them to act selfishly or 'badly.' Leo reiterates that if humans were truly unlimited, intelligent, and selfless, they would not create or do anything bad or evil.
</li><li><b>Realization of Absolute Goodness</b>: Leo highlights that bad or evil actions occur due to survival instincts and fear of death. As God is eternal and without fear, God can only create good. Absolute love and selflessness would manifest in the creation of only good and inherently beneficial realities.
</li><li><b>Existence and Goodness</b>: According to Leo, existence is inherently good because it was designed with infinite forethought and calculation for the good of all. This challenges the idea of dichotomy in existence (good vs evil), instead suggesting a monistic approach where everything that is, is good, and "evil" is a product of a limited, non-absolute perspective.
</li><li><b>Non-Existence and Opposite of Existence</b>: Leo argues non-existence doesnt really exist. It is only an idea crafted by the human mind. Gods existence is unopposed and eternal, and the concept of non-existence only exists as an idea in human minds.
</li><li><b>God Consciousness</b>:
</li><li>Leo represents his awakening as an instantiation of God creating the infinite universe through sheer will, with intelligence far beyond human understanding. 
</li><li><b>Authentic Love</b>: Beyond reason, logic, or cognition, Leo posits that total metaphysical understanding is attainable through what he describes as "pure intelligence", which is the true essence of consciousness, and synonymous with truth, being, and love. To realize this, one must align their life with divine goodness, despite its seeming unrealistically good nature.
</li><li><b>Infinite Complexity</b>: Leo underscores that the universe, far from being a set of all possibilities, is the set of the best possibilities - a perfect design conceived out of infinite goodness and love. Understanding this becomes challenging due to our limited perspectives. Therefore, its necessary to surrender our small, ego-centric perspective to embrace the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent divine consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Integration into Daily Life</b>: Leo emphasizes that despite the awakening experiences, he still struggles with ego problems. Therefore, continuous work is required to ensure integration of these insights into one's everyday life.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing the Journey of Awakening</b>: Leo stresses that while he has made significant strides in his spiritual journey, he is not claiming to be the most enlightened person. He underlines that he has merely gained access to rare spiritual experiences that few are able to reach.
</li><li><b>Awakening versus Liberation</b>: Leo makes a distinction between awakening and total liberation. An awakening experience is a glimpse into the god consciousness, but achieving total liberation involves inhabiting this state constantly, which, according to him, is a much more challenging and arduous journey.
</li><li><b>Challenges in the Process of Awakening</b>: He openly shares that while he has these profound spiritual experiences, he remains human with everyday concerns such as bad habits, anxieties, and financial worries. The process of integrating spiritual insights and teachings into everyday life is an ongoing task.
</li><li><b>Future Goals and Plans</b>: Going forward, Leo aims to be more authentic in his life and teachings. He acknowledges that he still has work to do to fully awaken, and he plans to embrace this journey in a more holistic and organic way. His goal is not just to have isolated moments of enlightenment but to live in a state of constant god consciousness.
</li><li><b>Evolution of His Teachings</b>: Leo reveals his plans to evolve his teachings to become more embodied and less analytical. Regardless, he reassures his audience that he will continue to provide detailed analyses, technical details, and practical topics.
</li><li><b>Future Chapter of Total Liberation</b>: Leo sees himself on the brink of a new chapter in his life, moving from success in business to total awakening and liberation. He expects this journey to take several more years and is excited for the transformative experiences to come. While he's uncertain of what will follow complete liberation, he remains open and accepting of whatever might unfold. 
</li><li><b>Closing Message of Hope and Inspiration</b>: Leo closes his discussion by expressing his hope that his sharing has inspired listeners to seek and embark on their own spiritual journeys towards awakening.
