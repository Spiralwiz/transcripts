[Music] so i've reached a new level of awakening that
i want to tell you about if you're interested in
something more practical less lofty and metaphysical then you might
want to skip this episode otherwise here we go so
as you know i've been awakening a lot and over
the last few years and especially many of my awakenings
were very solid cystic i've talked about that in the
past and i've been struggling to integrate this solipsism for
for years now really i would say that like probably
my last 30 or more awakenings were revealing a deeper
and deeper form of solipsism and my mind had to
struggle to to make sense of it to integrate it
into ordinary life and that sort of thing and i
know that many of you who've been following along have
also struggled with that and have a lot of questions
about that which i've answered here and there and i've
alluded to and so forth but there was even even
though like my awakenings have become really deep and i
successfully integrated a lot of the solipsism stuff and kind
of got over gotten over it personally but still there
was something in the back of my mind that was
always bugging me about that like i couldn't quite put
my finger on it but there was something there like
i could tell that there was there was more to
be revealed and so i started really wondering okay like
what could be missing what could i be missing let
me try to disprove my deepest awakenings as best as
i can not for the sake of anybody else but
just for my own sake because as i've talked about
with self-deception you know self-deception is possible even when you're
awakening self-deception is possible in the sense that you can
misinterpret your awakening or you can come back into ordinary
life and then have ideas about it that aren't quite
right that sort of thing so i wanted to see
the next time i woke i wanted to see and
really like push myself to try to disprove it and
this is what happened when i did that i had
one of my awakenings and it was sort of the
usual solipsistic sort very profound of course but by this
point i've had so many of them that i'm kind
of comfortable with that headspace but i decided to go
deeper i decided to really like start from scratch you
know throw away every idea about awakening that i had
all the teachings and all of my own ideas and
all of my past awakenings like throw it all away
like really go back to the drawing board as close
to a blank slate as possible and re-enquire completely from
scratch as it were and of course the inquiry is
who am i what am i and what is god
like really really rock bottom at rock bottom what is
it and so i entered into a state of very
profound non-knowing where i threw away everything and you might
wonder well leo haven't you done that before and of
course i have to various degrees um but this time
like i was really in a sort of not knowing
headspace i went very very deep with it um because
i felt like you know the thing that happens that
you have your awakenings then you start to develop ideas
and theories and you sort of make sense of those
awakenings and that sort of adds like conceptual baggage on
top of them and over time as you're doing that
you do sort of build up like a a sort
of you might call it a meta world view like
yes in awakening you're transcending all beliefs structures and all
ideology and even all spiritual teachings ideally you're translating all
of that but even as you do that still you
come back and you still you still develop beliefs about
it you still have ideas about it you still have
to have to make sense of it to yourself somehow
you still have to talk about it in my case
i still have to communicate it and teach it and
so forth and so that does build up a sort
of like meta baggage metal meta conceptual baggage so it
can be good to once in a while just completely
wipe the slate clean because that stuff can be distorting
and coloring how your future awakenings unfold and maybe it
holds you back from the deepest awakenings possible so i
did that i wiped the slate completely clean it's just
a very profound sense of not knowing and you know
a little extra point to this is that look especially
once you've had you know if you've done a lot
of psychedelics if you had a lot of awakenings if
you've done a lot of meditation do a lot of
spiritual study you can develop a sort of like spiritual
arrogance in the sense that you tell yourself well like
i've already experienced so much i've awoken so much and
so deeply and i've studied all this material so like
now surely i there's nothing i could possibly even be
missing and that's of course exactly where you could fall
into a trap right so you have to be aware
of that how that can be a trap hopefully you're
aware of that so anyways you know of course i've
always been aware of that so in this in this
whole experience like i really wanted to like confront the
possibility that somehow i'm fooling myself so that's the intention
i went in with then so i'm in a state
of profound not knowing and then i notice just how
much everything all insight all understanding about reality and about
self is locked behind a profound fear just this deep
primordial fear of coming to face to face with truth
or with with reality beyond what you've previously known and
so i felt a bit of that fear it's like
well [ __ ] i'm letting everything go you know
what what am i afraid of well what if something
comes up what if something is revealed to me that
contradicts everything that came before so there could be that
kind of fear uh or just uh there's a very
primordial fear of like well what if what if the
truth is ugly and horrific and something awful will be
revealed to me you know a lot of times we
talk about beautiful truths about god and love and the
liberation from suffering you know this kind of stuff but
then in the back your mind you're like but what
if reality isn't actually like that what if if you
if you let go of all that stuff and you
go like even deeper let's say beyond all that you
question all of that what if deep down what you
find is something horrific and you're afraid of that you're
afraid of admitting you've been wrong like what if you're
fundamentally wrong about not just your materialistic worldview but even
your spiritual worldview and in my case you know what
if i'm wrong about the things that i've been teaching
that's of course a kind of fear that you would
have as a teacher because uh when you're teaching thousands
of people you know it's a big responsibility hopefully you're
aware of that and then if you're misleading all those
people and if you've been misleading them for years that
would be a very big fear that you might face
as a teacher for example and of course there could
be many other kinds of fears that you might have
um but anyways i sort of i i recognize this
fear and uh but i also fully accepted it and
i was willing to just be honest and to see
whatever the truth was i was willing to look at
it regardless of the fear and that's a key point
for you here in this work is that whatever your
fears are in spiritual work eventually you're gonna have to
face them because the truth you're gonna find that the
truth and the greatest love is always found locked behind
your greatest fears this is a common theme throughout all
of human mythology and the hero's journey and i mean
the hero's journey is basically talking about the spiritual journey
and the reason most people don't go looking for the
truth is because it's scary they're afraid of what they're
going to find and in most cases they have good
reason to be afraid because most people's lives and their
minds and psyches and worldviews are constructed on foundations of
sand really no foundation at all it's just a house
of cards and as soon as you start pulling on
those cards the whole house is going to fall apart
very quickly and so that's scary if your career is
based upon a house of cards that's going to collapse
if your relationships or your marriage is based on a
house of cards that can collapse if your religion or
ideology or scientific worldview is based or your like career
as a public intellectual is based upon a house of
cards which all of it is basically that's going to
fall apart your you know your political ideologies those will
fall apart so people who have built up grand houses
of cards and then they rely upon those for their
survival to feed themselves to feed their children and their
family to take care of them to give them sex
and love and approval and status and reputation all you
know all the goodies that the ego wants various kinds
of pleasure as well um if your house of cards
is providing that to you you're going to be very
afraid of looking underneath the foundation of your house of
cards because you're going to discover that it's just a
house of cards and so anyways that was just an
aside but then anyway so i go beyond this this
primordial fear and then uh as much as i'm trying
to disprove the solipsism i can't i can't disprove it
it's just i'm in an absolute state of consciousness and
it's absolutely apparent to me that there is no other
but myself i am completely alone and so at this
point it's just a recapitulation you know it's kind of
like i'm i'm punching at a brick wall thinking that
maybe i can punch through it but here i'm punching
at it and i can't punch through it and so
this just reaffirms my past solipsism and i i become
i focus my mind on this aspect of absolute consciousness
and myself as being absolute consciousness of the sovereignty the
absolute sovereignty of consciousness the absolute sovereignty of god myself
as god and at this point i'm in a complete
god mode god consciousness and so i'm just exploring this
god consciousness and contemplating it as it's you know as
i'm in it and i'm just wondering like in awe
at the sovereignty now uh i've talked about this sovereignty
point before in the past i especially have a video
called how authority works which talks about this point very
important video um that a lot of people still i
don't think have grasped who follow my work so go
rewatch that one but anyways yeah the sovereignty see god
is absolutely sovereign you understand this you know what does
this mean god is absolutely sovereign it means that because
god is one because god is alone and god is
all there is god is conscious and infinite consciousness this
consciousness is completely sovereign onto itself now if you don't
like the word god and you want to use the
word universe you could use that or if you want
to use the word reality you can use that these
are all synonyms see if you're coming at this from
a more materialistic scientific perspective you can just use the
word reality and just kind of like ask yourself you
know if reality is infinite if there's only one reality
reality is sovereign onto itself you see that there can't
be something outside of reality that places limits upon or
dictates or mandates to reality reality is sovereign that means
it's self-determining a way to another way to put it
is to say that whatever reality wants however reality wants
to be it can be that way without anyone stopping
it who would stop reality from being however way it
was now this is kind of weird to hear if
you're like a scientific divided person because you would say
well leo reality doesn't want anything so you're anthropomorphizing reality
um yeah i get that but you don't understand that
it's not that i'm anthropomorphizing reality it's actually your demystifying
reality you're materializing reality you're not seeing reality as a
mind or as a consciousness you're you're de-spiriting reality and
that's why to you it seems like i'm anthropomorphizing reality
um but actually reality wills itself to be however it
wants it's sovereign that's what god is god is sovereign
if you just kind of like intuitively think about the
notion of god the concept of god would the concept
of god make any sense if god was a subject
to some but some other power or authority outside of
itself beyond itself second to itself like if you came
to god and you said hey god you know uh
you know make me some vanilla ice cream and god
say well i can't and you'd be like well why
you're god you can do anything and god would say
well no but there's somebody above me telling me that
i can't it's like no right that doesn't make sense
for the concept of god just intuitively it doesn't make
sense that wouldn't be god in this case in that
case what would be god is the thing that's above
the thing that's setting the limit on making the ice
cream that would actually be god so if you go
to god and then say god do something for me
then god says no i can't do that and then
you say why and then god says well because the
laws of physics prevent it or because it's not possible
within time and space or within the laws of this
universe you see that can't work either because you can't
appeal to laws or to to physics or to limits
of time and space or or to limits of logic
even you can't appeal to these things because these things
would then be god if you're saying that god is
limited by physics that means physics is god and then
you have to just then you have to skip the
middle man whoever you're calling god in this case skip
that guy and go straight to physics go to the
real god and then ask ask physics okay physics be
some way for me that i want you to be
and then see if physics if you could talk to
physics and physically say well no but i can't do
that why not why can't you do that and then
physics will say well i can't do that because because
why there would have to be something else beyond physics
that is limiting physics or physics could say well i
don't want to do that because i'm determining my si
i want to be the way that i am right
i want to maintain the physics as it is now
in this case it's not that physics can't change is
that physics doesn't want to change because physics is self-determining
see but in this case now physics is sovereign it's
sovereign because it can change but it doesn't want to
but if it wanted to it could nothing is stopping
it but itself that's what sovereignty fundamentally means is that
it doesn't mean you're not limited per se but it
means if you are limited you're imposing that limit upon
yourself and that limit could change if you changed your
mind or your attitude so reality is absolutely sovereign god
is absolutely sovereign if you haven't awoken to that yet
then i highly recommend that next time you're going to
be awakening or doing some psychedelics or contemplating this stuff
that you contemplate this issue of sovereignty and come face
to face with the fact that you are absolutely sovereign
so anyways this this was not new to me i
already knew this but i just i sort of focused
on this fast remember i talked about how awakening and
god has many facets i have an episode called the
many facets of awakening where i describe a couple dozen
different facets well this is one of the facets is
sovereignty so i was just focused on that facet a
lot in this experience in this awakening and i was
very conscious that i am forever locked into my own
consciousness as god i can't break outside of my own
consciousness because my consciousness is everything it's absolute and it's
unlimited but then as i was sort of like retreading
this was old ground that i was just kind of
like retreading in this in this awakening then some new
insight hit me that came completely out of the blue
and and shocked me and that insight was that wait
a minute if i'm absolutely sovereign why can't there be
another sovereign totally separate for me as though like in
a separate dimension why can't i be completely sovereign over
here and then some other consciousness can be completely sovereign
onto itself now if that was the case at first
it might seem well no that that can't be the
case because how can you have two sovereigns wouldn't they
contradict and conflict with each other well they would if
they were in the same reality than they would which
is why the only way this could work is that
if it's completely sovereign it has to be completely sovereign
onto itself utterly disconnected from the other sovereign like in
another dimension so to speak except this other dimension would
be would have to be so separate from my consciousness
and my reality that it would even have to be
outside of my notions of dimensionality because if if my
consciousness includes many dimensions and infinite dimensions in it then
this sovereign has to be even outside of all those
dimensions because if it was in one of the dimensions
that i could imagine then it would be part of
me and then it would contradict my sovereignty which would
not be possible because i'm absolutely sovereign so this possibility
opened up to me and i first i was like
nah that's kind of it can't that can't be and
i thought about it some more and i realized it
can be of course it can and that in fact
that's exactly what it means to be absolutely sovereign to
be absolutely sovereign means that you're so isolated into your
own solipsistic bubble that there can be an infinite number
of such solipsistic bubbles all completely disconnected from each other
completely sovereign onto themselves and so at this moment i
awoke to the fact that i am god but there
but what it means for me to be god and
for me to be absolute and sovereign is that there
can be an infinite number of other absolute consciousnesses like
myself forever disconnected from me doing their own thing and
that in fact this is necessitated by my own sovereignty
that this is the case i awoke to this insight
that there can in fact be infinite gods and i
don't just mean gods with a lowercase g but i
mean infinite gods with an uppercase g this was new
territory for me i had not considered this possibility before
if you would have told this to me just verbally
conceptually in the past i would have said no that's
not possible that's silly there can only be one god
one infinity one absolute one sovereign otherwise it contradicts that
but as i was actually awakening this wasn't just some
logical deduction that i did and this wasn't just some
activity of conceptualizing mind or some sort of like speculation
or theorizing this was part of my direct experience and
my awakening is that in fact this is a possibility
and not only is it a possibility but it's it's
almost necessitated by my own sovereignty which is just to
say that there can be an infinite number of realities
like my reality because when we're talking about god we're
just talking about reality but notice for there to be
an infinite number of realities they have to be completely
disconnected from each other because as soon as they can
form any kind of connection they immediately become part of
this reality that you're experiencing that you are so it's
a little bit tricky but at the same time as
this was happening i was also conscious that this possibility
of other gods sovereign onto themselves like me locked into
their own solid cystic realities that this is still just
a figment of my own consciousness because how else am
i thinking about this how else am i conscious of
this possibility other than as part of my own consciousness
obviously right so i am imagining this possibility but then
there is the possibility that i'm not just imagining it
as a possibility but that it is a reality beyond
my imagination of it as a possibility now of course
even that is still part of my consciousness part of
something that i'm imagining so i am god imagining the
possibility of other gods but as i'm kind of like
my consciousness is struggling grappling with the logic of this
it's a sort of like a very high level kind
of logic a divine logic and absolute logic you might
call it what i realized that what it really means
to be god is to have infinite absolute copies of
oneself that's an additional wrinkle to what god is and
then another insight came to me a new insight that
i can be conscious that because i am god i
can absolutely know that i can absolutely never know that
other gods even if they exist um i can never
absolutely verify that because i'm forever locked into my own
sovereignty but i can be conscious that nothing is stopping
them from being sovereign onto themselves and what was so
amazing about this insight is that it's not merely that
i was speculating about this as a possibility or i
was thinking like well maybe there are other gods but
i can't really know i absolutely knew that they could
exist and i absolutely knew that i could and i
was absolutely conscious that i could never know or validate
it because i'm completely locked in to my own solid
cystic bubble you see do you see that subtle subtlety
there it's not that i don't know it's that i
know for sure that i can never know and this
is a real like paradox because you might wonder well
but leo how is it possible for god to not
know that shouldn't god be able to know everything isn't
that part of omniscience in the past i would have
said yeah i would have agreed with you but this
awakening revealed to me that actually you can become directly
conscious absolutely conscious that it's not possible for you to
know precisely because you are sovereign if there's something outside
of your absolute sovereignty you can never know it if
there's a second absolute sovereign you know you can't know
it yeah it's very paradoxical um and so i became
conscious that i could have infinite copies of myself and
it wouldn't contradict my own sovereignty because actually that's what
sovereignty entails in a weird paradoxical way but then i
thought well well i can never i can never validate
this i can never connect with those other gods because
of this problem of sovereignty because they are sovereign onto
themselves so if they don't want to let me in
they don't have to let me in you see my
sovereignty can't really override their sovereignty you see you sort
of have a clash of absolute sovereignties if there's one
sovereign entity over here and one sovereign entity over here
this one can't really impose its sovereignty onto this one
because they're equally sovereign but then a new insight came
to me as i was mulling this over is i
said to myself but wait a minute i'm god i'm
unlimited if i'm unlimited why can't i form a connection
with another god it should be possible because if it
wasn't possible that would contradict my infinitude it would make
me finite it would make me limited and since i'm
god i can't be limited i have to be unlimited
and so then i thought to myself why can't i
make a connection to another god what would stop me
and then i woke to the fact that nothing of
course could stop me and so i of course i
attempted to make a connection to another absolute sovereign consciousness
like myself so at that moment i broadcast the intention
to connect to another absolute sovereign consciousness out beyond the
edge of my consciousness so i basically said i sort
of like i said to myself almost like if there
is a sovereign consciousness out there identical to me that
is distinct from me and disconnected from me and sovereigned
onto itself and i'm sorry not to myself i want
to broadcast a connection out to try to connect with
that consciousness and so i did that i sent so
i sort of like sent the message out into the
universe you might say and then of course a connection
was formed and there was a absolute sovereign consciousness beyond
my own that i was able to how would i
put it recognize become conscious of and succeeded in forming
a telepathic connection to it instantly recognized itself in me
and i recognized myself in it and we recognized that
we were both reaching out to each other so as
i reached out it immediately reached out back to me
because it was fully awake like i was so we
were both fully awake and this would only work if
both are fully awake at the same time and so
it was one god reaching out to another god so
now two absolutes recognized each other for the first time
so to speak we are awake in parallel recognizing our
awakeness together i am it and it is me it's
really twisted and very paradoxical it really felt like a
telepathic connection to another absolute consciousness that's what it felt
like it was an awakening unlike i've ever had before
and unlike i've ever heard anyone else talk about i
haven't heard any spiritual teachers or enlightened masters talking about
this kind of thing so it took me totally by
surprise i didn't go looking for this i didn't expect
this i didn't go into this experience trying to you
know create this it it just kind of hit me
out of the blue that's why i was so shocking
and amazing at the same time because in the past
i've had very profound awakenings but here what happened is
that as i was having my awakening i basically connected
to another awaken singularity and then we awoke and we
were having our awakening together it was like a a
dual two awakenings cup two independent awakenings coming together and
merging together and awakening at the same time as one
and it was it was a very surreal experience incredible
mystical experience there were some interesting wrinkles to it so
one of the wrinkles is that we both recognized that
we could just be dreaming each other and we could
be dreaming this connection and that this connection could just
be purely imaginary and as we were both recognizing that
we were so interconnected like our minds were so interconnected
that whatever like i was thinking it it was seeing
and whatever it was thinking i was seeing it was
almost like we were kind of like contemplating in tandem
and whatever insight i was having it was recognizing whatever
insight it was having i was recognizing and so we
were both like co-inciting together you might say having insights
in tandem and sort of like bouncing our insights off
each other that's what it meant to form that connection
this it wasn't just happening verbally through language this was
like it was a connection of pure consciousness like my
consciousness was completely accessible to it and its conscious was
completely accessible to me once this connection was formed but
then i started inquiring like but but what is this
connection is this connection actually real that's what i was
wondering is this entity i'm connecting to actually real or
is it part of just my own psyche and what
i became conscious of is that what it means for
me to be absolutely sovereign is that i can't ever
know that i can't actually distinguish between those two two
possibilities and that consciousness mirrored my own recognition that it
also can't know whether the connection is for me with
me is real or imaginary and that in fact is
the very evidence of our sovereignties that's what it means
to be sovereign is that you can never know anything
outside of your own consciousness it's absolutely impossible to know
and we both recognize this not knowing and we basked
in it simultaneously at once and it was such a
delicious like there was this feeling of just pure ecstasy
and bliss and deliciousness to this recognition we were co-recognizing
it together i mean if i was to describe it
in poetic language and really the way that it felt
to me it literally felt like having sex like having
metaphysical sex with god that's what it felt like it
was like two gods having metaphysical sex with each other
of course it wasn't physical it was metaphysical it was
purely in the like platonic realm this connection was formed
there was a profound flowering of love of of infinite
love that flowed from this recognition of not knowingness and
yet at the same time the possibility of this connection
and the recognition that this connection it didn't matter whether
this connection was imaginary or whether it was real because
there's no difference between what's real and what's imaginary that's
part of what it means to be awake is to
know that there is no such difference the fact that
i can't know if i'm actually connecting to another god
that's not a mistake that's a feature that's not a
bug and the recognition that that's a feature of your
absolute sovereignty this is the most delicious aspect of this
awakening that itself is the awakening that itself is god
recognizing god this is the logic the necessity of god's
structure and is being recognized by god not just by
me but by that other god and we're doing it
simultaneously and the recognition that the difference between this being
actual versus being an imaginary connection the recognition that there
is no difference between those two that is what creates
the connection that is what love is so it's a
mistake to focus on this difference because the difference itself
is imaginary now you might wonder well leo so did
this contradict solipsism does this mean solipsism is false the
answer is no because that other god is always just
part of my own consciousness so solipsism is never broken
here and yet it feels like a deeper version of
solipsism believe it or not it's like an additional next
level of solipsism because as soon as i make a
connection to any other god out there uh it's already
part of my consciousness that's the only way the connection
can be made and therefore as soon as i connect
with it i become it it becomes part of me
and so it's still just all me there's never anything
outside of me even if i find something find something
outside of me and recognize it it me immediately my
finding of it and my recognition of it makes it
part of me and so in a sense all that's
happening here is my own sense of me as god
is expanding so no other is ever really being found
as soon as another is found it's immediately integrated into
me it's as though infinity is trying to break outside
of itself by imagining another and then it succeeds temporarily
because it's unlimited so it finds something but as it
succeeds it recognizes that it is imagining that other and
therefore it merges that other into itself infinity here you
have to think of it as this dynamic for forever
expanding force like a shock wave moving out through space
it's like a rolling wave in an infinite space reverberating
through and it has like a leading edge you might
say imagine that our physical universe has an edge but
that edge is moving at the speed of light expanding
outwards forever you can never like go beyond the edge
because the edge is the fastest thing that there is
there's nothing outside the edge it kind of feels like
that like consciousness is forever expanding and you usually you're
not at the edge of that consciousness but in this
case when you're very very conscious and you're so awake
that you're like at the highest levels of awakening possible
you literally can get to the edge of it but
then as you get to the edge of it you
see that the edge keeps just rolling outwards outwards in
all dimensions all possible ways and you can ride the
edge of that wave but any time you get beyond
it that trying to get beyond it is the rolling
of the wave so you can't get beyond it because
every every movement to get beyond it is the thing
that's pushing it outward more so you become that wave
rolling outwards and everything that wave touches gets incorporated into
itself because it's always expanding out into not something else
but into itself really you might frame it as or
phrase it as consciousness is expanding out into unconsciousness and
as soon as consciousness expands out into unconsciousness it becomes
consciousness and therefore there's only consciousness you might say well
what about the unconsciousness well the unconsciousness is part of
your consciousness it's kind of tricky so any sense of
other can only be temporary before infinity absorbs it incorporates
it into itself by expanding its consciousness of itself so
really what was happening here when i was forming this
connection is i was just expanding my consciousness of myself
as god all others that i am ever conscious of
are me but there could be multiple absolutes like me
and since i'm always locked into my own absoluteness that's
just the nature of what it means to be god
so you can also think of this as god as
an infinite fractal god when you say god what that
means is an infinite number of singularities all absolute onto
themselves all self-similar nested inside of each other to infinity
that's really what it means to recognize yourself as god
is to recognize that there's an infinite number of gods
within you and within those gods are an infinite number
of gods like you it's a mind [ __ ]
for sure it's very paradoxical the paradoxes here are not
a mistake they're a feature so of course then i
realized that it's not just one god that i could
connect to but i can recognize an infinite number of
godheads like myself and all of us connect can connect
together telepathically merging into each other and it's not like
those gods are different those godheads are different for me
they're actually identical to me they're just like identical copies
though now they could be doing whatever they want they
can be dreaming their own dreams independent dreams of what
i'm dreaming but their fundamental nature is infinity infinity is
their is their true nature and that's consistent across all
of them and then what it what they're particularly dreaming
you know whether they're dreaming of being a cat or
a or a mouse or a human or a man
or a woman or whatever you know that's that's up
to them and i could never know that so then
i started thinking along the following line of like okay
well let's just let's just suppose let's just kind of
speculate here for a minute assume that there were an
infinite number of godheads and they can all be dreaming
their own independent sovereign dreams locked into their own solipsistic
bubbles and then assumed that we could we could reach
out to each other and connect telepathically to each other
and recognize each other we could do that this would
be sort of like consciousness merging into sort of like
one meta godhead individual godheads merging into one sort of
meta godhead by reaching out to each other connecting um
well what what could we do with this ability let's
say we have this ability what can we do with
it well we could decide to play a game what
if what if each of us decides to dream some
finite dream and cosplay as some finite being in that
dream but rather than just doing it individually like let's
say you know 100 people are playing a single player
video game each one playing their own video game like
you're playing donkey kong i'm playing mario brothers somebody else
is playing some other game halo whatever right individually um
i think that's kind of cool uh but what might
even be more cool is if we could recognize that
we're all playing these games what if we could connect
all our games together into one meta game into one
shared dream so to speak where each of us will
log in with our finite avatar in this collective dream
and we can dream together but for us to do
this notice what has to happen we would have to
surrender our sovereignty our absolute sovereignty because see if i
insist on being absolutely sovereign and you insist on being
absolutely sovereign and so does everybody else then we can't
have we can't have this collective dream so i'd have
to give up some of my sovereignty so my infinitude
you'd have to give up some of yours and then
by giving it up we become finite our consciousness has
become finite but as we do that we open up
the possibility now of connecting with each other the reason
we're able to connect with each other is because now
we're creating a sense of other when our consciousness becomes
less than finite less than fully sovereign that creates a
split between self and other now self is no longer
infinite self becomes finite as soon as self becomes finite
it's like you're creating a division with an infinite consciousness
you're dividing it in half half of it's going to
be you and half it's going to be not you
by creating a u and a not you now there's
a possibility of reconnecting with the not you who you
think is not you who actually is you so the
the the potential for connection is in the fact that
you become unconscious of the fact that you are the
entire thing but there's a danger if we play this
game and the danger is that as our consciousness becomes
less than finite i mean less than infinite uh we
risk getting lost inside of our collective dream we risk
forgetting that we're absolutely sovereign onto ourselves because we no
longer feel sovereign we feel limited because we chose to
limit ourselves for the purpose of this collective dream each
of us would get so wrapped up and engrossed and
mesmerized by this collective dream by our dreams in this
collective dream um and we would become limited in our
consciousness that we would forget that we're god's unto ourselves
because as soon as you recognize that you are god
and sovereign onto yourself that would immediately collapse this collective
dream and lock you into a solipsistic bubble of absolute
sovereignty so you can do that that's great but there's
a trade-off the trade-off is that you lose all sons
of other and so what would be happening is that
if we are creating this collective dream then each godhead
is fueling one of these avatars in the dream the
godhead is sitting behind the eyes of each avatar but
the avatars are sleepwalking in the dream the avatars are
not conscious for the most part of the godhead behind
the avatar and the avatars are not conscious that they're
dreaming because they lack the necessary consciousness to see that
and so this telepathic connection that i formed with these
um other sovereign consciousnesses i didn't form it with their
avatars i formed it with their godheads so you might
be sitting there saying well leo but you didn't form
a telepathic connection with me yeah i didn't form it
with your avatar i formed it with your godhead you
see the difference you're the avatar who's sleepwalking through this
dream so i didn't form it with that i formed
it with your godhead which is absolutely conscious you will
recognize that when you fully awaken but you're not fully
awake right now so you're not recognizing it you see
how this works but then what occurred to me is
that if we're going to play this collective dream game
then we have to promise each other that if any
one of us awakens to our god self from this
nightmare that we might be constructing because you know this
dream could turn into a nightmare it's not necessarily going
to be all good could turn into a [ __
] show so if any one of us awakens we
have to help others each ot the rest of us
awaken remind the rest of us that we entered into
this compact to dream collectively together and that we're stuck
in our own collective nightmare and so we could drop
each other hints an awakened teacher is someone who's dropping
you a hint dropping your avatar a hint and then
your avatar is not going to get it but what
will potentially get it is the godhead behind the avatar
so the infinity the god that you are behind your
eyes see i can drop a hint to that thing
maybe you'll recognize it see maybe one day you'll recognize
that hint that i just dropped or maybe you won't
you need to have enough conscious to recognize it will
you who knows did i really just drop a hint
or did you imagine that i just did what's the
difference these hints can only work as long as you're
awake enough to get them but if you're awake enough
to get them it's almost like you don't even need
the hint because you're already awake one of the imperatives
that comes with this sort of collective dream paradigm is
that there's a challenge now i recognize there's a challenge
upon me incumbent upon me when i'm in normal life
in this collective dream you know playing as the leo
avatar the challenge for me is to first of all
not lose my true self in the dream and in
the avatar of leo that's the first challenge but then
the second challenge is to see through the facade of
all the other avatars out there who are acting like
devils and idiots see through that and recognize the god
in them and sort of like see the good in
them even when they're not being good and in a
certain sense to hold space for their own goodness so
even when you're acting bad and you're acting selfish and
you're acting unconscious the responsibility for me if i'm trying
to be as awake as i can be and as
true to my god as i can be is to
see the god in you and to recognize that you're
just acting out because you're unconscious and for me to
remind you of your full potential for consciousness even when
you're acting out even when you lose yourself in the
in the nightmare and then hopefully you can do the
same for me when i'm acting out and i lose
myself in my nightmare and this is the thing that
humans are so bad at doing when humans are acting
selfish towards each other hurting each other the thing we
lose connection with the most is the god in the
other who is hurting us that's a real challenge when
someone is hurting you to see the god in them
and not only to see it but to even hold
space for it it's sort of like my responsibility is
to see the highest potential in you no matter how
bad you are at actualizing that potential in this moment
like for me to know the fullness of what you're
capable of as god that's what it means to see
the god in you because you're going to forget and
then the best thing i can do is set the
right example lead by example so the example and then
remind you of your full potential and then to help
you to guide you towards that see like when you're
depressed when you're suicidal when you're lonely when you're miserable
when you're suffering all this when you're failing when you're
not able to get the results you want in life
like my highest responsibility is to is to see that
that's not really that's not really what's the truest highest
thing for you that's just some temporary [ __ ]
but then like i can see your full potential that
you yourself don't even see that's what it means to
really be awake and that's a very practical nugget or
application of this otherwise you know very sort of like
metaphysical woo-woo uh you know conceptual stuff is like if
you just want a practical takeaway from this video the
practical takeaway is this try to see the highest potential
in others and help them in actualizing that whether it's
in your family or your girlfriend your boyfriend your spouse
your children your teachers your colleagues your parents whatever if
you just did that that would create an amazing life
for you you would be an amazing human being but
of course it's very hard to do this because this
requires a lot of consciousness it really requires that you're
going to have some awakenings see it would require infinite
intelligence and consciousness on your part to be able to
see through the facade that these avatars the way these
avatars are acting out in this collective dream to see
through that to see underneath that and to see the
god in them like for example to look at donald
trump and to see this kind of despicable avatar doing
these despicable things in the collective dream but then to
be able to look through that past that see the
god in him and then even to encourage the flourishing
of the god within that would be the highest way
to go about life and to interact with other avatars
this also explains why every avatar wants to be treated
as though it were sovereign because actually it is in
a certain sense see have you noticed this that basically
every human being wants to be respected and treated as
though he or she was sovereign unto themselves it doesn't
matter whether it's a child an adult a man or
a woman a rich person a poor person all of
us want respect all of us want our agenda to
be put front and center none of us none of
us really want to be playing second fiddle even those
of us who do it's only just because we've lost
our way if you were fully in your power fully
in your consciousness you would want absolute sovereignty why your
ego wants that why is it just because you're egotistical
narcissistic and selfish no it's actually because your true nature
is absolute sovereignty because you're god see there's a real
misunderstanding about the ego here uh the ego is not
just so like some bad thing acting out of selfishness
it's not just the devil really the good intent behind
the ego is look the ego is a fragment of
god it's a partial aspect of god it's a limited
biased form of god and without recognizing it what the
ego is moving towards is it's seeking its full godhood
it's seeking full sovereignty but the way it goes about
it is very dysfunctional and delusional and never really tends
to work but the ego doesn't understand that because it's
not conscious enough so it's just doing the best it
can so the ego wants a bunch of money the
ego wants a bunch of love the ego wants a
bunch of sex the ego wants a big house the
ego wants some fast cars the ego wants to fly
to mars the ego wants to build a giant company
the ego wants billions of dollars the ego wants never-ending
growth right never-ending pleasure a bunch of drugs just never
stopping like all the ego wants these things you have
to see the wisdom really and the good intention behind
all these things the ego does all of these are
just failed attempts of the ego to recognize itself as
sovereign as god so that's actually why the line between
narcissism and god realization is very thin it's a lot
thinner than it seems and all conflict evil and violence
in the world basically comes about when one godhead in
a finite avatar infringes on the sovereignty of another godhead
in a finite avatar have you seen this have you
noticed this this is basically what oppression and abuse and
enslavement is right when you want to enslave somebody it's
one part of god trying to dominate another part of
god and subsume it under its own authority and this
is fundamentally not going to work because it's untruthful because
the truth is that all at all subparts of there's
an infinite number of parts of god and every part
of god no matter how tiny it is is equally
as valid and sovereign as any other part now whether
it knows that or not that can vary not all
the parts know that but if they did know it
or if you know it then you know that all
the parts no part is above any other part in
a certain sense and so the challenge is that one
part of god is trying to dominate some other part
of god this is really what ego is about and
part of what it means to recognize your own sovereignty
is that it's not that you recognize that oh i'm
absolutely sovereign so let me go dominate everyone like a
tyrant it's actually exactly the opposite of that and this
was part of my original insight of realizing why there
should be other sovereigns outside of myself because when i
recognize my own sovereignty fully i recognize that i am
so sovereign i am so comfortable in my own sovereignty
my sovereignty is so unlimited that literally i can allow
the existence of another sovereign outside of myself and it
wouldn't diminish my sovereignty in the slightest that's what true
sovereignty means that's absolute sovereignty it's not diminished it's infinite
you can take infinity pull apart out of infinity and
create another infinity out of it and you're still equally
as infinite as you used to be that's the paradox
of infinity infinity is like a is like a magic
hat that you can just pull an object out of
like you can pull a rabbit out of this magic
hat and no matter how many rabbits you pull out
of there you're never out of rabbits there's an infinite
number of rabbits so if i pull out one rabbit
and give it to you it might seem like well
i've i've given up a rabbit no i haven't given
up a rabbit because there's an infinite number of rabbits
in this hat so if i give you one and
you won and you won i still have an infinite
i still have the same amount of rabbits i never
i didn't lose three rabbits and in fact what i
could do sort of like the meta trick here is
to say like if i have a magic hat that
i can pull out an infinite number of rabbits from
i can take this hat and i could pull out
not a rabbit but another magic hat the same as
mine so if i have a magic cat i can
pull out another magic hat give you that magic hat
now you have the same magic hat that i have
you can pull out an infinite number of rabbits and
i could pull out an infinite number of rabbits and
it we don't we're not we're not constrained by energy
or by matter or by physics or by anything you
could have as many raps as you want i can
have as many rabbits as you want and we can
spread this to everybody that's what infinity means it's infinite
abundance it's unlimited there's no limits now i recognize that
i am the magic hat that's what god is god
is this magic hat i recognize that that's what i
am but you may not recognize that that's what you
are so what does it mean for me to pull
out a magic hat and give it to you well
it means me helping you to realize that you are
the magic cat that i am and it's not that
you're a different magic hat we're the same hat in
fact your magic hat is just part of my magic
hat you see because you're part of my conscience i'm
part of your consciousness i recognize that i'm sovereign do
you recognize that you're sovereign that's the question that's what
you gotta awaken to and as long as you're not
awake to that you're stuck in in a finite paradigm
playing a finite game not an infinite game and then
you're going to be scarce there's not going to be
enough abundance for you and then you're gonna get violent
and angry and manipulative and you're gonna lie and cheat
and steal and hurt people and so forth to get
what you need to get your needs met that's the
finite paradigm you're stuck in that awakening can kind of
break you out of so another practical takeaway from this
episode if you just want something practical is live your
life and treat others respecting their sovereignty because you recognize
that their sovereignty is equal to yours see if you
just lived by this principle respecting the sovereignty of everyone
you come into contact with this would change how you
live your whole life and it would completely change all
of your social relationships because usually what we try to
do in our social relationships is we're trying to dominate
others whether in gross ways or in subtle ways now
if you say well leo i don't try to dominate
my children i don't try to dominate my mother and
father oh yeah is that true maybe you don't try
to dominate them like in a tyrannical way per se
but you still manipulate them you still try to get
your way with them you try to get them to
fulfill your agenda you still treat your agenda as more
important than their agenda you still don't respect their sovereignty
fully what does it mean to respect somebody's sovereignty first
of all it means you're not pushy with them about
what you need them to do you actually take their
needs seriously and their values seriously you don't try to
impose your needs and your values to override theirs that's
huge so like a lot of christians for example fail
in this so maybe it's easier to understand what sovereignty
is or what respecting sovereignty is just by with a
sort of counter example the classic counter-example is a christian
missionary you know who goes to some poor country third
world country in africa or in south america and tries
to convert the heathens there the tribal people into christianity
this is a disrespect of their sovereignty to respect their
sovereignty would be to respect their local customs and culture
their local shamanism or their local animal mystic worldview or
their local you know mystical traditions and spiritual traditions which
exist all around the world to respect those and to
not hold christianity as more important or better or superior
and to not push your christianity onto others not to
proselytize see christians fail at this of course almost all
fundamentalist religions fail this muslims fail at this and so
forth the jews are a little better jews don't proselytize
so much um but you know this isn't just happening
with religion though this sort of sovereignty violation is happening
on so many levels i mean it happens even within
science like a lot of people will push science on
you for example they will want you to drop your
spiritual ideas and to be more rational to be more
scientific or for example men will want women to be
less emotional and women will want men to be less
rational less logical and more emotional or more touchy feely
see and then you know your boss will will try
to impose sovereignty over you as as his employee and
so because of this all our conflicts happen and because
of this you know we're always like trying to control
people and manipulate people and this leads to a lot
of suffering and problems and this is fundamentally because there's
a lack of respect for the sovereignty there's a lack
of recognition before you can respect someone's sovereignty first you
have to recognize your own sovereignty and then you have
to recognize the identity between yours and theirs you and
them then you could see that oh yeah they're sovereign
just like me and my sovereignty is not superior now
all of the above that i described is a sort
of a thought process that i went through in this
awakening i'm sharing it with you as kind of accurately
as i can here going point by point but also
remember that all of the above is still just a
figment of my own consciousness that's all it ever was
it wasn't anything else and hence absolute solipsism still holds
nothing ever happened outside of my consciousness all of the
above is my own dream and that's all there can
ever be my own dream my dream is absolute and
to realize that is the realization of what god is
that is what god is it's an absolute dream sovereign
unto itself this is god realizing what it means to
be god god fully reuniting with himself god dividing itself
and then reuniting with itself this is the theme i've
talked about this theme in my episode called division versus
unity go check that out this adds some extra dimensions
to that now you might say well leo but all
these other godheads and gods you imagined didn't you just
imagine them and they were always just a part of
you well the answer is yes of course of course
i divided myself and then i reunited with myself and
that reunion is how you realize what god is now
you could say well leah wouldn't it be just easier
to not go through all this complexity and just to
be united immediately sure you could do it that way
too if you want um but but there was something
unique and something kind of novel about recognizing that i
could that i could unite with with other aspects of
my consciousness that are as powerful as myself god uniting
with god see fundamentally what this whole experience highlights is
that you can take god you can subdivide god into
an infinite number of parts and each one of those
parts is also just going to be god there's no
diminution it's what they would call holographic you can break
a hologram into as many parts as you want and
each subpart of the hologram will contain the whole hologram
this is what holographic means so in a certain sense
what i became conscious of here is the infinite holography
of god pretty cool it's a pretty cool thing you
could maybe wake up to one day yourself now you
might say well leo how does this differ from your
previous sort of solipsistic awakenings in a few ways first
of all i would say it's another level it's deeper
it was totally a totally mind-blowing experience and i wouldn't
trade it for anything one of the best experiences most
unique experiences of my life an incredible awakening if you
had one of these kinds of awakenings this would be
the crowning achievement of your life so it's just amazing
it felt amazing the insights of it were amazing um
also the possibility there of a very deep connection at
a metaphysical level with other in love is an amazing
thing and i think that a lot of people who
get a little taste of solaces and they miss that
they miss the love they meet they miss the deep
connection and really it's the difference between the aloneness versus
the togetherness aspects of awakening see when you awaken to
yourself as god you can sort of there's two sides
to this coin of this kind of awakening one side
is the aloneness the other side is a togetherness and
a lot of people who get really wrapped up on
the negative aspect of solipsism they focus on the aloneness
side of this coin they're like oh my god i'm
alone everything is imaginary everything's just me i imagine my
parents and my friends and my dog and my cat
and all this oh my god this is awful right
you're focused on the aloneness now that's true all of
that is true what i just said but if you're
focused on the aloneness part of it now there's the
other side of the coin which is the togetherness the
connection the love you're missing that so it's not just
that oh i imagine my mother and my father and
my cat and my dog in this and like all
sense of other yeah that's true but the because i
imagined it the reason i imagined it the other is
because actually that other was always a part of me
so really by awakening here it's not that i'm sort
of like separating myself it's like oh my mother's not
real it's no it's not that my mother isn't real
yeah i mean she's not real but she's part of
my imagination so in a certain sense this this opens
the possibility of being closer to my mother than i
have ever could have been under the materialist paradigm the
non-solipsistic paradigm because in the materialist paradigm you and your
mother are physically distinct and always therefore separate you literally
cannot become your mother under the materialistic physics oriented paradigm
those of you who say that follow-up system is solipsism
is [ __ ] and it's false and it can't
possibly be true and it's awful and all this okay
fine but then under your paradigm the non-solicited paradigm you
can never ever become one with your mother never now
i ask you how do you feel about that why
aren't you angry about that why aren't you nihilistic and
depressed about that why aren't you suicidal about that see
you could take the idea like oh my god physics
is true the material universe is real i'm not dreaming
this is reality and i can never merge with my
mother i can never be one with her how awful
let me go kill myself see that's the proper reaction
to uh materialism it's so disconnecting whereas with what i'm
talking about with awakening there is an actual possibility of
a physical union with anything in the universe so you
don't have to be separate from it so you can
literally merge with your mother in a platonic way in
a metaphysical way where you realize that she is you
so that's the proper understanding of the solipsism that i'm
talking about and to get this part it's not enough
to philosophize and theorize and sit there in your arm
chair and to think about this stuff into foreign beliefs
you have to actually have an awakening you have to
actually experience the love such profound levels of love this
entire awakening process that i was describing it was love
from beginning to end it was just deeper and deeper
gradations of love me realizing my own love for myself
imagine the kind of love you would experience if you
were able to merge and to recognize the god and
every other human and animal in the in the universe
and to merge with them and to become identical with
them to become one with them that is the togetherness
side of this coin yes you're one you're alone because
you're so together so what's different about this kind of
solipsism is that it's much more uplifting rather than nihilistic
it opens the possibility for deep connection and love you
don't feel disconnected this is a solipsism in which in
which you feel completely connected it's a level of connection
and by the way love is just nothing other than
connection it's a level of connection that becomes a unity
and that opens you up to the highest level levels
of love you can't even imagine infinite love this is
god's love it open it also leaves more room open
for teaching awakening because in the past when i've had
my solipsistic awakenings in the past i would come back
from those and i'd be like well what's even the
point of teaching anybody about awakening because all there is
is just me so who am i teaching why would
i even teach why even talk about why i even
record a video why write a book why talk about
awakening whereas now um that's kind of like turned upside
down for me now it feels like there's more of
a reason to teach about awakening because yeah in the
end i'm only teaching myself in a certain sense but
it just seems it seems um it just sort of
seems like the natural thing to do is sort of
like consciousness moving to awaken more consciousness even if it
isn't just all a dream so in a sense what's
happening here is that the solipsism is is reaching such
a deep level there's such a deep level of integration
of it and there's a such a deep level of
acceptance of the fact that i am dreaming that at
first when you realize that you're dreaming it's like oh
my god i'm dreaming and nothing is real and it
feels kind of down it's like oh it's a bummer
because it's not real that's not that's just the beginnings
of it that's not full awakening full awakening is when
you realize oh my god it's all a dream and
i love that that's not a problem that's not a
bug that's a feature that's not a mistake that's not
something you get depressed about that it's all a dream
this is the best possible news that it's all a
dream and then you embrace the dream you see in
the same way that when you're playing a great video
game it doesn't matter to you that the video game
isn't real per se if you're engrossed in playing mario
brothers and i come up to you and say hey
you know but mario's not a real person you say
well who gives a [ __ ] i still enjoy
playing it if you're watching a great movie and i
walk in there say well you know but like those
characters aren't real they're just pretending you're gonna say who
gives a [ __ ] i still enjoy it but
now see if you did think that those people on
the movie screen were real at first if i tell
you that you might go oh my god what this
movie's not real i thought it was real that sucks
i can't believe i've been fooled oh my god this
is horror horrible i don't want to even watch it
anymore i'm going to go kill myself see that's your
initial reaction to the news but then once you get
over that if you get over it without harming yourself
or spiraling out of control into sort of like nihilistic
depressive you know psychotic funk if you're able to go
past all that and then integrate it and accept it
then you can say oh yeah yeah i mean i
guess i i was a little bummed out that it's
not real i kind of got fooled by that okay
fine but but i still it's still a great movie
let me just sit down and do a movie and
you can sit back down and enjoy the movie and
finish the movie and enjoy it and you can even
enjoy it more than you did when you thought it
was real because there's no difference between real and unreal
real and imaginary real an illusion there's no difference between
these things and see part of this the sneaky sort
of like misconception of solipsism is that when you learn
about substances like oh well it's not real and then
you you ascribe negative meaning to the fact that something
isn't real like if i tell you your mother isn't
isn't if i tell your mother is imaginary that's going
to be like negative in your mind but the actual
awakening to the fact that your mother's imaginary is not
negative it's your ego mind that's reacting with the negativity
so in the end nothing i'm saying here contradicts solipsism
it's actually this is actually a deeper version of it
is what i'm telling you so i formed this profound
connection with all the other godheads now you might ask
leo weren't those other godheads weren't you just hallucinating those
to which the answer is yes absolutely that's precisely what
i did and that's precisely all that reality could ever
be and to recognize and accept that is to be
awake that's a feature that's not a bug you got
to learn to love that and the integration process is
it can be a long process to come to love
that it's an acquired taste you know this is this
is stuff that you know it's taken me years to
get to this point this is shocking radical stuff what
you're not fully recognizing yet is that there really literally
is no difference between a real connection with another godhead
and just you imagining that connection there's not a difference
and when you recognize that that will be the connection
see you don't connect physically with anything you're connecting by
recognizing that there's no difference between anything that's what's creating
the connection because by creating differences with your mind that
is the division that is the disconnection when you think
that i'm not you you're disconnected from me when you
realize that my body is your own mind you connect
with me in a way that would not be possible
otherwise under any kind of material connection you can connect
with me much more deeply metaphysically than you can physically
you can have sex with someone and you might think
that's a deep connection that's not the deep connection the
deep connection is actually realizing that the person you're having
sex with is literally you that would be the deeper
connection and that can't happen at the physical material that
can only happen metaphysically by using your consciousness to become
aware of the identity between you and everyone else so
i formed a connection as real as any connection you've
ever had to anything more real actually because it was
an absolute connection at a metaphysical level it was an
absolute unity so you might say well leo my connection
with my mother that's the real connection and your connection
was just some sort of hippie imaginary connection it's like
no my connection was deeper than any connection you've ever
had with any human in your in your life you
just think those are real connections those are not connections
you're disconnected from all those people you're disconnected from your
mother your father everyone everyone you think you're connected with
you're disconnected from them you don't realize that you're identical
with them you don't realize that they're god like you
are god you don't see the god in them you
don't see the god in you that would be the
real connection so what i'm telling you here is that
very again very a practical takeaway this is probably something
you're missing in your life a very profound connection with
other whatever that other is cat dog human whatever alien
a very profound connection with other is possible at a
metaphysical level go seek that connection but remember this connection
will be imaginary it will not be a real connection
it'll be imaginary and that's okay as it should be
because there is no other kind of connection there's only
one kind of connection all connection is imaginary all connection
is connection to your own self you're always connecting with
yourself you can't connect with anything but yourself that's what
you realize and you realize that love is just connection
love the reason love i mean the reason consciousness god
and truth are all equivalent to love is because consciousness
is capable of infinite self-connection by dissolving the differences between
all of its parts and turning into an absolute unity
that's just what love is and when you experience that
that's what your human emotions signal to you as feelings
of love human love is just a little tip of
the iceberg of metaphysical love god's love so in conclusion
a solipsism without infinite love is false a solipsism with
total connection to everything and you drowning in infinite love
that's the true solipsism so this is how you know
if you're asking with leo i've had some solipsistic ideas
and i felt bad about it how do i know
if that's true or false if you feel bad about
it it's false now don't get me wrong the insights
you might have had might have been true but you're
you're interpreting them and then your ego is taking that
into a negative false direction so you know you have
to kind of separate out the truth like for example
you might realize your mother is imaginary that's true that's
not false but then what you do with that and
how you get butthurt about that and how you take
that as unreal and negative and all the meaning you
attach to it that's the false part and if if
there's no love present with your realization that's also means
that it's a shallow level of realization and you have
a lot deeper higher to go so every god head
that i connected to is identical to myself i'm not
connecting to something different out there somewhere i'm just realizing
literally what the connection is just realizing that oh that
godhead is me oh okay yeah we connected because it's
just me i'm connecting to myself it's an identity the
connection goes so deep it becomes an identity so i
know a lot of you have struggled with solipsism and
asked a lot of questions about solipsism this question of
a topic of solipsism requires a lot of gradual repeated
exposure integration work you have to awaken to it and
then you have to integrate awake integrate equate it integrate
you like keep integrating because because basically what you're doing
is you're you're deconstructing your mind you're deconstructing various kinds
of illusions and as that's happening you're losing sense of
meaning you're losing a sense of purpose right because your
whole life was built on this house of cards probably
even your motivation to get out of bed in the
morning was based upon a lie so when you realized
it was a lie then maybe you don't want to
get out of bed in the morning you're feeling depressed
but these are just the early stages you have to
understand right like there has to be a lot of
integration work years of integration work you have to confront
the illusions that your mind creates again and again and
again and again and in in that process the ego
mind will hate it it'll misinterpret it it'll [ __
] and moan about it it'll get nihilistic about it
depressed about it and so forth and so you have
to be careful about that because if you're taking on
the solipsism stuff and the things i'm saying if you're
just taking this on as concepts and theories and philosophy
you're only gonna suffer more from this you need actual
awakenings if you've not had an actual awakening to the
fact that you are absolute consciousness that you are completely
sovereign and one then you're you're just stuck in mental
masturbation it's going to hurt you now if you have
had some of those awakenings that's good but you're still
not out of the woods you're still probably in a
bad spot you're gonna have to have a lot more
of those fully integrate those over years the way that
i've been doing and then maybe you can break through
to some of those more positive more like togetherness aspects
of what's being talked about here when you're thinking about
solipsism also just think about the difference between solipsism and
its opposite and realize that even that difference is itself
imaginary therefore any suffering arising out of you realizing solipsism
is also imaginary and it's not the ultimate truth so
this is tricky stuff i'm pointing out you know various
traps for you here so the key lesson another key
lesson here is this if you claim solipsism but you
aren't falling in love with yourself and with reality then
you're going wrong you've taken a wrong turn somewhere or
you haven't completed your work yet you're stuck in a
sort of a a local minimum on this journey you're
stuck in a dip if you're feeling depressed nihilistic suicidal
if you're feeling lonely cynical hopeless if you're hating yourself
hating others hating god hating life hating reality if you're
afraid if you're anxious if you're asking questions like well
why did god create this hell hole that i'm in
you're definitely not awake awakening wipes all of that out
at least temporarily it shouldn't be contributing to those things
if you if what you think and call awakening is
contributing to all those things that i just mentioned then
something is going horribly wrong and you need to rethink
what you're doing what you're calling awakening you've got to
rethink that because maybe what you're calling awakening isn't anything
that i'm talking about so in the end the way
you you know whether you're doing this awakening process correctly
is that you should be moving towards more love more
connection um more peace more joy more amazement and wonderment
at just like how amazing the structure of reality is
you shouldn't be cursing nature you should be marveling at
nature you should be marveling at yourself how amazing the
structure of all this is how how ingenious it is
how brilliant it is how intelligent it is not how
awful it is it's not a dark thing so be
very careful about your ideas of solipsism they're not what
i'm talking about the way you know that your awakening
is genuine and full is if you experience profound levels
of love awe and wonder and you're feeling whole healthy
and connected and you're not hating other human beings you're
not becoming misanthropic you don't want to hurt them you
want you fully understand them you have compassion for them
you understand their limitations and you understand why they act
awful you have understanding for all of that and you're
capable of forgiving that that's how you know that this
is genuine and uh proper awakening and if you're getting
more bitter then you're going down some wrong path so
be careful trust your feelings a bit on this your
feelings you know your heart is guiding you towards love
not towards bitterness if you're experiencing a lot of bitterness
sit down go back to the drawing board say wait
a minute where did i go wrong okay i'm feeling
bitter i'm feeling negative i'm feeling depressed i've been doing
a bunch of meditating and i've been doing a lot
of psychedelics and all this stuff and now i'm feeling
worse i'm feeling depressed and and nihilistic and i can't
even motivate myself get in bed what's happening to me
where did i go wrong that's how i want your
your thought process to work and then sit down and
kind of like go and say where did i make
a mistake where did i misinterpret some teaching where did
you know maybe leo said this but maybe he meant
something else and i didn't quite understand that or maybe
i'm interpreting this whole set of teachings in in some
twisted way maybe i'm resisting here or i'm avoiding this
thing here or i still have some fear i haven't
confronted there and that is tripping up and twisting up
this whole process which should be a beautiful process of
love awe and wonder and wholeness and connection rather than
misery so what do you do if you're stuck in
a negative solipsistic spiral um well you could just take
a break from this whole work and just go back
to ordinary life distract yourself go you know watch some
movies have some sex enjoy life you could do that
and then kind of forget about it sometimes that's necessary
if you're really in a bad place or if you're
feeling more powerful then you could actually start to question
it and deconstruct it and you could work you know
you could double down your spiritual efforts you could you
could go back kind of rethink your spiritual techniques and
and and methods and maybe make some adjustments and then
go for a more full more holistic awakening and remember
that awakening is not guesswork it's not speculation it's not
theory it's not philosophy philosophy is not awakening if you're
having doubts about whether you're awake or not you're not
awake if you've had a little bit of awakening and
then you're still having doubts about it you're like well
yeah maybe i had some awakenings but leo how do
i know if it's true how do i know if
that love that i experienced was really real how do
i know that my experience of god was the real
god or maybe i was just fooling myself and maybe
i was just delusional and hallucinating on some chemicals if
you're having these kinds of doubts then you didn't really
awaken or your awakening was so short and so shallow
that you need a lot more of it real awakening
has no doubts there's no real there's no doubt there's
no room for doubt in awakening awakening is absolute consciousness
absolute truth you're absolutely conscious there's nothing to doubt there
if you're doubting it you're not absolutely conscious don't worry
you're not gonna miss it you're not just going to
like have it awakening it's like what was that an
awakening or not i don't know i maybe i missed
it maybe i was like distracted i was daydreaming and
i missed my awakening no the awakening is so radical
it'll it'll it'll stop everything the real awakening is so
shocking you're not going to miss it so don't worry
you just have deeper to go that's all all right
that's it that's it for this episode i hope you
enjoyed it one last point i want to make here
is that for those of you who are taking the
psychedelic path towards awakening uh which i do recommend it
can be very effective uh a couple of points about
that how do you keep yourself from deluding yourself with
psychedelics that is possible that is possible but remember also
you could delude yourself without psychedelics too so that's also
possible in fact even even more possible the majority of
humans on this planet are deluded without ever having taken
a single psychedelic and in fact the majority of humans
on this planet are deluded about the function and nature
of psychedelics so when people tell me that oh leo
but but psychedelics are dangerous because you could delude yourself
but that's already the case so what what's the danger
now there's other dangers and by the way i've enumerated
all the many dangers about psychedelics some of them are
pretty serious you want to go check that out before
you actually use psychedelics i have an episode called um
the something like the top dangers of using psychedelics go
go search for that i ex list a couple dozen
different dangers that you should be aware of and yes
deluding yourself is a danger deluding yourself is always a
danger with or without psychedelics or whatever you do whatever
spiritual path you take it's always a danger so but
anyways how do you confront this specific danger well trip
more trip deeper integrate spend a lot of time integrating
contemplate really contemplate your trips journal about them think about
them very carefully and also seek to invalidate your past
awakenings and trips so you might have one awakening where
you experience god you might have another awakening where you
experience love another awakening where you experience absolute sovereignty another
awakening where you connect with some other being or whatever
okay now do five more awakenings on top of those
and try to you know five more trips on top
of those i mean and try to invalidate all your
previous ones and see if if it works for you
see what comes up don't get attached to any particular
idea even like the idea that you're god don't get
attached to that ideally every time you trip you throw
all your ideas away you're willing to invalidate any one
of them you're willing to experience something totally new that
contradicts everything you thought or said before you have to
have this kind of beginner's mind attitude with every trip
because if if you get too attached to certain ideas
that will start to color your trips then your trips
will go down certain directions and not potentially others and
then the more you try to invalidate your own spiritual
insights and understandings um you'll see which of those can
be invalidated and then other ones you'll try to invalidate
and validate and validate and validate it just you can't
invalidate it and then this builds real you know solid
understanding and then very deep integration of of these things
and you might say well leo but but what if
i've tried to invalidate it five times and i still
haven't but that doesn't mean it's absolutely true look you
can only do as good as you can do the
way that science works and really tripping on psychedelics is
no different than science you're doing science you're doing inner
science science of consciousness the way science works is that
you can never absolutely invalidate something all you can do
is you can try to invalidate it as many times
as you have time and energy to do to the
point where you're reasonably confident in it and that's just
as good as you can do that's as good as
a human can do all right it's it's always the
case that you can always make the argument like well
like how do you know that the speed of light
is whatever it is or how do you know that
gravity works the way you know einstein says how do
you know general relativity is true well because we've tried
to invalidate it thousands of times and haven't succeeded yet
okay well that doesn't mean it can't be invalidated tomorrow
it could be how do you know the sun will
rise from rise tomorrow i mean only because it's risen
every day of your life but that doesn't mean that
it won't rise tomorrow this is just the nature of
experimental empirical method remember that the truth is not fragile
it will stand up to vigorous testing and prodding it
will stand up to skepticism it will stand up to
efforts to invalidate it so if you're afraid to test
some theory of yours or some idea you have or
some spiritual insight you have if you're afraid to really
push on it that's probably because it isn't true if
it was really true you wouldn't be afraid to push
on it because the truth will support your weight full
weight on it that's what's so awesome about the truth
is that you can't invalidate it and the more you
try to invalidate it the more obvious it becomes and
also to avoid deluding yourself with psychedelics pay extra attention
to any kind of subtle fear in you when it
comes to tripping and exploring different parts of consciousness in
your trip those parts you're afraid to explore you're like
oh well i don't want to i don't want to
contemplate that topic or i don't want to contemplate this
topic because it's scary or it's uncomfortable whatever that's where
the truth is hiding the truth when you fully are
in possession of the truth with awakened consciousness there's not
going to be any fear at all consciousness eclipses all
possibility of fear so fear is your clue and that
fear gets replaced with love if you're doing this process
correctly all right that does it um i felt like
[ __ ] usually i don't share my latest awakenings
but i felt like sharing this one because it was
so unique and i haven't heard anybody else describing this
so that's that again i'm not sitting here claiming to
be the best the most and i'm not claiming to
have all my awakening complete i'm always open to more
i'm excited to explore new stuff discover even higher awakenings
that's always the case with all of my work it's
always been that way this is an evolving process right
and you have to get good in this work to
be willing to just like go beyond all of your
past experiences and all of your past understandings you know
keep pushing beyond beyond beyond and just keep going don't
worry about when is it going to end when am
i going to be done don't worry about it just
keep going why do you need to be done what
if there's a never-ending um you know ladder of of
insight and awakenings that you can have why not climb
that ladder and see where it takes you i see
people way too eager to claim themselves done and to
claim that they've understood everything i think you should understand
how foolish that is to assume such things how do
you know when you're done who would tell you so
my attitude just keep going keep exploring keep prodding at
your own ideas and i think you'll be rewarded with
higher and higher truths and discoveries deeper and richer and
greater degrees of love and that's to me what this
whole journey is about you
