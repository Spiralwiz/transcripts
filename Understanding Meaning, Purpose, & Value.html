hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about understanding meaning purpose and
value because this notion is central to how you live
your life [Music] you this is a very foundational topic
it's going to be worth it to you to listen
to this whole episode all the way through there's a
lot of confusion that I see out there with newbies
and even intermediate people in personal development who just don't
properly understand where meeting comes from and what it actually
is and this is especially a problem because of my
life purpose course people either take the life purpose course
or they hear me talking about the life purpose course
and then they assume that what I believe is that
there is some sort of life purpose out there in
the ether floating around which you can discover for yourself
and then your life is gonna be peachy if you
just live according to that purpose but of course that's
not what I mean by life purpose at all life
purpose as I talked about it in the course and
I say it there but I'll repeat it here it's
about how to construct meaning in your life the key
word there being construct it's a construction and it's very
important that you're conscious that that's what you're doing is
that you're constructing so what I want to help you
to do is just to understand that all meaning all
purpose all value is constructed by the human mind and
that it's not found out in the world anywhere that's
very important that might seem obvious in a certain sense
it's very obvious but to understand all the ramifications of
this that takes going down a couple of steps on
depth here and we're gonna do that so all meaning
all purpose and all value and I'm using these words
interchangeably throughout this episode and I'll just be referring to
all of it is basically meaning meaning is relative the
problem is when people hold it as being an absolute
now what's the difference between relative and absolute relative means
that it's relative to other things and that it's a
conceptual construction whereas absolute would mean that it's inherent to
reality so people think that there's a lot of stuff
in life that has meaning and when you talk to
them about it they tend to believe that the meaning
is not of their own making but is inherent to
reality and that this meaning is therefore constant for everybody
and this is a very very wrong way to look
at life and they're not conscious how they actually create
the meaning themselves for themselves and this gets them stuck
with whatever meanings they happen to think are real without
realizing that none of it is real and that they
are constructing it all along you will experience massive growth
and maturity if you realize this for yourself and all
of its implications but before you get the fruit of
that growth you're first gonna have to go through quite
a bit of confusion depression and nihilism you're gonna have
to go over this hump pass this hump and then
you will experience the growth and the maturity and most
people never do that in life and therefore they really
have a backwards relationship to all the meanings that they
create in their life so why is meaning relative well
to really appreciate that well you need to do is
you need to sit down and ask yourself what is
meaning hmm what is meaning what is it existentially speaking
what is meaning where does it come from why does
it exist what is its purpose have you ever asked
yourself that question in your life and I do mean
that you ask yourself and actually contemplated it for yourself
rather than getting the answer from somebody else to see
the problem is is that we tend to even when
we ask these questions we tend to ask it of
somebody or we tend to get the answer from society
somewhere like you right now I want to get the
answer for me and of course I want to give
you the answer but the problem is is that it's
not enough for you to get the answer you have
to derive the answer for yourself so that you see
how the pieces fit together and why it works the
way it works that's what actually grows you hearing the
answer in and of itself doesn't really grow you believing
the answer doesn't grow you either it actually gets you
a sort of false sense of understanding so you seriously
need to do this we're gonna sort of do it
together here as best as we can but also you
need to do it by yourself after this episode is
done later this week whatever you want to do it
you need to sit down ask yourself what is meaning
and let a natural answer come up not something that
you read about in a book so what we're gonna
do here to get you started on that process is
we're gonna look at an object you can take any
ordinary object and just sit down with it here we've
got a banana regular old banana mmm nice yummy juicy
banana so here it is now as you sit there
and look at it I want you to start to
contemplate what does this banana mean what is its meaning
what is its purpose what is the point of bananas
what is this value is it a good banana is
that a bad banana is it positive is it negative
what is it why is it what does this existence
mean and just sit there and actually seriously contemplate that
and see what comes up you never know what comes
up you start to ruminate about this and you start
to ask yourself like well is what the banana means
to me the same as what the banana means to
you or to my dog or to God or to
the universe or to itself if we just take humans
for a moment and we ask ourselves what does a
banana mean to humans well to us most likely it
means food we tend to think of bananas that way
after your are they're all pretty pretty pretty yummy they
got calories in there we can use this to fuel
our day but what if you take somebody who is
allergic to bananas let's say there was such a person
a banana could kill such a person if they were
really allergic let's just imagine that so in that case
what would be the meaning of this banana to that
person would it be the same as it is for
you let's say today you missed breakfast and you didn't
eat anything all day and now you're watching this and
now you're starting to go hungry your stomach is churning
oh you really want this banana huh see so to
you it really means one thing but what would it
mean if you had an allergy to bananas what would
it mean to you if you ever ate a banana
in your life and you got sick just not even
from the banana but you just happen to get sick
after eating that banana maybe got some food poisoning or
whatever people didn't wash it properly for you and you
ate it what would your reaction be to bananas now
after you had a violent reaction to some banana see
you have a very different reaction it would have a
different meaning for you which starts to get you to
wonder like oh so the same object can have different
meanings to different people not only that the same opps
you could have different meanings to the same person if
you just ate 50 bananas and I show you one
more you're not gonna think of this as food anymore
see but when you're starving you'll think of it as
food if I show it to your dog your dog
isn't gonna consider this food cuz dogs don't eat bananas
neither will your cat what will they do they'll probably
ignore it they won't care about it and if we
show this to any other kind of creature like an
ant or somebody like that they also probably won't care
about it they won't see it as food to them
it might have no meaning at all whereas to you
it might have a very important meaning if you haven't
eaten for days and this is your only meal see
so already this starts to tray the relative nature of
meaning what this shows us is that actually meaning all
meaning can only mean something for a who I'm a
who you're a who your dogs a who a who
you can think of it as a perspective one perspective
on life or an entity or creature or an organism
only for that organism is there meaning there isn't meaning
in the abstract there is only meaning subjectively for an
individual now why is that because a thing can only
be significant to another thing relative to which it is
trying to produce a benefit or it's producing a negative
benefit which is harm so see what meaning is about
is about benefits and harms but benefits and harms are
not absolute things there is no one thing in the
universe that is a constant benefit to everybody or a
constant harm to somebody it always depends on who you
are what situation you're in so it depends on the
context of the situation it's important to wonder who would
arbitrate between what is significant and what's not significant within
reality significance is the same thing as meaning it's not
found out in the world significance is relative to your
life to a life if you didn't have a life
nothing would be significant to you things are significant to
you because they can either help or harm your life
significance is relative to survival and this notion of survival
is a rather abstract notion it doesn't just mean your
physical surviving every single day that you wake up of
course it does mean that but it means more than
that survival pretty much in entails everything that you do
in your life it includes waking up it includes going
to the bathroom it includes food it includes your career
it includes any business that you do pursuing money spending
that money pursuing health and all the social stuff that
you do having sex having relationships having children all of
that is what we're meaning here by the notion of
survival that's your whole life so relative to that things
have meaning or significance and then relative to somebody else's
life there's a different set of significance that objects have
now what's really interesting about meanings is that they can
conflict with each other because since meaning is relative to
the self I'm a self yourself your dog's our self
let's say because the self is defined as the opposite
of other we can get into conflicts of significance and
of meaning so what do I mean by self defined
as other well to say that I'm a self means
that I'm not you as obvious as that seems people
don't get that that's an important flip side of the
coin is that they're self and there's other and that's
relative so to you yourself and I'm the other for
you and that's obvious but let's take the example of
an asteroid hurling at the surface of the earth and
it's a big asteroid it's gonna wipe out whichever city
it hits it's not so big it'll wipe out the
whole planet but just one city so it'll destroy everything
in that city and let's say that it has to
hit some city now it could either hit my city
or your city but we live in two different cities
and let's say that now we're sitting and we're waiting
for this asteroid to hit the question is is this
asteroid significant or meaningful well to us as humans who
are living in these cities it very much so is
because it's a direct threat to our survival that's the
only reason it's meaningful if the asteroid was gonna bounce
off the earth and not hurt anybody would it be
significant no we wouldn't care about it we care about
it because it threatens our survival and that's an interesting
thing to notice about meaning and about significance is that
the most meaningful and the most significant things in the
world in your entire life are those which threaten your
life which should already betray to you that meaning and
significance are completely relative to your survival and to really
nothing else and then the less that it threatens your
survival or the less that it benefits your survival then
the less meaningful it is until it basically winds down
to complete irrelevance so if this asteroid is gonna hit
one of our cities and let's say that we're gonna
flip a coin to decide if it's gonna hit your
city or my city so we flip the coin I
win it's not gonna hit my city it's gonna hit
your city I'm thrilled because I get to live to
me this is a very positive meaning because otherwise I
would have died for you on the other hand seized
act opposite it's a very negative meaning because it means
you're gonna die and if the situation were reversed it
would be reversed so this just is a very stark
example that starts to show you how much meaning and
significance is connected to your survival now this is a
very important point because we as self survival machines tend
to be very biased and we tend to want to
survive and this tends to make us blind to seeing
reality for what it is because we have a horse
in the race so to speak we care about whether
we die or not and in fact our entire neural
system our entire psyche is designed so that we care
and so that we live our life this way and
in fact there is no other reason why significance or
meaning exists but for that function that's why it exists
significance and meaning is not just something you find out
there in the world significance and meaning is something that
the human mind created so that it could navigate reality
and not kill itself as obvious as that is a
lot of people don't get this and they certainly don't
get the full ramifications of this so let's try to
help you to see why this is so significant ironic
to say that it's significant when in fact we're saying
that there is no such thing as absolute significance so
when I'm talking about significance or meaning what that includes
a lot of other stuff it includes all notions of
good versus bad so start to connect what I'm saying
to everything that you think is good and bad in
the world cuz that's what I'm talking about I'm not
just talking about abstractions philosophical abstraction here I'm talking about
every single thing in the world that you think is
good or bad is relative to your survival see it's
biased by your desire to live and it's completely dependent
on you it's only from your perspective it's not absolute
also all notions of positive and negative all priorities that
you assigned two things in life for example you might
say well my children are number one priority if you
have children they probably would be and then your business
is maybe a number two priority and then washing the
dishes is maybe number three priority C so you're prioritizing
things in life now are these priorities real in the
absolute sense of course not this is a projection of
your mind which is helping you to deal with the
stuff that you need to do as a survival machine
in the world because your children your even washing the
dishes these are all survival activities also this notion includes
making sense of life all attempts to make sense of
life so if you're sitting there at night look it
up at the Stars and you're wondering what does this
all mean what is the significance of all this why
is this earth here and this creation and all this
why am i conscious so you're trying to ascribe a
meaning to it to all this and that's a subjective
thing it also includes all notions of goals especially ultimate
goals so you might have an ultimate goal for your
personal life for your relationship for your family maybe for
your business you have some ultimate goal maybe you want
to retire somewhere move somewhere do something achieve something with
your career maybe you're a scientist and you want to
make some groundbreaking physics discovery which transforms humanity's understanding of
the cosmos and you think that's a very significant thing
and what I'm telling you is that you're creating that
it's not the case that scientific discoveries are inherently meaningful
you have created that for yourself and now you believe
that and notice that when you believe that something is
meaningful it's not simply that oh yes I created this
that it's meaningful no no no the way that it
works for most people is very unconsciously so what they'll
say is it actually is me this is actually meaningful
that's why I'm doing it I must do this because
it's so meaningful so meaning is tricky in that sense
is that when you start to hold something as meaningful
you start to think of it as real not as
something that you invented meaning also includes all notions of
worth this includes self-worth other worth so what are people
worth to you what are your children worth to you
and I don't just mean monetary value although that also
is included in meaning so all monetary values I hope
it's clear that those are all relative it's not like
a banana is worth actually ten cents or a hundred
yen or 20 pesos yes I mean you see how
it's it's arbitrary what does a banana worth it changes
every single day even just given human conventions so in
the absolute sense I hope you can see that a
banana doesn't actually have any worth nor do you have
any worth not monetary worth but not even self worth
cuz self worth becomes a self-esteem problem for people they
say like oh I'm not worthy I'm not good enough
but where's that coming from does the universe know that
you're not good enough or is that something you're making
up something you're inventing but see when you invent that
you're not good enough that's a big problem because you
don't hold it as like oh yeah I invented that
I'm not good enough no no no no when you
think you're not good enough you're not attractive enough you're
not masculine enough you're not feminine enough you're not pretty
enough you're not smart enough whatever you're not enough you
think that's real you think that's the way it is
so you think that's absolute you don't think that's relative
that's why it's a problem for you so the solution
there is to realize you're doing it and also meaning
includes all notions of better or worse so think about
all the situations in your life where you thought oh
man this is going so great this is such a
good situation or all the situation really oh man this
is terrible this is such a terrible situation it's so
bad like maybe you got sick or maybe your cat
got run over by a car and man that's such
a terrible situation it's so bad it's so sad is
so depressing you know death what could be more negative
than death but even death is a relative thing in
the absolute sense is death bad no of course not
simply you're programmed by nature to avoid death you hold
it as the ultimate bad because that is the the
ultimate standard by which you judge everything else you see
because meaning is designed to serve your life death is
held as the ultimate negative meaning and to overcome that
and to see that you're creating that that's not actually
the case but that you're creating that that's where this
gets a little bit deeper you see cuz when I
talk about your death like let's say you go to
the doctor tomorrow and he tells you you're gonna have
cancer and you're gonna die in a couple months you're
gonna have a very negative reaction to that all sorts
of negative emotions and oh my god this is such
a terrible thing you're gonna start to cry and all
this is gonna happen even though intellectually you might say
oh yeah well I know all meetings are constructed and
yet here you are constructing this negative meaning from death
when in fact does death have a negative meaning no
not at all so what might it look like if
you actually realized that death does not have a negative
meaning that death is meaningless and that life is meaningless
see this is where people don't want to go they're
okay with thinking about a banana not having any meaning
that's okay that's not controversial but when it comes to
your death when it comes to your children when it
comes to your family your country your God all your
favorite ideologies money morality the environment do you care about
the environment values such as freedom equality justice happiness health
your car your house your beautiful spouse travel good food
not catching diseases your favorite cultural icons literature love politics
truth all of these you think these have inherent meaning
what what might it be like to realize that these
are all relative things and that their meaning is simply
a creation of your own mind something that you project
out into the world imagine looking at your children and
realizing they have no meaning imagine looking at society and
realizing it has no meaning imagine looking at science if
you're a fan of science and realizing that it's completely
meaningless see that's the level of depth that we're talking
about here to see all the consequences all the ripple
effects of what I'm talking about here that can be
deep and a lot of people never want to go
here but of course this is exactly where we need
to go in order to get the biggest growth meaning
versus meaninglessness is a duality significance versus insignificance is a
duality why is that important because a duality means that
you don't just have meaningful objects out in the world
the meaningful object is always defined relative to a meaningless
object that's how meaning operates you see it's a-- it's
a system of contrasts and you need both sides of
the coin for it to work like heads and tails
in black and white and of course what you should
already know is the truth of non-duality at least you
should know it conceptually and the truth of non-duality tells
us that everything is non-dual which means that all dualities
must ultimately collapse into a unity and that's exactly what
I'm telling you here meaning is the contrast between what
is and isn't useful to you as a survival machine
that's all that it really is and notice that there
is nothing absolutely useful to anybody what's useful to you
today might be useless to you tomorrow and harmful to
you the next day what's useful to you to survive
might be harmful to another creature for example we tend
to think that well if an asteroid hits the planet
and destroys all of humanity that would be a terrible
thing perhaps the worst thing that could happen to humanity
and yet that's only from our human perspective because hey
humanity might die out but then other creatures and life-forms
might now get a chance to rise to the top
and to flourish and maybe they will take care of
the planet better than we did but of course that's
not a notion we like to entertain because we're very
biased all right human species perspective and we want to
survive not just individuals but also as a species but
of course that's completely biased see so it's relative an
asteroid hitting the earth might be a great thing for
cockroaches and we forget that and this this distorts our
perceptions of reality because we tend to think that well
reality is there to serve us and of course it
seems that way because mostly what people are preoccupied with
in their lives is a self survival when your occupation
is self survival and that's all you care about that
of course you don't care about the truth there's no
room for the truth because to actually discover the truth
you have to be very objective you have to step
outside of your personal agenda and even your species agenda
and even the agenda of life even the agenda of
evolution a lot of people make the mistake of thinking
well life is just about survival and reproduction and then
they they live their whole life that way but if
you live your whole life that way you're not gonna
have a very happy life because you are gonna be
then dictated by just the force of what it takes
to survive you're gonna have a very miserable life living
that way and people think well but leo that's all
there is there's nothing more well maybe there is something
more you just haven't explored it because you're so focused
on survival and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you need
to start to notice that your mind projects meaning on
to reality the whole point of the ego and the
whole point of selfishness is to overlay a weighted field
of polarity on top of reality like a net which
helps you to navigate and otherwise unnavigable terrain why is
this important well you can really appreciate this if you
think the way that a robotics engineer might let's say
that we're engineering a robot and we want this robot
to be a self-sufficient creature like let's say like your
dog so how would we create this robot well first
we need to give it perceptions it would need to
be able to see hear smell taste touch etc but
once we give all these to the robot it's got
all the raw data that it needs it's got a
connection to reality let's say but is that enough for
it to survive no clearly not because let's say this
robot sees a cliff and it just runs right over
the cliff falls to its death is that a problem
for the robot no of course not cuz for the
robot you didn't program any meaning you didn't create this
projected matrix of polarity of things that are more important
less important it doesn't know good from bad positive from
negative because these things don't actually exist until you create
them so if you want this robot to actually survive
you're gonna need to teach it how to recognize situations
which are threatening to its survival cliffs and so forth
and you're gonna need to teach us situations which are
beneficial to its survival like how to get electricity so
maybe this robot is gonna see a wall socket that
he can plug itself into to get its juice and
for it that will be like it's food and you
could program it to be very appetizing so every time
your robot walks by a wall socket oh man it's
so juicy I just want to stick myself right in
there charge up and that looks very appetizing and it
gets its emotions revving up and any time it's running
low on juice then it starts to feel some negative
emotions starts to feel some pain in its belly so
to speak and then it runs around looking for a
wall socket and if anytime it's walking by a cliff
then it experiences a deep terror and fear of death
and it runs away from the cliff and what are
we describing here we're describing the robot called you see
your mind uses meanings to manipulate you that is why
meaning exists that's the only reason it exists if not
for that the notion of something meaning something doesn't make
sense you can't just have a meaning out there floating
in the ether as though like this means something to
God or whatever no it only means something to you
and even then that's always subject to change just depends
you know some people might be happy if a city
got obliterated with an asteroid there are people right now
who don't like their neighbors one city doesn't like a
neighboring city and they would be thrilled if one of
their neighboring cities that they didn't like one of their
enemy cities was destroyed by an asteroid just so long
it didn't hurt them too much see that would be
fine but then if an asteroid was big enough now
to kill the whole human race well now we got
a problem now all the sudden we have to band
together to work to stop that you see so it's
relative so the size of the asteroid will determine whether
you think of it as a positive or negative a
little one it's okay if it hits your enemy great
I love it if it hits you or it wipes
out the whole human race and you along with it
oh man that's a terrible thing that's how it works
you need to notice that you are a puppet of
your minds meaning making apparatus it's got you by the
balls or by the ovaries whichever one and it's dictating
your entire life this is a very ironically again significant
factor in your life is whether you realize this or
not now you might wonder well what about from God's
point of view doesn't stuff mean stuff from God's point
of view people misunderstand what God is and what God's
point of view is God's point of view is not
the point of view of a person or of a
who God is not some grand who sitting up in
the clouds to whom everything is meaningful God is the
absence of who God is the absence of personhood God
is complete objectivity from God's point of view everything is
100% equal in weight there are no polarities for God
God doesn't discriminate that's why people say God is all
loving God is all loving because to him everything is
cool she can't be hurt it's not a he isn't
it it's not even an it we don't have a
good a good reference for it but it is the
closest thing we can get to God everything is equally
insignificant or you could flip it around say everything is
equally significant it doesn't matter because the only notion of
significance that's of significance is when there's contrasts as soon
as you eliminate the contrast the whole thing collapses into
irrelevance from God's point of view everything is being and
that should be the point of view that you aspire
to is to see everything as being because being is
all that there actually is meanings are illusions meanings are
something we construct being is what actually is and what
is being well being is what you see right in
front of you you might say it's like the matter
of which the universe is made out of but not
your concept of matter I mean actual being the way
you're experiencing with your consciousness being if you just stay
very conscious and objective with being you'll notice that being
has no meaning no purpose and no value nor does
it need these things nor is it diminished by not
having these things you might say that beings purpose or
meaning is simply to be that's its job its job
is to be and being what most people don't realize
is that being is infinitely more profound than meaning people
think that all meaning if I strip my life of
meaning then what's what's that gonna be it's gonna be
very miserable bad life no not at all it would
be infinitely profound because you would then experience God's eye
view of reality that's a very profound thing far more
profound than meaning running around looking for meaning which is
what most people do they chase meaning the reason they
chase meaning is because they think that it's inherent to
reality if they didn't think that they wouldn't chase it
so much you see meaning is a sneaky mechanism and
it operates like an illusion because that's his job its
job is to get you to chase that's what it's
there for and if you realize that it was an
illusion then it wouldn't feel as real and a solid
as it would otherwise and then you would stop chasing
it and that would undermine your self survival reflex and
some part of you is afraid to go down that
road because you're worried about well how am I going
to survive if i undermine myself survival reflex but see
the problem is is that you've been creating meaning in
your life way beyond what you need to survive to
the point where it has become toxic and neurotic and
actually this is the main reason why people become interested
in personal development why are you interested in personal them
because you want to improve your life why do you
want to improve your life because some aspects of your
life suck right you're not happy with them but why
is that well that's because you created all these meanings
as you were growing up your family and people around
you we're all creating meetings the way you were your
culture fed you with meetings so all these meetings were
created and then you got a hot board with that
and so you sort of creating meanings and you started
attaching meetings to this and to that you thought that
a marriage is good a hot girlfriend is good a
nice husband is good lots of money is good this
is good that is good and so you did all
this you slapped all these labels on this reality you
did this all unconsciously without realizing what you're actually doing
you thought that that hot girlfriend actually was good and
that that marriage actually was good and that money is
inherently good without realizing that no you were just imagining
that to get yourself into action and you were creating
these meanings unconsciously and now you got so addicted to
this process that now whenever you're not getting the thing
that you were labeled is good and you're getting the
thing that you label is bad or harmful that now
all of a sudden all your negative emotions come up
and you're hot and bothered by all this and now
you suffer see and you can't stop the suffering because
you literally believe that that good thing that you need
isn't given to you so that you actually believe that's
harming you and that bad thing you actually believe that
that's harming you too and that's why you suffer and
now if I tell you that that's all a construction
of your mind you say well Lia that's crazy that's
crazy you're telling me money's a construction of my mind
no man I need money to live that's actually real
that's not a construction of my mind and so on
with everything else with your girlfriend and your boyfriend and
your marriage and this and that and your house and
and your children and all that your think that that's
all real and that's why you're chasing it and you'll
be chasing it until you're dead and you will never
get satisfaction from that process because that process is not
designed to satisfy you you wonder why you're not satisfied
with life it's not because life is shitty it's because
you've assigned all these meanings to things and you've disconnected
yourself from being which is the only thing there is
of life you're wrapped up in illusions and of course
illusions are hollow and therefore your life feels hollow because
you keep chasing phantoms which you can never catch they
always slip through your fingers no matter how much meaningful
stuff you get have you noticed that you always need
more it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how many billions
of dollars how many hotwives or great children you have
it not if it matters you will always feel hollow
inside so long as you're disconnected from being because all
those things are illusions but people don't realize that there
are two ways to construct meaning unconsciously and consciously if
you construct meaning unconsciously you will have that situation that
I just explained to you if you become conscious though
of how meaning is created and you go through this
somewhat painful process to discover how much you've been projecting
and you develop the maturity to really take that on
and to actually accept it and then you learn how
your mind is actually creating meaning and then you take
control of that mechanism you can do it consciously which
means that you can create meaning and there's nothing wrong
with creating meaning as long as you realize that you're
creating meaning and also you think about why you're creating
it for what purpose what do you hope to achieve
by it and you realize the limitations of the process
so I'm not saying you should cut out all meaning
entirely but really just become conscious of this so you're
not chasing phantoms okay that's it for right now I'm
gonna do a quick intermission take a little break so
my mind is sharp and then I'll be back here
in a second don't go anywhere with some more all
right let's do some Q&A and answer some objections because
I noticed that a lot of people get stuck on
this topic even though I think it's a very simple
topic understanding what meaning is is not that complicated but
for some reason it just does not compute in people's
minds and they have all sorts of objections which keep
them from embracing what I'm saying so the first objection
might sound something like this but Leo isn't it the
case that we see progress within evolution it seems like
our universe is evolving life on Earth is evolving the
entire planet is evolving governments societies cultures technology science it's
all progressing it's all evolving it's all becoming more sophisticated
more complicated isn't it all moving towards something some ultimate
grand purpose or point like the singularity or something like
that there's no denying that evolution seems to be progressing
towards more complexity where that ultimately leads to we don't
know yet we can speculate but we don't really know
but it's very dangerous to fall into this rat race
mentality and thinking that progress will get you to some
ultimate state of Nirvana it won't your progress is always
progressing just two more being more being more being more
being more being at the end of the rainbow is
just more being the entire rainbow is made of being
the beginning of the rainbow is being it's all being
progress is a relative notion progress is something that some
organisms might want and think is favourable others may not
is a subjective and relative thing being is just what
it is even if progress is taking place it's still
seeing place within being people these days get caught up
in this rat race mentality in the same way that
they do with their careers and retirement they think something
like well if I work for the next 50 years
really hard then I can retire and spend the next
ten years of my life in the last 10 20
years of my life on a beach somewhere just chilling
out and that's gonna be the perfect life but then
what happens that when those people do get there they
realize that all they're there is is just being and
this being is rather boring to them because throughout those
50 years they never cultivated an appreciation of being a
consciousness of being they thought they were gonna make it
to someplace without realizing that all there is is just
being all there was was just being and they could
have saved themselves 50 years of drudgery and grind by
accepting being right now rather than working towards some destination
you can work towards a destination there's no problem with
that per se just don't trick yourself into thinking that
the destination is the whole point of the journey that's
not the case when you become really conscious you realize
it's all just being and a lot of very successful
people fall into this trap I'd like to talk about
Ellen musk and rag on him a little bit precisely
because a lot of people hold him up as sort
of the role model of what a really good high-quality
human being should be doing it's like they should be
advancing society the cutting edge of science and progress and
inventing stuff and moving the human race forward and all
that and that's life purpose there's nothing wrong with life
purpose I did a whole course on life purpose I'm
big on life purpose but you have to recognize the
limits of that see a lot of people don't recognize
that actually Ellen musk is not conscious of this being
situation here he is very hooked on meaning for him
there's a apparently a very big meaning and creating all
these businesses and working very very hard to run them
all and there's nothing wrong with that per se but
he is disconnected from being which becomes a problem because
it never ends you see that's why you need to
create business after business after business no matter how many
businesses you create and how successful they are you could
fly yourself to Mars to Pluto to the edge of
the solar system it doesn't matter it's never gonna satisfy
cuz no matter where you get to all you have
is being the meaning that you're attaching to the stuff
you're creating that's illusion you created that and you need
to become a conscious of that as quickly as possible
in your life to avoid negative consequences the next objection
goes something like but leo this is so negative you're
stripping meaning of everything and this is gonna make me
depressed negative is a meaning when I tell you that
reality is meaningless and that all meanings are projections and
you think that's depressing a negative that's you continuing to
assign and project a meaning onto what I told you
you get that meaninglessness isn't negative that would be a
meaning meaninglessness is meaningless you get that you got to
get that I mean it's pretty simple but for some
people again it doesn't compute but I know it can
be depressing I've gone through this you can a face
an existential crisis here because what you do is you
build up your whole life as about achieving meaning family
career business science helping people in your community you know
loving people compassion all this sort of stuff but you
never realized that it's just a castle you built up
in the sky the reason that this news is depressing
to you at first and it might be for a
while is because you've been avoiding being in your life
he takes real maturity and consciousness to fully embrace being
and the emptiness of being this is something that most
people do not do they in fact actively avoid it
by going around chasing more meaning see they come up
with some meaning they don't even know that they constructed
the meaning they chase the meaning they acquire it then
they want more because meaning never satisfies you because meaning
is an illusion so you chase more and more and
more and you're never fulfilled and then when someone tells
you that what you're doing is you're just like running
around like a a mouse in a wheel that depresses
you because you want more you constantly keep wanting more
but you want more in the wrong direction see there's
plenty to be had when you become conscious of infinite
being being is absolutely infinite there's more of it than
you can ever possibly want but meaning is completely illusory
and non existent you can never get enough of something
which isn't real so the harsh reality here is that
there's nothing more than being being is all that there
is that's the bad news the good news is that
being is absolutely infinite and it's all you could ever
possibly want and being is infinitely more profound than meaning
people think that if all of an if I just
lose my meaning then what am I going to do
in life I'm gonna be so depressed no that's just
the initial hump get over that hump and you realize
that actually meaning was such a cheap thing compared to
being being is so much better it's so much deeper
so much richer it's so much more mysterious and amazing
that there is being but it has no meaning and
that it's groundless but you have to become conscious of
that and it takes work to become conscious of that
and most people don't do the work to become conscious
of that because they're scared off by this initial hump
of negativity or depression so don't get caught in that
trap watch yourself for assigning negative meanings to meaninglessness the
next objection goes like this but Leo how am I
supposed to use this what you're talking about here just
isn't practical I'm interested in building my business and creating
an awesome kind of life and now you're coming in
here and you're you're you're screwed up the whole plans
you're not motivating me you're actually demotivating me well here's
the thing about this what I'm actually telling you is
incredibly practical you holding it as impractical is really just
because what I'm doing is I'm undermining your ego-driven lifestyle
of course to your ego driven lifestyle what I'm telling
you is like putting a wrench in the works of
that whole project it has very significant practical consequences it's
just that you don't want those you want to continue
your ego driven lifestyle so of course what I'm telling
you seems impractical and it seems like it's moving you
in the opposite direction well you know what that's why
this stuff I say I keep saying is counterintuitive because
a lot of times to grow you got to move
backwards or at least it seems as though you're moving
backwards your problem is not that you don't have enough
meaning in your life it's that you assign all the
wrongs meanings to all the wrong stuff and you're not
conscious of the fact that you're doing this and that
you are not really in touch with being if you
were fully in touch with being it would give you
infinite satisfaction you can just sit there all day and
be happy on your couch you wouldn't need to go
anywhere but that's not the case for most people because
you haven't developed that yet you haven't realized yet that
there's nowhere to go there's nothing to do there's nothing
to achieve you can do those things but if you're
doing those things because you think they're gonna make you
happy which is why most people do them you're caught
in the illusion of the rat race and you're gonna
be constantly forever disappointed and you're not even gonna know
why you're disappointed it's just gonna feel like your entire
life is lackluster like it's always less than you thought
it could be the reason that is is because that's
what you get when you go around chasing illusions not
realizing that they're illusions the nature of an illusion is
that it's hollow so your life feels hollow because it
is hollow the way that you're currently living in the
other objection is but leo now there's no more reason
for me to take action after all you just said
I could just sit there on my ass all day
and do nothing is that what you want me to
do the reality is that there never was a reason
for you to do anything reasons were inventions that society
culture and your parents fed you to get you to
be a good little monkey to do what they wanted
you to do why so that they could survive easier
and so you could survive easier that's why there was
no other reason there is no reason to do anything
there's no reason to stay alive there's no reason to
live there's no reason to eat there's no reason to
have sex there's no reason to do anything there's no
reason to personally develop yourself there's no reason to pursue
truth there's no reason to get enlightened there's no reason
to be happy or to be sad but people get
addicted to these reasons and then their whole life becomes
about reasons without realizing that reasons or something you construct
after the fact to justify what you did or sometimes
you constructed before the fact as well in order to
get yourself to do stuff that you probably really shouldn't
have been doing in the first place see the reason
you need your reason is because you're trying to do
stuff that you don't really even want to do and
then you need all sorts of reasons to motivate yourself
but when you really want to just do something when
you have an natural spontaneous desire to do something you're
just gonna do it you don't need a reason to
do it you don't need to rationalize it away most
of your life you've been living it by acting out
of delusion this is called attachment you've been attached to
things that you thought you should or you have to
do or that there are good reasons to do well
what nobody told you is that all that is a
crock that there are no reasons for anything and now
what you're being presented with here is the option to
act from truth which means the option to act from
detachment where you don't need anything you don't need to
do anything but you can if you want to if
you have the genuine desire to and isn't that what
you want in your life don't you want your whole
life just to be you doing what you desire isn't
one of the things you most resent about life is
having to do things you don't really want to do
see well that's all the stuff that has to do
with reasons and meanings that have been created if you
get rid of all the meanings and all the reasons
then what you're left with is just you're free you're
free to play the game however you want there's really
two options here you can grind through life which is
obligating yourself with all these meanings and reasons and having
them run your life unconsciously or you can free yourself
of those and then you can play the same way
that a child plays in a playground if you see
a child in a sandbox building a sandcastle you don't
ask him well what's the reason why are you building
that sandcastle there is no reason he's playing you see
that child is still fresh his consciousness is still fresh
he was recently born so he's actually closer to consciousness
and to being than you are as an adult as
an adult your mind filled with all sorts of nonsense
and reasons and justifications and all this and all these
cultural conditioning things and values and principles and so now
you're just bogged down with this stuff where as a
child can just play and a child enjoys himself generally
speaking when he's playing so the choice is yours do
you want your life to be a grind or it
to be a play the next objection is but leo
should I then have no values and no purpose seems
like that's what you're saying no that's not what I'm
saying meaning value and purpose is still useful in practice
you will still have them in fact I think to
really self actualize you need to construct a really compelling
life purpose to get you out of bed in the
morning life purpose is very helpful my life purpose course
is very practical you just need to realize that these
are relative things that these are constructions so that you're
not attached to your purpose see so you don't become
neurotic about it so you don't become a slave of
your purpose so you're flexible that's we're talking about now
you might say well leo so that's does this mean
this is just a word game cuz I thought you
were saying I have to get rid of values and
meanings and purposes and now you're saying that I need
to construct them so you're just playing word games I
mean I already have values and I already have certain
kind of meanings so what are you talking about here
what is supposed to change no it's not just a
word game because right now if you're like most people
you believe in absolute meaning and the change comes when
you realize that there is no such thing as absolute
meaning and that all your meaning is relative and now
you have more flexibility and control with that it might
seem like a philosophical difference absolute relative what's the big
difference it seems subtle when you intellectualize about it but
when you actually experience it in practice when you actually
real sit down and realize there's nothing to do there's
nowhere to go like literally there's nothing to do and
nowhere to go and nothing has any meaning whatsoever including
my continuing to exist has no meaning whatsoever and once
you resign yourself to that that's a really big change
then when you go and take action from that first
you realize that really deeply then you start to go
take action from it and it's a very different way
of taking action it might seem like the action is
the same you might still go to work you might
still start a business you might still have a family
but the reasons why you're doing those things are gonna
be very different that's the key that's the difference now
of course some people might think here below isn't this
nihilism isn't that what you're really talking about nihilism says
that nothing is meaningful there's no purpose to anything yes
of course what I'm saying is nihilism spirituality is nihilism
actualized that's all it is this is a counterintuitive thing
though people don't like to hear this they think that
spirituality is the opposite of nihilism because isn't spirituality about
having all these higher consciousness values like love and goodness
and consciousness and God and passion and all the stuff
a lot of values a lot of values in spirituality
but this is uh this is people who haven't really
practiced spirituality these are people who only believe in spirituality
what I said is that spirituality is nihilism actualized and
there are a lot of people who like to think
about nihilism and of course nihilism has a negative connotation
to it but all those people are doing they're just
believing they're intellectualizing about nihilism they're not realizing it even
many nihilists self-proclaimed nihilists will not actually be nihilists in
practice what I'm talking about is being a nihilist in
practice enlightenment is absolute nihilism that's what it is and
all spiritual values ultimately stem from nihilism now how can
that be that seems like a contradiction nihilism says there's
no values and yet spiritual values come from nihilism and
spiritual people tend to act in the most responsible and
the most moral ways well if they're really spiritual if
they're spiritual then they act in very evil ways like
the Spanish Inquisition and so forth so all the evils
of religion of course that's nihilism on actualised this is
a counterintuitive thing and I want to shoot a whole
episode on nihilism specifically but the reason this works is
that once you realize that everything is meaningless you are
able to get in touch with being and when you
get in touch with being that being is so profound
and divine that it transforms you from the inside not
through any kind of moralization God doesn't give you some
Ten Commandments to obey that's not why you become moral
simply because you realize that all being is infinite and
remarkable in such a staggering way that you lose all
sense of self-importance and that ends up being the key
to truly moral behavior is losing a sense of self-importance
see because meanings charge your perceptions when you remove all
the meanings your perceptions are clear and perfect and objective
and you see the magic of being the beauty of
it the power of it and this ends up being
not a dry philosophical sort of thing but a very
a very human a very rich religious experience that's what's
called the religious experience of course a lot of people
misinterpret that and then they they they then build all
sorts of moral systems around this but see because most
people never actually reach true actualized nihilism they stay stuck
at the sort of intellectual level of spirituality now there's
the question of like but what about Buddhism and you
know other mystical traditions which encourage love and compassion they
don't seem very nihilistic that's because you have to understand
that most mainstream spirituality cannot come out and tell you
the truth about what it is firstly because a lot
of people who do mainstream spirituality and teach mainstream spirituality
are not themselves enlightened so they don't know what they're
talking about that's number one they're just talking stuff they
read it in a Bible or whatever or some dogma
that got handed down to them through their guru they
didn't experience themselves and secondly because even if they did
they can't tell you outright what it is because then
it wouldn't be mainstream the surest way to lose your
audience and to make your teaching non mainstream is by
stripping it of all meaning people just hate that the
mind hates it it's an acquired taste which is why
there are so few spiritual masters and gurus out there
cuz people generally don't want this stuff so what teachings
like Buddhism and Sufism and Christianity whatever else you know
these teachings that talk about compassion and love what they
do is they put the cart before the horse they
try to teach you the fruits of enlightenment without actually
having people become enlightened which is putting the cart before
the horse it craze a big problem but in a
sense they have to do this because otherwise they could
not sell their ideology to millions of people because people
just don't handle the truth the truth is something you
have to have a really deep passion for and you
have to go pursue on your own and discover on
your own and then once you discovered absolute nihilism and
it transforms you and then you become a mystic and
you become loving as a result of that see then
people will try to emulate you and they think oh
I can do that too I can just be loving
I can walk around and be loving but see what
they don't realize is that with an ego you can't
walk around and be loving as you're projecting meanings everywhere
and you're afraid of your own death and you're clinging
to all your possessions and you're clinging to your house
and your car and your bank account and your wife
or your husband or your children you're trying to protect
all this stuff you're so wrapped up in your egoic
lifestyle that there's no way you can truly be compassionate
and one's that what ends up happening is that when
you preach compassion to people when you moralize to them
and tell them you can't do this you can't do
that and this is what this means and God says
the purpose of life is is to be good and
not to be evil not to do sin and all
this when you set it up like that then actually
what you do is you set a person up for
committing a lot of evil because you give them the
idea that they can go out there and just be
passionate I mean not passionate but compassionate and that they
can be loving when in fact you're setting them up
to fail they can't be loving they've never experienced unconditional
love they don't know what a conditional love is they
never experienced the truth they don't know where those moral
principles are actually derived from because they never bothered to
derive it for themselves so if you want to be
like a mystic do what the mystic does don't ape
the Mystics results do what the mystic did the core
thing the mystic did is he found the truth and
then from that came all the quote unquote good stuff
and see the mystic always understands that there is no
such thing as good that these are projections so even
though he may act in a sort of good way
that's how people perceive him in his own mind he
does not think of himself as acting in a good
way or as being loving or as being selfless he
just has no self it's a very big difference between
acting selfless that's impossible for a self to do versus
actually not having a self that's possible because that's the
truth take some work but it's possible and the last
question here that I'm gonna answer is but Leo I
just don't buy it life is here it must be
here for a reason surely it has a purpose are
you really saying that all of this life is just
pointless what you're asking with this question is what is
the nature of being what is the nature of all
of existence that's what you're trying to understand without understanding
that you're trying to understand it in the wrong way
you're trying to give being a certain sense of purpose
or point or meaning which actually completely underestimates the magnitude
of what being is why is life here why does
it seem to have a purpose it's absolute infinity you're
inside absolute infinity you are absolute infinity like that like
that is just infinity that's what it is and you're
sitting there asking for its purpose that's only because you
don't recognize what it is when you recognize what it
is you're not gonna ask for its purpose it's going
to be infinitely times larger than any purpose you could
possibly imagine it's empty of purpose but that doesn't mean
ironically that it's insignificant it's the most significant thing that
you'll ever experience in your life but ironically even though
it sort of feels significant it's actually meaningless that's the
peridot paradoxical nature of the beast that we call reality
now of course it's no good to just believe me
on any of this stuff that I said and there
are different levels at which you can understand and internalize
what I've said first there's the intellectual conceptual level at
least get it on that level but that's not nearly
good enough what you need to do is you need
to sit down and actually derive what I'm saying for
yourself sit there with a banana or some object and
think about what does it mean from whose point of
view is it meaning and how am i projecting the
meaning I see how you're actually doing it once you
see how you're doing it that will start to loosen
things up for you ultimately you need to get to
the point where you feel the meaninglessness of life down
to your bones not intellectually but down to your bones
in a crippling sort of way where all your motivations
are thrilled under the bus where you question everything who
are you question why you're still alive today where you
question why you don't shoot yourself where you question why
you don't kill your kids where you question why you
should still go to work tomorrow where you question everything
why you should be good why you should be loving
why you should meditate why you should pursue in Lineman
or any of it and ultimately realize that there is
no reason even the pursuit of enlightenment or the truth
is completely pointless you need to come to that realization
yourself and not just come to it and react against
it but come to it and accept it in a
mature way and resign yourself to it such that it
it permeates your being and it rewires your entire motivational
system this is not going to happen without a midlife
crisis to really get what I'm saying here you will
have to experience them in life crisis and maybe more
than one and don't worry if this is not at
the midpoint of your life if you're only 15 years
old or 25 years old it doesn't matter have your
midlife crisis as soon as possible I was figuring this
stuff out when I was still in middle school that's
when I really had my midlife crisis was in middle
school and then that created the foundation for everything that
I became after that he was very important that I
got it out of the way early in life I
realized the pointlessness of life back then and I surrender
myself to it and it was a tough time tough
few months to a few years expect that for a
few months or a few years of of this process
you will be groundless you will feel confused you will
feel lost you might feel dejected you might be in
a funk you might feel unmotivated but that process that's
true growth happening right there just make sure you don't
spiral out of control down to some sort of existentialist
nihilist rabbit hole where you get depressed and bummed out
and take everything very negatively right because this whole thing
is meaningless so there's nothing negative about it and in
fact once you come out the other end you realize
that man this is the most positive thing ever because
this means reality is totally free I am free to
construct whatever meanings I want I'm free to change them
anytime I want I'm free to do whatever I want
I'm free I'm free I'm free and then from there
you can begin to take action again you can still
be very passionate about life I'm not saying not to
be passionate in fact if you want to be the
most passionate person you can be do what I'm telling
you to do even though it looks counterintuitive but really
think of it like this it's like popping a Boyle
with a needle if you have a nasty old cyst
on your finger or whatever and is filled with pus
and it's it's just aching and aching and itching you
take a hot needle you poke that thing yes that
process is painful and nasty but you do that and
all the pus comes out and then the thing heals
up and now you're happy you're happy camper that's what
this process is like it doesn't take days usually takes
months or years so that's the reality of it that's
why most people don't do it and then they suffer
for it for the rest of the lives because then
either they're stuck in this artificial matrix of meaning I'll
warn you to watch out for a trap which is
that even when you pop this boil and you realize
the the meaninglessness of it all you're gonna get sucked
back into the illusion just by the fact that you're
living in our society in our society fill is filled
with meanings artificial meanings that just get thrust upon you
and so maybe you'll have a child you have a
family you'll get a girlfriend a wife a husband or
you'll get a better career or what a house and
then that will become your meaning and what you got
to be very careful of is not to get sucked
too much into that meaning to always remind yourself that
okay I've realized and understood that everything is meaningless that
is the foundation for everything else I have to be
very careful that I don't let the illusion then turn
into the foundation because that can happen you can very
easily forget so in practice you might need to face
this midlife crisis over and over and over again until
you actually grasp it for good and when you do
have this midlife crisis you will then become much more
interested in spirituality and meditation and self inquiry and vice
versa the more that you do meditation self inquiry and
spirituality the more it'll bring you to the brink of
a midlife crisis so these two things go hand in
hand that's not a mistake don't make the assumption that
oh man something's going wrong with my meditation practice know
if you're facing a midlife crisis that's very healthy that's
very good that's exactly what you want so let me
just paint a little final picture for you of what
all of this that I'm talking about in this episode
will look like in the end after it's all said
and done after you go through this somewhat tortuous process
here's what you end up with you will have realized
that everything is absolutely pointless and that this is not
a problem this is actually a great thing it will
not disturb you in one one bit your focus will
shift to being from meaning from having and from doing
this being you will develop a very intimate connection with
it you will develop your consciousness such that this being
is a very palpable every moment of your existence and
this being will give you unconditional satisfaction you will no
longer need to chase circumstances in life but you will
just sit there and be no matter what's happening and
you'll be satisfied and you'll be deeply happy and you
will be truly free to play life however you want
without moralization without obligations without feeling pressured into doing it
and you will actually become playful you will become spontaneous
you will become more creative you will have much less
stress you'll be much more relaxed you'll spend more time
out in nature you'll be comfortable with solitude you won't
need to have a bunch of people around you to
keep you happy all the time you won't need to
go to parties you won't need to chase career after
career after career or business success after business success after
business success and yeah you can still do that you
just won't hinge your happiness on it you will be
fully alive in every moment you won't be waiting to
get to some moment where it's like oh yeah now
it's great cuz you'll realize that all moments are equal
they're all the same doesn't matter what moment you're in
and so what that does that allows you to enjoy
every single moment and if you think about it isn't
that what you want isn't that why you're doing personal
moment in the first place because right now in your
life you have a few moments sprinkled throughout your week
where they're really great but then 95% of the rest
of the time it's kind of boring it's kind of
lame or it's negative and it's causing you suffering and
stress so what do you want you want all of
your moments to be good moments right so how do
you do that can you do that by chasing stuff
can you do that by having a lot of money
and just like like in the morning I'm doing drugs
in the afternoon I'm going to a party in the
evening I'm gonna go have sex then the next morning
I'm do another kind of drug then the next afternoon
I'm gonna have a big business thing then the next
evening I'm gonna do something else then I'm doing something
can you do it that way no you can't do
that you'll you'll burn out even if you had all
the money in the world you would burn out doing
it that way that can't work and even if you
did that it would not be fulfilling you would find
that you would actually become very miserable you need to
do in a much more mellow way the mellow way
to do it is to to ground yourself in being
and you will also stop clinging to moments so when
you're having a good moment when you're with that amazing
girlfriend or boyfriend or when you're with your kids or
when you're in nature or when you're doing a drug
or whatever that peak you're not gonna cling to it
because you're gonna realize like oh yeah that's just one
moment out of all the moments and all my moments
are great moments cuz it's all being just different kinds
of being you see you're not gonna attach too much
meaning to anyone kind of being because you're have changed
from the meaning centered orientation towards life to the being
centered orientation towards life and that in nutshell is what
all your personal development or your consciousness work should be
leading you towards that's what it's about so in conclusion
stop chasing after a meaning and start pursuing being alright
that's it remember to click that like button for me
come check out actualized org my website see all the
resources I have for you there you can browse videos
better there are mp3s available for download for free if
you want to watch these or listen to them on
your mobile device my blog the forum life purpose course
book list more stuff to come and most importantly make
sure that you stick around and make a habit of
personal development watch every week's video I'm always releasing new
stuff there's a lot of important stuff I still need
to cover as we go forward a lot of foundational
topics that I've never talked about I try to cover
new topics every single week there's hundreds of stuff that
we need to cover years and years of stuff make
sure that you build your theoretical foundation that's very important
because otherwise you're gonna be going down dead ends and
doing stuff and falling into traps build your theoretical foundation
and you do that by just watching the theory every
single week and then once you've got a few years
down under your belt then you're gonna be able to
know how to navigate and know where to go know
which things are worthwhile to do and which things are
not worthwhile to do ironically right because I'm standing here
talking about there not being meaning and at the same
time all my videos are telling you what are the
most worthwhile and meaningful things for you to be pursuing
in life that's because I'm talking about relative meaning understanding
that absolute meaning doesn't exist see so I speak from
that perspective hopefully you can sit down and contemplate the
stuffers I'll figure it out so that when you're I'm
speaking you understand what I'm speaking about relative versus absolute
you
