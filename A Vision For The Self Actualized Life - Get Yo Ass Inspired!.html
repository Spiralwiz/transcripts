hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I want to share with you a vision for
the self actualized life the inspired life the kind of
life that's available for you I just got back from
a two-week pretty intense consciousness retreat where I did a
lot of inner work and a lot of thinking and
introspection a lot of pursuing of enlightenment and also meeting
and talking to a lot of interesting people who are
involved in self-improvement in some fashion and one of the
things that I kind of realized is I just realized
how lucky I am to be where I am in
2015 just reflecting back on what happened this year for
me I took five retreats I invested over ten thousand
dollars just in taking retreats traveling around the country I
took three vacations a seven day vacation a ten-day vacation
I'm going to take another vacation coming up here two
more to wrap up this year I get to set
my own schedule I wake up whenever I want I
go to sleep whenever I want I work in my
underwear although right now I'm wearing pants as I shoot
this got to keep things professional right umm I earn
six figures doing what I love this year I released
my dream project the life purpose course which I really
wanted to release because it feels like I get to
use it to to improve the world for the better
to make my contribution impact on the world so that
was really big for me worked really hard on that
I've received thousands over a thousand thank you emails and
thank-you comments on YouTube on my website in my inbox
every single week it's amazing to read some of the
some of the emails that I get from people that
get progress in their life from for applying some of
the concepts that I teach I bought pretty much everything
that I wanted every gadget every electronics thing television compute
like whatever I want gadget wise or books or you
know anything I want materially I basically have there's there's
like there's not much more I want I've pretty much
exhausted all of my material desires except for maybe buying
a house which I could do if I wanted to
but I just don't want to tie myself down with
that right now and my emotional and my mental development
I feel like it's skyrocketing and growing at rates that
I never imagined was even possible I thought that I
already knew so much but it's like no there's more
and then there's more and there's more and I'm just
discovering that it's like it's never-ending how much I can
learn and how much I can grow myself and how
good I can feel in my mind in my body
on a daily basis so the reason I say all
this is not to brag but just because I was
at this retreat and I was really having some deep
conversations with people and one of the individuals I met
there was this a 20 year old kid and he
was inspiring guy because I just talked and listened to
his story in fact I got a lot of people's
stories there but his story was interesting because he actually
became an apprentice and he was at this at this
consciousness thing for eight months straight he was living there
full-time working at it full-time that was like his whole
thing but before that he was basically just like an
ordinary teenager ordinary kid who just played video games back
to his thing was that he played Wow for like
ten hours a day that was this thing just went
to school [ __ ] with friends and played Wow
for ten hours a day and that was his life
and then he came here and he just had this
complete like mind-blowing transformation and what was interesting is that
he was learning consciousness work at this retreat and that's
cool you know conscious work is a very specific thing
it's a little different from self improvement or personal development
work but you know we just try to talk in
and I was talking about what I do and the
concepts that I talked about on my channel fourth and
he just got curious and we just started talking about
and I was trying to like help him a little
bit give him some advice about becoming a writer because
he wanted to become a writer and one of the
things he got from doing this conscious work is that
he saw that [ __ ] I'm wasting my life
playing Wow 10 hours a day I should be working
on my writing and so he actually started working on
his writing started making plans for all that stuff but
we started talking late at night and basically I started
exposing him to self-help material so some of the advice
that I'm exposing you guys to here through these videos
I was starting to expose him to some of that
stuff and it was starting to blow his mind I
could see it it's like he was listening to some
of these concepts it was the first time he ever
heard about some of these concepts even though he was
doing conscious work and you know conscious northing I said
is a different thing but it blew his mind because
he's like oh like it's actually possible to engineer systematically
engineer an awesome life for oneself like it's possible to
create an amazing career with passion it's possible to like
get your financial freedom in life it's possible to like
learn a lot about relationships and about sexuality and all
these other domains business and marketing and so forth and
like set up an amazing lifestyle for yourself like it
blew it was blowing his mind that this stuff is
possible to do and yeah I was you know telling
him more and more about this news getting curious but
what shocked me was it was an epiphany for me
was that he was shocked by the fact that these
are possibilities for him and what clicked in my mind
is I had to slot I'm like oh my [
__ ] god ordinary people I'm so involved with self-improvement
work that I'm like out of touch with the fact
that ordinary people don't even know it's not that they
don't know that there's personal development work that they should
be doing it's like they don't even know that there
is such a thing called self improvement at all this
concept is completely foreign to most people like it was
for this guy I was telling you about something seventies
he's just like oh my god I never realized like
I could actually live a life that's passionate and that
feels like I'm alive that's like not what all my
friends are doing and not what like my family is
kind of expects they need to do I just like
thought that I was just like go working some regular
job you know in a grocery store or something like
this or bartending or whatever and maybe just work a
little bit on my writing you know like that was
kind of his plan and it blew my mind because
I realize like holy [ __ ] what needs to
happen here more than me just communicating a bunch of
techniques to you guys and concepts and advanced theory Theory
collide ia's what needs to happen is just more communication
of the vision of what you can create for yourself
and what I really want you to buy into is
the idea that there is this thing of self-improvement and
not just a 20% self-improvement or like a 50% self-improvement
but like uh five thousand percent twenty thousand percent like
life altering radically changing how you feel about life who
you think you are in life what you're doing in
life like completely wiping the slate clean and rebuilding yourself
kind of self-improvement one of the problems is that most
people don't really realize that this is out there this
is possible it seems like a fantasy especially if you're
stuck in an environment with friends and family who set
a shitty example and the fact is that most friends
and family set a shitty example including my own I
came from a background where that was the case so
I wasn't privileged in any way by having some great
well-functioning family in fact one of my main motives I
think for getting into this work was because of how
shitty the example was set by my parents so there's
that but then there's also pop culture so you watch
movies video games television all this kind of stuff Netflix
Internet you just get sucked into all that and then
pop culture basically destroys your capacity to live a creative
fully alive life and it robs you of this drive
that you could have so this was an epiphany that
I had I think that more needs to be said
about this like just hammering this point home because I
want you to see what you're missing out on in
your life because I don't think you get it even
if you're following this work even if you're dabbling a
bit in self-improvement I still don't think you get just
how much you're leaving on the table right now and
how much is possible for you so I want to
share a little bit of my vision for what self-actualization
is what I call self-actualization this actually concept that I
was inspired to take from Abraham Maslow who I think
coined a term self-actualization here's how he defines it it's
the realization of one's potentials capacities and talents the fulfillment
of one's mission in life a fuller knowledge of one's
intrinsic nature getting really in touch with your authentic self
and becoming a whole human being not the fragmented human
being not the small petty human being that you are
right now it's an unceasing trend towards unity and integration
within yourself Maslow said there are two types of pleasure
scarcity pleasure and abundance pleasure scarcity pleasure is the relief
that one gets from the loss of tension and anxiety
ringabel isn't that what you're doing with most of your
goals in life right now is you're trying to reduce
tension fear and anxiety and pain and this gives you
a certain kind of pleasure when you do this a
certain relief and you think that you're actually accomplishing a
lot and it's a good first step but then consider
abundance pleasure abundance pleasure is the ecstasy at functioning at
one's prime the ecstasy of functioning at once prime it's
not just about fixing a dysfunction that you have it's
not about curing your depression or it's not about fixing
your crappy job and getting a good job no it's
about the bliss that you get from living an excellent
virtuous life from acing life there's a very big difference
from like failing at life to doing good in life
to acing life that takes a whole new level of
commitment I know a lot of people who are relatively
successful they earn 50 to $100,000 a year which is
good enough to get them the kind of nice basically
comfortable carefree lifestyle that they want and sure they have
some higher aspirations but but basically you know they're just
kind of like living well which is easy enough to
do in modern society but they're not really functioning at
the peak of their potential I wouldn't really call these
people self actualized or self actualizing seif actualization is a
this is an ideal you never really get some ultimate
destination it's a it's a trend an unceasing trend as
Maslow says a trend towards what well it's the pursuit
of the following is the pursuit of humanity it's the
pursuit of creativity it's the pursuit of knowledge the pursuit
of fairness rationality playfulness authentic love virtue truth beauty and
a feeling of joy and real deep gratitude and fulfillment
with life notice that this is not just getting security
in life or getting comfort in life this is something
very different than that if you're living your life for
security and comfort which probably 90% of you are then
you know that's a good start you got to start
somewhere but that shouldn't be your vision your vision has
to be higher it has to really tap into the
ultimate of what a human being can be let me
tell you little bit about that what's possible for you
what is possible for you if you really commit yourself
to a lifelong path of self-actualization work of working not
just on the outside circumstances of your life but mostly
focusing on really the inside circumstances your beliefs your attitudes
your habits and patterns and so on there's a real
huge difference between the regular life and the self-actualized life
and you'll start to see more and more of it
as I talk like I said it's living to the
peak of human capability and most of us state we
don't really know what the peak of human capability what
this means because we're growing up in a culture around
us and are the people that we grow up around
are probably pretty average they're probably pretty neurotic and dysfunctional
they're not really superstars because even if once in a
while you do encounter a superstar chances are he or
she then exits and passes through your life because usually
superstars want to associate with other superstars that's one of
the secrets of of moving up in life associating with
really ambitious people who really understand this vision for what
they can get out of life and they're really bought
into it and if you grew up an environment where
your parents or friends or siblings they weren't bought in
and your co-workers weren't bought in and so forth then
you don't even know what's going on like what is
possible for you you think that what's possible for you
is just what's possible for the common herd like a
cow who grows up in a factory farm doesn't really
know what it's like to really be a a cow
who lives on a green beautiful pasture out in out
of nature all he sees is just the feedlots and
all the other cows crammed in together in some aluminum
shed which is not how you're designed to live imagine
for a minute a moment in your life where you
felt the most alive with creative energy where you were
giddy with creativity you were working on something or you
had some brilliant idea or maybe some artistic inspiration or
you were just blown away by something that you read
and you wanted to do more with that or you
were blown away why by piece of music or you
blown away by something you saw in the movies or
maybe you were blown away by something you saw out
in nature or you were moved by some speaker that
you heard speaking giving a motivational speech or whatever imagine
right now conjure up a memory from the past you
have one of these memories where you really felt creatively
alive and maybe you have to go back 10 20
30 years to find this moment all the way back
maybe to your childhood but you can find one of
these moments and go ahead and just close your eyes
for just a few seconds and try to recall the
emotions in your body that you actually felt when you
were creatively alive and really juiced up and really like
ready to go do something in the world close your
eyes right now and picture that try to get a
little bit of that feeling back in your body if
you can here's what's possible you got that feeling here's
what's possible what's possible and you're probably not going to
believe this but what's possible is that you can live
every single day of your life feeling that way consistently
every single day waking up charged and feeling alive and
eager going through your whole day creating and stoking up
even more of that energy and then going to sleep
after a whole day of work and all this kind
of creative cool stuff that you do and all these
ideas that you have and going to sleep almost more
excited than when you woke up because you got so
much done and now there's so much more to do
that's what possible it's possible to turn your work into
your top passion it's possible to be creatively driven in
your life and to have that imbue and soak through
into every aspect and facet of your life from your
relationships to your finances to your health to everything else
it's possible to really make the most meaningful contribution that
you can possibly make to the world it's possible to
actually live that and to do that to be a
leader to be someone who's inspirational to others it's possible
to free yourself of your neuroses and your fears and
any kind of other limitations that hold you back and
SAP this aliveness feeling that you were just experiencing when
you were visualizing your memory it's possible to remove all
those balls and chains that are tied to your feet
that are holding you back to break all the shackles
and it's possible to really learn and master all the
key areas of life career wealth health friendships intimate relationship
self-esteem and confidence so you have really strong confidence in
yourself really full self-acceptance you're like a fully integrated human
being where you don't browbeat yourself you don't sabotage yourself
you don't feel guilty you don't feel shameful you don't
feel sad you don't feel nihilistic you don't feel depressed
you don't feel angry towards others you don't feel critical
you don't feel negative at all you can learn to
shed all those habits those are all internal toxic habits
that you think is just the norm and part and
parcel of being a human being but it's not it's
just that the society we grew up in we think
it's kind of a good society but it's a it's
a really toxic society toxic culture environment and we just
we just normalize to it and we think that asks
what's normal and that's what's typical and that anything else
seems like it's a fairy tale or it's only for
certain kinds of people who are special in some way
or who've been privileged or have a lot of money
or some other thing like that but that's not the
case at all it's also possible to learn and master
emotional development so you can really master your emotions and
of course your family life all those family issues that
you have not just I'm not talking about just removing
all the problems from all these different domains of life
like career wealth health family friends and so forth I'm
talking about like acing and excelling and being superb and
deriving bliss in each one of these categories right but
this takes work this is not something you get easily
this takes a lifelong commitment to self self-actualization work a
lifelong commitment to self improvement and a lifelong commitment to
learning about all the deep material that you need to
learn all the conceptual frameworks and theories and techniques that
you need to learn for for mastering all these areas
which is what I was talking about with this guy
at the at the retreat you know we were talking
with this I was talking with this kid and um
you know telling him that there are all these different
categories you can improve yourself in all these different categories
you can rank yourself on how good you are right
now in each one of these categories how much suffering
you have or how much bliss you get from each
one of those and then you can take on a
systematic effort to master each one of these areas career
your wealth health self-esteem family and intimate relationships and so
forth and you can lock each one of these down
systematically over time and you can buy books and you
go to seminars you can find videos and so forth
and you can get coaching and you can learn from
experts who have aged all these areas you can put
it all together for yourself and this is not a
fantasy this is not this is nothing that's like you
know it's not like winning the lottery it's not like
an accident that maybe it'll happen for me someday no
it's guarantee that it'll happen for you if you just
commit to it and you put forth work every single
day it will happen for you let me share some
what I call kick-ass goals that you might want to
set for yourself as you're thinking about your vision for
the future because what I really want to get across
to you here is you need to have a much
larger vision for your life than you currently have not
five times larger or not telling like a hundred times
larger than what you currently have you're selling yourself very
short and you're setting your goals very low you need
some much more inspiring higher consciousness goals to shoot for
so let me just give you a little list of
some stuff that might be interesting for you that might
really get you excited to to do the self-actualization work
how about this one for starters how about you can
create a life where you never have to worry about
money ever again never have to worry about it because
you're always guaranteed to get more how about a life
where your work is not work but it's like play
it's your greatest joy and you're doing service to the
world that really means something to you and lights you
up and brings you deep joy and satisfaction how about
developing full emotional control I mean conquering your depression your
anxiety boredom and pain and suffering anger and negative thinking
and fear how about conquering all of those because you
can if you want to how about developing yourself beyond
that to become a really grounded emotionally imperturbable human being
whatever I think about this I think about Marcus Aurelius
the Roman Emperor whose whole thing was emotional mastery living
a noble life being grounded being rock solid it's kind
of a stoic ideal stoicism you can develop that as
well and it's a lot easier these days actually than
it was 2,000 years ago German during a Marcus's time
because we have so much more psychological understanding we know
pretty much everything about how the human mind works we've
mapped out psychologically almost every neurosis and also every ideal
and potential of the human mind and every capability that
there is so all that knowledge is available to you
right now really easily really cheaply very efficiently how about
as a goal to have deep understanding of how the
world works like real satisfying deep knowledge that makes you
feel at home in the world because you literally understand
everything you need to understand about life that's very possible
in fact I'm feeling more and more that I'm getting
to that place and I'm going to be there very
soon and it's a really satisfying feeling how about a
really successful intimate relationship that's pretty rare a really successful
fulfilling intimate relationship that's very rare very rare very very
rare most people have no idea how to create that
for themselves how about amazing sex also very rare sex
is an interesting one because sex can be a low
consciousness value it can also be a very high consciousness
value depends on how you think about sex how mature
you are about sex how really how much you've studied
and developed yourself sexually the ability to have multiple orgasms
really deep intimate sex really dominant sex squirting hypnosis there's
so much you can do with sex Tantra you can
use sex for for enlightenment it's quite and quite incredible
what you can do with sex it's a really deep
field that most people never even bother to study they
have even no clue that they can go so far
with sex no clue at all how about confidence really
developing yourself developing your core confidence so you're really sure
about yourself your decisive you're assertive you accept yourself fully
your flaws and your weaknesses you accept those too it's
not about becoming perfect and kind of cultivating this kind
of deep self-love where you love yourself as you are
even with all your imperfections that's a pretty worthwhile goal
how about traveling hobbies really putting yourself into a place
where you can savor the full richness of life life
in the 21st century offers so many incredible hobbies and
adventures and places to travel to you can travel all
around the world you can see amazing monuments and sites
you go to amazing restaurants you cannot engage in incredible
hobbies probably hobbies that you didn't even think existed and
that certainly didn't exist several hundred years ago all of
that is available quite affordably these days you can really
sample the richness that the entire planet offers before you
die it's pretty worthwhile goal I think really see what
the world is about see how it functions see how
other cultures and people function how about as another goal
physical vitality and energy not feeling exhausted not feeling drained
like you do after you come back from work dead
tired fat and overweight and not strong kind of weak
and anemic how about instead the opposite of all that
you're energetic your vitality z' ah just shooting out of
you just is kind of radiance of a live energy
that comes to force through you physical strength and flexibility
and endurance and enough energy to get through the day
without having to be liquored up on coffee and energy
drinks and pip pills and all this other kind of
crap and then of course transferring that beautiful energy that
physical vitality into into the bedroom how about rich and
rewarding friendships not the kind of crappy friends you have
or just like your victim companions who you all get
together in [ __ ] and moan with but like
really uh friends that are inspiring to you who are
out there who are superstars or acing life just like
you are who are self actualizing and getting a circle
of those kind of friends around you friends who challenge
and push you and who share the richness of the
world with you how about as a goal becoming a
leader of other human beings and inspiring them and being
a role model and setting an example with your own
life that inspires others and moves others to become great
how about being creative to the ultimate degree and advancing
humanity in a meaningful way whether through invention or art
or scientific discovery or product creation consumer products technology and
so forth how about breaking free of the rat race
your 95 job the two weeks of crappy vacation that
you get and the toxic pop culture that you are
inundated with every single day television internet social media smartphone
breaking free of that how about living a life with
integrity a life based on principles for their own sake
so you can feel like you've lived a noble life
when you're dead like your life was extraordinary in the
full sense of that word and that you're really proud
of the kind of life you lived this intense pride
for your life not in an arrogant gloating sort of
way but actually in a very humble sort of way
where you realize and you're grateful for how lucky you've
been and all the great stuff that's happened to you
and all the great people and things that have come
into your life that you've been able to seize those
opportunities and make something out of those and pride in
the fact that you actually committed yourself to making something
more of yourself than the average person does and that
you somehow left the world better off than when you
came into it through your work how about enlightenment how
about realizing the true existential nature of yourself other people
and reality that's possible for you did you know that
did you know that you can discover the answers to
those questions philosophical type questions that you would think there
are no answers to well actually you can get experiential
answers to those questions very profound answers that will completely
transform how you see life and people it will even
transform how you see life and death including your own
death how about as a goal having the time to
contemplate and reflect on life to really appreciate and see
the beauty of life to savor that beauty not just
to be running around a hamster in a wheel all
the time frantic and doing this and that and bouncing
between 20 different things with a full schedule and trying
to juggle ten different balls in the air and being
all neurotic and and anxious about not having time to
even when you have your victories your little petty victories
when you have those you don't have any time to
really select and contemplate and savor them do you know
you're just rushing through you just going through the motions
how about as a goal though that you actually make
that time for yourself you actually do more with less
time and you leave time open to really savor and
appreciate the beauty of life and how about is your
ultimate goal that when you're lying on your deathbed you
die with a smile on your face without fearing death
without all the regrets that normal people have when they
die but really understanding that you went all out and
you soaked in everything that life had to offer all
the richness and all the possibility that you really sees
as much of it as you could not perfectly but
you seized as much of it as you reasonably could
be expected to and dying knowing that you accomplished everything
there was to accomplish here on earth and you've savored
everything that there was to savor with this human body
apparatus that you've been given did you know that that's
possible for you as a goal these things they might
sound like a pipe dream these might sound like wishful
thinking they're not these are all very practical pragmatic things
that you can set as specific goals for yourself and
you can achieve them and not just like checking off
a bucket list that's not what I'm talking about here
I'm talking about really transforming the very core of your
being to embody all of these things and to not
just achieve them but to be fulfilled by them and
to savor them and to really appreciate them and be
grateful for them that's what I talk about when I
talk about my vision for a self actualized life when
I think about self-actualization it's a pretty abstract term it
could mean a lot of things for a lot of
different people it might just mean general self-improvement to you
it just might mean like Oh getting a better job
or earning some more money or something I know to
me what it means is in me these more noble
higher consciousness ideals the kind of stuff that most of
us don't even think about ever in life like 10
years for the average person 10 years could go by
and not one of these goals that I talked about
would even be considered as possible or really be seriously
pursued so this is what's possible for you now notice
this is different than just being rich or successful I
don't really like to push being rich and just being
successful for me here the emphasis and the difference is
on personal emotional growth because I know rich and successful
people quote unquote successful people who do not touch many
of these goals that I talked about and I wouldn't
really call them self actualizing people because they're not really
emphasizing their own inner transformation emotional growth maturity spiritual growth
you might say although I really like that word spiritual
growth might be a good way to put it so
that's what's possible now I was talking about some of
the stuff with with this kid at the retreat and
he was getting excited by these very curious about me
spent a lot of time he spent several hours talking
about all this kind of stuff I gave him various
tips that I um that I give you guys through
through these videos one of these he asked me says
he asked me so Leah are you happy now was
an interesting question because I thought about them like yeah
am i happy and at the time I was actually
quite frustrated doing conscious work is is a really surefire
way to make oneself frustrated and actually I was at
that point my life were I was thinking through a
lot of stuff working through a lot of stuff I
wasn't really happy but one thing I could say is
that I was fulfilled fulfillment versus happiness happiness is like
an emotion it comes it goes sometimes you feel sad
sometimes you feel frustrated or angry or pissed off or
afraid or whatever it goes up and down fulfillment though
fulfillment is what you experience when you're on the self
actualizing journey when you know that you really are self
actualizing when you've started when you've gotten past the couple
first years of real you know rocky ground or you're
falling off track a lot you're not sure if any
of this stuff works once you get past that and
you finally commit to self actually [ __ ] and
you see that it's possible you see that all this
is possible and you're going for a now full-bore on
and stuff is clicking for you that's when fulfillment starts
to come fulfillment it's just like this general sense of
that you've got life handled or that even those aspects
of life that you don't have handled you'll handle those
and then ultimately you see the beauty of life you
see how much there is to appreciate and you know
even though I'm not happy all the time you know
I would bet that most of you think that I'm
happier than I actually am on a daily basis which
is false that's that's a wrong assumption on your part
I'm not that happy but what you probably underestimate us
how fulfilled I am generally speaking like I'm at the
point in my life and I'm not trying to brag
here but I'm just trying to show you like what's
possible because most people don't believe that this is possible
it sounds hokey and you know what 5-10 years ago
I probably wouldn't have believed it as well but right
now I'm at the point my life where I get
tears tears of joy like literally tears of joy that
pour down my cheeks at least once a week when
I reflect on the quality of my life and also
the trajectory of my life and also what I've accomplished
in my life and what I'm doing and the impact
that I'm having on other human beings so like tears
like tears right um this is one of the most
profound own feelings that you'll get and probably the most
inspiring reason to become self actualizing and to do this
work is because at one point you will reach this
point in your life I guarantee it if you do
this work where you will just sit down you will
look at life and you'll just have tears thinking about
how privileged you are to be able to to experience
this because this is very easy for me to imagine
a life where I was born and I grew up
and just the universe reality or society or whatever was
so constructed that basically I was not able to get
any of this right none of this was bit would
be possible either because I'm living in some sort of
dictatorship regime or because human technology hasn't evolved let's say
if I'm living 10,000 years ago or because because we
don't have the knowledge and information available to allow this
kind of stuff or because it's way too expensive like
it might have been a thousand years ago or because
the government doesn't have the laws that allow it or
even because human psychology is different and it doesn't allow
it what if you were born a chimpanzee self-actualization would
probably not work for you so well right and you
probably couldn't really do the things you could do as
a human being we're really privileged to have been born
as human beings and not something else in a sense
we're also cursed but if you can conquer that curse
you can get to the to the highest potential of
humanity that's a really beautiful thing it really starts to
change how you see humanity for a long time in
my youth when I was in my kind of philosophical
phase I'm doing a lot of philosophy I was I
was very misanthropic and I kind of hated humanity hated
society and hated all the evil stuff that it does
and there's a you know there's a lot of truth
to that low consciousness humanities really ugly but also what
starts to happen once you do the self actualization we
can start to see that actually there's high conscious humanity
- and that's basically what you're working for and you're
working towards you're working towards moving yourself out of low
conscious humanity towards higher conscious humanity and when you get
here and you live from this place what happens is
that all this nastiness over here just kind of dissolves
it all becomes understood you just become peaceful about it
you accept that you understand it you can even love
it that's what it means to be a fully integrated
and whole human being you accept reality as it is
not as some ideal but as it actually is and
this is out of most people's wildest imaginations about what's
possible I can't really even describe and articulate all the
crazy [ __ ] that's possible all the amazing stuff
that's possible for you in this work it's hard I
have to sit down and really think about all this
stuff before I came up here and started talking about
it because there's so much and I really struggle it
takes me a lot of time thinking about this stuff
to fully articulate in a concise way and this is
not a short video all these points so at this
point you might be wondering okay Leo how do I
self actualize what should I do how do we take
this from the vision to actual reality well it's true
you need both right you need the vision you need
the ideal to inspire you but that's not enough this
is not the secret this is not Law of Attraction
we just get a sick back and just wish and
have your vision and it's all done for you no
not that easy I'll give you a couple of steps
no real practical steps you can start doing today step
number one is knowledge you need knowledge to self actualize
one thing you're lacking is accurate high-quality information how do
you acquire that well first you make a commitment to
become a lifelong learner learning should be a top priority
in your life learning through thinking through reading books through
talking to people through going to seminars and etc etc
all the different ways you can learn taking notes keeping
a journal keeping a diary this is mandatory this is
not optional learning does not stop after high school or
college or after your PhD is done here's a really
good tip invest 10% of your income every year into
learning that means if you make fifty thousand five thousand
a year invest it into books seminars self-help products therapy
coaching or whatever other way you can use to learn
get creative with it you'll actually find it's quite challenging
to spend ten percent of your income on learning if
you are in a hundred thousand dollars a year right
now then that means ten thousand dollars a year on
learning and then once you spend that money then you
have to create the time to actually read all those
books or listen to all those seminars and so forth
step number two start making small changes in your life
right now you don't need any huge drastic things like
quitting your job and becoming a millionaire to start this
process so the first thing you're going to do is
become a learner you can do that right now even
if you're poor you can go buy a couple of
books for twenty bucks that will change your life second
step like I said is sort making small changes what
I mean by that is eliminate toxic habits the most
toxic have is you have eliminate those start building good
habits start building a strong morning routine healthy morning routine
that inspires you and energizes you and I have other
videos and episodes where I talk about bad habits good
habits and so forth I'll give you a lot of
ideas for different habits you can create meditation would be
one great habit to install one or two bad habits
to remove would be eating unhealthy foods especially wheat products
lots of sugar eliminate those or if you drink or
if you smoke or ingest any kind of drugs eliminating
those or limiting your negative thinking habit eliminating your social
media / internet / TV habit so you get the
idea there these are little things you can do without
quitting your job and without leaving your marriage and so
forth little things start with little things it will add
up before you can make really big inspiring changes in
your life sometimes you just got to get like the
basics down you can't make a big inspiring change in
your life win for example you go binge drinking every
Friday and Saturday and just totally waste yourself not going
to work so fix that first fix the basics there's
a lot of [ __ ] you could fix right
now in your life that's just like very basic stuff
and then emotional mastery focus your attention on mastering your
emotions at least a little bit especially the most negative
emotions for example if you have crippling low self-esteem if
you have anger issues if you have rage issues if
you're constantly critical of the world if you're constantly negative
if you're a troll if you're crippled by fear if
you have a lot of negative limiting beliefs and if
you play the victim all the time and you blame
other people for why your life is so miserable then
those are all areas you need to start addressing now
how do you dress all those there as well I
have a lot of videos on it all these various
topics but also you can go read books seminars see
step number one for that it's not rocket science here
all this stuff solutions to all these problems are well
researched well documented well known and they're all proven and
they work if you go out and find the right
ones so that was number two now step number three
once you get a little bit of that stuff handled
kind of the toxic dysfunctional stuff then step number three
should be find your life purpose and man this is
a very deep topic it's a very important topic you
need to find your core essential purpose in life you
need to find out who you are authentically who you
are as a human being as a personality and I'm
not going to talk much about that here but if
you're really interested in that and you want to really
a that then go check out my ultimate life purpose
course it's a 25 hour course plus even more material
that I'm adding to it soon uh that's just some
of the most life transforming material if you go and
do those exercises that I tell you that course it
will change your life that's step number three you need
a life purpose I don't just say that because I
have a product no don't get that wrong I have
a product because this is such an important point that's
why the product was created I didn't just create a
random product I found my life purpose I discovered what
was most important to create a self actualized life and
it just so happened that it was live purpose and
most people have no idea what their life purpose is
so this is a critical component that virtually everybody is
missing you need this component otherwise you will not be
fully self actualized not even close and step number four
is and it's a little more advanced become financially independent
when you free yourself from your nine-to-five job and you
become your own boss or at least you are not
reliant and you know what's the word you're not desperate
for money and you're not working 80-hour days because your
boss is forcing you to otherwise you can get fired
when you can disconnect from that and set your own
sane schedule and your own sane work hours and also
pay yourself well support yourself financially this gives you a
level of confidence and freedom and ability to then go
out and really do the deep self-actualization work and fully
and richly enjoy life so that's step number four I'm
giving you a broad outline here so I'm not filling
in all the details you're going to go find out
how these are big goals it'll take you probably multiple
years to work on some of these goals like your
life purpose like becoming financially independent but you need to
start thinking about this stuff in planning ahead that's it
those are the four steps if you do those four
steps I'm going to be pretty confident that you're going
to be well on your way to self-actualization and if
you don't do these four steps or you skip some
of them then I'm going to be very worried for
you and I don't think you're going to get there
so in conclusion your life is short live your life
like you have a burning midlife crisis right now I
don't care how old you are if you're 15 if
you're 20 if you're 30 if you're 40 for 60
right now is your midlife crisis moment I've had at
least two or three midlife crises already and I'm only
30 that's a good thing get them out of the
way early what else have you got to do with
your life can you come up with a better vision
what else have you got go with the best vision
that you find available whether you came up with it
or you want to use my vision or you want
to use somebody else's vision you find some better vision
some book somewhere go do that but I doubt you'll
find something much bigger than what I outline for you
here because this encapsulate a whole lot of [ __
] this encapsulate basically what it means to be an
extraordinary human being what else have you got to do
what TV playing World of Warcraft going out and banging
girls getting drunk on the weekends working 80-hour weeks at
your law firm for what what what the [ __
] are you doing are you thinking about where that's
going to lead you in 20 or 40 years keep
doing that think wiser and hold this vision in your
mind every single day every single day because there's nothing
better that you can do with your life there's nothing
that will bring you more joy or more satisfaction or
more fulfillment right this is Leo I'm signing off go
