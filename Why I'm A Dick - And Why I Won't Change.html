hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm gonna tell you why sometimes I behave like
a dick all right so why do I sometimes behave
like a dick and what I'm referring to here is
sometimes the way that I might respond to a youtube
comment or a comment on actualise org or a point
that I make might make in one of my videos
why do I do it in a dickish way at
some points and in not dickish ways and other points
so a short story you know Zen masters do you
know anything about Zen Zen Buddhism is the Japanese tradition
of attaining enlightenment through deep contemplation what basically you sit
in you meditate for years until finally you reach enlightenment
and this is a very very hardcore practice this is
not something done very casually this is something done with
a lot of intensity and so what will happen is
that a student will go and sign up for Zen
and then he will sit there and usually there is
a like a Zen master the Guru and he's gonna
help you to attain enlightenment and so what you do
is you listen to that guru and you do what
he said to what he tells you to do and
if you do that for many many years eventually maybe
you'll get there and one of the things that Zen
masters will do is that their students they will sit
in a hall and they will just meditate in a
in a big group the students will meditate and this
isn't master he'll walk around and he'll observe them and
he will give them little tidbits instructions some help and
the Zen master he is kind of like this stoic
quiet figure at least stereotypically he's like this stoic quiet
figure who who has a very penetrating penetrating way of
showing you what you're doing wrong and in order to
crack through towards enlightenment to really make the Zen process
work for you what you really have to do is
you have to it can be very harsh with their
ego right you can't post a foot around sometimes you
got to cut straight to the chase and sometimes that's
what does that master does is he cuts straight to
the chase and sometimes that will that will hurt literally
this might hurt physically it might hurt in fact when
Zen masters do is they have a stick they walk
around with a stick like a bamboo rod and as
the students are sitting there in the meditation hall meditating
well they meditate for many hours and I don't know
if you've ever tried meditation sometimes when you're meditating in
your doing for a long time your mind gets tired
and you tend to doze off you tend to fall
asleep well you're not supposed to do that that ruins
your meditation so the Zen master he'll walk around with
a bamboo stick and he'll smack people across the back
of the head or then back in the shoulders in
order to wake them up so the reason I'm saying
this is because that's kind of what I'm doing when
I'm being a dick if I'm being a dick to
you in a comment or I'm being a dick towards
your point of view of life the reason I'm doing
that is because you're way off course right you're so
off course that arguing with you logically is not the
best it's not the best way to to help you
at that point you need to be kind of shook
it up in fact that's that's one of the challenges
I have with these videos is in trying to to
bring some of this wisdom that that I've accumulated over
the years and trying to bring that to you and
trying to communicate in an effective way so that it
actually takes root in your life so it's not just
running around in your head well I need to wake
you up some of you need to be woken up
and that's that's challenging to do because I only have
so much time with you and if I sit here
and I'm baby you if we're playing this kindergarten game
and I'm trying to be gentle with you and I'm
not trying to not to hurt you and I'm trying
to soothe your ego then that might feel nice for
you and you might lighten you might you might like
it and you might like my video for for me
doing that except the problem is that you're gonna stay
asleep see so many of you are asleep and you
don't even know it you don't know that you're asleep
and you need to be woken and the only way
sometimes to wake someone up is to really shake them
right shake them put some fear into them it's a
rhetorical approach it's a it's kind of a style of
teaching and I don't think that that's always the best
approach so sometimes what will happen is sometimes I'll take
a very compassionate approach and I hear someone and he
or she posts a comment where they're really struggling and
I can feel like they're really struggling they're really having
a hard time and they're just lost they're lost they're
confused so in that kind of situation usually kind of
my heart will go out to that person because I
can I can relate to that you know I've been
there myself I can understand why that's happening with them
they don't have the knowledge they don't have the mind
says they don't have the experience so with that kind
of person I'll be more patient I'll write a long
reply I'll try to encourage them and I think that
that's great sometimes I see people just behaving in stupid
stupid ways like they know better right they know better
they're wiser they know what the right course of action
is but they're being lazy like they're so lazy they're
so plugged into groupthink that they're just like behaving in
such ridiculous ways that they need to be shooken up
in that kind of situation I'm not gonna take a
compassionate compassionate approach with you that's the kind of situation
where I take a stick and I hit you over
the back of the head so that you understand that
what you're doing is totally [ __ ] stupid right
and that you need to change and sometimes that's what
it takes sometimes it takes nice knock on the back
of the head to learn that what you're doing is
not right and then you go oh okay I was
asleep that whole time okay now I understand I was
asleep thank you for waking you up now of course
most people don't take it that way most people when
you hit them over the back of the head with
a stick what do they do then they get mad
at you if they start blaming you because their ego
doesn't want to admit that they were wrong that's usually
the case and you know that's one of the one
of the challenges that a true teacher faces is that
a true teacher she has to be a little bit
ruthless because he can't be gentle some students do not
take too gentle handling they need to be roughed up
a little bit and and that means the student the
teacher needs to do what he has to do and
then the student has to react however he reacts and
if the student Lee if the student doesn't like the
teacher you know well tough luck the fact is that
there's specific things that you need to be doing in
life in order to live a successful and happy life
and if you're not doing those things then you're gonna
fail right one of the philosophies that I take with
actualised org is that I don't try to [ __
] you guys I try to be very direct and
when there's a clear principle that you're breaking it needs
to be made very very clear because one of the
challenge that I faced myself through the last five years
of learning personal development is that sometimes people or teachers
or self-help experts will take a very light handed approach
and they'll be very compassionate very be very optimistic and
very positive thinking and I'll tell you that you can
do anything and that everything is okay and things are
gonna be fine and they take that kind of approach
and you know sometimes you need that encouragement and I'm
all about positive thinking and I'm all about like dreaming
and doing all that stuff but your dreams and your
positivity needs to be grounded it needs to be grounded
in something solid because if all you're doing is you're
dreaming and all you're doing is you're you're having wishful
thinking and you're thinking positive you think that stuff is
just gonna happen for you miraculously then I can guarantee
that you're gonna be miserable in life and you're not
gonna be at the level of success that you want
you're not gonna really be doing solid personal development so
part of my job I feel as someone who's working
within this field is to show you clearly where where
the where the boundaries are right where you are wrong
and where you are right because when you know clearly
that you're wrong well then it's very easy to not
do those things at least you know a lot of
times what I found is that when a teachers is
is fuzzy about it and he tells you well maybe
you're right but maybe you're wrong and then he kind
of like carves out these large gray areas maybe that's
even technically true that this area is great but the
fact is it doesn't help you because your mind is
very tricky and it'll use that fact against you and
so you'll say oh well that's a gray area so
I can just continue to be lazy and I can
tell you to be stupid and I can continue to
to do all these self-destructive things and not start to
kind of wise up and straighten my course so sometimes
you just need to be told that you you need
to straighten your course because honestly if you roll life
being asleep being unconscious doing unwise things then you're not
going to transform you're not going to get the kind
of results you want from life you're gonna sell yourself
very very short and you're not going to self actualize
so that is sometimes why I take a heart approach
I I'm still trying to work that out you know
when to take a soft approach when to take a
hard approach sometimes I get that wrong but I'm learning
and I learned pretty quick so that's what I had
to say about that that's why sometimes if I'm a
dick excuse me but I'm trying to do it for
your own benefit and I try not to take too
much pleasure in it although sometimes I take some pleasure
I need to get some pleasure out of this stuff
