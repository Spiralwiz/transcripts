In this episode, we're going to be talking about sameness
versus difference. What is sameness? What is difference? This topic
is a lot more profound than it would initially seem.
And this topic is also going to be very fun.
We're going to dig into a lot of examples. And
we're gonna talk about a lot of the ramifications of
just how significant the answer to this question really is.
And we're going to contemplate it together here. today. I
wanted to show you after last last week's episode, which
was called How to contemplate using a journal, I wanted
to show you how to take your contemplation is really
deep. Because the problem that I see is that people
still don't understand just how deep contemplation can go. I
see people taking some profound questions, some existential metaphysical question
about the nature of reality. And just thinking about it
for 30 minutes and thinking they got the answer. And
then that's it. They're all done. And now they're moving
on to the next thing. And it's like, no, no,
no, you don't understand how much more there is to
mine here. And so that's why I really want to
go through with this in a lot of detail with
you. And then as a homework assignment, I'll have you
contemplate this topic of sameness versus difference from scratch, for
yourself. Always you have to remember that these very obscure,
sometimes sounding questions about the nature of reality, which might
seem like they're just pure philosophy, or they're just some
mental masturbation, or just some, just some random academic point,
like sameness versus difference. They don't turn out to be
that way. So one thing that I want you to
notice here is that by the time we finished with
this episode, I want you to see just how far
we've come. And I want you to see what you
assumed this topic was about at the beginning, and then
what it actually turned out to be after we go
through all the details. And that should open your mind
to the possibilities of contemplation and get you to start
to take contemplation a lot more seriously. We have a
lot of ground to cover. So let's begin exploring sameness
versus difference. Are you as they say a difference person
or a sameness person. And by that what they mean
is psychologists sometimes do various tests on people. And one
of the things they have discovered is that some people
are more different people, while others are more sameness people.
And what that means is just that the mind tends
to focus more on the differences between things for some
people, and for other people, the mind tends to focus
more on the similarities between things. And that's one way
to categorize people, similar to how you might categorize people
as introverts or extroverts or something like that. So let's
do the test. I got a pop quiz for you,
there's going to be about 40 questions that I'm going
to go through really quickly here. So listen to them
carefully. And I want you to give a yes or
no answer to each one of these questions. And this
will determine whether you're a difference person or same as
person. And after we're done with with this list, we're
gonna go through it again, and I'm going to show
you just how much depth there really is each one
of these questions. So you can either make a mental
note yes or no. Or if you want, you can
actually pull out a piece of paper and jot down
your answers as I'm going through them. I'm gonna go
through them pretty quickly. So if you need to, you
can pause to think about it. So you're ready. Here
we go. First question is, is Coke, the same as
Pepsi? Yes or no? is gold the same as silver?
Is an ant the same as an elephant? Is the
chimpanzee the same as a human? Is an acorn the
same as an oak? Is a child the same as
an adult? Is abortion the same as murder? Is beheading
a chicken? The same as beheading a human? are identical
twins the same? Is your child If you have one,
the same as you? Is Monday the same as Friday?
is $999,999.99. The same as $1? million? Is English the
same as Chinese? by which we mean the languages? is
the number five the same as the number 25? Is
an idea of an elephant, the same as an elephant?
Are men and women the same? Are all human beings
the same? are Republicans and Democrats the same? Is Donald
Trump the same as George Washington? Are US drone strikes
the same as terrorism? is taking a knee at a
football game during the national anthem? The same as disrespecting
the country? Is California the same as Mississippi? Are psychedelics
the same as heroin and meth? Is a blow job
the same as sex? is cheating on a test? In
college, for example, the same as cheating on your taxes?
Are all religions the same? Is the Buddha the same
as Christ? Are my two fingers that I'm holding up?
The same? Are you the same as a Nazi? Are
you the same as you were five years ago? 20
years ago? Are you the same as you were five
seconds ago? Are all actualized.org videos the same? Is every
hydrogen atom in the universe the same? Is reality the
same as illusion? Or fantasy? Is God the same as
the devil? is good? The same as evil? Am I
the same as you? Is nothing the same as something?
That's it. That's the whole pop quiz. Now, I should
have warned you. I guess from the very beginning. Some
of these might have been trick questions. Maybe all of
these were trick questions. So let's go back and take
a look at just what we have on our hands
here. These are some very fascinating questions. So first, what
we have is Coke and Pepsi. Are these two the
same? Or are they different? Of course, it all depends
on your point of view, doesn't it? For someone who's
a connoisseur of soda, the way that maybe I was
when I was a teenager, I used to drink a
lot of soda. I haven't for probably a decade. And
I used to drink a lot of coke. I loved
my coke. I was a coke loyalist. I would drink
a couple of cans of this stuff every single day.
It's one of the things that made me fat. And
I would hate Pepsi. absolutely hate it. In fact, if
I was brought a Pepsi at a restaurant, let's say
sometimes you order a coke and the waitress to her.
The difference isn't as big as it is to us.
So she'll just bring you some soda, the closest thing
to coke even if they don't have Coke, and you
say Coke, she'll just bring you a Pepsi. And then
you drink it and you're like you What is this?
I asked for a coke. And then you you get
her to come up and say what's wrong with this
coke and she's Oh, we only serve Pepsi products at
this restaurant. And then, I mean, I'm thinking in my
mind, well, if you would have told me that from
the very get go, I wouldn't have even ordered it
because I don't want to drink this nasty Pepsi. That's
how it tasted to me. And then you know for
other people, they they're not very discriminating between soda. And
for them colas. Just call Although whether it's a Coke
or Pepsi or some Walmart branded non, you know, generic
brand Cola, it doesn't matter to them some homemade cola
doesn't matter. But for someone who really likes their Coke,
you know, they need Coke, they need the original classic
coke. And it's interesting because you know, on the one
hand, of course, they clearly appear different, different colors, different
looking cans. On the other hand, the CANS also look
very similar, same shape, same size. In fact, if you
look, they have the exact same number of, of liquid
in here, it's 473 milliliters. They both contain basically the
same ingredients, like carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel
color, sugar, various kinds of phosphoric acid, citric acid, caffeine,
and so forth, natural flavorings. But of course, they're not
identical, right? Because that's why they have a different flavor,
different, different taste. And in fact, if you look carefully
at the ingredient lists, even though they're very similar, they're
still a little bit different. The ordering of some ingredients
is different, which tells you that the quantities the relative
quantities are different. And actually, the Pepsi, this can of
Pepsi has 200 calories, whereas this can of Coke has
160 calories. So this half tell us calories. So are
they the same? Or are they different? I mean, they're
both cola. So in that sense, they're the same, but
they're different kinds of cola. And they're certainly very different
from Sprite, or Mountain Dew or some other kind of
soft drink. But then again, if we think about all
the possible different drinks that a human being can drink,
like alcohol, fruit juice, even inedible things like poison and
liquid mercury, and all this sorts of bad stuff that
you definitely wouldn't want to drink, or just water. These
two sodas are certainly much more similar than they are
to any of those other kinds of drinks. But it
gets even trickier. This question, because look at this are
these two colas, two Cokes? Are they the same? Now
you're very tempted to say yes, of course they're the
same. But if they're the same, how can I have
one over here on the left, and one on the
right. After all, they are two different cans, they're located
at two different positions in space, I can drink one
of them throw it away, the other one will still
remain. This one technically has a different number of atoms
in it, than this one does different volumes. So even
though it says on here, 473 milliliters on both cans.
If we go down to the decimal points to the
10s, hundreds and 1000s of the death decimal point of
a milliliter, we'll see that these are not equivalent cans.
And if we look closely at these cans, these cans
aren't perfect. They have dents and scratches in them. Look,
I can clearly see some dents and scratches and stuff
in this can. And in this can. And in fact,
they have different expiration dates on them slightly different. So
again, are they the same? Or are they different? Are
you starting to see how maybe some sameness and difference
can be a matter of perspective, more so than a
matter of objective fact. In fact, think about this, there's
probably a billion cans of Coca Cola right now in
existence around the entire planet. And even though you might
say they're all the same, let's say we're talking about
just one flavor of coke, Coke Classic, they're still probably
a billion cans in the world. But are they really
the same? Or are they really all different. In fact,
they're all different because they all exist in a different
location in space. All around the world. There are different
temperatures. They, they technically each have a different number of
molecules in them even though the ingredients are basically all
the same, but you can't have precisely the same measurements
down to the to the micron measurement level have all
the same ingredients in each can. So technically every can
is unique and every can has its own imperfections flaws,
manufacturing flaws, scratches, dents, and so forth. Even if you
count the number of bubbles of carbonation in this cam
versus this can, you will find a different number of
bubbles. This tan might have a billion bubbles, and this
might have a billion in one bubbles making a difference.
What about the question of is gold the same as
silver? Well, you might say, of course the other, they're
totally different. But then again, they're very similar because they're
both elements. They're both precious metals. They're both used in
jewelry. They're both mined with heavy machinery. They are both
the good electrical conductors, and are used in circuitry and
other kinds of electronics for that purpose. Even though gold's
a little better than silver. They're both elements on the
periodic table. Now, you might say Leo, but they're but
the elements that's like so fundamental elements are what constitutes
difference. Gold is a different element than silver. That's why
it's different. On the other hand, we can zoom in
even further and we can say, well, what's an elephant
made out of? It's just made out of protons, neutrons
and electrons. So in that sense, literally, gold and silver
are the same, because they're both made out of those
three subatomic particles. And if you want to zoom in
even further, we can zoom in to the cork level.
And we can say they're, they're all made out of
quarks. Or we can zoom in even further, if you
believe in string theory, you can say they're all strings.
And in that sense, gold and silver are the same.
Is an ant the same as an elephant? Well, at
first glance, you'll say, well, that's preposterous. How can you
even compare the two, and he asked is this small
an elephant is, is this big. But then again, they
shared a lot of similarities. They're both living creatures. They're
both carbon based life forms. They both have DNA. They're
made out of eukaryotic cells. Each of these cells contains
the same organelles, mitochondria, and ribosomes, and all the stuff
you learned in biology class, these are all similar between
ants and elephants. In fact, I'm not really sure what
the similarity of their genome is. But I would bet
it's somewhere around like 50%, probably 50% of ants DNA
is similar to an elephant's DNA. They both have legs,
they both have eyes. They both have other kinds of
perceptions. I assume both of them can can smell, I
think ants can smell, they can smell, there's pheromones and
so forth, just like elephants do. I'm not sure if
ants can hear, they probably can hear vibrations or sense
vibrations, just like elephants can. They both have a nervous
system, they both have neurons. They both have brains, even
though the ants brain is very tiny. It's still there.
They have a nervous system. They both probably see in
color. Not the same color, but in color. So you
could imagine since they both have eyes, they can both
die. They're both alive. So look how much they have
in common. And you thought an ant and health that
were different? No, they're the same. Look how much they
have in common. We can keep talking, I can talk
for a whole hour about the similarities between ants and
elephants. And after all, you know it's it's relative, it
depends what you compare it to because like if I
tell you to compare an elephant to something like the
color blue, well, now that's a lot more different than
comparing an elephant to an ant. Because the color blue
isn't even a living thing. It's not even a creature.
It's some sort of I don't know what blue is,
what is blue, it's a color. It's an abstract concept.
It's not an elephant, not an animal. It's not even
alive. You know, certainly, if you compare an elephant to
a Coke, it's very different than an ant compared to
that elephant. How about a chimpanzee and a human being?
Are they the same? Well, if you look at the
science, science will tell you chimpanzee has about 98 plus
percent similarity in the genome to a human being. But
a lot of people get offended by this notion that
chimpanzees are the same as humans. It's like no, Leo,
we need to there's no there's no way humans are
like chimpanzees. What are you talking about? Humans were God's
chosen creatures and chimpanzees are just like apes in the
forest. How dare you compare me to a chimpanzee? What
are you saying? Are you saying I'm primitive? Are you
saying I'm ugly? Are you trying to be racist? What
are you saying, calling me a chimpanzee? See people people
need to differentiate themselves from a chimpanzee. Isn't that interesting?
Why do people feel that need to do so? A
lot of fundamentalist Christians around the country around the world
take great offense at comparing humans to chimpanzees, or that
humans evolved from apes or share a common ancestor with
chimpanzees. Now, of course, science doesn't say that humans evolved
from chimpanzees it says we have a common share. ancestral.
But even that idea is very disturbing to people. Might
there be something hidden behind that? triggering? getting triggered by
that? Yeah, maybe we'll get to that a little bit
further in the episode. But I mean, look at the
similarities between humans in humans. We're about the same size.
We have the we both have 10 fingers and 10
toes. We have hearts. We're both mammals. We're both. We're
both born in the same way. We have the almost
identical nervous systems. We have eyes, ears, nose, a mouth,
the tongue, teeth, or teeth are very similar. We both
have grasping hands, we have opposable thumbs, we can both
use tools. There's so much that we have in common
we both have hair. We both care about our young.
We both live in, in tribes. And actually, there's a
lot to be learned about the the deep similarities between
chimpanzees and humans, there's actually primatologists who spend their whole
lives studying the similarities between chimpanzees and humans, and drawing
various profound psychological and sociological lessons for us. And I
actually have a book on my book list that that
is written by a famous primatologist, which compares humans and
chimpanzees. And that's a very profound book, you read that
book, it completely changes your understanding of humans, because you
realize, oh, my god, humans are just like apes in
tuxedos, that's all we are. Walking around with briefcases thinking
we're so sophisticated. But really, our behaviors are so similar.
humans and chimps get scared by the by the same
things get angered by similar types of things. We both
get jealous, we both cause violence to each other, we
both go attack each other and start small wars with
each other. If we're in tribes, there's tribal warfare within
chimpanzees. So there's a there's a lot of similarity in
the psychology of a chimp and an a human. But,
but see, the more this similarity gets shared with people,
some people get even more offended by this, because they
don't like it when it's pointed out to them that
they're basically just behaving like a dump, like a dumb
ape. But in fact, that's what's happening. Most people are
walking around like chimps do and chimp stuff, just, of
course, we have more technology, we have more sophisticated language
and, and all this we dress nicer. We have nice
cars. chimps don't have that stuff. But but you could
imagine if chips did and they would act or similar
to the way that we act and handle all this
technology, and all this, all this luxury that we've developed.
So you see very interesting how these differences and similarities
play out. Is an acorn the same as an oak
tree? Well, you might say, How can you compare them
an acorn is this big and oak oak tree is
huge. But then again, literally, an oak tree comes from
an acorn, they literally have the same DNA. In fact,
you can't get an oak tree without first having an
acorn. One is necessary for the other. So look at
how similar they are. And yet you think of them
as being so different. How dare you? How about a
child as a child the same as an adult, where
this is kind of similar to the acorn, an oak
question. You might say, well, of course, Leo, as an
adult, I'm not a child. I've outgrown all my childish
ways, children are silly, and their ignorance, and they're smelly,
and they're loud, and they're dirty, and they're noisy, and
bla bla bla bla bla. But then again, as an
adult, what are you but just a big child? That
kid that was in you, when you were a child,
that's still there and you now in fact, most of
what you're doing in your adult life is just acting
out. Stuff that you were as a child, you're still
dealing with the same issues, you haven't really outgrown them.
You're just a big man, child, or woman child. And
when I say manchild, it makes me think of Donald
Trump because that's what he is. I mean, look at
what he's doing. He's just acting out the same childish
impulses that he was for the last seven years of
his life hasn't really grown a bit. And yet, adults
like to think of themselves as so different from children.
Is abortion the same as murder? Well, probably about a
third of the country in America would say yes, abortion
is no different than murder. You're killing a human being,
on the other hand, are a clump of cells is
an embryo really a human being? What counts the human
be and who decides that I could take some cells
from the tip of my finger some living cells and
kill them. And I could take more cells than there
would be killed in aborting a very early embryo. And
yet, you probably wouldn't say that that's killing a human
even though they're human cells. So how are you drawing
these lines? At what point is murder really murder? And
by that logic is, is it murder when you ejaculate?
And don't create a baby? Is it murder when a
female just has an unfertilized egg that just goes out
with her menstrual cycles that murder? I mean, that's a
potential baby. I mean, that's your argument for saying that
abortion is murder, you're saying well, that would have been
a potential human. And of course, you're right, that would
have been, but then again, every time you ejaculate, that
would be a potential host of babies, and every month
that a woman has her menstrual cycle, there it goes,
one more baby. You're killing a baby. So are these
the same? Are they different? Who's to say? Who gets
to say, is there a law written somewhere? Somewhere in
the universe, there's like, a database of all the laws
of the universe, which includes gravity, and Einstein's equations for
relativity equals MC square, the gravitational constant, all this stuff.
And then somewhere there's another law that says, if you
abort an embryo at two weeks old, then it's murder.
Otherwise, if it's early than that, and it's not, is
there such a law? Is beheading a chicken the same
as beheading a human being? Now, of course, many people
say, Leo, how can you compare them a chicken and
human being? I mean, these are totally different. A human's
life is worth 1000s, or maybe even millions of chickens
lives. And after all, we eat chickens all the time,
we need to eat food to live and we chickens.
But on the other hand, you might have some vegan
or some vegetarian, saying, yes, Leah, what is the difference
between beheading a chicken and a human? I mean, after
all, they're both living creatures, they both have a nervous
system, chickens nervous system is fairly complex. A chicken is
not that far away from a human being on the
evolutionary ladder. And it's a complex life form, and it
suffers it has feelings and emotions. And if you would,
if you would have been around a chicken yourself, personally,
you would see that you would get an emotional attachment
to the chicken like you do if you had a
pet chicken, and then you would you definitely not want
to behead it. And that really is like murdering human.
What's the difference? I mean, what's the difference? Is there?
Is there a law somewhere in the universe that says
killing humans is wrong, but killing chickens is okay. I
mean, how selfish would that be? Why would the universe
save our human lives? Over chickens lives? Does that make
any sense? So are they really different? Are these same?
are identical twins the same? You would say? Well, Lee,
oh, yes, of course, identical twins must be the same.
By definition, they look the same. And they even have
the same personalities that we can, we can see from
the psychological studies, they literally have the same DNA. So
that's as similar as you can get. But then again,
they're still not the same. Take a look at two
identical twins, and they live their own different lives. Sure,
they might have a lot of similarities. They might even
like have the same kind of job, but not literally
the same job. They don't literally have the same wife,
or husband. They don't literally do everything the same. They
still dress different and so forth. Unless you're specifically coordinating
that, which I certainly don't do us adult. So even
identical twins are actually different. Are they? Otherwise it would
just be one person? Is your child the same as
you say, Well, how could my child be the same
as me? Clearly, my child is not me. And yet,
you can look into your child's face and you can
see yourself right there in your child's face. It's almost
as though you're literally part of your child. And in
fact, if you're honest, isn't the only reason that you
love your child, because they're the same as you. And
you perceive that as such. What if you found out
that your child wasn't actually your child? Would you still
feel the same? Would you still love that child? If
you're really honest, you'll admit that out Actually your love
for your children is really not much more than the
genetic similarity that you think exists between you. Because, look,
there's billions of children all around the world that you
don't give a shit about. There's millions of starving children
in Africa that you don't care anything about. And many
people, they could travel to Africa, they can see those
kids there. And they will say, Well, yeah, but look,
they're their dirty, poor, mangy black kids, or Hispanic kids
or some other kinds of kids around the world, third
world countries. I mean, they're just yeah, they're just like
animals, they're subhuman. They're not the same as me. They're
not the same as my child. But then against some
other people, they can travel to those exact same countries.
And they can look at that mangy child who's a
different ethnicity than them, and they can literally see themselves
in the child's eyes. And some people say, well, that's
diluted Lea, that's diluted, because that child isn't really theirs.
But then again, all human beings have almost identical DNA.
We are so closely related as human beings, that you
might almost consider us as one large extended family that
just interbreed with itself. That's how close we are. We
are not that many generations apart. Like ever, I forget
exactly what the number was. But there was, there was
some profound number that I read where it said like
that, every human like, if you meet, if you meet
a random human being from another country, the chances of
you being related to that human being by like a
factor of let's say, 2%, are actually enormously high. So
like, literally every human being on this planet is related
to every other human being on this planet. Because we
share a common ancestor just like 100 or 1000 generations
ago, literally, we all came from the same grandmothers and
grandfathers. And yet, for some people, that doesn't matter, they'll
still look at that mangy kid and they'll say no
different race, different ethnicity, different country, not my kid. Don't
care about them at all. So who's right? Is Monday
the same as Friday? Leo, how dare you even compare
these two? If you work a standard nine to five
job, then you might feel that way. Because you'll say
all Friday, Friday is the best day. I love that
day. Thank goodness, it's Fridays. I get to have fun.
It's casual Friday. I have a whole weekend off. It's
great. Well as Mondays I hate Mondays have to go
back to work. The whole week is ahead of us
that to answer emails and do all this sort of
stuff. Mondays are boring and tedious. But then again, Mondays
and Fridays are both work days. They're both days of
the week. Like after all, I could have compared Friday
to an ostrich. That would have been a radically different
comparison. Friday compared to an ostrich they don't have that
much in common but Monday compared to Friday, look how
much they have in common. Is $999,999.99 the same as
a million? Well, many people say yes, does matter. One
penny difference, Leah, what difference does a penny make? And
yet, depending on the circumstance, a penny can make all
the difference in the world. For example, if you are
making a digital purchase and you're transferring some money to
some store using some shopping cart, in let's say you're
buying something for a million dollars, will that shopping cart
accept one penny shy of the actual buying price? No,
it will reject your purchase. So in that case, one
penny will make the difference between you buying that thing
and not for example, if you're bidding on an auction,
like let's say on eBay, you're buying I don't know
what would cost a million dollars, some super rare baseball
card or something. Then or some really fancy car, maybe
some collector's car, and the asking price. The final price
is a million, but you bid one penny shy of
a million. Are you gonna get that car? No, you're
gonna lose your favorite car. Somebody else and if you're
a giant business, who's doing 1000s millions of transactions every
single day let's say your giant company like Coca Cola
for you a penny makes all the difference in the
world. You know if the price of a Coca Cola
went up by one penny That would mean, probably billions
in additional revenue for Coca Cola, it would be very
significant. So it's all about what contexts you put it
in, and how you look at it, then again, you
know, if you're just transferring some money between friends, like
let's say you need to transfer $1,000, to your, to
your mom or your dad to help them out with
paying some of their bills. Does it matter if you
transfer to them? $909 or $1,000? Is that $1? Going
to make a difference to them? No. Doesn't make any
difference? Is English the same as Chinese? Well, first, you
might say, Well, yeah, of course, Lea, you couldn't have
picked two more dissimilar languages. Right, but I could have
compared English to an ostrich. Now those would be quite
different. English and Chinese have a lot in common, a
lot more than you might initially think. They both have
verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, they basically have almost the same
kinds of words, you can say almost any sentence in
English, and also saying that exact same sentence in Chinese.
And even if you found a situation where you couldn't,
you could just invent some new Chinese character, some new
Chinese words, to stand in for those English words. And
if you compare English to something like Navajo, that it's
very different. Because Navajo has a radically different grammar than
English. And even then Chinese. In fact, the Americans in
World War Two specifically relied on Navajo to encode their
secret military messages. Because Navajo is one of the most
radically distinct language groups separate from the Indo European languages,
and even the Asiatic languages, the Chinese and Japanese and
Korean and so forth. And it's so different. And it's
so difficult to learn for, for indo Europeans and for
for Asians, that like the grammar, the way it works
is so different that actually you have to think radically
differently just to use that language. And so it makes
perfect encoding language. And in fact, from what I understand
the Germans and the Japanese in World War Two, I
don't, I don't think they were able to actually decipher
Navajo, because they didn't have the native interpreters because the
only people who knew Navajo were Native Americans who were
in America. So isn't that interesting. On the other hand,
English and Chinese are very different, because they don't have
any of the same letters in common, like English and
French are much more similar, or English and German than
English and Chinese. is the number five the same as
the number 25. They also want to hear you've gone
too far. Obviously, these are different, how can these two
numbers be the same. But then again, they're both numbers,
I could have compare number five to an ostrich. And
that would have been quite an interesting comparison. But they're
both numbers. They're both odd. They're both whole numbers, they
are both able to divide the number 100. The number
100 is divisible by five and by 25. In fact,
25 is divisible by five and 25 is just five
times five, five groups of five equal 25. So they
have so much in common. In fact, if you wanted
to, you could devote the rest of your life, the
next 60 years of your life could be devoted to
tallying up the similarities between the number five and the
number 25. And that list would not end it would
keep going and going and going. In fact, I want
you to consider something very profound, which is that this
list is infinitely long. There is an infinitely long list
of similarities between the number five and 25. And also,
there's an infinitely long list of differences between the number
five and the number 25. So out of those two
lists, which ones do you select, which ones do you
focus on? You see how tricky this is. It's not
nearly as simple as you thought. Is the idea of
an elephant the same as an elephant. Now, you might
say, Leo, how could they possibly be the same? They're
completely different. And ideas are something in your head if
an elephant is actually real. There it is. But then
again, I could have compared the idea of an elephant
to an ostrich, in which case they would have been
much more different because at least the idea of an
elephant has a resemblance to an elephant. In fact, many
people confuse often confused their ideas of elephants with to
actual elephants, oftentimes people neglect to make a distinction between
the their ideas of something and the thing itself. I
can start talking to you about pizza and how delicious
pizza is. And all this is just going to be
ideas, but I can talk to you and all the
juicy details about this slice of pizza, such that you
can actually mistake is for the real thing, and you're
gonna get hungry by it and all that. And all
that is just gonna be a mental image in your
mind. So clearly, there's a similarity, there's a deep similarity
between your idea of an elephant and an actual elephant.
In fact, that's what allows you to be able to
use this idea to represent the elephant in the first
place. Now, it's also possible to represent an elephant with
an ID of an ostrich. Now that takes a little
bit more work, that's an extra level of abstraction. But
you can do it, you can actually program your mind,
every time you think of an image of an ostrich
that actually what that is, is that's not referring to
an ostrich, but that's referring to an elephant. And you
can do that. In fact, that's how you learn language
in the very beginning. Our men and women the same,
oh, this is a really hot button issue, especially these
days, people like to make a big deal about how
different men and women are. But that, again, there's so
much in common that men and women have, I mean,
we have the same basic DNA, we're of the same
species. We both have hair, and nails and fingers. And
we basically have the exact same organs. And we can
basically do the same things. But then again, we also
have differences. We have different ways. We think we have
different psychologies, we have different things that we're sexually attracted
to. And some of us are masculine, some of us
are feminine, and, and so forth. So which is true,
our men really different for women, are they the same?
Are all human beings the same? That's also a hot
button issue. A lot of people get triggered by that
issue. You know, the liberals will say All human beings
are basically the same. And then the conservatives will criticize
a liberal say, Oh, those liberals are so stupid. They
they lump all human beings together, but really every human
being is unique and different. Who's right? Could it be
that it's a matter of perspective? And that there is
no such thing as an objective answer to this question,
in a way that most people think, See, most people
just assume that these answers have objective questions. I'm sorry,
these these questions have objective answers. And what I'm trying
to get you to maybe start to open your mind
to is the possibility that maybe they don't. Maybe reality
doesn't actually know whether all human beings are the same,
or whether they're all different. After all, how would reality
know the difference? We'll get back to that. We'll talk
about that. And science a little bit later in this
episode. are Republicans the same as Democrats? You might think,
well, Leo, they're so different. How could you put them
in the same category? They're like almost the opposites. But
then again, they're both Americans. They're both part of the
same political system, part of the same government. Many Republicans
and Democrats agree on exactly the same issues. They'll vote
for the exact same policies. But then again, they're also
quite different, and not necessarily different in equal ways. And
then you might zoom in further just on Democrats. And
you might say, are Democrats all the same? And of
course, tool Republican. Democrats are all the same. They'll say,
Yeah, well, Democrats are just social justice warrior, Marxists, socialists.
But of course, if you ask a Democrat, the Democrat
is going to be a lot more discerning about fellow
Democrats. And to a Democrat. Not all Democrats are going
to be socialists. There are some very progressive Democrats who
will be considered socialists, and then there will be some
centrist Democrats who a Democrat would consider more Republican than
a Democrat. And the issues that Democrats and Republicans care
about, they're basically the same issues. They both care about
earning a good wage. They both care about taxation. They
both care about their families. They both care about having
access to employment. They both care about health care, they
care about all these things. They have a lot of
things in common. They're both human beings. I mean, I
could have compared a Republican to an ostrich is Trump
the same as George Washington. So Leah, now you've gone
too far for sure. How could you possibly compare Trump
to George Washington? They're nothing alike. And I would tend
to agree with you. But of course, they do have
so much alike. They're both human beings. They're part of
the same species. Did you know that George Washington was
one of the richest US presidents of all time, of
course, you have to account for inflation. Of course, Trump
likes to lie about as well, we don't really know
how wealthy he is. But even if even even under
the worst line conditions, Trump is still gotta give him
credit for being relatively wealthy. As far as presidents go,
and politicians go. And they have many other things in
common. In fact, you could spend the next 60 years
as a historian and researcher doing research on all the
commonalities between George Washington and Trump. Of course, you could
also spend 60 years doing a careful study of all
their differences. So which are you going to select what
you're going to focus on? Are US drone strikes the
same as terrorism? Now, many Americans would object to that
characterization, say, Leo, how dare you even compare terrorism to
drone strikes? I mean, the United States does drone strikes
in the name of good in the name of democracy,
the name of freedom and, and against the terrorists, we're
fighting the terrorists with these drone strikes. It's not terrorism,
it's counterterrorism. But, you know, you can actually go and
read and watch documentaries of people in Afghanistan and other
places like that, where these drone strikes occur, who are
literally terrorized every night, by the prospect of a drone
strike accidentally hitting them. And there have been 1000s of
civilians. I'm not talking about terrorists, I'm talking about civilians,
innocent civilians, children, women, families, husbands, you know, people haven't
done anything wrong. And their lives, they're already living a
very tough existence in that country. You know, lots of
poverty, they're difficult conditions to raise a family and, and
now these people have to worry, and they have to
watch the skies, and they have dreams that their children
will get hit accidentally by one of these drone strikes,
literally that terrorize them. If that's not the definition of
terrorism, what is then again, of course, the United States
is not deliberately killing the civilians. At least we like
to think so. So what's the difference? What's the similarity?
Maybe depends on how you look at it. is taking
a knee during a football game at the national anthem.
Is that disrespecting America? Well, a lot of people would
say, yes, it is. Because you're supposed to stand up
and hold your hand over your heart and all this.
And if you're not doing that, you're disrespecting the country.
Then again, a lot of people would say, well, but
this is like the most respectful form of protests that
there could possibly be. I mean, a disrespectful world protest
would be like, if the guy took off his pants,
and showed his ass to the camera. That would be
disrespectful. But taking a knee, come on, that's not disrespectful.
That's actually a very respectful form of protest. And then,
of course, the people disagree with each other vehemently, thinking
the other side is dead wrong. Is California the same
as Mississippi? And Missouri, Leo? How could you compare these
two California, Mississippi, so different, but then again, they're both
in America, they're both states. They have similar kinds of
governments. They have similar kinds of policies, similar, very similar
kinds of laws, almost all the same laws in California,
then apply in Mississippi, a murder in Mississippi is going
to count as a murder in California, a theft and
a theft, they're both going to count like, probably 90%
of all their laws are very, very similar. And in
fact, you could drive around in Mississippi with a California
driver's license, and vice versa. And, in fact, you could
live a very similar kind of lifestyle in both those
places. But then again, of course, they're also very different.
They're different politically, they're different, which presidents they vote for?
They're different geographically, they're different in terms of temperature, and
all sorts of stuff. Which are you going to focus
on? Are psychedelics the same as heroin and meth? Well,
a lot of people think so a lot of people
lump those together in the same category and, and that's
why they they hate and they demonize psychedelics. But then
of course, if you've done psychedelics, you realize just how
different they are from something like heroin or meth. Is
a blow job the same as sex. Well, that very
much depends on what, what, what side of the line
you're on. Because like, let's say you're a teenager or
something, and your parents tell you not to have sex.
So of course, maybe you get a blow job. thinking
to yourself, well blow jobs not really sex. And if
they catch you, then you say, Well, I didn't have
sex, I just had a blow job. Or let's say
you're one of those fundamentalist Christians who believes that it's
immoral to have sex before marriage. So you're saving yourself.
But hey, blow jobs don't count a sex, I can
have all the blow jobs I want until I'm married.
And then, and then I can have sex and blow
jobs. See, so very much depends on kind of where
where your agenda lies on that one is cheating on
a test the same thing as cheating on taxes? Well,
you probably think they're quite different. I mean, what is
cheating on a test had to do cheating on taxes.
One is a crime cheating on your taxes, you can
go to jail for that cheating on a test. That's
not very serious. Probably most students have cheated on a
test at least once or twice in their life. But
then again, they're both forms of cheating. And fundamentally, a
cheater is a cheater. Cheating is not a particular activity.
Cheating is an attitude, it's a frame of mind. And
I would bet good money that there's a positive correlation
between people who cheat on their tests, and people who
cheat on their taxes. Because a cheater is cheater. Then
again, there are many people who would just cheat on
a test, but never cheat on their taxes, because they
draw a clear distinction between those two. And they see
that, you know, cheating on taxes, that's a really serious
offense, both legally speaking, but also just morally, because when
you're cheating on your taxes, what you're actually doing is
you're basically just stealing money from public coffers. Whereas when
you cheat on a test, you're not, you're not really
hurting anybody. But then again, if you're cheating on an
important test, let's say a test that determines whether you're
gonna go to Harvard or not, like an essay t
test. And let's say by cheating on this test, you
got a perfect score on this a T, and therefore
now that allows you to go to Harvard, whereas otherwise
you wouldn't? Well, there's a very limited number of slots
at Harvard every year. So you literally stole someone else's
chance to go to Harvard by cheating on this test.
So that's pretty serious. You've changed someone's life by doing
that. Are all religions the same? Well, a lot of
scientifically minded and historically minded rationally minded people. So yeah,
Leah, all religions are just all fantasy myths, nonsense stories,
fairy tales, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, that's all it basically
is just delusion. Really. Look at all the differences you
see within religion. Somebody differences, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims? Are
they really all the same? Are they different? How about
we look at just the Christians, or the Christians all
the same? You might say all the Christians are all
the same. If you think that go to Wikipedia, and
type in List of Christian denominations, you will get a
list of Christian denominations, that is like 10 pages long,
which has probably 200 different Christian denominations on their listing
every percentage by the millions of each version of Christian
you Baptists and Anglicans, and, and Roman Catholics and Protestants
and evangelicals and Orthodox Christians, Eastern Orthodox and, and then
sub denominations and sub sub sub denominations and all that.
So what are they all the same? Are they different?
Are all Baptists the same? If you ask a Baptist
are all Baptist the same? What do you think they
would tell you? No. They will make fine distinctions between
different kinds of Baptists like, Oh, I hate those Baptists
over there that Baptist churches is full of, of evil
Baptists, and we're the good Baptists over here is the
Buddha the same as Christ. And for this one, I
have a really funny story. I came back from Hawaii.
This was maybe half a year ago, after a meditation
retreat there. A good retreat, lots of deep insights and
awakening experiences. And I'm driving back from the airport, my
taxi drivers driving me back home. And, and we're just
chatting in the in the car in his taxi. And
he asked me, Oh, where are you from? What are
you doing? I'm like, oh, yeah, I just got back
from a long retreat in Hawaii. I'm glad to be
back. And then he's like, Oh, well, meditation. What is
meditation? What is meditation? I mean, this guy was, you
know, he wasn't into self help. He wasn't into spiritual.
He didn't know anything about this sort of stuff. So
I'm trying to explain to him what meditation is. So
I tell him well, meditation, I just basically sat there
for a week and did nothing and I just kind
of sat in a room for 12 hours and just
like stared at the wall. That's meditation. And I tried
to clear my mind thought. And he's like, like, that's
what you do. Are you serious? Is that what you
did? Are you joking with me? I'm like, No, that's
I'm serious. That's what I did for whole week. And
he's like, that's, that's, that's crazy. Why would you do
such a thing? If he and then he's like, if
I, if I had to sit alone in a room
for a whole week, my mind would just be nagging
me all the time coming up with all sorts of
crazy thoughts and ideas. And I'm like, Yeah, that's exactly
the point is to calm your mind with meditation. And
to him, this was such a foreign concept. And he's
like, God, what's the point of the book? What's the
point? Why, why empty your mind? Why would you want
an empty mind? Just this amused me so much. And
I'm thinking about how to explain this to him. And
I'm like, Well, you can have profound mystical experiences. After
many days of emptying your mind, you can have awakening
experiences. And I'm trying to explain this to him. But
he doesn't know what awakening is what enlightenment is, I
have to find a way to explain it to him.
So I asked him, hey, you know, are you religious?
Because I know I can. I can relate this to
him if he's religious. And he's like, Yeah, I'm a
Christian. And he was actually I think he was Ethiopian.
And Ethiopia, Christianity ism. It's one of the few Northern
African countries that that Christianity is big in other places,
and it's more Muslims, but historically, it was Christianity. So
he's a Christian. And I'm like, okay, so you believe
in Christ and the message of Christ? And he's like,
oh, yeah, yeah, I do. I go, I paraded in
church and all this every Sunday, blah, blah, blah. And
like, well, then, you know, you know what I'm talking
about? What was the central teaching of Christ? It was
that you could awaken. You could have enlightenment, you can
become like Christ, by doing these practices, and what what
was Christ really teaching? He was teaching you meditation? What
is prayer really about? It's not about asking God for
gifts and stuff. Prayer is calming your mind. So that
you can silence your mind and actually merge with God
and realize your own Christhood your own Christ nature. And
he's like, Yeah, I guess. But what does that have
to do with meditation? Isn't meditation, like, something Buddhists do?
Isn't that like the Buddha? That's not Christ. And I
tell him, yeah, that's the Buddha, Christ Buddha, same thing.
Buddha nature, Christ nature. And he and this, and I
will never forget this, this made me laugh so hard.
And also this was so eye opening for me about
just how difficult it is to communicate these ideas. This
is exactly what he said to me, he said, but
isn't the Buddha evil. And I just started laughing and
laughing and laughing. Because he as a Christian, he was
taught that Buddhism is just some devil worship cult. And
it has nothing to do with Christianity, because what Christianity
is interested in is differentiating itself, from Buddhism and Hinduism,
and all the other religions. So of course, what it
does it demonizes all the other ones. And that prevents
people from actually seeing the deep interconnectedness between all of
religions, and what is really being taught. And realizing ultimately,
when you have this union for yourself, in your direct
experience, that you are none other than the Buddha, and
the Buddha is none other than Christ. That's a very
profound realization. Are my two fingers the same? They look
the same. But actually, they're mere copies of each other.
But of course, they're not even copies because each one
is unique. different hair, different, different freckles, different scars, different
cells. There's a there's very complex stuff going on in
each one of these fingers. In fact, that could ask
you this, is this finger right now? The same as
this finger right now. You might think so but how?
How could they be the same? You know that there's
billions of cells and blood cells, oxygen, chemicals and stuff
flowing through this finger every second, all the blood that
was there has already flown out new blood has flown
in. It's changing. It's growing. It's aging, it's actually slowly
dying. All the cells get replaced this finger, you might
think it's the same finger that I've had my whole
life. But really, every single molecule in this finger has
been replaced over my entire lifetime. So how is it
really the same? Which brings us to the even larger
question. Are you the same as you were five years
ago? or 20 years ago? Or hell, even five seconds
ago, are you the same? Are you the same as
you were? When you started watching this episode listening to
me, I've already filled your mind with all these crazy
new ideas that you never thought before. already. If you
believe in the scientific materialist model, your brain has changed
by just the things that I told you in the
last five seconds. So you're always different. And yet you
still think you're the same, you still fundamentally feel like
you're the same thing that was born 2030 4050 years
ago, and that that's you? Why do you feel that
if you're different? Technically, you're different. So how can you
say you're the same? Which is true? Are you technically
different? Or are you the same? Who's to say? Are
you the same as a Nazi? No, of course, people
will immediately say, No, Leah, how, why? Why would I
be a Nazi? I'm not an I'm not a neo
Nazi. But that's not what I asked you. I asked
you can you see the similarity between you and a
Nazi? I mean, after all, Nazis, not some monster, a
Nazi as a human being like you same species, same
Oregon's same brain, same mind, same basic ideas. Pretty much
the same value system is you people think Nazis have
radically different values. No Nazis have almost the same values
as you. Even if you're not calling yourself a Nazi,
there's so much similarity between Nazis. To the point where,
you know, people don't like being lumped together with Nazis.
So of course, they're going to make all this effort
to try to differentiate themselves from Nazis. But in doing
that, that actually makes them very susceptible to then becoming
a Nazi. Because to really understand Nazism, and the evils
of it, and how to avoid it, you have to
actually study the similarity between the Nazi mind and your
own mind. And to see that actually, the kind of
logic and reasoning and justifications that a Nazi would use
to justify the kind of evils that they committed, every
human mind is capable of every single one, don't care
who you are, you could take a baby, and that
baby's mind is capable of what that Nazi mind is
capable of. Because at one point, that Nazi was also
just to maybe it's just all a matter of how
your mind gets programmed, what kind of ideologies gets fed
to you, what you start to believe what your paradigm
is, and then what kind of place you find yourself
in life. And then you know, pretty soon you can
start telling yourself that, hey, I was just following orders.
Let's see if the ego doesn't like to be compared
to Nazis. Because the ego loves to compare itself to
the good guys, not the bad guy. So the ego,
the ego will do everything possible to differentiate itself from
the bad guy, the quote unquote bad guys. Are all
actualised.org videos the same? Well, if you're a casual viewer
of actualised.org, then you would say yes, of course Leo,
you're you're just you're basically spouting the same shit. Enlightenment
is self actualization that every single fucking week you're talking
about. egos and, and this and suffering and religion and
Buddha and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all the same?
Same gobbledygook. Same religious sounding mumbo jumbo. But then of
course, if you're, if you're a discerning viewer, then you're
thinking yourself, how can people even think that every video
is unique, new topics are being covered new, profound insights
and things that I never heard about before, even though
I thought that I saw everything there was to see
and heard everything there is to hear about self help.
And then the next video comes out. And now it's
something new, something different, something I never heard about before.
How is this even possible? So which is? Is every
hydrogen atom in the universe the same? Will on this
one, he went to Hollywood? I got you now? This
is a physical scientific question. And the answer is definitely
that every hydrogen atom in the universe is the same.
That's what physics tells us. Really, really? Or is every
one of them different? If they were all the same?
How could they be in different positions in the universe?
So at the very least, they have different xyz coordinates.
And also, the fourth dimension time, a different time coordinate,
let's say? At the very least, you have to pause
it that because if you didn't pause it that how
could you distinguish one hydrogen atom from another one? So
literally, every single hydrogen atom in the universe is different.
But of course, they also share a lot of similarities
too. You could swap one hydrogen atom for another hydrogen
atom, and it probably wouldn't make a big difference to
your scientific experiments, or to your technology. Is reality the
same as illusion and fantasy? Well, you might say, Leo,
that's totally different. What can illusion fantasy have to do
with reality? It's the opposite. But then again, who's to
tell? What is reality? What is fantasy? You assume there
is such a thing as reality. And then anything that
doesn't correspond to that is fantasy. What What if reality
isn't like that? What if the nature of reality is
that it's not distinct from illusion and fantasy? What if
reality cannot tell the difference? between reality and fantasy? What
if fantasy is the reality? After all, how would you
distinguish the two? And you might say, well, Leo, we
can clearly distinguish between something real, and the Flying Spaghetti
Monster. But that's not my question. My question is that
thing that you call real? How do you know that
that itself is not an illusion? How do you know
this hand right before your eyes right here is not
an illusion. What would you use to distinguish between an
illusion and reality? And that criterion that you're using to
distinguish between reality and illusion? How do you know that
itself? is not an illusion? See the problem there? It's
a very deep problem. Think about Elon. Is God the
same as the devil? The religious people say, Leo, how
dare you even compare these two? Obviously, the devil is
the opposite of God. But really isn't? Have you thought
about this? Think about this. Set your dogmas and religious
teachings, and just think about this? Very simply using common
sense. What did they tell you? God is they told
you God is infinite. They told you God is the
Creator of everything. So did the devil not get created
by God? If the devil was not created by God,
then that means that God did not create everything. And
then the question is, how did the devil come? Come
into being? So if, if God didn't create the devil,
that means the only possible other place the devil came
from is God knows that the devil created himself. Right?
But if the devil created himself, that means he has
the power to create himself, which is the power that
God has. So that means that the devil is God.
So let's say though, that you say, Okay, well, let's
say the devil didn't create himself. Let's say God created
the devil. But Leah, that still doesn't mean that God
is the devil. But they told you that God is
infinite. If God is infinite, that means God is everything.
There is nothing which God is not. That means that
everything that God creates, is God itself. So no, no
creation of Gods is separate from God. Which means that
God is literally the devil. Interesting. is good, the same
as evil. Now, again, here, we're gonna say, no, they're
the opposite. But then again, it depends on who you
are, and what position you're looking at it from. After
all, what's good for one person is precisely evil for
another person. And what's evil for another person is precisely
good for another person. For example, a terrorist will think
that blowing up some civilians is good. Whereas people looking
from the outside of that situation will say that that's
evil. So who is right? Be careful about just assuming
that you're right. Because the terrorist is also just assuming
that he's right. So again, who's right? Everybody feels there,
right? So you can't just rely on your feelings of
being right, to determine whether you're right or not. And
after all, what's the difference between right and wrong? Is
there a law in the universe that says that something
is right, something is wrong? Or is that something that
your own mind created? Am I the same as you?
You might feel like we're very different. You might say,
Leo, you're you're so intellectual. And you know so much
stuff about self actualization, whereas me, I'm just getting started.
I'm confused about this stuff. I have a hard time
meditating, I have a hard time understanding some of these
enlightenment concepts he talked about and so forth. And you
might feel like we're very different. But over time, as
you self actualize, and you gain more consciousness, you'll discover
more and more just how similar you and I are,
until maybe one day you will actually realize that I
actually am you and that may be all that I
am is just, you telling yourself to wake up. Wake
up, wake up is nothing the same as something? Again,
you might think nothing and something these are opposites. To
have something is to have nothing, or is to have
something is to not have nothing, and to have nothing
is to not have something Well, you got to be
careful about that. Because after all, nothing is nothing. And
precisely because it's nothing, it could be hiding right under
something. You see, the problem is that people assume that
nothing is some empty void. Somewhere somewhere far outside of
all of this reality. The opposite of this, it's what
happens with all this gets destroyed. But what if nothing
is precisely what is here right now? What if this
is nothing? How do you know what nothing is supposed
to feel like and look like? You assume it's supposed
to look like an empty space? But how do you
know it's not full of everything that you see around
you? How do you know that the entire time that
you've been alive, alive, from your very birth, all the
way till now, all the stuff you went through all
the suffering all the problems, all the emotions, all the
ups and downs, the happiness, the sadness, the misery, the
depression, the joy, the beauty, the love all of it?
How do you know that all of that is not
nothing? Who's to say that these things are distinct. So
that's the quiz. I hope you start to see now
how much depth there is told us a lot more
than you probably imagined when we first started. And it's
a lot more of a consequential topic. Notice, we touched
upon a lot of hot button issues here, issue that
have been debated by mankind for 1000s of years issues
that men have killed each other over for 1000s of
years, all because they get stuck arguing between a specific
set of differences or similarities, and they get ideological about
it. And they insist that they're right. Because they fail
to see the relativity of what difference and similarity really
are, they don't really understand the essence of what difference
and similarity are, they just assumed that this is just
sort of like a given reality short, just gives you
a bunch of similarities and gives you bunch of differences.
And there it is, it's just objective, it's just facts.
You just look at the world, you see the differences,
you see the similarities, and it's just obvious. And that's
it. And if somebody doesn't agree with me, and doesn't
see it, they're just stupid, they're deluded, they're crazy, they're
criminal, and we lock them up, we got to exile
them, or in the worst case, we got to execute
them. And that's the mindset that we're questioning here. What
I'm trying to get you to see is the relativity
of thing. And relativity is too deep of a topic
to fully elaborate on here, I'll have a separate episode
about the future. But fundamentally, what relativity means is that
it depends on your perspective. And what that means is,
is that without a perspective, there's nothing there. So it's
like that, that old saying that if a if a
tree if a tree falls in the woods, and there's
no one there to hear it, does it make a
sound? And the materials paradigm would say yes, of course,
it makes a sound, there's just no one there to
hear. And with relativity, the relativity paradigm tells you that
not only does it not make a sound, there is
no tree and there is no forest, if you are
not there looking at it. That's relativity, but we'll get
into that deeper in the future. So there's a lot
of examples that we see happening all around our culture
these days, in the news and in the media, which
have directly to do with, with people not really being
able to, to grasp sameness, the essence of sameness and
difference. For example, we see lots of racism and xenophobia
and ethnocentrism, race wars, what is this but people arguing
over sameness in differences? A lot of times these differences
are very petty, very petty differences, like differences in in
melanin in the skin color. How about Israel and Palestine.
They've been at each other's throats at each other's throats
for a long time. And they consider themselves to be
very different. But I'll bet you this, that if we
had an alien race of Martians fly down tomorrow, and
start to conquer the world, the Palestinians and the Israelis
will start to get along just fine. They would find
all sorts of similarities. They would start to go to
the same schools and they would start to go to
the same restaurants they start to integrate a tear down
the walls because they have a larger difference. They have
the aliens to fight against. And for them now, so
it's a matter of survival. But then I'll bet you
one more thing that as soon as the aliens were
defeated, let's say we defeated the Aliens, the Palestinians and
Israelis would again go back to being at each other's
throats. Because again, there would now no longer be that
external difference. So now the sameness they shared to overcome
that larger difference, will now again get further subdivided into
individual differences between Israelis and Palestinians. And I'll tell you
this one further thing, once the Israelis and Palestinians maybe
in 1000 years, once they finally get together and make
peace and, and integrate and solve that whole issue in
the Middle East. They will subdivide even further, this joint
unit of Israel and Palestine will itself then find frappes
factions and divisions within itself. And in fact, right now,
within Israel, you can find divisions within Israel, different political
factions and groups, some of them want to integrate, some
of them don't. And same thing with the Palestinians. Wouldn't
it be helpful to understand this sort of stuff if
you're trying to overcome that conflict, and really find a
lasting resolution and avoid all the violence and all the
nonsense that goes on there? All the demagoguery and all
the ideology? about Christianity versus Islam. Those likes to go
out each other's throats as well, citing differences between each
other, calling the other one evil. Without seeing the deep
similarities between the two. How about capitalist versus socialist? Same
sort of problem? How about the culture wars that we're
seeing all over the place? Now? Same sort of problem?
How about the Gender Wars, men versus women feminists versus
the men's rights advocates? Same sort of problem. How about
sexual harassment, the ME TOO movement, you see this, this
sort of problem happening with the me to movement where
some people lump too many different kinds of sexual harassment
into one category. So they will, they will lump together
rape and a pat on the butt with a crew
dirty joke, or maybe some some awkward flirtation in by
the watercooler at the office, right, those are, those are
quite distinct things. And yet, they're all They're all lumped
together. On the other hand, it's also important to recognize
that there is a common element, there's a deep sameness
between all of these individual cases, in that we have
a cultural problem, in that men in general tend to
have a lack of sensitivity, about how they pursue sex
with women, especially the workplace. And men do abuse, their
power, and their position their privilege, to to try to
get sex, and sometimes, you know, it can be very
light stuff. But sometimes it can escalate to something as
as ridiculous as whipping your dick out uninvited at a
restaurant or something like that, or in a hotel, corridor.
And so it is very important that we also recognize
the commonalities and that we say, hey, as a culture,
we need to think about reforming some of this stuff.
Because you know, I don't want my daughter growing up
in a world like that. You want your daughter to
grow up, and we're like that. How about science versus
religion, this is also one of those hot button issues
that gets debated the atheists versus the Christians, or it's
the, the evolutionary scientists versus the creationists, and so forth.
And they go back and forth. And they, they and
it's all it all has to do with sameness, as
in differences. The scientists love to emphasize the difference between
science and religion. But as I'll say, a little bit
later in this episode, that's that difference is not always
as great as they like to believe. So what is
sameness? And what is difference? Like, really? What are they?
And here I want you to start to contemplate, and
I don't want you to just speculate. And to come
up with theories, what I want you to do is
I want you to take two objects in your direct
experience right now. Like this finger and this finger, take
them in your direct experience, look at them. And notice,
train your consciousness on these fingers. And notice first of
all, that they're different, but also that they're similar and
the same. And I want you to kind of focus
your your consciousness back and forth between those two and
as you're doing that also bring in a sort of
meta consciousness, a meta awareness of what you're doing, and
try to get a sense of like, what is difference
and what is sameness. I'm not just asking you what's
the difference between one thing or another finger? I'm asking
you what is the difference? P Read difference between any
two objects. What is that? And what is the sameness
between any two objects? What is that this is the
sort of a higher level, second level abstraction from one
particular difference. And don't go too fast here, let yourself
really slowly just train your consciousness on it resists speculating,
or theorizing or bring in any kind of scientific explanations
and just go with your direct experience, the answer is
right there in your direct experience and nowhere else. So
of course, you can try that now you can pause
the video and try this now. But really, it's not
gonna be enough for you to try for five minutes.
This, this needs some serious work. So I'm just, I'm
putting this out there. And as your homework assignment for
the next week, you will be practicing this. And you
can try different objects, you can compare your finger to
a pen, to a pencil to a car to a
cat or whatever. In fact, I also want to want
you to try the following exercise, I want you to
try to think of two things, which are as utterly
radically different as you could possibly imagine. So as an
example, what might happen, you might think of like a
donkey, and a car. Those seem quite different. Okay, so
let's say that that's your answer. But then I want
you to ask, but how are they still similar. And
you'll quickly notice that actually a donkey and a car
are similar. They're both used as vehicles, they're both transportation
devices, they can both be used to, to lug around
cargo. And in sources, they almost both require fuel. They
don't work for free, you need to feed the donkey,
you also need to feed your car with gasoline. They
require energy or both, in a sense machines. One's a
biological machine, another one's a mechanical machine, but they're both
in a sense machines. Of course, very different. But you
find those similarities. So then I want you to say
okay, well no, let me find something even more radically
different. Like donkey, and what? Love. Those are radically different
things. They're like, not even in the same ballpark. Donkeys
in love, love. Love is not really even a physical
object. Because like a donkey in a car. They're both
physical objects, but a donkey in love and would love
what's the connection? And then I want you to ask
further. What is the deep similarity between a donkey and
love and you will find something there is my claim?
Well, for example, it's possible for a human being to
love a donkey. Not necessarily romantically, I just mean like,
you could have a pet donkey that was living on
your farm for a long time and you can develop
a real love for that for that animal. And it's
back to you might even hypothesize that a donkey might
love its children. After all, loves is a is a
sort of a, a high level human mammalian type of
emotion at least if we believe the scientific material Sparrow.
So if humans are capable of love, are chimps capable
of love? Probably, most people probably say they are especially
like with their children. I think most people most people
would admit that chimp mothers love their babies. No less
than, than a human mothers love their babies. And so
you know, a donkey is not that different from a
chimp. Or you could, you could find other things. I
want you to do that exercise and see how radically
you can pull, pull things apart. And then also notice
that there's still similarity in the very end. And no
matter what, no matter how radically different you can think
of two things. Ultimately, at the rock bottom, the most
common denominator between any two things will be the fact
that they are both happening right now. In your consciousness.
Right now. In fact, I dare you. I double dare
you to find or think of two objects which are
not happening right now. In your consciousness. Try it. Don't
speculate. Don't argue with me. Don't Be arise, don't bring
science into it, try it find it in your direct
experience will she'll notice is that for a thing to
exist, it must exist within your consciousness. Otherwise, it's not
a thing at all. And so that gives you a
clue. Maybe the one similarity that everything has in common
is that it's consciousness. That's something I want you to
contemplate. And don't take my word for. I want you
to further notice that technically, every single object is different
from every other object. I don't care what it is,
in fact, to be to exist, is to be different.
That's what existence is. Its difference. If we had two
objects, and they were precisely identical, that means that they
would be so identical that even their coordinates in space
and time would be superimposed on top of each other,
such that literally the two objects would fuse into one
and we couldn't even speak of two objects anymore, there
would only be one object to speak of, you get
that make sure you get that this is super important.
To have two objects, they must be distinct by at
least one measure of quality. So if we want to
use space as our distinguishing dimension, then we would say
that at the very least, if we want to have
two particles, they must be separate from each other in
the x coordinates are in the y coordinate, or in
the z coordinate, or in time, at the very least.
But of course, they can also be distinct in their
shape in a color in their smell, and they're truly
in other things. But they must be distinct. Otherwise, they
don't exist. You get that this is super important that
you get this. Don't just believe me, pause the video,
pause the recording and actually get this in your direct
experience. Everything look around the room, everything you see is
completely distinct from everything else. Otherwise, you couldn't see it.
Otherwise, it wouldn't exist. For your cat to be a
cat, it has to not be a dog. For your
finger to be a finger has to not be a
tow, for your head to be ahead as Nokia car.
Get this. This is super important. So everything is different.
But that's not where the story ends. Because of course,
I told you earlier that everything is the same as
well. Everything is consciousness. So now it seems like we're
saying that everything is different. But at the same time
everything is also the same, which is that which is
true. could both be true simultaneously? Could this be the
essence of relativity? Think about that. Further, I want you
to notice that even though technically everything is different. If
you only had the ability to see differences, then you
couldn't function. And in fact, you couldn't even live. Here's
what I mean, you couldn't recognize your own mother. Because
the act of recognizing your own mother requires that you
look past the differences to see the similarity. Because hey,
your mother is different every single second, every single year.
Your mother is very different from the way that she
looks 20 years ago, and yet you can still recognize
her. Your mother could have some new mole, a scar,
a new haircut, new lipstick, new makeup. She could get
disfigured in a car accident, horrible fire, half her face
could melt off, you would still be able to recognize
her. Even though she's technically different. And her brain and
mind is changing all the time. She has new beliefs,
new ideas, new experiences. So for you to say that
that is my mother, and for you to be able
to do that for the entirety of your life that
requires that you be able to see sameness. And all
that depends your entire life. Again, this is extremely significant.
Because see, I don't want you to fall into this
very naive, rationalist, scientific, atheistic materialistic trap of saying, oh,
Leo, I'm very scientific. And I'm very rational. So I
just stick to the facts, man is the hard facts.
And the hard facts, like you said, is everything is
different. So that's what I believe that's what's true. And
what I'm telling you is that no, you're full of
shit. That's not how reality works. If that's actually how
reality works, you couldn't recognize your own mother, you will
be a complete moron. You will be dumber than a
rock. Computers are stupid. Because they lack the ability to
recognize sameness. It's very difficult for computers recognize the sameness
between a photograph of this hand, and this hand now,
computer technology is advancing and our computers are becoming smarter.
But notice what's happening as we're becoming smarter. They're getting
better at recognizing faces, recognizing images, matching them up, and
looking past the differences to see the similarities. And as
that happens, they become smarter. But a computer is still
so stupid that a computer cannot tell the difference. Or
cannot tell the similarity, for example, between a photograph of
me as I am today, and me as when I
was a baby, a computer could not tell that similarity,
a human being could it'd be difficult, but could I,
at least I can. And you know, a computer, for
example, cannot see the similarity between a Baptist and a
Roman Catholic, or between Christianity and Buddhism cannot see those
differences. Now, in the future, they definitely will be able
to, but right now they can't. And that's why they're
dumb. So if you keep insisting that you're just sticking
to the hard facts, which just means the differences, then
you're insisting that you're going to be the dumbest thing
that is alive. But of course, you can't do this.
Because actually, it's not possible for you to actually live
while doing this. So you just be lying to yourself.
And what I mean by that is that actually, the
problem is even worse than I started with your mother,
the problem is much worse. The problem is that you
couldn't even recognize yourself. For you to know that you
are you every morning that you wake up and look
in the mirror, when you're brushing your teeth, you have
to look past the differences, to see the same nurses.
Because hey, your face is aging, it's aged over the
last 10 years, probably quite significantly. You're different. All the
molecules and cells in your body, according to science, have
come and gone in the last 10 years have all
been replaced. You're a completely new creature. You've experienced so
much your beliefs have changed your your thinking mean, you're
learning your knowledge has changed your attitudes, your feelings have
changed. Everything about you has changed from when you were
a teenager to when you are, wherever you are right
now. Sometimes in radical ways, radical ways, might be difficult
for you to even remember what life was like as
a teenager, and the kind of ridiculous stuff that you
believe that you don't believe anymore. And yet, you still
consider yourself to be the same. So to accomplish that
feat, what I want you to notice is that you
have to look past a lot of differences, a lot
of very significant differences, to see the dip, the deep
similarity in order to exist as a self at all.
That's profound. We'll return to that. I want to show
you an example since we're on this, on this. On
this point of image recognition, I want to show you
example, here on the screen, take a look at this
first slide. And what you see is you see the
word hello written a bunch of different fonts and if
you're an English speaker, then you have no problem reading
all these different fonts as hello and in fact your
mind accomplish the task and In a fraction of a
second, you didn't even notice it was not even difficult
for you. And yet also, now I want you to
look very closely at each of the different letters, look
at the cursive H, look at the different ways that
h can be written. In all these different fonts, look
at how radically different all of these are. So for
you to be able to accomplish the rather intelligent task
of reading all these words, and, and noticing that they
all say the same thing. Hello, it's all the same
one word for you to notice that your mind has
to accomplish a very sophisticated thing. It has to look
past a lot of differences. But it's precisely because your
mind is so good at it, that you don't even
notice that you do this. The reason I'm emphasizing this
point is because people will get stuck in this trap.
I'm telling you, especially scientifically minded people get stuck in
the trap that hey, Leo, I'm just a hard, no
scientifically minded person. And all I care about is the
facts. And what I'm telling you is that no, you
care a lot more about not the facts. You see,
it's not a fact that all these words are the
same word. That's not a fact. That's something your mind
is constructing. And that's very important to start to see.
That becomes very significant as we go along in this
topic. And if you're still not convinced, and let me
show you slide number two. Slide number two is the
exact same phrase or word hello, in Chinese. But now,
it's pretty difficult for you to see the sameness on
the slide. Because in English, you learned over many years,
how to interrelate and look past the differences of various
ways to spell and write English characters. Whereas with Chinese,
you didn't do that. If you're a native English speaker.
And now though, as I'm talking, as I'm pointing this
out to you, now your mind is starting to focus
in on every little character. And now maybe you're starting
to match up this one here with that one there.
And you're saying, oh, yeah, Leo, you're right. This is
the same character as that. It's not a big difference.
On the other hand, if you were a new student
of Chinese, and then you went to China, for a
vacation, and you were asked to go around town reading
different signs, even though you might know this word, this
phrase other kinds of common phrases, you might still struggle
very much to read the signs, because those signs will
be written in fonts that you are not familiar with
at all, such that you might be looking at the
exact word that you know, but you're still not going
to recognize it because it's written in a different font
than the one that you're used to. Especially with cursive,
kind of like calligraphy type fonts, it becomes quite, quite
difficult or artsy, fartsy types of fonts, which have a
lot of stylizing on them, they become quite challenging to
read. So if you're learning Chinese, it will take you
many years before you're actually able to read Chinese. Even
if you already know it perfectly, you to read it
in all the different fonts that it comes in. That
will be many years of work for your mind to
look past those differences. Because in point of fact, they
are all different. If they weren't different, there would only
be one set of characters on that page. You see.
Further example of this is with children, object permanence and
conservation of substances and liquids. And I'm actually going to
post a video of this very illuminating video, I'm gonna
post it on my blog after this episode releases, where
it will show a toddler sitting there, and they will
ask the toddler to look at two glasses of water.
Both glass of water have exactly the same liquid, let's
say they're half filled. Then the adult takes one of
the glasses pours it into a tall champagne glass, same
amount of liquid just Paul and takes the glass pours
it into into a flat petri dish, same amount of
liquid just now flat and ask the child this is
like a three year old child or something. Ask the
child which one has more liquid and the child will
say the tall one. Even though they have the same
amount of liquid. Now as an adult, you look at
that you're gonna laugh and you say, Oh, that's so
silly. How could that child be so stupid? But you
have to remember you were that child yourself. You were
that stupid, but also further there's the An additional, deeper
mindfuck is when you realize that actually in point of
fact, in a sense, to be able to look past
the differences is to actually fudge the truth. The truth
is that the differences are all there and everything is
absolutely different. But this is not convenient to your survival.
And so what you do is you look past the
differences, to be able to live your life in a
convenient and comfortable way. And you know, little babies, they
don't have a sense of object permanence. That means that
if you if you play the peekaboo game like this,
and you hide an object behind your hand, they will
actually think the object has disappeared. And then it'll reappear,
disappear, reappear in the spirit appear as an adult, though,
you know, the object didn't actually disappear. Now, you might
say, well do that. Yeah, so what the kid was
stupid, then the kid learned how it was, what what
what reality was really like, what's true? And now the
kid just knows that objects exist. And there we go.
It's as simple as that. If only it were that
simple. What if actually, it's you who's stupid one? What
if the kid was right? What if actually, in truth,
the object does disappear. But you as an adult, because
it was necessary for your survival, you learned how to
trick yourself into believing that the object was still there
behind the scenes. That's not true. That means actually what
you learn, you didn't learn the truth, as an adult,
you actually learned to delude yourself. But Leo, why would
I learned to delude myself? Well, we'll get back to
that. I also want to show you an example of
how sameness and difference are relative to context. So take
a look at the following slide. We have two rectangles
here on the first slide. Now answer the question, are
they the same? Are they different? Okay, remember your answer?
Now, I'm gonna show you the second slide. And now
again, the question is, are those two rectangles? The same?
Are they different? And now I'm gonna show you the
third slide. And again, are those two rectangles the same?
Are they different? Notice as as I'm introducing a more
and more different third object, the original two rectangles appear
to be more and more similar. Until we get to
slide number four, take a look. And now they look
even more similar than they ever did. And all that
we're doing here is we're just introducing an additional shape,
which is really what we're doing is we're, we're changing
the context. And this is changing your perceptions of the
situation. And now finally, I want you to take a
look at the fifth slide. Are these the same? Or
are these different? Be careful, it's a trick question. They
can't possibly be the same, because they are distinct. It's
precisely because they're distinct, that you can count four of
them. If they weren't distinct, you could only count one
of them, there would only be one square on that
screen. So for there to be four of them. There
must be at least one difference between each one. Get
that that's super important. Can you see that? I mean,
it's not rocket science. It's very simple. But but it's
very easy to overlook, because it's so obvious. You get
that? Good. Now let's talk about science. It's very important
to notice that science cannot prove difference or sameness. You
might be very tempted at this point, in order to
deny the relativity that I'm proposing is to come in
here say, oh, Leo, you're just you're trying to push
relativity on me and I don't like relativity. Why don't
we use sound? Why can't we just use science to
adjudicate these questions? Science will tell us we'll just run
some experiments. And what I'm telling you that you can't
do that, because sameness and difference Prior to science because
if you want to be technical, like already said, everything
is different. But just because everything is different, so what?
That's not enough. The problem is when you're doing science,
you're going way beyond just looking at differences between things.
In fact, mostly what science is, is looking for similarities
between things, grouping things into various categories. Whether it's animals,
or elements, or atoms, or some subatomic particles, or people
or monkeys, or apes, or psychological diseases or disorders or
whatever. Largely science is about categorizing stuff. And what is
categorization? What is the category. And by a category, I
don't mean anything complicated, I mean, something very simple. Like
the category of cats. That's an example of a category
that includes domestic cats, lions, tigers, ocelots, cheetahs, jaguars, leopards,
and so forth. Right? So that's a simple category for
you. But the question is, what is the category? And
where does it come from? Is the category something you
find walking around on the savanna? Do you like, go
go on the savanna. And you see, you see a
catch all look, that's, that's a cat. No, you don't
see cats on the savanna, you see a particular thing
sitting there, maybe it's a lion. By the way, a
lion already is a category for many different kinds of
individual creatures. But let's overlook that. So you see a
lion sitting there. But you don't know that it's a
cat, to know that it's a cat, you have to
also create a higher category based on your experiences with
tigers and domestic cats or other things to create a
cat category. And then you have to create that your
mind is creating, that's not something you find in the
world. So this, this really stupid notion that science just
deals with the fact man is just rational. This is
this is flying completely out the window. This is completely
naive nonsense. There's no such thing. Science is not objective.
Science is deep, deeply subjective. These categories you're creating. These
are not objective things. The similarities, you're drawing between different
scientific fields and scientific phenomena. This is subjective stuff. It's
not objective, despite what science tells itself. And this is
the fundamental problem with science that science is not conscious
of the way that it's, it's it's constructing these categories,
and that it's constructing its own metaphysical understanding of reality.
It's sneaking in hidden metaphysical assumptions, while denying that it's
doing so that's the fundamental problem. And by the way,
you want a definition for what a category is, I
forgot to tell you a category technically, is a collection
of different objects, which are similar. Again, let me repeat
because this profound, a category is a collection of different
objects, which are similar. But the question of course, is,
who gets to arbitrate between what counts as different and
similar. And notice that that is not done through any
kind of mechanical means. You cannot go out with a
ruler and measure the difference between or rather, you cannot
measure the similarity between a lion and a tiger using
a ruler. Now, if you're, if you're clever, and you
keep insisting on your materialism, because they Leo, but we
can use DNA testing to measure the similarity of DNA
between a cat and our tiger and a lion. And
through that we can create categories. But you're still overlooking
the obvious. Who is determining that DNA is what should
be the criterion that accounts for the similarity or the
difference? And how much of a difference in the DNA
counts as the determining factor is that 1% 5%? I
mean, science tells you that you're 99% chimpanzee. So why
don't you call yourself a chimpanzee? Who is determining all
this stuff you are? And if you're just believing some
scientist, then the scientist is so you're just seeing authority.
And here's where science gets very similar to religion. Scientific
people like to tell themselves that, hey, man, I don't
I don't buy into authority. Religious people who will justify
their beliefs by citing authority like the Pope or the
Bible, but science doesn't do that. Yes, it does. Science
builds a consensus around categories. These categories are arbitrary. These
categories are created by the ego mind. They're constructions. But
science needs to build a consensus in a community precisely
because there's no reality to, to those concepts. They're arbitrary.
So the only way to win that battle is to
win the battle, through consensus, not through truth. Science isn't
went through truth, science winds through consensus. Just like religion,
which is why science needs to fight for its ideas,
just like religion. Ah, now we see some deep similarities
here. Now, things were getting a little clearer. You see,
science is far from some objective, pursuit of the ultimate
truth. That's not what science is about. Science is about
creating categories that serve the ego mind. But that's a
very deep point, there's so much to unpack in that
we'll we'll keep chipping away at it. I want you
to notice that identity is not an objective fact, the
way that most people assume it identity is not an
objective fact. Yet this science cannot determine if two things
are identical. Can't do it. Because by definition, if you
have two things, they are distinct. So if you if
let's say you want to be super, super rigorous, super
truthful, then you would have to just say that absolutely.
Everything is unique and distinct, and different from everything else.
And that's the end of the story. But but if
you said that there could be no science, you understand
this, there is no science if you say that, because
science is all about finding the similarities between things. So
that doesn't work. Not to mention what you still wouldn't
have the whole truth, you'd only have half the truth.
If you said that. Well, we'll get to the other
half in a moment here. So what I'm I'm literally
what I'm saying is that science cannot determine there is
no objective determination within reality, for the identity one equals
one. Because in point of fact, one is not equal
to one, because if we write out the formula one
equals one, that one is distinct from this one, so
literally, they're different ones. So if you're equating the number
one with another number one, you're actually lying to yourself.
They're not equal, they're actually different. So you're, you're you're
finding, you're finding a hidden similarity. But that hidden similarity
is not an objective fact. It's something your mind is
constructing. It's not just a given. And science also cannot
tell you which two objects are distinct. So science cannot
tell you that a lamp is distinct from a coffee
table. Or that you are distinct from the earth. Or
that a black person is distinct from a white person,
science can't tell you this. Only your mind subjectively can
tell you this. And in fact, science cannot even occur
or arise until your mind starts doing this. Your mind
has to start making distinctions long before science is invented.
You see? For you to even say that. This here,
what I'm doing is science. And that over there, what
you're doing that's pseudoscience, or that's religion, or that's fantasy
or something else already. Look what you're doing. You're creating
a distinction between science and its opposite. You're looking at
noticing a difference between science and not science. And in
fact, that's what science is. What is science science itself
is a part of reality. And for science to exist
a part of reality it also has to be distinct.
Otherwise, there's no such thing as science. So you invent
science at the very moment where you make a distinction
between science and non science. Which is first Eisley why.
And we'll get to this a little bit deeper in
a minute, which is precisely why scientists and defenders of
science are very, very touchy when their their metaphysics was
questioned, because when I questioned a scientist, metaphysics, what it
does that actually it dissolves the boundary that a scientifically
minded person has made between science, religion and everything, and
not science, basically, pseudoscience. And so what this does is
this actually threatens the very life of science, sciences life
depends upon it being a specific thing. Again, this goes
back to the earlier point that I said that to
be is to be a specific way, you cannot be
as a nonspecific thing, you have to be a specific
way. That's what your being is, that's what you are,
is whatever differences there are within you. So if I
start to remove the differences between you, and some other
thing, then literally what I'm doing is I'm killing you.
Or I'm killing that thing. If I remove the difference,
for example, between your car and every other car in
the world, if I remove all the differences, what's going
to happen is that all the cars will become one
car. And so by definition, your car will cease to
exist. But of course, this is a much bigger problem
than just with your car. Your car is peanuts, compared
to where this really leads us to. Which is the
ego, and self. What you are, is not a body,
or a creature, or ape, or a living being what
you are, and you're not a molecule, you're not a
bunch of molecules, you're not a brain, you're none of
that. What you are, is you are an identity, a
set of differences. You are different from your environment, you
have differentiated yourself. And through that differentiation, you came into
existence. You weren't born in the conventional sense that you
think of as like you came out of your mom's
vagina. That may have happened, but that did not create
you. You came about years later, only when you became
conscious of a distinction between yourself and your environment. And
the way you did that, you just said, Oh, I'm
different from everything else. And that's how you were really
born. And that's also how you're gonna die. When you
die, what will happen is the difference between what you
thought you were your identity, and your environment will collapse.
And you will merge back into the totality from which
you emerged. And so your very life depends upon you
being different from your environment, and other people. Let me
repeat that, again. Your very existence hinges on you being
distinct. If you stop being distinct, you will physically die.
That's what I'm saying. Are you getting this? This is
some heavy stuff. So now you start to realize that
this notion of identity is a very, very tricky business,
and it's much more significant to you and your mind
than you ever thought. So maybe as a kid you
you were like a part of some group identity in
school. Like maybe you were a goth kid. Maybe you
were some emo kid. Maybe you thought of yourself as
a nerd or as a jock. Or as a cheerleader
or whatever you thought yourself. You were and you you
built up your identity. And basically you spent your teenage
years and all your early 20s building up your identity.
I'm a man I'm a woman, I'm Republican, I'm a
Democrat and I'm American. I'm a Russian or I'm a
Chinese or a Muslim or I'm a Muslim or I'm
a Christian. I'm a good person, a bad person. I'm,
you know, I'm a moral. Or, you know, I'm attractive.
I'm attractive. I'm, I'm tall, I'm fat. I'm skinny. I'm
successful. I'm irresponsible. I'm lazy. I'm ugly. I'm addicted to
porn. I'm this I'm that I love video games. I
love fast food. I love pizza. I like sushi. I
like this. I hate that I love baba, baba, baba,
baba, what is all of that you are differentiating yourself
to create an identity. It's like a snowball that starts
rolling down a mountain and it gets bigger and bigger
and bigger. And it accretes more and more stuff. And
then it gains momentum. And as it gains momentum, eventually,
it gains a sense of mass and solidity until this
giant Snowball is so big, and it's rolling so fast.
And it's got such a force behind it, that it
really feels solid. This is a force to be reckoned
with. That's your ego. That's who you are. That's your
very life right there we're talking about. And now when
we're starting to talk about self actualization, changing yourself getting
some kind of new result in your relationships, in your
level of happiness, in your career, with your finances, with
your spirituality, whatever. We're talking about changing the trajectory of
that giant snowball that's rolling down the hill. And now
you can see why that's difficult to do. Because the
thing you identify with is the thing that keeps you
alive, your very life hinges upon your identity. So while
we try to create a significant change to your life,
so you can get different results. The reason you resist
it so much. The reason you go through all these
ego backlash is the reason that you refuse to listen
to the things I say, the reason that you are
lazy, the reason you don't take action, the reason that
this should goes in one ear and out the other
ear, and you keep struggling and trying and trying and
trying and nothing is working, nothing is changing. The reason
is, is because fundamentally, you don't want to change. Because
deep down, you know that change is death. To get
real change, we need identity level change, change of your
being change of who you are. That's not what you
want. You want the results of the change without changing
your identity. But unfortunately, it's precisely the shitty results you're
getting that are the result of your identity. So the
to change your shitty results in any area of life,
you got to change your identity. But of course, that's
the last thing you want to do. So that's the
catch 22 of all personal development. That's why it's difficult.
That's why nobody does it. That's why your friends don't
care about any of this stuff. That's why nobody listens
to this stuff. That's why this stuff isn't talking about
on TV or anywhere else, because nobody wants to do
it. And really everything that society sells you all the
books and cars and advertisements and all the shit they
tell you on TV and in the media, all the
intellectuals you listen to Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, blah, blah,
blah, Richard Dawkins, I don't care who it is religious
people Sudoku, what are they telling you they are? They
are, they are serving your ego to build up your
identity, because that's what sells because your ego will only
pay money for that which builds up its identity, your
ego doesn't want to pay money. For breaking itself down.
Your ego wants to live, it doesn't want to die.
So your ego is gonna run far, far away from
anything that destroys its identity. But paradoxically, that's what we're
doing here today is we're laying the groundwork for destroying
your identity. But of course, your ego is gonna be
very sneaky. It's not gonna let you get away with
it so easily. What it's going to do is going
to take everything that I'm saying. And it's going to
turn actualised.org and all these teachings into an identity building
exercise. So even though actually that org is supposed to
help you break down your identity, what your ego is
going to do is going to, it's going to flip
it on its head and it's actually going to use
it to build up your identity. You're going to build
up the identity of becoming a self actualized or someone
who's pursuing enlightenment, someone who's coming to consciousness, someone who's
a vegan or vegetarian, or this or that. And there
you go again. You see how tricky this is. That's
your life. You're fucking with your life here. And your
life is not gonna go without a fight. But nevertheless,
if you keep persisting with it, eventually you'll die. and
that will be like, and then you'll be finally happy.
And you'll realize how stupid this whole this whole game
was. Because the entire time really what you are is
you were the whole shebang, you were infinite, you were
everything, you were everything and nothing. And you were sameness
and difference. And that there is no difference between sameness
and difference. But until such time, you are going to
keep struggling and keep trying to differentiate yourself. The ego
needs this. This is why the ego creates enemies. That's
why the ego demonizes this, whether you're criticizes, that's where
the ego builds up ideologies. This is why the ego
joins groups, cults, sects, philosophies, scientific schools, you name it,
political groups, economic groups, ethnic groups, racial groups, family groups,
national groups. All of this is building the egos identity.
The ego needs to be able to say, I am
different from you. Because if I'm not different from you,
I am starting to become more and more like you
more and more and more, we're getting closer and closer
and closer until we we literally join and we become
one, I become you. And holy fuck you don't want
to become like everyone else on the planet. That's scary.
That's a lot. That's a big burden. You know, it's
a big burden to realize that you are Hitler. That
you are Donald Trump, that you are terrorists, that you
are a fundamentalist, that you are murdered, that you're a
rapist, that you're that you're everything that you've ever hated
in your life, you're all of it. That's a big,
bitter pill to swallow. See, the whole reason that you
hate in the first place is precisely because you are
denying the very thing that you are. And so the
reason that you're unhappy is because you're fundamentally in denial
about your true nature. And your true nature is infinite.
And your true nature is indiscriminate. It's all but that's
too much, that's too much for you. So what you
want rather than the see that the whole cake, the
whole cake of reality is so big and so delicious,
and so beautiful. That it's too much, you can't eat
so much fucking cake, you think you want cake. But
after you've eaten 50 slices of cake, and there's still
a million slices left to go. You're like, Man, I'm
done with cake. I'm tired. I'm sick and tired of
cake. Right? So then you draw lines, okay, 50 piece,
that's where I'm drawn line 50 pieces. That's where I'm
drawn line. And the whole challenge of life. And the
whole purpose of life is to say, Fuck it, I'm
gonna go for the whole cake, you go for the
whole cake. And then you realize how huge that is,
you realize that you couldn't have even imagined what you're
really what you're really in for until it's already too
late. But luckily, by that point that goes dead and
you realize everything is peachy. Want you to realize that
the mind works by tuning into differences in sameness is
like a lens, it can dilate and focus on whatever
it wants to see. And what does it focus on?
It's never a question of objective truth or objective difference
or sameness. It's always a question of what you select,
which differences are significant, which are insignificant, which sameness is
are significant, which are insignificant. And of course, how do
you determine that how does your mind determine that based
on who you are as an identity. So you will
select those similarities and differences which are most conducive to
your survival as the identity that you have identified yourself
to be. It's not a matter of truth. Your mind
doesn't give a fuck about truth. It cares about preserving
your identity. And it will cite all the scientific evidence
all the rationales all the justifications, all the logic, all
the religious scriptures, everything. It will muster and marshal everything
in its power to see reality as selectively as they
possibly can, such that your identity is preserved despite the
changing circumstances of the environment and And that's, that's a
struggle. That's why you're struggling in life all the time.
If your life feels like a struggle feels difficult, that's
because fundamentally, that's what you're struggling against. And because you
will lose that battle, you cannot win that battle, you
will always be lost in the end, your identity will
collapse. Because ultimately, what you are is you are the
whole. And you could only remain the part for so
long to remain the part, when you're really the whole,
that means you have to be deluding yourself constantly actively,
that you are the part. And that can only go
on for so long until finally the game ends. And
you will merge in back with the whole, because that's
the truth of what you are, you cannot be other
than what you really are, other than for a short
period of time, which is what your life amounts to.
The ego mind is terrified of deep sameness. This is
why it clings to ideology. And it clings to anything
that it identifies with. Do you know why a white
supremacist or a racist hates immigrants? You might think, well,
Leo, that's because he sees immigrants as different than him.
That's why he hates them. Role, precisely the opposite. The
reason that xenophobia exists, is because people are afraid of
the deep similarity that they have been denying their entire
life. So racists hate immigrants, or people of different color.
Because deep down actually, the truth is that we're all
the same. And that's what the racist doesn't want to
admit. And he's in denial about it. And of course,
he hears me saying this to him, he will of
course, deny it as well, and accuse me of being
deluded. But that's just a defense mechanism that he has,
from admitting that actually, we're all the same. Because you
see, a racist or white supremacist as someone who's built
his identity, on being a certain ethnicity. And he's built
this identity so much that now it's a deep part
of him. So now to tell him that actually, he's
the same as a black person, or brown person or
Chinese person or either chimpanzee or whatever. This is going
to threaten his identity, it's going to feel very painful.
He's not going to be conscious of the fact that
is threatening his identity, he's just going to react in
a knee jerk way, with anger, with violence, with fear,
with denials, with criticism with blaming with scapegoating, and so
forth, which is why very conscious people who become very
grounded in their metaphysical identity. They don't, they don't care.
They don't care about other races, other races don't threaten
them, they don't get angry, they don't get fearful of
them. Or any of this kind of stuff. They are
unfazed by this stuff. Because their identity transcends all of
that. And that's ultimately what you should be working for.
The mistake that xenophobic people make is that they double
down on their xenophobia. And they try to justify and
rationalize it and say stuff like, oh, but but but
those people have done IQ tests. And you know, black
people have a lower IQ than white people. It's proven
ilio it's proven science. Or they will cite other kinds
of studies and other kinds of evidence, it doesn't matter.
The ego will use any studies or any evidence or
any science to justify whatever the fuck it wants. The
ego doesn't play fair. It doesn't care about the truth.
It doesn't care about being honest. It's not honest with
other people. It's not even honest with itself. The ego
lies to itself first and foremost. The ego is built
upon lies, self lies, self deceptions. That's what you are.
That's the very mechanism by which you have come into
existence. So it's a sunk cost. Bias. You see, I
mean, you have sunk so much energy into defending your
current identity, that you will not admit that it's a
lie. That's the last thing you want to admit. So
what you have to do is you have to come
up with justifications and further lies, to explain why what
I'm saying isn't true. And why what you believe all
the lies that you believe their whole life, that they
were actually not wise but real. So you gotta you
gotta keep playing the line game. That's the prom with
lies, you start lying, gotta keep lying, keep lying, keep
lying to sustain the lies. The ego mind does not
care about truth. If the ego wants to see difference,
it will see difference where there isn't. And if the
ego wants to see sameness, it will see sameness, where
there isn't one or rather, the reason they can do
that is because sameness, and difference are in the same
place. They're always there. At the same time, everywhere. Everything
is different, and everything is the same. And that's why
the ego can cherry pick whatever the fuck it wants.
Whatever it is, is most self serving. Look, look at
this happening. Look at this happening in the news. Look
at what's happening with Donald Trump. Look at this happening
with politicians, with people on TV, your favorite speakers, your
favorite scientists, your favorite, whoever, it isn't matter. They're all
playing this game. So what it is, it's the game
of life. This is what business is built on. marketing,
advertising, whole society, culture, religion, economics. Everything, everything socially constructed,
is based upon this fundamental principle of helping you to
maintain your identity, both individually and collectively. Remember, you have
an individual identity, you also have a collective identity. Those
people who fancied themselves as individualist like those libertarians, maybe
some of those Jordan Peterson followers who fancy themselves as,
oh, I defend free speech and individualism. And I follow
an iron Rand and I'm an individualist. I mean, it's
the most preposterous thing, because of course, as you're saying
that what you're doing is you're actually building your libertarian
ideology, which is your collective identity, your collective ego, and
then these people complain about identity politics. The entire right
wing is pure identity politics, that's all it is. That's
all libertarianism is its identity, Pa has nothing to do
with truth has nothing to do with reality has nothing
to do with improving society. It's pure identity politics. That's
what it is. It's a defense of identity. Why do
people defend guns and an abortion? And it's not because
I like you might be saying, Leo Oh, why are
you railing against the Conservatives here but I mean, the
liberals do it too. But the Liberals are, are more
conscious of it than conservatives are. Which is not to
say liberals can't do stupid things. They can't. They can,
they can be diluted, they can be very diluted, they
cannot come up with very bad policies. There's far higher
to go beyond liberalism. But um, but for conservatives, mostly,
if they defend an idea, all they're doing is they're
they're just defending an identity. That's all it is. That's
why Republican politicians, they don't they don't talk about policy.
Republicans don't care about policy. The Republican base doesn't care
about policy. They don't care about the economy, health care,
they don't care about the spirit. They don't seriously study,
like how to improve the health care system in this
country or the school system. No. What they're doing is
they're they're, they're defending their identity. Republican politics is all
about identity. You know, are you a patriot? Are you
a true American? Are you a conservative? Are you are
you fighting for freedom? Are you sticking sticking it to
the social justice warriors and the snowflakes and, and the
liberals? If you are, then you're part of the identity.
And life is good, you feel good, you feel happy?
And so to rally up the base, what does Trump
do Trump just Trump Trump just pushes that identity politics
button all the time, just pushes it all the time.
That's what all Trump is doing, right? He doesn't really
know consciously that he's doing it. He's just doing it
out of instinct. I'm telling you what he's doing because
I've studied this stuff very deeply, in a way that
he hasn't but he that's how he's usually pushing that
button. And intuitively, he understands that's what's actually going to
get people riled up. And that's what good sales marketing
is. It's all about riling up people's emotions. It's not
about truth. Nobody buys anything for truth. Nobody votes for
politicians based on truth. They vote for them based on
Whether those people are able to push their their most
base psychological needs because most people the majority of society
is operating at the at the bottom third of Maslow's
hierarchy of needs, right. So you can't motivate the majority
of society by appealing to their higher interest, to love
to truth to beauty to creativity to, to spirituality to
kind of it doesn't work, because most people aren't there
yet. Maybe in 1000 years, they'll be there but right
now they're at the bottom. The bottom is what sex
food, partying entertainment, identity politics, ethnocentrism. Yeah, that's it. So
that's what you hit if you want to win. Pretty
interesting that works. Why am I telling you all this?
Well, we live in a time of seeing differences. A
lot of people now are emphasizing differences. The entire materialist
paradigm emphasizes differences. It's built upon that, including science business,
and basically all of Western society is built upon the
materialist paradigm at every level. So in school, the tissue
analysis and university you're analyzing, you're using the reason you're
using your left brain, your left brain, this leads to
reductionism, atomism, and fragmentation. Everything is fragmented, broken down to
little pieces. That large unity that reality is, is all
fragmented. That's the state that we find ourselves in today.
And because of this, we have all the crazy stuff
happening in our politics, in the media, and everywhere around
the world violence, evil suffering, all of this comes from
fragmentation, fundamentally, the ego, otherwise known as the devil, the
devil uses fragmentation to achieve his aims, why does the
devil do this? What is the devil? The devil is
that which separated itself from God, the devil is the
fallen angel. See, a true Angel understands that the angel
and God are really one. But an angel who is
arrogant and deny that it is God hates God starts
to criticize God deny the God that God exists. What
the devil does is the devil fragments. And the devil
depends upon fragmentation because that's ultimately what the devil is
very existence is the devil's body is made into a
fragment of God. So of course, if the devil wants
to stay separate from God, God will allow it as
long as the devil keeps insisting on fragmentation, and the
only way fragmentation can happen is through delusion, through lack
of consciousness. So the devil has to limit its own
consciousness to maintain its devilry. And so that's what the
ego mind fundamentally does. That's what you are, you aren't
the devil, the devil is not some, some red guy
with a tail and with horn the devil is you?
The fragmentation that you create. It's the demonizing the scapegoating,
the denying the hatred, the criticism, the crusading, the separation
of you against other groups, the splintering the the sex
that you create, it's the not sex, sex. Make sure
you hear me right. It's all the cherry picking that
you do. It's all the differences in sameness that you
see which serve your identity, rather than the truth, and
of course, God is the truth. Eventually, the the devil
will lose the battle and the devil will merge back
into God, but not without a good long battle. You
know, they say Barack Hussein Obama, Barack Hussein, so people
who say Barack Hussein Obama, what are they doing? They're
emphasizing the Hussein. Why are they doing that? Because they
don't want to acknowledge the sameness between Barack Obama and
themselves. They need to differentiate. So they're going to cherry
pick their mind is going to go out there and
cherry pick every single difference between themselves and Barack Obama
so they can demonize Obama and think of themselves as
superior righteous. By the way, this is not something exclusive.
I'm I'm don't Don't get the wrong idea here that
I'm just saying this as though like from a liberal
position to defend liberalism. No, not at all. Liberals definitely
do this as well. Liberals also love to demonize Republicans
I love to demonize corporations love to demonize Trump, love
to compare Trump to knots, Nazism to Hitler and so
forth. So, I'm saying this as a general characteristic of
every human mind, it doesn't matter whether you're American or
Republican or Democrat, and Iranian and Iraqi, you know, a
European, a Scandinavian, an African, it doesn't matter who you
are, you're doing this. That is one of the deep
sameness is that we all have is that we're all
doing this all the time. The only question is, how
conscious are you of the process, and the more conscious
you become of the process, the less you will do
it. So while materialism emphasizes fragmentation, and seeing differences, spirituality
is the opposite movement. True spirituality is an emphasis of
deep sameness. And this is done through the right hemisphere,
the right hemisphere responsible for intuition, integration, consciousness and wisdom.
It's taking all the fragments that materialism has left on
the floor, and piecing them back together, which is what
actualize that org is helping you to try to do
if you notice, in all my episodes, what I'm really
stressing, as I'm stressing the deep sameness is between a
bunch of different topics, between spiritual schools, various religions, between
religion and science, between different emotions between different meditation techniques,
whatever we're talking about, I'm trying to show you the
deep sinuses, precisely because the rest of society has already
filled your mind with all the fragments and all the
differences. What do I mean by deep sameness? I say
deep sameness, as opposed to surface sameness. The ego tends
to like to use surface sameness, but avoid deep sameness.
So, it's not only the ego just focuses on differences,
but the ego also focuses on surface sameness says, between
things, the sameness of the appearances, whereas deep sameness is,
is penetrating through to the profound similar essence behind all
the appearances. And that's what intelligence and genius are. You
want to know what makes a genius. A genius is
someone who is able to see deep sameness, where other
people only see differences and surface similarities. By surface similarities,
what I mean is similarities that that, that the ego
deliberately uses to try to create an identity for itself.
So for example. Atheists create an identity for themselves by
saying that all religion is delusion. So there, they think
the atheist thinks that he's come up with some brilliant
genius insight, that all all religion is delusion, and I'm
above that. But actually, what he did is he fell
into a surface sameness, the similarity of religions is actually,
on the surface, at least the way that the atheist
thinks about it, there actually is a deep similarity between
religions. But that's the opposite of what the atheist believes.
It's actually enlightenment, awakening God. But the atheist denies this,
because he's only looking at the surface similarities, the delusion.
Or, for example, when conservatives called all liberal social justice
warriors and Marxists, which is popular these days, that's a
that's what I would call a surface similarity. See, they're
lumping all of that together. And why are they doing
that they're lumping it together such that now that is
going to be distinct from what I am as a
conservative wishes. I'm not that I'm an anti social justice
warrior. I'm an anti Marxist. I'm a capitalist, I'm a
libertarian, I'm a freedom fighter, whatever, you fancy yourself as
a conservative, however, you justify that to yourself. So, deep
sameness is opposed to that. Deep sameness is not about
using sameness to try to build your egoic identity. Deep
sameness is about actually dissolving your going identity into your
ultimate true identity as everything. Wisdom comes with deep sameness.
Why As people are able to see the date, the
deep sameness between phenomenon between various appearances. What are some
examples of what I mean by deep sameness, for example,
I talked about paradigms and paradigm lock, that is present
within religion and also within science. And I actually draw
sameness. For me, unlike, for example, someone like Sam Harris,
who's going to emphasize the difference between science and religion,
I actually do the opposite. Because see, what he's doing
there is he's actually he's drawing up a very shallow
phony distinction between religion and science is actually much more
profound and much more useful to help to draw out
the, the sameness between religion and science. And what we
mean by that is that both are dogmatic. Both are
ideological. Both are sneaking into metaphysics without realizing that they're
doing so both are locked into a certain paradigm, without
realizing that they're locked into that paradigm. That's a sameness,
that's a very profound sameness, which is not easy to
see which is lost on most people. And if you
can see the same as and be aware of it
and be conscious of it at all times, that's going
to produce enormous growth in you and wisdom, takes genius
to see that. Another example of deep sadness is to
start to understand where all the suffering in the world
comes from, and that it comes from selfishness to draw
that connection between all the suffering you've ever had in
your life, and selfishness, and all the evils in the
world war and violence and corruption and, and theft, and
murder, and all this sort of stuff, to realize that
all of that comes from the selfishness, which is there
present within you and present within all people, to see
that that's a deep sameness. And that's not easy to
see, takes genius to see that. To realize that all
living beings have equal worth. And that no living being
is has more value or worth more than any other
living being. That is the deep sameness, which is lost
on most people. So if you want to really be
intelligent, don't bother taking IQ tests. Don't bother reading textbooks.
What you need to do is you need to develop
your capacity to see deep sameness. Douglas Hofstadter has an
interesting theory that they're all thinking is done using analogies.
And while I think that Douglas Hofstadter is ultimately wrong
in that, all thinking is not done via analogies, because
I can think of, well, I can think about going
to eat a sandwich, and that has nothing to do
with analogies. But Douglas Hofstadter, point though, is still important.
And his point is that the most creative thinkers that
have existed in mankind, whether they were philosophers, or mystics,
sages, or even visionary scientists like Einstein, Newton, liveness, Galileo,
Leonardo da Vinci, all these people their wisdom, and intelligence
was based upon their ability to make analogies between unlike
things. For example, the story about noon, I don't even
know if the story true, but it's, it makes a
good example, the story of Newton sitting sitting under the
apple tree, the apple falling on his head or whatever.
And then him making the analogous connection of like, wait
a minute, the apple fell on my head. That means
there's a force pulling the apple to my head. But
then he looks at the moon and he sees all
that means there's also maybe a force pulling on the
moon, that means the moon is also falling towards the
earth. Oh, that's a deep, profound fucking similarity. And that's
how gravity was admitted. Or so the story goes, who
knows that that's how it actually happened. Probably not. Many
of these stories are apocryphal and you know, spruced up
to make it look more interesting. But anyway, I mean,
you if you go look at some of Douglas Hofstadter
books and work, he has several books, where he just
talks about many, many, many, he just pummeled you with
examples of how analogies are used within science and within
intellectual disciplines to develop deep insights about reality in nature,
because that's what's happening. People are looking for deep sameness
and the way you do that is through analogies, sometimes
very simple analogies like Apple Moon another example where this
This applies for example, with lessons in history. If you
want to be a good student of history, and you
want to be able to apply history, to the present
into the future, you need to be able to draw
analogies between this similar events, something might have happened within
Roman history, Greek history, or Chinese history, if you're a
really good student, and you're also intelligent, in that you
can see deep sameness is, then you will be able
to see Aha, so what the Emperor did in China
back in 1700, is very similar to what our president
is doing here today. I'm just making this stuff up.
But you know, something like that, you can draw those
connections. And that's what actually makes you intelligent. Another example
would be integrating all of religion, to understand how all
of religion interconnects with itself requires seeing details. And the
ultimate deep sameness, like I said, is that everything is
consciousness. There are no two objects in existence, which are
not occurring right now in your consciousness. Think of any
two objects, and you will realize they're occurring within your
consciousness, they are made out of consciousness, they are consciousness,
everything is consciousness. That lamp is better consciousness, that cat
is made of consciousness, that treatment of consciousness, your body
is made of consciousness, your brain is made of consciousness,
you are made of consciousness. The floor, you're standing on
it then of consciousness, signs made of consciousness, Isaac Newton
was man of consciousness. Albert Einstein was made of consciousness,
your reason and rationality is made of consciousness. They reduce.
That's the second half of the equation. You need both.
What consciousness is, is it's all the differences that are
possible, infinite differences. And since everything is different, that makes
it all the same. The deepest sameness is to realize
that all of reality is alive and intelligent. Everything look
around you everything around you. Everything in your room is
intelligent. Everything is alive. Intelligence and aliveness is not something
that human beings possess, or that creatures possess is the
quality of the universe itself. And which finally brings us
to love and compassion. True love, unconditional love comes from
seeing deep sameness. Whereas hatred comes from emphasizing differences between
things. But see, I'm not trying to demonize make sure
you don't make this fun. I'm not demonizing differences, you
can see differences because technically everything is different. So seeing
differences is not bad. What is a problem is when
you make an identity out of your particular set of
differences, and then you need to defend it, and to
defend it, of course, then that's where hatred comes in.
When your identity isn't small, but it is big. And
in fact, when your identity becomes infinite, your love will
become infinite. So your capacity to love is directly proportional
to how big your identity is. You want infinite love.
You need infinite identity. That's why fundamentalist religious people are
not capable of love and compassion. Have you wondered why
religious people are some of the most violent and vicious
and unloving people in the world, despite the fact that
all their holy books teach them to be more loving?
It's because they can't. Because you can't get there through
belief. You can't just believe that you're going to be
like Christ, and all loving, while at the same time
maintain the little itty bitty identity. You need to actually
develop the identity of Christ, which means you need an
infinite identity. If you have an infinite identity, love and
compassion come naturally and easily. And you don't need to
sell flagellate, or go to church and pray or, you
know, read holy books, to be a good human being.
For someone with an infinite identity Being a good human
being is just spontaneous. The mistake that religion makes is
that religion what it does is it tries to teach
you how to ape enlightened beings. So they look at
Christ or the Buddha, and they say, Oh, look, look
at how wonderful this person was in the world. Without
realizing that the reason this person was wonderful in the
world, was because they had an infinite identity, they surpassed
all they let go of all they're clinging to every
possible difference. And they realized the same as the very
thing. And from that naturally came all the love and
the joy and all the magnificent qualities that you want
for yourself all to happiness, and so forth. But now,
religion just tries to teach that to you through dogma
and beliefs. And you can't do that. Because doggone beliefs
just build your identity even more. So it has the
opposite effect. So the most religious people actually become the
ones who are the guiltiest, who hate the most, who
are the most bitter inside who are the most xenophobic,
the most ethnocentric, the most racist, the most violent, the
most vicious, do the most torture and, and so on
and so forth. All right, let's pause right here for
a quick intermission, I need a break. But we're still
not done. There's a lot more to be said. So
stay right there. All right, let's talk about applications of
this topic of sameness and difference. I want to show
you just how much stuff there is here to work
with and where you can apply this and basically, almost
any human fields and domains of study. And it's very
broad in terms of its application. And, as you should,
of course, expect, it would be that way, if what
we're talking about here is sort of the very nature
of existence itself being sadnesses and differences. So first of
all historical analysis. In order to do proper historical analysis,
it's all about making differences or distinctions between things, and
also bringing things together and finding deep similarities and then
applying those to the future or to the present. Also
medicine, can you see how in medicine, it's extremely important
to be really good at using your mind to both
make distinctions and find differences, but also make deep interconnections
and find the same bonuses between, let's say, your patients,
symptoms, or illnesses, or the spread of diseases or any
kind of research that's being done within the medical field.
Speaking of research, we've got science, science is a huge
can of worms, there's so much that we can say
about science, and how science is limiting itself by not
deeply studying the essence of what reality is the metaphysical
nature of reality, being sameness as in differences. See, science,
generally, generally treats reality as though it's an objective external
object that can be studied in an objective manner. And
that really all you're doing is you're finding the differences
in similarities that are just they're kind of given to
you, and you're just discovering them. And science isn't that
good at seeing how the human mind plays a role
in constructing various models and category schemes. And in this
way, science lacks self reflection. It lacks the ability to
observe itself with conscious awareness to see how it's creating
these categories, how it's slicing up and carving reality. And
therefore science likes to say that what it's doing is
just a simple objective process, when in fact, that's not
the case at all. And so by denying the subjectivity
which, which is inherent in science, science is limiting itself.
And it's overlooking important discoveries, which will be made in
the future. And of course, one of the key problems
with science we have today is that science is fragmented.
It lacks integration. It lacks holistic perspectives. So some of
the most important work that's going to be done in
science over the next 100 years is going to be
done at the intersection of various disciplines. So over the
last two or 300 years, science has fragmented itself more
and more and more. So you have a lot of
very intelligent scientists and academics, sitting around in universities and
in laboratories around the world, but they are hyper hyper
specialized, such that they're not even biologists or physicists. They're
much more deeply specialized in that they're like a microbiologist
who studies evolution in fruit flies, have one particular kind
of species or it's a physicist who studies the movements
of electrons in one particular type of substance like cold
liquids, right or some plasma. And that's all they know
is they know that one thing. But the problem with
that is, is that when you really want to understand
life and reality and your place, within reality, what you
need is you need the ultimate big picture. And you
can't get that by hyper specializing into some technical field.
And so what's going to have to happen with science
going forward in next 100 years, most of the big
breakthroughs and all the really interesting discoveries are going to
happen now with people who are able to straddle multiple
fields. So it's someone who's going to come in there
and integrate, find a way to integrate biology and psychology,
or sociology and chemistry, or some other you know, thing.
Bridging multiple disciplines, not just two, sometimes three, sometimes four
disciplines, and coming up with an integrated holistic model or
picture of what's really going on, that's going to be
necessary. And so if you're a budding young scientist, and
you're looking for a research field for yourself, what I
recommend for you is don't just do what your professors
tell you to do, don't go into their little box,
you got to think outside the box, you got to
be an integrator, not a fragment, er, because our science
right now has is sort of starting to sort of
reach the limits of fragmentation. There's only so much you
can do with that. And we've been doing a good
job last couple 100 years, fragmenting and analyzing reality to
death. But what we're really lacking is in integration, seeing
those deep same misses, that's where the really groundbreaking stuff
is gonna happen. Of course, science, just like religion, fragments
itself into various schools of thought, various schools within physics,
various schools, within biology, within chemistry, within psychology, within sociology,
and so forth. And, and these schools, they go to
war with each other. They're ideological, just like religious sects
are, they have their own premises, they have their own
biases, of course, they fight to defend the school, they
have a collective ego. And by school, by the way,
I don't mean, like, a university, I mean, a scientific
school like, for example, behaviorism, or you consider psychoanalysis, even
science, I mean, there's a lot of bunkin in psychoanalysis,
but you can call that a school, or maybe string
theory. String theorists might be like a sub school within
quantum mechanics or within theoretical physics, you know, you have
various kinds of schools of scientific thought. And what what
defines a school is their assumptions, metaphysical epistemic assumptions, and
so forth. And the procedures and methods that they use.
And so yeah, so these schools, they have egos and
they fight with each other. And wouldn't it be nice
to be able to understand that rather than just participating
in these scholastic battles that have been happening for hundreds
of years, and they'll they'll keep happening for hundreds of
years more. And it's easy to get sucked into, that
doesn't matter if you're a really intelligent academic or scientist,
you're still going to fall into these traps. And you're
still going to fail to see how sameness and difference
plays a role in you becoming ideological sucked into these
debates and games. How about application within the legal system?
What is the legal system, but adjudication of various sameness
as in differences? That's what justices, Supreme Court justices, various
judges all around the country, and all around the world
are doing all the time, they're faced with the tough
job of of getting particular situations showing up in their
courtroom, or whether it's lawyers that are arguing for various
things, what are they doing when they're arguing? They're drawing
similarities or making differences? So if I'm trying to defend
my client who's a murderer or accused of murder, then
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna say, Well, really,
it's not the same as murder, what he did was
different. It's really different. And I'll cite excuses and reasons
and rationale for why it's different. And then conversely, if
I'm, if I'm the one who's prosecuting this murder, then
I'll say no, it actually is murder. It's just this
it's exactly the same as all the other murders. And
I'll present evidence and this is this to, to make
my arguments. And that's that's what crime and law, the
whole legal system is all about this. Justice is all
about this. What is justice about? It's about looking at
a situation and telling yourself well, to correct this wrong
to make this just then it would have to be
like this. It would have to be the same Amos,
this situation or This is unjust because it's different from
that situation. So you're making these sorts of comparisons. And
who's doing that? You of course, your ego is doing
it. And then of course, it's going to pick the
arguments that that skew the deck in its favor. So
this whole notion of fairness is a very tricky notions
very egoic notion. People love to act like they're victims,
like they're being treated unfairly. And of course, that's mostly
all ego. But that's coming from but then of course,
the mind comes in and starts to justify all that
stuff with with excuses and reasons and scientific facts and
data to build a strong case. That's basically what lawyers
are about. And your own mind is just like a
lawyer. What does the lawyer do? A lawyer argues, without
any moral qualms, or any consideration for truth on behalf
of the defense of his client. And that's exactly what
the left hemisphere of your mind is constantly doing, which
is why reason cannot be trusted. for discovering truth. The
domain of law enforcement, we have a lot of discussions
these days and societies about well as law enforcement truly
fair for different people. And for some people, it seems
like it's the same. And for some people, it seems
like it's very different, depending on your skin color, or
your ethnicity, or the language that you speak, or how
much money you make, what what social status, what class
you're in. How about the application in the domain of
politics, politics is all about sameness and differences. That's fundamentally
what politics is about. All politics is basically identity politics.
Politics is about fighting for your egos agenda, your individual
agenda, but also the collective agenda that you've built up,
even if you're fighting for politics that are supposedly, for
the good of all of mankind. Like a lot of
liberals would like to say, well, Leo, I'm for universal
health care, and I'm for universal rights. And I'm for
this and that, how can that be ego, that's not
ego, that's the opposite of ego. But of course, you've
built up an ego or identity around the fact that
you are this self sacrificing fair, just humanist, social justice
warrior type who fights to defend the downtrodden. And so
this has become your identity, which is why you're very
passionate about it. And which is why you get triggered
a lot by not getting your way. What is civil
rights, the whole Civil Rights Movement was basically about correcting
and shaping and changing cultural notions of difference and sameness.
That civil rights, that's what desegregation was about. And you
notice how much resistance there was to that. And really,
basically, it's still happening today, there's still a lot of
resistance to it basically, still today. So you have to
understand that your notions of sameness and difference, they don't
just come from you, and from your own personal ego,
as though you invented it. Actually, you're not that clever.
Most of your notions of sameness and difference. They came
from your culture and your society. You were programmed with
them. And now all you do is you run around
like a robot playing that programming. So if your parents
told you that black people and white people should be
separate, because one of them is inferior, one of them
is superior, that's what you're going to feel is correct,
you're going to feel like black and white people really
are different. And that's what you're going to spend your
whole life defending. And likewise, if your parents were hippy
liberals, and they taught you that you should love all
all of God's creatures equally, and that nobody is superior
to anybody else, and that men and women are equal
and all this, then that's what you're going to believe.
And you're going to defend that for the rest of
your life. Not because it's actually true, that, that all
people are the same. But because that's just what you're
comfortable with. You picked it up from your culture. So
you need to get good at not only becoming more
conscious of your own notions of sameness and difference in
how your mind is, is always cherry picking stuff. Of
course it is. But you also have to be very
conscious about how your culture is doing that too. And
how that is very arbitrary, and also needs to change.
And a lot of people have problems with this is
why we have the culture wars. What are the culture
wars all about? The war on Christmas and the people
who people who complain about the war on Christmas people
who say that there is no war on Christmas Eve
blah, blah, blah. And I mean, these culture wars go
on and on and on and all these different areas.
What is this about? This is all about how are
we going to draw the distinctions. And of course, every
part of the culture wants to draw these distinctions, and
similarities and differences in its own way, which is going
to favor its group. And it's going to favor the
individual ego. That's what culture wars are about. You're defending
identities. Or you've got people who feel like they've had
identities that were subjugated for a long time and treated
unfairly. And now what they want is they want a
more equal decent distribution. And so now they're also fighting
for from a position of ego, because they're fighting to
get certain rights that they were denied. Now, of course,
they're gonna justify it as well, I'm fighting for the
good of mankind, or for the good of my race
for the good of my ethnicity for equality. But why
do you really want equality, the only reason you want
equality, love equality, care about equality, is because it serves
your agenda, it serves your survival, that's the only reason.
If equality actually hindered your ability to survive, you wouldn't
like it very much, you'd have to really go against
the grain to like equality, when it would lead to
your own death, or to the death of your children,
or to the poverty of your family. See, the Gender
Wars, say same kind of thing. We've got the feminist
movements in various subgroups, and feminist movements who fight with
each other. But then, of course, now we've got the
men's rights movements who fight back with the feminist movements,
this is going back and forth. And of course, these
feminists and anti feminists and men's rights and the red
pill movement, the MGTOW, movement, the pickup stuff, the Jordan
Peterson, install stuff, all of this, it's all about trying
to draw sameness in differences in a favorable manner, which
will advance the egoic agenda of, of the people who
are participating in these wars. The reason these wars go
on, and the reason people get so animated and passionate
about it, and build entire careers around talking about it,
is because identity is what everybody cares about most. If
you're pissed off about something, if you're angry about something,
if you don't like something, almost anything, if you have
a problem in the world, and you probably don't care
what problem it is, the only reason you have a
problem with it is guess why? Because it threatens your
identity. That's it. If your identity was universal, if you
weren't identified with a particular gender, a particular race, a
particular way of being the particular family, that you're part
of the particular country, that you're a part of the
human species and all of that, if you were literally,
if you didn't care how you were to the point
where you allowed yourself to die, because you didn't care,
you didn't even make a distinction between living and nonliving.
Because to you it didn't matter. Then would you have
any problems at all? No, of course, not. The only
reason you have a problem with anything, is because it
threatens the way you think you should be. The difference,
or the difference that you are, which separates you from
your environment. And so you're gonna go to war to
defend that. And that's what people do. And that's why
they get so passionate about it. It's got nothing to
do with truth. It's got nothing to do with reason.
So I've got nothing to do with logic. It's not
got nothing to do with science. But all of those
things will be marshaled, of course, and front and center,
right, because you're not going to fight in identity war
over gender, or culture, or civil rights, or politics, or
justice or, or science or anything. You're not going to
fight this war. If if you're not attached to some
position, and the reason you're attached to this position is
because it's a part of your identity. That's why you're
passionate about it. You need it to come out some
particular way. Another area of application here is religion and
spirituality. There's a lot of religious conflict that goes around
on around the world. And it's gone on for 1000s
of years and it will continue to go on for
1000s of years people killing each other, abusing each other
demonizing each other, criticizing each other, debating each other, arguing
with each other, splitting off into sects forming various groups,
yada yada yada conspiring against each other. What does all
of this this is all about. For argumentation. It's all
about people trying to draw distinctions and then create an
identity, using their religion because religion and spirituality is a
huge component of one's identity. And even if you're not
religious or spiritual, even if you think your name is
atheist, that's, that's part of your identity. See, the mistake
that religion that atheists make is that they, they think
that oh, well, atheism is not a religion. Leo don't
don't mix atheism in with religion and spirituality, it's, it's
the opposite of that. It's the default state. Actually, no,
you've made an identity out of your, your atheism, or
agnosticism, or whatever else, which is why you get triggered
by religion, spirituality, or, or whatever. That's the only reason
because you've made an identity out of it. See, the
problem with religion isn't really the content of religion. The
problem is that people make an identity out of it.
But you know what, that's not exclusive to religion. That's
also happening within politics, within economics, within science, with atheism,
with rationalism, with materialism with a bunch of other stuff.
The common denominator is not the content of your beliefs,
it's that you hold certain positions, and you don't want
to give them up. And so of course, that's why
we have 1000s of various sects of religion and spirituality
all around the world. And all of these sects basically
hate each other, demonize each other, fight with each other,
don't understand each other almost at all. Because they don't
have an understanding of the relativity of sameness and difference,
they cling to what they think is different between them
and some neighboring sect. And then they go to war
with each other over that, whether it's physical war, or
intellectual war, doesn't really matter. Another area of application is
conflict negotiation, basically, was in any conflict. The reason there's
a conflict is because people are not, or the parties
are not able to see the situation from the other
person's point of view. That's largely what contributes to conflict.
And so to be able to negotiate these various conflicts,
whether they're religious conflicts, or political ones, or whatever. It
boils down to helping people to see how they are
using their own mind to construct these same misses and
differences in ways that are favorable to them. Once you
start to see that, then you start to let go
of your positions, you're not attached to it anymore, and
then you let go of the conflict. How about in
relationships, in your intimate relationship, for example, you might have
various problems, simply because of the way you're using your
mind to look at differences or sameness is an and
the situation can be resolved just by getting you to
change your perspective. Like, maybe you have a girlfriend, and
you're not happy, because you think that all, she and
I are so different. We can't get along, she's always
doing this thing there. And I'm always doing this thing
here. And we're so different, blah, blah, blah, blah. But
that's because your mind is is focusing on those differences.
You could also conversely, train your mind to focus on
the similarities that you do have to emphasize those and
to let go of the differences. See the deeper similarities
between the two and that could actually make your relationship
work. And see the problem is that if you're using
your mind improperly to be always nitpicking at the differences
of things, that means that the current relationship you're in,
you're going to nitpick the differences until you reach the
point where you're just going to get so fed up,
you're gonna say, I fucking fuck this, I'm leaving this
relationship. We're two different, we don't get along. And then
so you go to the next relationship, but guess what
your mind comes with you. Your same as in different
filters, they don't change, they come with you, because they're
a part of who you are. And you don't want
to give those up. So in your next relationship, you're
gonna do the same thing, you're gonna nitpick, bla, bla,
bla, bla, bla, and then of course, you're gonna, in
the end, get fed up, you're gonna blame the other
person, and then leave and then go to the next
one. And you're going to keep doing this until you
wake up and you realize, oh, it's me, it's my
mind. It's the filters that I have. I gotta learn
how to use my mind differently. And then you'll see,
oh, shit, all those relationships that I thought were so
bad that I left, I could have actually salvaged all
those. If I was just using my mind properly. Even
as an area of application, let me just point out
to you even finding, for example, new music that you
like, or new movies that you like, or new books
that you like, or new teachers and gurus that you
would resonate with. What is that? Oh, What you looking
for sameness is in between differences. And there are in
fact, many music services available online today, who will do
this job for you, they have various algorithms or editors
who try to create music lists for you such that
whatever music list you currently have, they will try to
match you up with some other music list, which is
very similar to this kind of music that you like,
whether it's techno or pop, or dance or hip hop,
or whatever you like. And the success of their entire
business depends upon their algorithms or their editors, being able
to properly match up the sinuses or differences. The the
music app, Shazam, you press that button on that app,
and it just listens to some music that's playing at
a restaurant or whatever, they're faiz, that music for you
in a couple of seconds. That's a pretty amazing technology.
But what is that technology doing? It's filtering out all
the noise, all the differences, because, you know, if you're
listening to music, and in a noisy restaurant, that music
is different than the actual original song. So this program
has to somehow use some fancy algorithms to remove all
the noise and match things up such that it says,
oh, yeah, this is a match. And these are actually
the same, when in fact, they are technically different. You
see, so in a sense, what scientists have had to
do in order to create smart technology, or like facial
recognition, technology on your smartphone, you press the button, and
it recognizes your face. And that technology is getting better
every day. It's still pretty crude, though, is what they
had to do is they have to kind of actually
build in a fudging factor. Because when I take a
photograph of your face, every photograph is going to be
different. So I need to create some kind of algorithm
which is going to fudge the truth and actually say,
wait a minute, that first photograph, and the second photograph,
they're actually the same. It's the same person. The mistake
that people make is they think, well, the smartphone really
is tracking the same person. And what what I'm telling
you is that, no, that's your mind fudging things. Your
smartphone is not tracking the same person, your smartphone is,
is tracking stuff phenomena. There's no law in the universe
that says that you are you. Only you say that
you're you. And therefore by saying that you're you, and
believing it, you become you. And so you are born.
That are that's how identity happens. Identity is not found
out in the world. Identity is what you create to
be. And then of course, we're building machines that are
also going to be capable of doing that. getting better
and better at that. Keeping track of these similarities and
putting in these fudge factors, and so forth. What I
want you to really understand is that there's no like
scientific fact of your identity out there somewhere in the
universe. See, you construct it, like a story. And because
you construct it, you can also deconstruct it. And only
if you fully deconstruct it, will you possibly ever become
aware of what your identity is, without any constructions? What
is your identity without any kinds of stuff added on
to it? What were you before that giant snowball? Even
started rolling? What was that? And that's a pretty radical
thing to discover. Let me also point out specifically applications
of sameness and differences. With respect to self actualization. For
self actualization, you need to really get good at seeing
the deep sinuses. For example, when it comes to integrating
all spiritual schools, and understanding what spirituality and religion really
are, and why they originated in the first place, for
that you need to be able to see deep, deep,
deep sameness. And this is something that I see very
few people are able to do because they get too
stuck on the differences. So you'll have someone like Sam
Harris, who comes up there's as well but Islaam is
is actually really different from Christianity and from Buddhism. Because
in the Koran they say, bla bla bla, bla, bla
bla, and this and violence and that and, and so
because of this blah, blah, blah and because of this
all the violence in this Yeah, if you want, you
can definitely use your mind to see that in the
Koran. On the other hand, you can also look at
the Quran and see the deep similarities between the Quran,
the Bible, and Hinduism and various Buddhist texts, sutras. And
actually, you would be more right, by seeing the same
nurses than the differences. Because you know what, there's differences
all the time between everything. And it's very easy to
get lost in the differences, just the way that Sam
Harris, Sam Harris doesn't the way he, he, he gets
all of his his audience members lost as well, because
they start to believe it, and then there'll they're lost
in all the differences. As you get lost in the
differences, you lose the sight of the deep, deep, deep
similarities, and also you develop hostility. And in the case
of Sam Harris, he's stoking up xenophobia, or Islamophobia in
this case. And then, and then people can't even open
their mind to a teaching like what I teach. Because
what I teach is, is radically looking at the deep
similarities between things. And when I even bring up the
idea that Islam could be similar to Buddhism or to
Christianity, people balk at that idea. Because already their minds
have been filled by the media and folks like Sam
Harris, and others, with just this general vibe of xenophobia,
and that there can't be anything worthwhile in the Quran.
Because now people have been built up their identities around
that. Right, they've built up an identity around hating Islam.
And while there are many problems with Islam, you know
what, there's a lot of problems with everything. Fast the
problem, there's nothing that's problem free, in a sense, there's
deep problems within Islam. There's deep problems within Catholicism. There's
deep problems within Buddhism, there see problems within every single
religious tradition. But not only that, it doesn't stop there.
There's deep problems in capitalism. There's deep problems than socialism.
There's deep problems within modernism, there's the problems and post
modernism, there's deep problems within every single country, there's deep
problems with every single economic system. There's deep problems within
every single political party. There's deep problems, even within science,
even within mathematics, even within rationality. So where are there
no problems. There's always problems. And so of course, what
the mind will do is the mind will ignore all
that, and the mind will select those problems, which it
needs. such that it can create a differentiation between those
people over there. And us over here. Because we're over
here, this is our identity. This is our tribe. This
is our nation. This is our religion. This is our
second this is our group, this is our second, whatever
it is, whatever you're subscribed to. Another area of application
is integrating science and religion. If you really want to
understand how science and religion fit together, for that you're
gonna need to see deep sadnesses. For Understanding the blunders
of epistemology. for understanding how the mind misuses beliefs, are
the problems of ideology and fundamentalism, the problems of paradigms
and people getting locked into various paradigms. For that, you're
gonna need to apply deep sameness. Because you see, the
biggest problem with people who believe stuff and who are
ideological is that they don't see the deep similarity between
their fundamentalism and the fundamentalism, fundamentalism of everybody else. So
what happens is that people become a fundamentalist. But then
they can't see how my being fundamentalist is the same
thing as those fundaments over there. So for example, Christian
fundamentalists in America can't see that their fundamentalism is really
just the same thing in different clothing, as Islamic fundamentalism,
and it will have the exact same problems. And even
scientists and atheists, they can't look past the fact that
their own atheistic fundamentalism, the rationalist fundamentalism is also just
another form of fundamentalism, and it suffers from exactly the
same problems as Islamic fundamentalism. Now, of course, see, the
atheist mind of the rationalist minds they all do, but
rationalists Don't. Don't commit suicide bombings And that's true. But
what you're doing there is you're, you're nitpicking the differences.
See, it's true that rationalists probably won't do a suicide
bombing. But you know what a rationalist will do a
rationalist will start a corporation, for example, that tries to
squeeze a bunch of money out of third world countries
create sweatshops in Indonesia somewhere, or, you know, cut down
rainforests in the Amazon or something for a profit, because
that's what the rationalist is about rationalism and materialism go
hand to hand. And when you're doing that, you don't
care really what the impact is on the environment for
the most part, other people a lot of times and,
and so, in that sense, you're going to heart or
you're going to hurt harm a lot of people. And
now, of course, the rational say, oh, but I'm not
intending to harm people. I'm just doing business. I'm just
involved in business, whereas the terrorists, they're really evil because
they want to harm people. But again, see, the fundamental
similarity is not in that that's all window dressing. You
got to see the deep sameness, the deep sameness, is
that the Islamic fundamentalist, what is he really driven by?
He's driven by defending his identity? Why is he blowing
people up? Because his identity is in danger, and he
wants to protect it against an existential threat? What is
the businessman doing, when the businessman is paying money to
lobbyist to go in and fix the laws in the
country such that they favor the businessman? What is he
doing, he's doing the exact same thing. So it's not
the content of your beliefs, or the content of your
fundamentalism that matters. We have fundamentalist scientist, like people who
have Nobel Prizes, and who have won procedures award the
universities, we have scientists, like people who are involved in
quantum mechanics and so forth, who take up a fundamentalist
position, about their ideas about string theory, or quantum mechanics,
some interpretation, they think this is the right interpretation. And
then they, they cling to it, and they will spend
the rest of their career defending that, never realizing that
exactly the same thing that Islamic terrorists is doing, or
that the businessman is doing, or that a football fan
is doing when he is defending his team, against some
other team and starting some riot. Now, all of these
various things play out in different ways. So there's a
lot of differences between how all this gets played out,
and people get lost in the differences. And they start
to blame each other for the differences. But really, what
they're missing is the deep, fundamental similarities. You're also going
to need to see deep similarity for understanding how evil
works, how corruption works and how conflict works. It's really
the same product as I was just describing. See, the
problem is that people don't understand evil, because they're too
self centered. And they don't see their own evil. They
look out at the world and they say, Oh, look,
that person is evil, that company's evil, that organizations evil,
that country is evil. But what they don't really see
is the deeper connection of like, what, what is causing
that evil, that company, organization or person, whatever they're doing,
they're doing it to advance their self agenda. Because they're
self biased. But guess what, who else is self biased?
You are, who else has a self agenda you do?
Who else is ignorant of their own evil that they
cause you are just like they are. Because every evil
person believes they're a good person. Just like you believe
you're a good person. But to see that requires you
really looking past the differences. And it means admitting some
bitter truth. Like that. There's not much of a difference
between you and a Nazi, or you and a terrorist,
or you and a fundamentalist. And especially a lot of
scientifically minded people, they like to think that they're above
all that, which is precisely what gets them to commit
their own versions of evil. Now, of course, all these
groups commit their own unique versions of evil, which are
different. So there are important differences. I'm not saying that,
that a quantum physics professor commits the same level of
evil, that some is radical, Islamic suicide bomber does their
different versions of evil, but it's stemming from the same
source. And if you want to understand that, you got
to be able to see the deep sameness. If you
want to understand human motivation, why human beings do what
they do, you got to be able to see deep
sameness is because fundamentally All human beings are driven by
exactly the same psychological drivers, which are good out and
even further even deeper into existential drivers, or motivations, which
have to do with like I said, defending one's identity,
because that's what life is about defending one's identity, because
without an identity, who are you? What are you What
is there to defend? A lot of people who buy
into science, again, rationalist type, skeptic types, atheist types, they
just assumed that oh, well, Leo, that's easy. Natural selection.
And evolution explains all this. So human beings were just
like, biological machines who grow up and are supposed to
replicate. And that's described by evolution. It's not so simple,
though. How does evolution know that something is a thing
that needs to be perpetuated, or survived at all. And,
of course, people just naively assume that well, creatures are
just creatures, and they just, they just are themselves. Because
you're already taking identity for granted, you're already assuming that
the creature knows it itself. But that's not at all
obvious. It's not at all obvious that when you're sitting
there eating your food at dinner, that you shouldn't eat
your hand as well. It's not obvious at all, that
this hand is not something that ordered that rather than
this hand is you and therefore you shouldn't bite it.
Right? So somehow, your mind had to actually draw a
distinction between what is acceptable to eat what's not acceptable
to eat. And that is based literally on what you
believe you are. That's not a given. That's not a
physical given. Nowhere in physics, does it tell you that
you are you and that your body is you. Science
doesn't tell you that. And also, as an area of
application for self actualization, for understanding all of human suffering,
if you want to understand where all suffering comes from,
you're going to need to see deep sadness, because all
suffering basically comes from one source. But because suffering proliferates
in so many different ways, you can be depressed, you
can be angry, you can be bitter, you can be
mad at some political group, some religious group, and it
seems like all your problems are such specific problems out
there, you have a problem with your wife, with your
boss, with your children, with your work with this with
school, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and you're solid.
You're trying to solve these problems all the time. And
you're just inundated, never ending problems. Have you ever wondered
why you never run out of problems in your life?
There will never be a day where you just kind
of sit back and say, Okay, that's it, I solved
all my problems. No more problems left anymore. Why is
that? Could it be because you're creating the problems yourself.
And all the suffering that comes along with it? Well,
maybe you could start to become aware of that. But
for that you would need to be conscious of deep
sadnesses, which you're not conscious of right now, because you're
overly focused on the differences. It's very important that you
understand here that even though I am stressing deep sameness
is here, and I am sort of presenting them as
superior to seeing difference. It's really important to understand that
sameness is not better than difference. Nor is difference, better
than sameness. Both can be traps, there are trade offs
with both abilities of seeing sameness and seeing difference. Seeing
difference is very important. And it's very good, especially for
developing technical mastery in some kind of field, which is
why it's used so much within science. You need to
be able to make fine grained distinctions. To become a
technical master anything, whether it's a sport, and art, business
signs or anything else. The danger in doing that is
that you lose sight of the bigger picture as you
get lost in the details in the minutiae of your
technical craft. So the opposite thing you could do is
you could develop a really strong filter for sameness. And
seeing sameness is good for holistic understanding big picture stuff,
which is why I emphasize that so much with actualized
at Oregon in this particular episode, because that's what we're
concerned with here. We're concerned with the very big picture,
the largest, broadest, most, most possibly broadest context because we're
looking to recontextualize our life in the in The most
powerful way possible. But the danger with that is overgeneralization.
Because if all you see is sameness everywhere, and you
fail to make distinctions and to see the differences, then
that will create all sorts of problems and evils in
and of itself. So you need to be able to
do both don't fall into this black and white trap
of being only a sameness person or only a difference
person. Or it will become pathological. In fact, what I
want to do right now is I really want to
give you some examples of how sameness and difference turn
into pathologies, because this is eye opening. And it's super
important because these here are some of the biggest traps
that minds fall into. So first, let's start talking about
sameness pathologies. There's a really great example that I love,
which comes from the early scientific revolution, and the discoveries
of Galileo. So Galileo, created a telescope, he didn't actually
invent it, but he created his own. And he started
looking out into the stars, Jupiter, the various planets and
moons that are out there, he started just counting them
up, he was very empirical. And the numbers that he
came up with with the various planets didn't correspond with
the classical medieval notions that existed in his society. And
so he brought up this discrepancy to their attention, thinking
that they would be open minded and that they would
listen. But of course, the church and the prevailing intellectuals
at the time roundly rejected him. And here is their
justification for why he was wrong, this is very, very
illuminating, because it is a sameness pathology. So look at
this, read this with me. They told him quote, there
are seven windows given to animals in the domicile of
the head, through which the air is admitted to the
tabernacle of the body, to enlighten, to warmth, and to
nourish it. What are these parts of the microcosm, two
nostrils, two eyes, two ears and a mouth. So in
the heavens, as in the Macro Cosmos, there are two
favourable stars to unpropitious to luminaries and mercury, undecided and
in different from this and many other similarities in nature.
Such as the seven metals, we gathered, the number of
planets isn't necessarily seven. And end quote. See, see what
they did there. They had a reasoning based on sameness,
because they thought that God created the human body, and
the head, and the head is the most important part
of the body, and it has seven orifices in it,
that means there must be a sort of isomorphic morphic
similarity between the number of holes in the human head
and the number of planets and to them that made
perfect sense. Now to us today, after all, the centuries
of various kinds of discoveries and changes in our philosophy
and metaphysics and epistemology about how science works. And all
of this, because, you know, back then scientific method was
a totally new invention didn't really exist at that time.
So back then this reasoning was perfectly valid. Of course,
today, to us, it seems ridiculous. Why would there be
a similarity between the number of holes in your head,
a human head, and the number of planets, that seems
to be such an arbitrary correlation? And that's exactly the
problem is that the mind will pick these arbitrary correlations,
but then hold them up as though they're the truth
as though they're somehow physically mandated by God, or by
atomic theory, or by quantum mechanics or by whatever else.
And the mistake here that rationalists and scientifically minded people
make is they say, oh, Leo, but this is actually
an example of how religion corrupts science. And this, though,
is the wrong conclusion to draw. Because what you have
to understand is that this type of reasoning, wasn't really
religious reasoning. This was the prevailing signs of that time.
This is how scientists thought at that time, by scientists,
what we really mean is people who think about the
nature of reality. This is what those people thought. Today
we have visionary scientists, just like Galileo, who are advancing
radical theories about the nature of existence, the nature of
the mind, the nature of consciousness, the nature of psychic
phenomena, the nature of psychedelics, and so fora which are
being roundly rejected by materialist scientists, in universities and an
academia using similar kinds of ridiculous arguments as this now,
of course, they're different. They're based on atomic theory and
whatever other materialist nonsense the scientists believe in, but the
similarities that they believe in it, is become a dogma
for them. And so therefore, just like with Galileo, they're
not able to really see the cutting edge that is
being shown to them. You know, the way that Galileo
responded to this sort of criticism is he said, but
look, guys, here's my telescope, look in the scale scope.
See for yourselves, that count up how many planets there
are, you'll see that there's, there's more than seven of
them. One of these intellectuals of his time tell him
they told him that that instrument is the work of
the devil. And that nothing that could be seen through
that instrument can be counted as evidence or truth, because
it's the work of the devil. So of course, we're
not going to look into your devil instrument. Sound familiar
to what's happening today? That's precisely what's happening today. Modern
science has very compelling evidence, for example, for psychic phenomena,
indisputable evidence, not to mention millions of anecdotal accounts not
mentioning that I'm talking about statistical analysis, meta studies that
have been done by serious accredited scientist on psychic phenomena,
which are absolutely indisputable proof of the existence of psychic
phenomena, indisputable. But of course, it doesn't matter. Because as
soon as you present this evidence to any kind of
material scientist, because what they really believe is materialism. First
and foremost, anything that contradicts materials and by definition must
be false. So it will be rejected. In the same
way that for these people during Galileo's time, anything that
contradicted the seven orifices, and the human head must be
false. Because we know by definition, God created the head
and God created the heavens, so therefore it must be
seven and seven. That's the deep similarity that's being missed.
Nowhere is this more true than with psychedelics, you know,
I could take a materialist scientist and turn him into
a believer in 15 minutes, by giving him five Meo
DMT. People criticize me for, for being mystical for talking
about woowoo subjects and New Age stuff and God and
this and that, look, I'm telling you straight up right
now. Just like Galileo told those guys, three, four years
ago, I have an instrument, we have this instrument, five
Meo DMT, you take this instrument within 15 minutes, you
will realize what God is, and you will realize that
you are God. And that all of materialism is false.
Within 15 minutes, you will realize this, just take 30
milligrams of this substance and wash out. Will you do
it? Will any serious scientists and some serious University actually
do it? Of course not. Because they'll just say, oh,
Leo, psychedelics, those are just hallucinations. How can you possibly
trust psychedelics? Leo, that's like the, that's like some kind
of devil chemical, which can't trust anything from that. Therefore,
I won't even try it. It's the exact same shit
400 years later, the exact same shit. And the really
funny thing is, is that 400 years from now, once
people have tried five Meo DMT, and they will come
to realize that I was one of the first people
in human history to really advocate it as strongly as
I am. They will say, Yeah, Leah was totally right.
But they will still not learn the lesson, the really
deep lesson of the fact that even 400 years, whatever
science is doing, it will still be locked into some
further paradigm. Further stuff that people are dogmatic about, and
it will still deny certain kinds of evidence, simply because
there will be some new technology that reveals some new
part of reality in some radically new way. And of
course, people will say that, Oh, well, that's just the
work of the devil or whatever, whatever the fashion is
at the time. So right now, you wouldn't say it's
the work of the devil, you would say it's just
some hallucinations in the mind because that's what the materialist
paradigm believes 400 years ago was the work of the
devil because that was the religious paradigm in 400 more
years is going to be some, I don't know. You'll
have some other excuse. Your mind will always come with
an excuse. That's what The mind is a master of.
So this example here was an example of sameness, pathology.
Another example of sameness, pathology is what happens within, again,
science at large within academia and universities. And this is
the same as pathology of confusing the map for the
territory. This is a very broad pathology, which applies to
many fields in many particular cases. But generally, what happens
is that scientists and mathematicians get good, so good at
quantifying reality and building models, that they build these models.
And then after a while, once they get research funding
and grants and and they write books about in this,
their models start to seem so real to them, that
they actually start to confuse the model with the territory
that they were modeling. And they actually start to believe
that their models are the territory and to the point
where they actually start to deny that territory. And, I
mean, this might seem like I'm making this up. But
there are serious academics and scientists right now in the
top universities, in Harvard and Princeton, and elsewhere around the
world. Who actually, for example, believe, because let's say they
were a physic quantum physicist, who was doing some equations,
you know, created a bunch of equations for gravity and
this and cosmology in that. And he's been doing this
for 40 years of his life. And he's made some
great discoveries, for sure. So we're not we're not trashing
his discoveries. But he now actually has convinced himself that
his formulas and his equations are literally our the truth,
literally our reality, to the point where he can't distinguish
anymore. And he can't see that his equations and models
are not reality itself. And that is the same as
pathology. Because, see, he sees the sameness between his equation
and reality. He sees some kind of sameness. But the
problem is, he's so locked into that same as he
also can't see the difference anymore. And now he's falling
into a very deep delusion. There are scientists right now.
Alright, around the world who actually believe that the universe
is mathematical. Or that theory, physical equations actually are like
the laws of the universe is preposterous. They're not conscious
at all. If healthy, invented this. It would be just
as ridiculous as a pig believing that God looked like
swine with snout and bristles. Why would the pig believe
that? Because he's a pig. So why would a mathematician
believe that the world is mathematical? The mathematician has how
he sees the world. But he's not conscious that he's
the one who's projecting the mathematics onto the world. There's
nothing mathematical about reality whatsoever. It's a projection. But to
see that requires overcoming this sameness, pathology. Another really good
example for you from the social domain, I read an
article recently, that in Scandinavia, some Scandinavian country, maybe Sweden
or something, I forget exactly which one. They're becoming very
sort of politically correct, as they say. And so what
they want to do is they want to remove gender
stereotypes between men and women. And so in Sweden, let's
say they had a catalog with, with toys for boys
and girls in school. And this catalog would feature you
know, the traditional gender roles, they would show a boy
playing with a Nerf gun and a girl playing with
the with a Barbie doll. But in the name of
equality, because there's this kind of movement of, of social
justice warrior equality. And so what they want is they
want to remove these stereotypes because you know, we don't
want to pressure boys to necessarily have to act macho,
we don't want to pressure girls necessarily have to be
housewives and so forth. So why don't we just kind
of like mix it up. And so what they decided
to do is they decided to switch the roles such
that in the magazine, they will show the girl playing
with the guns and the boys playing with the dolls.
But of course, this creates a problem. This is going
to create a whole generation of boys and girls who
are confused about how to be masculine and how to
be feminine. Now, of course, these people who are planning
this equality, they they're doing it from a good intent.
Tension. Because it's true that you know, not all boys
want to be masculine. Not all girls want to be
feminine. But it's also true, that it's certainly not the
case that boys and girls are indifferent to which toys
they play with, or who they are going to have
sex with when they get older. And one of the
wondering, masculine or feminine, it's overwhelmingly the case that most
boys will skew masculine, and most girls will skew feminine.
And the problem is, if you're gonna raise boys and
girls in an environment where you're forcing them, like, literally
in some of these Scandinavian schools, they will take a
toy away from the boy, like, they'll take away his
gun and give him a doll. See, but the problem
with this, of course, is going to be that you're
going to raise a generation of boys and girls, who
are not going to understand what it really means to
be a man or a woman. Because that needs to
be taught, that's difficult to suss out all by yourself.
And I speak as someone who's struggled with that myself,
and had to really work hard to overcome that to
really learn what it means to be masculine. And also
learn to, to understand what femininity is. Because the way
I used to treat girls and women in general, is
just as just like boys, because no one really taught
me in my early years, that actually, girls need to
be treated differently than boys, especially if you want to
be in a relationship with them. And you want to
make it successful. And you want to make it exciting
and passionate and all this. So this becomes another example
of a sameness pathology. Certainly, we need to be careful
about not pigeon holing boys and girls. So we don't
want to force masculinity or femininity on anybody. But like,
for example, what would be nice, what what I would
like to see is I would like to see in
high school, every high school to have a class called,
How to be masculine, and how to be feminine. And
the boys and girls can decide which class they want
to enroll in. And it's going to be a whole
semester, where they get really good, solid practical advice, theory
and practice on what it means to be masculine, what
it means to be feminine. And maybe, in fact, you
you force, the boys and girls to take both classes,
so that you can see the world from both sides.
And then they can decide after that for themselves, which
way they want to be which ideas they want to
adopt and which ones they want to leave. That would
be a much better model. And in this case, you
don't force anybody to be any particular way. But you
do give them the options to learn what it means
because it is important to learn how to be a
man and how to be a woman. Otherwise, what happens
is that you're going to be a boy into your
30s and 40s. Or you're going to be a girl
into your 30s and 40s. And are going to be
lost and confused. Because in traditional cultures and tribal cultures,
this kind of stuff was taught by the tribe to
the boys and girls. And it's important to proper functioning.
Otherwise, what you get is you get these entire generations
of boys and girls who grew up and they're sexually
repressed, or they're incompetent in bed, or they don't really
understand the opposite sex and then of course, because they
don't understand them, and they can't attract them, then they
get bitter, they get mad and they get angry. They
get depressed, they get suicidal, they go shoot up a
school or something because of a simple problem like this.
That's the same as pathology. lumping together fundamentalist religion with
mysticism is also the same as pathology. This is what
Ken Wilber calls the pre rational trans rational fallacy. So
this is something that scientific and atheistic people make all
the time is this fallacy is whenever they hear the
word God or spirituality or religion spoken. They automatically assume
that what that is, is that that's just like old
school Christianity fundamentalist religion. They equate it with Islam and
fairy tales and nonsense and flying spaghetti monsters. And they
don't make any distinction between that and no non dual
teachings, Buddhist scriptures, mysticism, they consider all of that just
one thing all of it is fairy tales. All of
is that anti scientific, which is of course precisely wrong.
Because even though science and rationalism is one evolutionary step
above, fundamentalist religion, mysticism is a few evolutionary steps above.
Rationalism and science. But that's lost on most people these
days, especially within universities, where mysticism is not allowed, because
it's considered to be religion. or if it is allowed,
it's lumped together with religious studies, which is, which is
a real shame. That Satan theology and other saints pathology
is lumping together all forms of sexual harassment like I
said earlier. Like, people will just ask for free people
to get fired and, and sued for exactly the same
kinds of crimes or abuses. Even though they're not really
the same. Like they will start to treat a serial
rapist with the same outrage as, as someone who Pat's
a woman on the butt with the same outrage as
someone who tells a dirty joke with the same outrage
who was something something else, right? I mean, there's there's
different degrees of sexual harassment. And so you got to
be careful about lumping them all together. Another same as
pathology is with psychedelics. People generally lump psychedelics in with
hard drugs. That's what our US government does. The US
government lists, weed, mushrooms and LSD and DMT as a
Schedule One Substance the same as heroin, cocaine and other
hard drugs. Which is preposterous, if you've ever taken a
psychedelic. And so in general, our entire culture stigmatize a
psychedelic so much, that they're not taken seriously in the
medical community not taken seriously in the scientific community, not
taken seriously, by the culture at large. And so therefore,
this powerful, powerful tool is, is going to waste really,
the evolution of mankind is being significantly retarded by this
lumping together of psychedelics with hard drugs. And, of course,
that's done on purpose. A lot of this lumping together,
it's not an accident, the same as pathologies, if they're
done by the ego, mind on purpose, precisely because the
ego mind doesn't want the truth. The ego mind loves
being diluted. Because it doesn't know it's deluded, it tells
itself that delusion is the truth. So therefore, it only
thinks it has the truth. Once you think you have
the truth, why go looking for the real truth, you
already have the real truth in your estimation. Another example
of Samus pathology is with Jordan Peterson. And his lumping
together of spiral dynamics stage green, or what are the
what he calls the Neo Marxist, lumping stage green, post
modernism in with Soviet style of Marxism and communism and
all the evils of the of the early 20th century.
And what this does, in many people's minds who listened
to him is they start to think that Oh, my
God, stage green, they don't know what stage green is.
That's as far than Amex concept. But basically, they think
all those hippies and those liberals and those progressives, really,
they're taking us back to Soviet Marxist era days. And
it's gonna be terrible if we let them do that.
So now they start a war, they sort of cultural
war against this, and that's what you're seeing right now
in the media. But, of course, what they don't realize,
and what Jordan Peterson doesn't realize is that actually, what
what he's railing as post modernism, this is stage green,
on spiral dynamics. He's railing at post modernism. From below,
not from above. So it's true that post modernism definitely
has its excesses and its problems, just like every stage
does. But the solution is not to rail against those
problems. But to realize that actually, you have to grow
through that stage and then evolve up it, not to
resist it and to try to repress it, which is
what Peterson is trying to do. PISA is basically advocating
for a sort of stage, orange and maybe a little
bit of stage blue society, which is actually the greatest
danger that we face right now is we have an
overabundance of orange, orange materialism is destroying the entire planet,
creating gross income inequality and other sorts of social problems
corrupting our politics with with lobbyists money. This is very
toxic and very problematic and unsustainable. Not to mention all
the ecological problems that come from orange. And stage blue.
Well, hey, that's just takes you back to the medieval
era. We've already had stage blue. If you want stage
blue, go live in the Middle East. You'll get plenty
of stage blue. That's not what you really want. What
we really need to we need to get more people
we need more Americans who are stuck in blue and
orange, we need to get them to actually start To
open up and accept green, which is the hippies, we
need more people to become hippies and social justice warriors,
and quote unquote, Marxists, that's not going to lead us
to Soviet communism, for sure that's going to lead us
to certain problems, there will be problems, there will be
excesses to green, of course, there will be every stage
has excesses. But we will move past those, and then
we'll go to yellow and so forth. And then that
will auto correct itself. But demonizing green is only gonna
make things worse. Another Samus pathology is calling all corporations
evil, which is the same as pathology that green makes,
in fact, stage green. And one of the one of
the biggest problems with post modernism is that actually, stage
green people, they are the ones who come in a
lot of sameness pathologies, because they tend to see everything
as equal, so equal, that it's too equal, they make
all sorts of false equivalencies. And also, they start to
lump together, stage blue and stage orange. And so green,
looking down in orange will say that orange all the
orange corporations and people are evil, and they're greedy, and
they're money hungry, and they're showing suicide and all this.
And so it's, it's also a same as pathology. And
the last example give you same as pathology is I
showed a video called why people seem crazy. And in
that video, basically, what I explained is that the reason
that most people seem crazy to each other, is because
we just have a fundamental assumption when we're born. And
the way that we're raised is that all human minds
and all human consciousnesses are basically the same. Meaning that
like, the reality that I inhabit is the same as
the reality that you would have it. And that's not
at all the case. That's a false assumption. That's the
same as pathology, you just assume that what you're conscious
of is the same stuff that other people are conscious
of. That's not the case at all. There are people
who are conscious of aliens and extraterrestrials and fucking psychic
phenomena and auras and chakras and higher states of consciousness,
God, angels, demons, I mean, you name it, there's so
much shit that people are conscious of, that you probably
have never been conscious of. But you could become conscious
of if you open your mind, if you maybe started
a spiritual practice, or did some psychedelics or maybe had
head injuries or whatever. I mean, there's lots of ways
to alter your consciousness radically, radically such that you're living
in a different reality. People don't have to understand this.
Scientists don't understand this, the scientific paradigm paradigm does not
understand or account for radically different degrees of human consciousness.
It just assumes that all human consciousness is the same.
And that what the scientist sees what everybody sees, no,
that's not the case at all. Most scientists are at
a very, very low state of human consciousness, which is
why they're materialists. And it's because their materials that they
stay in that low state of consciousness, so it's a
self fulfilling prophecy. So if you want to, if you
want to understand that famous pathology, check out that episode,
why people seem crazy. I think it's one of my
better ones. Of course, we shouldn't forget about the difference
pathologies, we have plenty of different pathologies. Perhaps the quintessential
example of which is literal demonization, which is done during
war time. It's pretty amazing. Go Go google for world
war two posters, typing into Google Images, some phrase such
as demonization poster, World War Two, and you will see
some pretty crazy stuff. It's hard to believe that the
government actually did this. Here's an example I'll show you
just as a teaser of a kind of poster that
the United States created during World War Two. Pretty crazy,
pretty racist stuff. Why does this happen during wartime? Of
course, it's not the only the US that's guilty of
this basically, every warring nation, demonizes its opponents. Why? Because
it's pretty hard to kill other people in a sustained
fashion, without separating oneself from them without demonizing them. So
literally, or we draw people with fangs and claws and,
and devils tails and horns and pitchforks. we demonize them.
A very interesting example to illustrate this is that in
the 60s or 70s, I believe the CIA, CIA and
the US government wanted to use LSD thinking that it
might be great for creating super soldiers because they thought
hey, if we give them this mind altering drugs, and
maybe they will have become super warriors and be able
to indiscriminately kill on the battlefield with no remorse and
no moral compunctions or anything. So they gave some soldiers
LSD as a test. And then what happened was the
exact opposite of what they expected. What happened was that
the LSD expanded their identity so much such that they
became so unified with their environment with all the people
around them, that they couldn't shoot the enemy, because they
saw themselves in the enemy. And there was no point
in shooting yourself. So instead of shooting people, the soldiers
were just loving their enemies, such that there could be
no war. So of course, they had to nix that
whole thing real quick. And that's a very funny story.
So another difference pathology is what you see with the
men's right movement, which is rather problematic. You see it
with pickup you see it with MGTOW with red pill,
Jordan Peterson's so called insoles, this sort of stuff. What
is the men's rights movement? Really, it's a bunch of
guys who have dysfunctional problems with their entire relationship to
womankind as a whole, because of the way they were
raised. They were raised in such a way that they
didn't know how to attract women, or they were, they
suffered some suffering from women. And, and so, because of
this, now, of course, their egos are wounded. But at
the same time, as their egos are wounded, of course,
they have their biological needs and their hormones. So they
love to have sex with hot women. But at the
same time, they actually have a secret hatred of women.
Because really, what they want is they want to be
able to use the woman have sex with her from
a sort of dysfunctional position, but don't want to really
commit to a serious relationship, because they don't really know
how, because a lot of these guys are very difficult
dysfunctional on the inside. They just don't even know how
to approach a woman. They don't know what really masculinity
is, or what femininity is, or how to treat a
woman properly. And so because of this, they develop very
dysfunctional views of women. And they start to blame women
for their own inadequacies. Because of course, for a man
to admit that he's not good with women is, is
a rather ugly, and unpalatable thing for the ego to
admit. So what the ego dues will do is, it'll
exteriorize this problem, and it will start to blame the
women, it'll start to blame the feminist movement, it'll start
to blame the social justice warriors, it'll start to blame.
Political correctness, it'll start to blame the repression of men
and the taking away of men's rights and all this,
you see, it'll start to act like a victim. Which
is, of course, ironically, the very opposite of what a
true man would do. A true man would never bitched
and moaned about the problem, that he's not getting enough
sex, a true man would go out there and say,
Okay, I have a problem attracting women, it's probably because
I was raised by a bad father, bad mother, or
whatever problems happened in my childhood. And now I have
to take responsibility for it, it's my problem, I'm gonna
go out there and fix it, I'm gonna read the
books, watch the videos, take the courses, go out there,
socialize, meet women, and solve this problem. And I'm not
going to develop any kind of ideologies, I'm not going
to blame women for my problems. And of course, in
a certain sense, that's what pickup artists try to do.
But even as they're doing that, they're still wounded inside.
And they're still not really addressing the root problem, because
what pickup usually teaches men is that it teaches them
how to attract women, but it doesn't really teach them
how to understand women. And in fact, it feeds their
ego centric view of women asked sexual objects and how
to have transactional relationships with them. And in fact, the
more POA gets good at that. It still doesn't resolve
his problems. Deep down, he still has insecurities about women.
He's still using women to try to feed his own,
sold out the hole in his own soul that's there,
because he hasn't really done any really deep inner work.
And so because of this, he even though he might
get good with sleeping with lots of women, he still
can't really develop serious relationships with them. He's still extremely
immature, and he still has an ideology of blaming women
in the back of his mind. And so, this is
a difference pathology because what this creates is creates a
fragmentation in the P ways mind or in the in
cells mind or whatever they are. They're creating a rift
between themselves men, as an identity and women as an
identity. And then they start to blame the women as
though the women aren't giving them enough sex or they
aren't doing something right or whatever. they're cheating on them.
Women are cheaters. And so there's all these stereotypes. Women
are cheaters women are sluts. Women aren't doing their the,
their job with men blah, blah, blah. It's the feminist.
It's the radical crazy feminazis and this and that. And
so this this turns into not just a problem with
women, it turns into a whole political ideology. And that's,
of course, where Jordan Peterson comes in. Because Jordan Peterson
feeds into this. The reason Jordan Peterson is so popular
with these types of folks, is precisely because he comes
in there and he says, Hey, you guys are insults
and I, I know why you are. And I will
provide you on a silver platter with a political philosophy
and ideology that will explain to you why you're a
victim, and why in fact, you're being mistreated and why
in fact, your identity is threatened and how to get
your identity back. And that's by attacking those people over
there. It's the post modernists, it's the Greens problem is
green people. It's the women, it's the feminist, this all
this. That's why this is happening. If we just revert
back to old school, deep orange, and even blue traditionalist
society, then you'll get all your sexual needs met. And
of course, this is preposterous. This is preposterous. It's the
opposite of taking responsibility for the problem, blaming scapegoating somebody
else. But of course, this serves the needs of Jordan
Peterson. It serves his identity needs because he himself is
coming from a wounded place from having these sorts of
problems on university campuses with with feminist women. Look, you
can have legitimate problem not saying all women are angels.
I'm not saying you can't get hurt by a woman.
I'm not saying a woman can't cheat on you. She
can. The problem, though is is that when you start
to create an ideology about it, just because someone woman
offended you, or didn't give you sex, or mistreated you
or whatever, that doesn't mean that you get to create
an ideology, anti women, because of that. That's preposterous. And
so Jordan Peterson will come in and will say, Oh,
look, there's really big differences is the liberals who are
telling you that men or women are the same, but
but really, in fact, there's a lot of differences. Let
me bring in the studies and the science and the
lobsters and this and that, to show you how we're
really all different and how blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
So what he's doing there is he's trying to fragment.
And he's overly focusing on the differences. were, in fact,
really what what these what these insults and DUIs and
so forth really need to understand is that he just
understand the deep similarities between men and women, we have
so much more in common than, than not. And also
a lot of these. A lot of these people, these
insults and so forth, really, they're immature boys. They're immature
teenagers who have spent the majority of their life playing
video games. Going on Facebook, watching YouTube videos and watching
porn, living in their mom's basement, not socializing, cooking on
their smartphone. That's what they've spent a good 20 years
of their entire upbringing doing cooking on an iPad since
they were a toddler. And now they grow up living
in this virtual world on chat rooms and read it
and so forth. And then they wonder how come I
suck with women? Of course, of course, you suck with
women. Because you have no practice, because you grew up
in a virtual world. And so yes, this is a
problem in society. But of course, you don't see Jordan
Peterson playing video games, and blaming Facebook and blaming YouTube
and blame television and all this, because if he did,
he would alienate his entire audience. Because his entire audience
basically fucking gamers, teenage gamers who are immature and don't
want to take responsibility for anything. That's his audience, primarily.
And so they don't want to hear that. What they
want to hear is who can escape goat goat and
who can I blame him? Oh, the Neo Marxists. Okay,
that's a perfect solution to my problem. Let me sit
around blaming the the Neo, the Neo Marxist, but you
know what? You're sitting around blaming, Neo Marxists isn't gonna
get you late. It's not going to fix your problems.
In fact, it's only gonna make it worse, because you're
just doubling down on the problem. You keep watching those
stupid Jordan Peterson videos over and over again. What does
that do that just drives you deeper and deeper into
the virtual world. You watch more porn, you play more
video games, you go and you, you. You develop this
political ideology of yours on online forums and chat groups
and stuff. And not only just makes it worse, doesn't
solve your problems. How do you think you're gonna relate
to women, when deep down you hate women. And yet
at the same time you need women to satisfy your
sexual needs, that's a really tough place to place yourself
in, you are really in a pickle there. Because what's
gonna happen is that even if you do manage to
accidentally bump into a woman, and she's beautiful, and you
like her and all this, and you're gonna destroy that
relationship, because deep down, you have this bitterness inside you,
Jordan Peterson's bitterness will creep into your mind, and then
you will go around spouting the bitterness. And yet, at
the same time, you're gonna need that woman to have
sex with her. And so you're gonna, you're gonna both
hate her at the same time as needing her and
loving her. And that's going to become a really dysfunctional
thing. And then you're gonna spend your whole life bouncing
between different women wondering what's wrong. And then of course,
as you do that, you're gonna blame the women more
and more, because the cash of course, the ego doesn't
want to take responsibility. So it's not going to admit
that it's wrong. He's not going to admit that all
these Jordan Peterson ideologies are, are silly, and immature, and
regressive. And so it's going to double down and it's
gonna say, oh, no, it's really the women, even the
good women, even the women that I thought were good,
even they are evil. They are right, Jordan Peterson is
even more right than I thought, the red pill movement
is even more right than I thought. And so you
will create your own living hell. Another difference pathology is
Sam Harris and Islam. So Sam Harris likes to rant
against Islam, drawing a sharp distinction between Christianity and other
religions and Islam, saying that Islam is particularly dangerous and
evil and bad and non humanist and against Western values
and the mother lode of bad ideas. That's his direct
quote. And then this ideology starts to pervade culture at
large and those people who follow him, but of course,
the thing that Sam Harris is missing, and that his
followers are missing is that they're not seeing the deep
sameness between what Sam Harris is doing, and actually what
Islam is doing. So really, Sam Harris's greatest problem with
Islam is that the problem with Islam and it's a
real problem. So he's right, that it's a problem is
that Islam falls into the trap of the lesser jihad.
So there's the greater jihad, which is going inside and
pursuing awakening. And then there's the lesser jihad of externalizing,
that whole process attacking other people in the world, the
infidels, or whoever else, are your enemies. And that's, that's
a big problem, for sure. And it exists within Islam.
But the problem is that it also exists within Sam
Harris and within his whole movement, because even though Sam
Harris is anti religious, and all this, he's a rationalist
fundamentalist, that's what he is. And so the deeper similarities
that the dog was within Islam are also materialist dogmas
that exist within Sam Harris, and especially, especially his followers,
because Sam Harris is fairly evolved. But his followers are
much less evolved. But they, but they subscribe to his
rationalist cult. That's what it is. It's a cult of
rationalism, a cultivate theism, a cult of materialism. And they
believe that this is the solution to all of religion,
and all the evils of Islam and all of that,
and that this will lead to the perfect society if
we can just make the whole world rational. But of
course, it will lead to its own set of problems
which are parallel to the ones that Islam created. And
in fact, this whole crusade against Islam really is just
the lesser jihad. It's a waste of your time. It's
a distraction. It's a red herring, what you really need
to be doing is waking up the greater jihad. And
the deepest irony of it all is is that this
is what this has become for Sam Harris, because Sam
Harris has not completed his journey. Despite what people think,
despite writing books like waking up. He has a half
baked sense of awakening. Not a full deep enlightenment, not
a full deep awakening. And so rather than completing the
greater Jihye what he's done is he's fallen to the
lesser jihad, and what is the lesser Jihad fighting against
Islam? So the time that he could have spent fully
enlightening himself instead, he's spending now writing books and doing
tours with Jordan Peterson is so forth to rail against
Islam and other political things. So, so the very evil
that Sam Harris is railing against within Islam is the
very evil that he himself is committing, but not seeing
and his followers certainly are not seeing it. Because to
see it requires seeing deep sameness. And this here is
a difference pathology. Now, you might say Leo, but But
what about you, aren't you now right? Feeling good? Sam
Harris. So aren't you committing the same thing? Why don't
you go live in a cave and fully enlightened yourself?
And then otherwise, you're doing the same thing. Sam Harris's
and you're right, I have to be very careful about
that. I have to be very careful about starting ideological
crusades against any of these people, Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris,
Richard Dawkins, we'll talk about next, and so on, you
know, I could, I could, I can get so many
followers, I can write books, I could write books, tearing
down and deconstructing all these popular fingered figures within politics,
within science, within spirituality, within religion, all of this, you
know, I could, I could go on TV shows and
radio shows and podcasts and earn millions of dollars and
do tours and speaking engagements and all of this, I
could easily fall into that trap. So I have to
be very careful. Very careful, I'm very careful not to
do too much of that. And whenever I try to
criticize somebody, I tried to not make an identity out
of it. It's very easy to get an identity as
a critic, and then that becomes your thing. And then
you're criticizing everybody all the time. And that's really not
my intention. I'm just pointing out traps do you hear?
These are just examples. I'm not really using this to
rail against these people, even though it might sound like
especially to their fans. These are just examples to point
out how relevant this topic of sameness and difference is
to our time right now, and it will still be
relevant 100 years from now. The details will change but
the the traps will still remain the same. They've been
the same for 1000s of years. Richard Dawkins creates a
difference pathology between himself and creationists. So he's an evolutionary
theorist, and he likes to advocate Darwinism. And he loves
to bash and criticize and ridicule creationists. And that's fine.
Yeah, I mean, in a sense, there's a lot wrong
with creationism. I'm not here to defend it. There's a
lot wrong with fundamentalist religion. But again, just like Sam
Harris, there's a problem here, in that Richard Dawkins himself
has taken on a materialist dogma, the dogma of evolution,
and so forth. Through random mutations, he's taken this on,
as his own religion. So the irony is that he's
ranting against religion, but really, he has a different flavor
of religion himself, which is the scientism version of religion.
And he behaves if you watch his, his videos and
talks pretty much like a religious person, just as dogmatic,
just as close minded, completely oblivious to the truths of
mysticism and non duality, lumping them together with those of
fundamentalist religion. So the difference pathology here is that Richard
Dawkins thinks he's very different from religion. But in fact,
the more profound thing to realize there is, they're more
similar than they are different. Of course, ethnocentrism and racism,
which we're seeing a resurgence of lately, is a difference,
pathology. That's what racism is. That's what ethnocentrism is thinking
that your culture is, is a better culture than other
cultures. And cherry picking the evidence to justify your beliefs.
And the reason you're doing that is not because it's
true, not because the science support you, supports you. But
because it's your identity. And you're attached to it. And
the last difference pathology that I'll mention is not seeing
one's own evil. The reason people don't notice the evil
that they themselves commit. And the reason that evil really
exists in the world in the first place, is simply
because every individuals thinks that they are different from all
the evil people out there. So it's because I'm not
like a terrorist. I'm not like a Nazi. I'm not
not like a corrupt politician. I'm the good guy. I'm
the hero of the story. Which is essentially saying, I'm
different from all those. That I get to act in
a self righteous manner, without self reflection. And whenever I
act without self reflection, I will actually be selfish, and
therefore commit the very evil, that every other person out
there is also committing. That's how evil gets created. Selfishness,
blindness of one's own self biases. And being in denial
about the fact that evil doesn't lurk out there. Evil
starts from within every individual. And it gets worse the
less you self reflect about your own self biases. So
the mistake is drawing too strong of a distinction between
you and all the other evil people out there, really
what you need to do is you do the opposite.
And you say, if there's so much evil in the
world, where's it coming from? It's coming from the human
mind. And I have a human mind. And fundamentally, we're
not that different from our Yeah, we're not that different
from each other in terms of our, the way our
brains and our minds work. So because of that, I
should assume that I am capable of the very same
evils that everybody else's. And therefore I have to be
really careful about justifying my own selfishness to myself, using
reason, science, logic, and all sorts of excuses and rationalizations.
And if I do that, by seeing the commonalities between
us all, then I will actually be able to transcend
evil and commit less of it. So those are the
pathologies, I hope you can see how many traps there
are here. And that you need to be able to
do both. See the differences and see the sameness is
not one, not just the other. I have three powerful
questions for you that you can use in all sorts
of situations for the rest of your life from now
on. That will, that will help illuminate a lot of
stuff for you, if you ask them open mindedly with
genuine curiosity. The first one is, how are these two
things the same? Any two things? In any situation? Especially
some controversial or tricky situation? Like religion versus science, or
politics or whatever? The second question is, how are these
two things different? And the third question is, how are
these two things deeply the same? You want to make
sure you get past the surfaces, and get to the
essence of things. Those are very powerful questions. As a
homework assignment, what I want you to do is I
want you to contemplate this topic of sameness versus difference.
What is difference, really, what is sameness? I want you
to do a tricky thing here wishes to contemplate this
from scratch. Despite all the ideas that I filled your
head with, and all the examples, what I want you
to do is I want you to develop a certain
ability, which is sort of like walking and chewing gum
at the same time. And this is the ability to
be able to both rely on external sources, like myself,
or books or other videos or teachers or courses and
seminars and workshops, and so forth. But then be able
to isolate yourself for 30 to 60 minutes, as though
in a hermetic bubble. And contemplate a topic that you've
studied and read about as though you haven't read, read
about or study that ever in your life. This is
contemplating it from scratch. Without assumptions, without preconceived notions without
bringing science and philosophy and religion and all this sort
of baggage into your contemplation, you need to be able
to do both, because it's not a viable strategy to
go through life without reading books, listening to great teachers
and gurus and all the seminars and workshops that are
available, that's critical, you need that, because you know what,
if all you do is you just seal yourself in
a room and you just contemplate for the rest of
your life, chances are, you're going to fall into traps,
and you're going to delude yourself. So one of the
ways to prevent that is by bouncing your discoveries off
of external sources, to double check yourself. And conversely, if
all you do is read books, and you listen to
teachers and gurus and videos, but you don't contemplate for
yourself, then all you're going to have is a bunch
of ideas that are not going to be your own,
and you're not going to own them, you're not going
to deeply understand them, you're not going to know why
they're true. It's just going to be ideologies. And all
you're going to do is be defending ideology for the
rest of your life, which is going to be disastrous
for you and for society at large. So what you
need to do is you need to be able to
combine both. You need to be able to study broadly.
Then sit yourself down for 30 to 60 minutes, throw
it all away, contemplate in your journal, have some amazing
insights and epiphanies then come out of your bubble. And
then you can think about and you can compare like,
oh, what I discovered here matches up with what Leo
said or this thing here. No, it doesn't it contradicts
what he said. So who's right maybe he's right, maybe
I'm right. And through this process, it's kind of bouncing
back and forth. That's how you will develop a really
deep understanding of reality and you will avoid many of
the traps that would otherwise you would fall into So
for the next week, every single day, I want you
to contemplate what is difference, what is sameness for at
least 30 to 60 minutes. not based on anything I
said here today. And then after a week of that
you can come back and maybe you can compare and
see how you did. There's a lot there go deep,
this topic is much deeper than even I'm making out
to be in this very long episode. So in conclusion,
you need to become mentally flexible, you need to get
good at seeing both difference and similarity without getting trapped
into holding an ideological position without needing a particular difference
or particular similarity to be true. So this is the
process of letting go and letting go and letting go.
The goal is to develop an ability to be a
really nuanced, greyscale thinker, not a black and white thinker.
Plus an ability to see the deep interconnectedness of things,
such that you're able to do both at the same
time, you're able to integrate, and you're able to distinguish.
And you're not using either of these to serve your
egoic self centered agenda of survival. If you can do
that, that is a really rare and powerful thing. And
so now in conclusion, just notice, notice where we started
with this episode, notice how much ground we've covered, notice
how much practical stuff came out of it, all the
ramifications, notice how far we've gone. We started with a
very innocuous seeming topic, like sameness and difference. And you
might think, Oh, well, what's the big deal about that?
There's nothing special about that, I can contemplate that for
30 minutes, and be done with it. And now you
discover No, that's not the case at all. In fact,
ultimately, what we discovered is we got to the very
root of reality itself. This very question has led us
to the very structure of existence. And as it turns
out, reality is really nothing but differences which are all
the same. And at the same time, reality is nothing
but sameness is, which are all different. And that's the
end. All right, I'm done here. Please remember to click
that like button for me, and then come check out
actualize that org, that's my website, you'll be able to
find some exclusive stuff there. My blog, the forum, the
life purpose course, the book list. All of those could
be life changing for you. So make sure you check
those out. And the last thing that I want to
leave you with is something really profound to ponder over
the next week, something that puts a bow ties everything
we've talked about here together, in in the deepest way.
And this is the deepest truth about reality. And that
is what I will leave you with
