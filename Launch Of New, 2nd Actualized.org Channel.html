[Music] this is an announcement for the launch of a
new second actualized.org youtube channel called actualizedclips this new channel
will not feature any new content instead it will feature
the old content clipped up into short bite-sized segments that
are five to ten minutes long because my content is
so long that the majority of people don't watch it
even those of you guys who are hardcore fans of
my work you don't sit through the entire episode most
of the time and so my work therefore becomes very
inaccessible so this the idea behind this the second channel
is to make the work more accessible to make it
more shareable i know many of you have complained that
the episodes are too long uh and you can't share
them with your friends and family they won't sit through
them when they see a two three hour long episode
they don't even click on it and so this is
this is a really a huge problem that i've sort
of been dealing with for years and really i should
have launched this clips channel a long time ago just
i didn't fully connect the dots because i wasn't really
focused on the marketing aspects of things that much um
but it's getting to a point where it's necessary and
i think that um well it's necessary both from sort
of a business and marketing perspective for me um but
i think it's also necessary just from an accessibility standpoint
because the material it really needs to be like a
funnel where people get introduced to lighter aspects of the
work and then they can go deeper you know they
can go as deep as they want really the limit
is you how deep do you want to go with
me and so that's what this clips channel is about
right now um there's going to be a link down
below if you want to go subscribe to the channel
please do that helps helps us out to gain more
visibility and so forth in the algorithms you'll be notified
of new releases so i i hired an editor who's
going to be doing these clips he's doing a pretty
good job and we're still polishing stuff up we're still
going to be tweaking the format seeing what works what
doesn't over the next month but our plan is to
basically go through the entire back catalog of actualized content
which is something like three or four hundred hours of
stuff it's really quite a lot of work this is
going to be a multi-year long project we anticipate publishing
over a thousand clips over the next year or two
at a rate of about one to two clips per
day that's our initial estimates and plans we'll see how
that goes and whether he's able to keep up with
that or maybe even go a bit faster and then
of course every new episode that i release every full
long new episode that i release that will also be
clipped up and put up there hopefully within a week
or two of of the release and uh and yeah
so if you're a really hardcore fan of my work
and you really are patient enough to sit through a
whole two and a half hour long episode then you
really don't need this clips channel uh unless maybe you're
interested in in saving certain segments or sharing them with
friends and family uh but uh if you don't have
the patience to sit through all that well then this
is perfect for you subscribe to the clips channel and
you'll be getting little nuggets here and there on a
daily basis on a weekly basis and and then as
you get more interested in topics every clip down below
the clip there will be a link to the full
episode description then you can go and see the full
episode and and also one of the benefits of having
clips is that we're able to be much more specific
with the titles and with the topics right because when
i do a two and a half hour episode i
usually cover a dozen different topics in there and some
of those topics may be of interest to you and
others may not be but even more importantly there may
be aspects or topics there that are of interest to
you but you don't even know that yet but you
don't watch them anyways because it's too long to sit
through it and to comb through it and to find
the value in it so one of the benefits here
is to help you to to find what is valuable
for you in your own development path today a certain
episode might be useless to you but in five years
it will be valuable or maybe some nugget of that
episode is already valuable to you today but you're not
gonna sit through a two and a half hour episode
to dig out that nugget so that's uh those are
some of the trade-offs that come with short versus long
episodes all right that's it it's it's really just that
simple um uh subscribe if you like and stay tuned
for more you
