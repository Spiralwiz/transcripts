All right, this one's for all you youngsters in the
audience, should you go to college. In this episode, we're
going to take a deep look at the pros and
cons of going to college. What some of the alternatives
are, what some of the traps are, I'm going to
give you the real scoop, a lot of truth that
you're not going to hear anywhere else about the realities
of college and whether it's worth it or not, you
might be surprised at the conclusion that you reach, I'm
going to give you a powerful alternative to college if
you want to go down down that road. And we're
basically going to explore everything you need to build the
foundation for the rest of your life, right here. So
this is powerful stuff, stick with me, this material can
change the whole trajectory of your life. This is one
of the reasons I love shooting content for people who
are really young. Like if you're watching this, I'm assuming
you're between the ages of 18 and 20. Somewhere around
there in your teens. This is the perfect age at
which to begin self actualization, you're going to have such
a huge advantage over everybody else. So let's get into
that. First of all, what are my qualifications for talking
about this? Well, of course, I went to college, I
finished a four year degree, I graduated as a philosophy
major. I also studied aerospace engineering for two years, I
was a straight A student through high school and through
college, I took all the advanced classes in high school,
all the AP classes, I took a bunch of advanced
classes in university graduated, actually half a year early, within
three and a half years, I finished my degree, and
then moved on to other better things. And I'll be
talking more about my story here. Because it's actually pretty
interesting. I've gone through a lot of shifts in my
career, multiple careers, I've probably gone through four or five
different career changes, changing majors. At one point, I wanted
to be actually a philosophy professor. And I was looking
into that. So I looked at various kinds of possibilities.
And then also, after I left university, I became a
game designer, video game designer, professionally, I got paid to
do that work that a great studio, then I switched
from that to running my own online businesses, I did
web development, I did online marketing. And now I'm doing
self help spirituality philosophy through YouTube. So I've I've had
a very interesting journey. I've devoted a significant amount of
my life to try to figure out how to find
the right direction in my life. And in the principles
that I learned, I actually put into a course that
I created a 25 hour course specifically about how to
find your direction in life, it's called The Life Purpose
course you can find it on my website. So I've
helped 1000s of people, literally 1000s of people figure out
their life purpose through my course. And through interacting with
them. One on one coaching people, I also as a
life coach in between all those things, I got certified
for that, and I've coached many, many people on their
issues. And a lot of people have this problem of
not finding the proper direction in their life. So this
is a real deep passion for me, because my whole
life was really about trying to find my own sense
of purpose. So really, this question of whether you should
or shouldn't go to college, it's a much deeper question
than just that. The problem is that society has just
sort of programmed you with this idea that you should
go to college, that's sort of what your parents want
of you. That's probably what your teachers want of you
what your mentors want of you, maybe your friends, your
best friends, if they're academically inclined, they're probably shooting off
to college and going through all the college prep work
and all that rigmarole. So it's very easy just to
get caught up in that like, being part of a
sheep inside of a herd. And you just go along
with all of your friends and what everybody is, is
doing. And of course, all of the teachers in your
school and your high school, if you're going to good
high school, they're probably pushing you, you know, to take
all the hard classes and then to take the SATs
and get good grades and then apply to the best
schools, right? So this can be a trap, you have
to really carefully think about is this really going to
lead me to what I ultimately want in my life?
So we have to back up a step and sort
of zoom out and take a meta perspective and ask
ourselves, what is the point of all this? Why am
I doing all this? Why am I reading all these
books? Why am I going to all these courses? Why
am I taking all these tests, jumping through all these
hoops and going to these universities and then paying them
10s And even hundreds of 1000s of dollars for this?
Is it really worth it? And of course the answer
isn't so simple. It very much depends on what kind
of life you want to lead. So the ultimate thing
I want you to start to think about here is
not so much about college don't focus so much about
college, the College question focus more about really, the point
of all this is, you want to build your life
as quickly as possible. Right now you're in this critical
transition period, between the ages of 18 and 24, let's
say. And if you're not there yet, you're going to
be there very soon. So this, this period in your
life is the period in which you can make or
break your whole life, the entire foundation for your life
is getting set right now, really, between the ages, it
starts even earlier than that between the ages of 15.
And let's say, 25, this is where your whole life
is being set. And most people, what they do is
they piss this time away by playing video games, hanging
out their friends, smoking weed, getting drunk, and all this
sorts of stuff. And then just going through the motions,
and just following along with the herd of what their
friends and classmates and so forth are doing. This is
a very big problem in our society, you need to
start thinking independently and critically for yourself about what you
want out of your life. And chances are, you're already
behind the curve. Even if you're 18 years old, right
now, you're it's already too late. In a certain sense,
you should have started when you were 15, or even
younger, thinking about once you want for your life. See,
basically, it breaks down like this. If college is something
that's going to lead to how you ultimately want to
lead, lead your life, then go to college, otherwise don't.
So what do I mean by this, if you're interested
in in a very, sort of conventional traditional career track,
and you are planning to actually make a full, lifelong
career of 4050 years. In this conventional track, according to
some major in college, like, you know, you want to
be a physics professor, or you know, you want to
be a scientist, you know, you want to be an
academic, you want to be a historian, you want to
be a scholar, you want to be a professional philosopher,
you want to be an engineer, computer, you know, AI
researcher, a doctor, a chemist, these sorts of fields and
majors, if you know for sure that you want one
of these than college is going to be necessary for
you, basically, you can't avoid it, you have at the
very least you need the certificates and all that just
to go through that because like even engineering, you're probably
not even gonna be able to get an engineering job
without having some engineering certifications, which at least it's going
to require a bachelor's degree, probably at the very least.
So in that case, it's easy. And if you were
that type of person, you probably wouldn't be watching this
recording right now, the reason you're listening to this is
because you're probably not so clear. You don't have clarity
in your life about what you really want. You're waffling
around, you're uncertain, you're undecided. As many freshmen are when
they enter, university, they're undecided. They don't know what the
hell they want. And so they're there. They're wasting the
most critical period of their life, doing things without understanding
what they're doing or why they're doing it. Make sure
you don't fall into this trap. Right now, all of
your time. And attention should be focused on not hanging
around with your friends or playing video games, but sitting
alone in a room by yourself for hours contemplating every
single day for weeks, and for months. What do I
want out of my life? And then what will be
required to get what I want to get that thing
that I want out of my life? How am I
going to get there? What's a realistic plan? And of
course, look, I was in your shoes at your age,
to a certain degree. I was unclear exactly about what
I wanted from university. I first entered undecided but then
I also quickly went into aerospace engineering spent two years
doing that. Then I switched two years into it to
philosophy. And I'll tell you more about this story is
as we go deeper in this episode, but anyways, just
the point of it is, is that I know what
it's like to struggle with this. And of course, it's
difficult sometimes to know what you want out of life
because to know that you have to have experience and
at your age, you're so immature and so inexperienced that
you don't really know what you want and many of
the things that you might even think that you want,
you discover later that that's not what you really want.
And part of that is just trial and error. Testing
stuff out, and seeing that isn't fit for you. But
when you're going to do that, you have to do
it. See there's a sort of a, an unconscious, lazy
way of going about that. And then there's a conscious,
proactive way of going about that, if you just let
things unfold organically following the path of least resistance. And
you do it unconsciously not proactively, then what's going to
happen is, you're going to probably waste the next 510
years of your life, just, you know, making all sorts
of moves that end in dead ends, and they don't
lead you anywhere, you're going to waste the most precious
years of your life. Right now you've got abundant health,
if you're if you've been fortunate with that you've got
energy, you're young, this is the time to really invest
that into building the foundation for the rest of your
life here. So the first thing I want you to
see is that if you had that kind of crystal
clarity about what you really want from your life, these
sorts of questions wouldn't even arise for you, it'd be
very easy for you to make decisions about whether you
should go to college, what major you should select which
classes you should select, and so forth. That would be
very easy. Because you would know exactly what your end
goal was. And then you wouldn't be listening to me
probably. So you're probably unclear. And that is one of
the things that you need to one of your meta
lessons here is clarity. Clarity in life is critical. We're
not just talking about how to get through college here,
we're talking about how to ace all of life to
ace all of life, you need to be crystal clear
about what you want out of life. Otherwise, how can
you get it? When you have even you don't know?
How can other people give it to you? How can
other people help you? How can all the resources that
are necessary to make that happen? Come into your awareness
if you're not clear and insistent about what you want.
So the first lesson here is spend a lot of
time contemplating and just trying to become as clear as
possible. Now, you can't just do it all in your
head, I'm not saying that you can just sit alone
in a room and contemplate for the next 40 years,
you know, into the future about what your life should
be and plan it all out. That's not what I'm
saying. This is an organic process that will have to
unfold over five or 10 years or even more for
you as you're trying to figure yourself out. Figure out
who you are, and what you want out of life.
And part of that is going to be making some
tests and having some failures and going through various trials
you need experience. So exposing yourself to more experience is,
is crucial here. It's crucial. But also, it's not enough
just to go bumbling into various things without contemplating you
can accomplish a lot of work here and save yourself
years and even perhaps decades and also 10s of 1000s
of dollars just by sitting alone in a room and
contemplating a little bit more than the average person is
willing to do. See, don't go looking to your friends
in school, for good role models about how to set
up one's life. They don't know what the hell they're
doing. See, they don't know what the hell they're doing.
And your parents probably also don't know what the hell
they're doing. And probably even your teachers don't know what
the hell they're doing. They're stuck in some sort of
job, that's just paying the bills. That's, that's not going
to be sufficient for you to really excel in life.
What we're talking about here is excelling in life. What
we're talking about here is success, creating a deeply fulfilling
life for yourself. And in order to do that, you
need to understand yourself deeply. Which you don't, you might
think that well, but Leo, I understand myself, I know
what I like what I don't like, no you don't.
You don't that your age, you can't possibly know that
yet. You don't have sufficient experience. Here's other critical insight
for you about this topic. Each one of us, even
though we can look similar, and we can think that
we're all human and of course we are. We're similar
in many ways, but each one of us is also
very unique. We have a unique constellation of personality traits,
likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses. And God given gifts
and talents, that it's our life's work here, just to
be born is to undertake this life's work of discovering
these strengths and weaknesses that you have discovering your own
personality. Woody, becoming intimately familiar with that, and then constructing
a life that is in alignment with that, and not
at odds with it. Because if your life is going
to be the kind of life that most people lead,
then your life and your career will be at odds
with each other, your unique strengths and gifts will not
be fully actualized in the work that you do, and
what we're talking about here is ultimately work, you're going
to university, you're selecting a major, and then you got
to somehow connect what you're going to be studying in
university to the work that you're going to be doing
after you get out of university. So we're talking about
a career path for you here. And really beyond a
career path, we're talking about a life purpose. See, you
don't just want a career that pays you Well, that's
not going to be fulfilling enough for you, no amount
of money is sufficient to compensate you for 50 years
of working in a career that you don't like and
that you're not passionate about. You need to have deep
passion, about your career. Whatever that is. And don't let
anybody tell you what your career should be. Only you
can decide that your parents can't decide that for you.
One of the traps you're going to likely fall into
is you're going to try to pick a career that
your parents are going to pressure you into picking, because
it's one of those careers That's very kind of bankable
and tangible like engineering, programming, and becoming a doctor, a
lawyer, an accountant, this sorts of stuff. See, for these
careers, these are well trodden careers. These careers have existed
for hundreds of years, the university system is well designed
to prepare you for entering one of these careers. But
the problem is, is that if you're lukewarm about any
of these careers, it's not going to work for you,
you got to look for something that you're deeply, deeply
passionate about and passion here, don't let anyone fool you.
Passion is not a luxury, passion is an absolute necessity.
Because we're talking about 50 years of working in this
career, you can't excel at something for 50 years, when
you're not deeply passionate about it, actually, by picking the
career that you think is going to be the most
profitable for you, but that you're lukewarm about you're not
passionate about, you're actually over the next 50 years, you're
going to lose millions of dollars of value, you see.
Because if you would have picked the career that you
were really passionate about, that you could spin off, and
you can make millions of dollars doing that. Because your
passion is what drives you. If you lose your drive
and your motivation, because you're working some dead end job
as a wage slave, then you're losing so much of
your human potential, you have enormous creative human potential, all
of us do. The problem is how do you tap
into it? That's what's difficult. And nobody teaches you how
to do this, which is why I created the course,
my life purpose course 25 hours on this, there's a
lot to say about it. I had to research all
this stuff by myself through lots of trial and error
over a period of 10 years. See, but nobody in
your high school teaches you this stuff. Your parents don't
teach you this life purpose stuff. Even in university, they
won't teach you this life purpose stuff. So you have
to spend more time figuring out who you are, as
a personality, you're not even aware of your own personality.
Yet at your age, once you start to figure that
out, then you can start to figure out what will
and won't work for you. And then you can work
with your passions. And then you can start to tailor
a career around that. Make your career and basically tailor
your entire life specifically to who you are. That's what's
going to lead to the best life possible for you.
So I recommend that you stop screwing around, stop delaying,
and really take this critical next five years of your
life very, very seriously. This is your self discovery phase.
This is where you're building the foundation for everything else.
If you're unclear, get clear, it might take you years
to get clear. I'm not saying you can get clear
in a week or in a month. Now for those
of you who are clear and you know for for
sure that you want to be a lawyer and that's
what you're passionate about. Because you want to be a
judge in the future and you really love law of
whatever you know, something like that. Okay, colleges is for
you. It's perfect for you. But if if you're less
solid about that, and you're also thinking about one of
these sort of less tangible majors like maybe you want
to be an English major or a philosophy major You're
a psychology major, a sociology major, something where you're going
to get that major, but then you're probably not getting
a job in that major, like, you're probably not going
to be an English professor or teacher, after you get
your English degree, and you're probably not going to be
a historian, after you get your history degree, that's a
bit more problematic. And we're gonna spend a lot of
time talking about how to how to deal with that
kind of case. But of course, by all means, if
you want to, if you clearly know that, for example,
you want to be a professional psychologist, or a professional
sociologist, or a professional historian, by all means, of course,
go and do that. And then University is great for
you. They've got you covered. But you have to think
about where is your paycheck actually going to be coming
from? After you graduate, if you're not thinking about that,
you're screwing this whole thing up, you need a solid,
tangible plan for your paycheck. Because if you don't have
a solid tangible plan, I can tell you exactly what's
going to happen and where your paycheck is going to
come from. your paycheck is either going to come from
your parents, who you will be mooching off of for
a long, long time. And they probably won't like that.
And you won't like it either. Because by by taking
their money, you have to follow their rules, see their
strings attached with their money, it's much better to live
life, financially independent from your parents. So that's also a
key goal that you should be thinking about is how
to break out of your family move out and be
on your own become an independent person, this is going
to be huge for you. It's a game changer. This
is where life gets really, really interesting is when you
start to live by yourself without depending on others for
financial support, it's also quite challenging to figure this out.
So yeah, like I was saying, I can tell you
what the default is going to be if you don't
take what I'm saying you're seriously and you don't get
clear very fast about your career and life purpose, you're
going to end up in a dead end wage slave
job, working at Starbucks, something along those lines. That's, that's
even if you finish college. Insane. And if you get
something like an engineering major, but then you realize that
you don't like that, and you don't want to work
as an engineer, guess what, you're going to become a
wage slave working at Starbucks. And it's not going to
be very fulfilling. Because your talents and your creative potential
is all going to be going to waste as you're
pouring that coffee for eight hours a day, and getting
paid, you know, some minimum wage to do that. That
is not a good way to live life. And the
point of of earning a nice salary, which is going
to come of course, from you, figuring out your career
and being serious about it and developing your career. The
point of earning a nice salary is not to have
a bunch of money, or luxury, it's really to buy
yourself freedom, the freedom to live your life according to
your strengths, and your own unique personality and your passions
and your top values. That's what the point of that
is. I have an actual I have an episode called
How to Escape wage slavery, where I go into more
depth about this, this issue of wage slavery. It's it's
a big problem that many youngsters don't think about until
they get out of university and they realize, oh, wait
a minute. I'm 25 years old, I just graduated. But
I have no idea how am i I'm actually going
to pay my bills, and I have to pay my
bills. And hey, I'm just gonna go work at Starbucks
or whatever is available. This you've you've screwed up, you've
screwed up, you should have spent the the, the prior
10 years of your life already having a rock solid
plan for career and business. You see, when I say
business, some of you will think Oh, Leo, I'm not
interested in business. No, you don't understand what businesses. When
I talk about business, I'm not just talking about business
in the conventional sense. We're talking about the entire activity
of human survival. That's business. You care about business, you
deeply care about business, because you care about surviving. Businesses
not crunching some numbers or earning a bunch of money,
businesses survival. Really what we're talking about is if we
take the entire global community of humans, which is close
to 8 billion people, all of them comprise sort of
a social matrix. And within that matrix you need to
survive. So you're not surviving in the jungle. You're surviving
in this social matrix and to survive in the social
matrix. You need money. The money is just a means
of exchanging labor and surviving within the social matrix. And
so how are you going to be getting that money,
because you're gonna have to get it somehow. Because you're
committed to survival. You see, you have to survive, you
need food, you need electricity, you need probably some luxuries
like Cable Internet and other things like this, to live
the kind of life you want to lead. You see,
so are you going to be surviving on your terms
or on somebody else's terms, because if you're not going
to be consciously figuring out your survival, by figuring out
your career and your life purpose, and mastering business, then
you're just going to be somebody's wage slave. That's what
it's going to boil down to, that's going to be
the default position. And once you become a wage slave,
it's extremely difficult to break free of wage slavery. I
know I've been there. I was a wage slave for
about a year. I didn't like it very much. In
fact, I hated it so much, I quit, I quit,
I quit a promising career because I couldn't stand it,
I wanted to be my own boss. And the best
way to avoid or to escape wage slavery is not
to enter it in the first place to plan your
life out so well. So early, that you never even
enter wage slavery. That's possible, but you have to, you
have to go above and beyond in order to succeed
in doing that. Now, of course, there's nothing wrong with
a little bit of wage slavery here and there, if
you need to, to, you know, to hold yourself over,
that's fine. But in the long term, one of the
things I suggest you might be interested in, that you
might not even know that you're interested in, is escaping
wage slavery, or avoiding it. And you do that by
getting crystal clear about what you want out of life.
And coming up with a tangible plan for your career.
See, I was so clueless when I was your age,
that I didn't even understand this problem of wage slavery
and how much I wouldn't like it. The only way
I had to learn that was by actually entering into
it seeing Oh, no, this is not, this is definitely
not right for me. And then I had to work
really hard to break free of it. So start thinking
about this stuff. Now, let's talk about different kinds of
majors that you might be interested in. In university, if
you have a hard major, like engineering physics. You want
to become a medical doctor, whatever, the sorts of majors,
they're easier, in the sense that it's more clear about
what you got to do. To master these majors, then
by all means, go to university for those. Now, the
software majors, you can still go to university for those.
In fact, like I said, you know, philosophy, it's considered
one of the softer majors, actually, it's not soft at
all, philosophy is one of the most serious subjects that
there is, it's more serious and more important than physics.
But, and that's not how most people think of it.
Because most people don't really understand or do serious philosophy.
But anyways, yeah, there are these kinds of softer majors
that that you can major in is going to be
very difficult for you to get a job directly related
to that major. There's very few, for example, academic positions
as a professional philosopher, there are some you can become
a philosophy professor. But generally, these are plumb positions. It's
quite difficult to get one of these positions, and the
majority of people who become philosophy majors will never do
professional academic philosophy in their life after they graduate. So
what then well, you need a plan, you need a
plan. And here's where I'll tell you a bit more
about my personal story. Because it serves as a good
example here to illustrate some of these points. So I
entered university, basically, as an aerospace engineering major. I was
interested in aerospace engineering, I liked the idea of, you
know, the future of space, travel and, you know, sending
people to Mars, I thought that that was the future,
that would be cool. I thought it would be cool
to work on these kinds of projects. And so, sadly,
a cool major. So I went into that, and I
was good academically, so I could handle that. It was
pretty difficult. Courseload a lot of calculus and physics and
so forth. So I spent two years doing that. But
then I quickly realized, like, wait a minute, what is
going to be involved with his job? I have this
sort of fantasy of how what an aerospace engineer does,
which could be something like, you know, traveling to Mars
and so on and so on. But of course, that's
not really what an aerospace engineer does. An aerospace engineer,
in reality sits in a cubicle for eight hours a
day for 50 years of his life. Looking at to
a computer screen, you know, crunching numbers in Excel spreadsheets
and CAD software. And when I thought about that, and
I thought, I'm gonna be doing this for the rest
of my life, this is what my entire life is
going to boil down to is just sitting in a
cubicle for for 50 years. Hell no, there's no way
I can do that. But I already sunk two years
into this, I took all the hard classes, it felt
like, it was very difficult actually, psychologically and emotionally for
me to admit to myself, that this major wasn't going
to work for me. Because I already sunk a lot
into it. And I thought that, well, maybe I can
just toughed it out two more years, and then somehow
make it work in the future. No, that would have
been a huge mistake. So one of the most important
decisions I made in my life, was to cut my
losses here, admit the mistake, not try to whitewash it,
or sweep it under the rug or ignore it, but
to make the difficult choice to find something that I'm
really passionate about. And one of the things I was
always passionate about. And in fact, as as, as a
youngster I thought about doing professionally was video game design.
So I started to think more seriously about that. The
problem with that is that it's sort of a field,
that is not a traditional career path. It's not like
a lot, a lawyer or a doctor, or an accountant,
something like that, right? It's one of these more new
modern careers. And you know, there's always new careers that
are coming online, new careers are being developed by society
every single decade. And usually, they're not taught at universities,
not at the major ones, at least, there can be
specialized schools. But in my university, there was no game
design curriculum, no game design department, the closest thing would
have been computer science, which was not game design. I
wasn't interested in game programming. I wasn't interested in game
art. I was interested in game design, specifically. So one
of the problems I had here is I didn't know
could I really get a job doing this, it seemed
kind of like this one, the one of these kind
of fanciful, you know, kid dreams, like, you know, a
kid dreams about becoming an astronaut. And then when they
grow up, they they realized, no, that's too hard or
too unrealistic, or something like that. But I started to
research game design a little bit more. And I realized,
no, this, this is a legitimate field. And there can
actually be good money doing this. There's a big future
in it. And, and so I decided to switch, basically,
to game design. But there was, of course, no game
design classes in my university. So I said, Well, the
other thing that I'm passionate about, as I was, at
that point, late in high school, early college, I was
interested in philosophy law, I had a lot of deep
existential questions that I was asking about life, like, what
is life? Why am I here? What is all of
this? How do I become happy? How do you live
the good life? Of what is knowledge? How can we
know anything is true? This sorts of stuff, you know,
what is religion? And I was very, very interested in
these questions. And so I started to toy around with
the idea of like, well, it could be game design,
or I could become a like a professional philosopher. And
I was kind of toying with these different possibilities. But
I knew I couldn't do it all I had to
make some decisions here. And the definition of making a
decision is that you're making a cut between two different
possibilities, and you're cutting one off, you're deciding not this
one, but this one, right. So you're saying to no
to something when you're making a decision. So I hatched
this plan, that maybe I can go to a specialized
game design University, and I looked around for those I
actually found one in Seattle. That was pretty good. The
problem was that it was too expensive. And there wasn't
financial aid for it, my family couldn't really afford to
send me there. It was also far away from home.
So I would have to live and there's costs with
living in a different state from where, you know, where
my nearest University was near my home. So anyways, that
possibility was eliminated. So I hatched this plan that I
would go full in on game design, and I would
teach myself game design. I would switch my major from
aerospace engineering into philosophy, philosophy was a lighter course load.
It was also something I was more passionate about. And
I was sick of doing engineering coursework. So I really
wanted to study philosophy. And at the same time, while
I was studying philosophy, my plan was that I would
teach myself enough game design skills by doing various projects
and online tutorials and things like that. And just basically
teaching myself the skills, doing modeling work on various games,
and then I would be able to build a portfolio
and then use that portfolio to get hired by studios
after I graduated with my philosophy degree. That was the
plan. And then I went to work on that plan,
and actually, it worked out pretty well. I graduated half
a year early. And then I use that half a
year that I sort of saved by switching to philosophy.
I use that to, to do some, some serious game
design projects. And then from that I built my portfolio
and I applied to various game studios. And I was
actually lucky enough to get hired by one of the
top studios in the country. And really in the world.
I got hired by to Cape Austin or Irrational Games,
as you might know it. The who developed Bioshock and
and then they actually hired me right after BioShock was
released, they hired me to work on Bioshock Infinite. And
so I did pre production work on Bioshock Infinite for
about a year. And then after that, you know, even
though I got this amazing job, with game design, you
might think so you've made it Leo, you found this
great job, it's like the dream job and you finally
got it, you know, it's pretty hard to break into
the game industry as a designer. See, it's a lot
easier to break in as a programmer or as an
artist. But as a designer, it's pretty difficult to find
entry level design positions. But I was able to do
that. And the problem though, and I was making pretty
decent money. The problem though, is I didn't like being
a wage slave. I really hated it, I hated it
so much that I had to then give up on
that, on that idea of working for triple A studios,
I didn't want to do that. So then I had
to hatch a new plan to, to develop my own
businesses so that I can develop the Financial Independence to
stop being a wage slave and then do whatever I
wanted to do have the creative autonomy to create whatever
I wanted to create. And so I ended up doing
that spent several years learning web development and online business
did online marketing and so forth, I was able to
sort of bootstrap myself that way, made some decent money.
And then from there, stuff unfolded, and eventually I got
into self help. And then I got into what I
do now with actualized.org. And then I've been doing that
now for for eight years or so. So and then
also in between there i i got certified as a
life coach, I went through a life coach training, I
spent a lot of time learning self help, before I
started actualised.org. That's when I got my life coaching, training
and certification. And then I coached people, actual clients. So
anyways, that's kind of my story. As you can see,
I wandered around quite a bit, quite a bit, I
tried various things. And I think that, that's what you
got to do to really discover what you want out
of life. The problem that I see for most people
is that they try one thing, and then they get
kind of stuck in it. And it takes a lot
of inertia and emotional labor to break out of that
to try something else. And so they just, they get
lazy and they just get stuck in one thing. And
then it's not a good fit for them. But then
they just endure it for the next 4050 years of
their life. And it makes them depressed, it makes them
better, it makes them angry, resentful, and it robs them
of all their potential. And then they also have financial
difficulties. Because of course, when you present your job, you
can't really work well at it, you can't generate the
value and give a lot of value to the world.
And therefore the world is not going to give a
lot of value to you back. That's why passion is
so critical. And why passion is not a luxury. Because
passion is what allows you to create massive value for
people. And massive value creation is how you get well
financially compensated. So it is okay to wander around. And
also, this this, everything I talked about here was occurring
over a period of like 10 years, right. So it
took a while. It's not like I just sit down
and figure it all out in one go. But one
thing that I was always very adamant about, no matter
how much I wandered is I knew that what I
wanted was to live a life on purpose, I knew
that what I wanted was to be passionate about my
work. And I was very proactive and deliberate in pushing
myself to set up the foundation my life that I
wasn't unclear about that I was crystal clear about. And
that's why it worked. And that's why it doesn't work
for many other people because they're not crystal clear about
that. So it's not so important that you know right
now exactly which major you need to go into or
which career is going to be your ultimate career. What's
more important is that you're committed to figuring it out.
And you're working on that every single day, for months
and years on end. So one key distinction that's going
to help you is that realize that there's a big
difference between your fantasy, your imagination of what a job
is, and then the actual job itself. Like the fantasy
of being an aerospace engineer, you might imagine is going
to Mars and building cool rocket ships and stuff. And
then the reality of being an aerospace space engineer. He's
sitting in a cubicle looking at us screen for eight
hours a day at Excel spreadsheets. See, night and day,
night and day. So you have to make sure that
the actual job that you're going to be doing is
going to be something that you're satisfied with. And that
the difference between your fantasy are your image of that
job and the actual job is not too great. And
the way you disabuse yourself of these illusions and fantasies
is by actually going and doing some of this, some
of this work, like maybe you want to be a
writer, go try writing a short story and see how
that feels. Maybe you want to be a filmmaker, go
actually try to film a little indie film and see
how that feels, do you actually enjoy doing that? See,
because you might have this image of of a filmmaker.
But that's different from actually shooting a film, you might
not actually like the process of shooting a film, in
which case, you gotta go find something else. So here
are the top problems I have with college. First of
all, is the financial cost. And going into debt, this
is a huge problem, especially these days, as the costs
of Africa have risen, skyrocketed so much. And they're out
of control, you can easily spend 10 to $50,000 per
year, times four years, you can rack up 50 To
100 to $200,000 in student debt, depending on what kind
of universities you go to, of course, the more elite
universities are gonna be even more expensive. So here, of
course, it depends on what your financial situation is, if
your parents are wealthy, and they're going to pay for
everything, well, then it's, it's a little bit easier for
you to decide to go to university. On the other
hand, if your parents are poor, and they're not gonna
be paying for anything, and you're basically going to have
to have to get a bunch of loans, maybe you
can get some scholarships or grants, but probably not, you're
probably gonna have to incur some, some loans and debt
as well. That it's a much more iffy proposition. For
example, if right now, I would have to relive my
life over again, and someone told me that I would
have to accumulate $50,000 worth of debt. Once I graduate
at age 24, let's say, in order to get my
college education, I would say no, that's, that's dumb, it's
not worth it, it's not worth it. Because the debt
will, the debt will drive you so deep into wage
slavery, you're going to be looking for any job, you're
going to be desperate, like a desperate dog looking for,
you know, a little bit of food, just to survive,
just to pay your debts. And these debts from student
loans, you can't even clear them with bankruptcy, at least
not in America. Now, of course, if you're living in
one of these cushy Scandinavian countries that I hear about,
or in North Northern Europe, like in Germany, I hear
that supposedly they give you a free college education. That's,
that's pretty mind blowing. From my perspective, as an American,
and that's, that's pretty amazing. So if you've got that
kind of situation going for you, and I've even heard
that in Scandinavian countries, they will actually pay you a
stipend to go to university. So if, if you have
that opportunity, well, that might be a no brainer. Because
you gotta consider what's the alternative? What else are you
going to do with your life. Which brings us to
the second problem I have with college, and this is
actually an even bigger problem than the financial problem. This
is the problem of the opportunity cost. See, the four
years you're gonna invest in college, that's going to be
a lot of time studying, going to courses, and, you
know, you're gonna be doing that basically, basically, six days
a week, for the next four years. Think about what
else you could do with all that time. There might
be much better use of your time, especially because many
of these courses and classes that you're going to be
taking are going to be highly impractical, and are going
to be teaching you things and skills that are never
going to be used by you in your actual career.
So here, here, it's really important that you think about
how the actual skills and knowledge that you're gaining from
the actual specific classes that you're gonna be taking, whether
that's going to be knowledge and skills you're going to
be using on a daily basis for the next 50
years. And if it's not, then recognize that as a
giant waste of time. Now, don't get me wrong, there's
something very valuable about just education in general. I'm very
pro education. In fact, I'm so pro education, that my
critique of university ultimately is going to come down to
that it's not educational enough, not that it's too educational.
There's sort of a critique of university from above and
from below. My critique is from above. I've gone through
the system and I've seen the problems with system. And
to me actually, the education that's offered in universities, even
in really good ones is low quality education. Mostly even
if you go to MIT or Caltech or whatever, mostly
the education you're getting there is you're getting indoctrination. You're
memorizing you're cramming for tests. It's, they're not really teaching
you how to think very deeply about anything. They're also
not teaching you the the practical and important life skills
that you need to really be successful and fulfilled in
your life. There's a lot of academic mental masturbation in
these universities. Now, of course, you know, if you're going
to be a physics right researcher, then of course, yeah,
you gotta go through that. There's a lot to learn
about physics, and university will teach you physics very well,
or engineering or something like that. But if that's not
going to be your actual career, like, for example, I
spent two years learning advanced physics and calculus. And now
Now, what I do, the business that I do, even
when I do computer programming, I've done quite a bit
of programming through for web development. And also, as part
of my game design, skill set. And, you know, I
almost never used the advanced calculus, and physics, even game
development, it's rarely used. So I mean, it was a
giant, giant waste of time, in retrospect. So you got
to really think about all of the practical and useful
skills and knowledge that you could be learning versus what
the university classes will be teaching you. This is a
huge, huge world of difference here. I'm willing to bet
that for the majority of you, what the university is
going to be teaching you is not going to be
something you're actually going to be using ever in your
life, for the most part, and actually, sometimes they're going
to teach you stuff that you can have to unlearn.
For example, you might say, Well, what about English? I
mean, English is something you can learn in university, and
that's useful, you can use that in business and elsewhere,
right? Not so much. What I actually realized after after
learning four years of you know, advanced English writing essays,
and so forth. In university, when I got into the
business world, I noticed that all of those English skills
for academia were completely useless in business, completely useless for
marketing, completely useless for sales. highly impractical, very counterproductive. Very
arrogant, and obnoxious and pedantic. These sort of academic English
skills. I had to unlearn that, learn to speak more
conversationally, more casually. Even like in my in my content,
even in my recordings in my videos, I speak very
casually, I don't use a lot of complex academic terminology,
and so forth, even though I could I had to
unlearn that took me some years to unlearn that. So
in a certain sense, academia is this bubble of its
own. And it is possible to sort of get fooled
into thinking that the academic bubble is how it is
out in the real world in the business world. And
it isn't, it isn't at all. And this is one
of the problems with our current university education system. So
the opportunity cost is potentially enormous, you can spend the
next four years of your life in some major learning
some major, and then you're never going to use any
of those skills or any of that knowledge ever again,
once you graduate university, and this would be a huge
waste of time. And also money, if you're actually paying
for that if you get it for free. Okay, maybe.
But it's, it's a huge, huge waste of time. If
you really took your education seriously, you could learn so
many skills in four years, so many practical and valuable
skills. And one of the biggest problems today is we
have people who are graduating as English majors, history majors,
philosophy, major sociology, major psychology majors, even physics majors, whatever,
even engineering majors, but then they don't go into those
fields. And then also, when they get into the workplace,
they realize that everything they learned had nothing to do
with the actual work that we're going to be doing.
Even as an engineer, many of the things they teach
you in engineering school, I mean, they of course, they
teach you some some basic foundations like math and physics
that you're going to need no matter what, but many
of the things they teach you are not actually what
you're gonna be doing at your job when you're going
to be doing engineering. So, a lot of kids and
teens are fooled to this idea that well, I'm going
to graduate university and then I'm going to have this
fancy diploma and then I can you Who's that in
this degree in this? All these good grades that I
heard I can somehow use that to survive in the
business world? Because he once you leave the university academia
bubble, then you're in the business world. So don't tell
me that all ugly, I'm not interested in business. No,
you're very interested in business, because you're going to be
in business for the rest of your life. Once you're
out of university in academia, and even University academia is
its business. It's one of the business biggest businesses there
is. Its we'll talk about that in a second. It's
basically a pyramid scheme. More than a second. But let
me finish this point that I was on. So. So
yeah, you need skills that actually work in business, you
need tangible marketable skills actually offer value to your employers,
and to your clients and customers. Not just theoretical, know
how, or knowledge. And so the illusion is that you
think you're gonna go to university, you're going to work
really hard to get these good grades for four years.
And then after that, you think, Okay, I've made it
now I have all these valuable skills, right? No, you're
at Ground Zero, you spent four years running like a
hamster in a wheel getting nowhere. So be careful with
that trap. Now, let me talk about academia as a
pyramid scheme. Really, really, our education system right now, today
is still the Dark Ages. The education system is very
corrupt. It's very cut and dry. It's very much indoctrination,
just pure memorization. Even in great universities, this is true.
Sometimes you'll encounter the exceptional professor, or the exceptional class.
But for the most part, most classes are just paint
by numbers, indoctrination. And academia is a pyramid scheme. So
you understand why is because the reason they charge you,
you know, 10s of 1000s of dollars, hundreds of 1000s
of dollars of all the students on the bottom of
the pyramid, they need a constant churning of new students
coming in spending their daddies and mommies money. funneling that
money up the pyramid, then these universities, you know, they
have giant bloated budgets and so forth. And then they
pay all their professors fairly well, and the professors get
these tenured positions. But then to be within this university
pyramid scheme, there are only a few positions at the
top. So the amount of people who can actually become
professors who work at these top universities is extremely small,
these positions are extremely competitive, it's virtually impossible to get
them, you have to be the cream of the crop
to get these positions, and people are fighting over it,
and the majority people will not get them. But there's
some sort of an illusion that it could happen. And
the whole academic system is basically geared towards creating academics,
but the majority of people going to university will never
be academics or scholars, probably less than 1% of them
will be. And it's very difficult to succeed as an
academic or a scholar outside of academia, they don't basically
teach you those skills, they don't teach you the business
skills, you need to succeed in that not the marketing
skills or not the sales skills. And so basically, once
you've got this sort of academic degree, like a philosophy
degree, what are you gonna do with it? I mean,
you could try to become a professional philosopher, but that's
gonna be very difficult for you to do. There's not
enough positions. And so in a sense, is a pyramid
scheme. That depends upon new fresh minds getting pumped into
this meat grinder every single year. That's what these universities
run on, while they proclaim to be these bastions of
truth and wisdom and knowledge. Actually, the reality with universities
is that mostly the whole university system is geared towards
stupid people. It's factory farming, education, factory farmed education, the
way that we factory farm cattle is the same way
that we educate people in universities. There there's not a
lot of consciousness or wisdom in the education system. Now,
we have to be careful here, because there are some
serious benefits to university education. I'm not just trashing the
whole thing. There is value in just general education. General
Education rounds you out as a as a human being.
It gives you a sort of a breadth of of
knowledge about history, about art, about science about math just
that is important. Because otherwise what we have is we
have a population of morons and these morons will then
not be very good citizens and lead to all sorts
of catastrophe catastrophes. Social and Political. For example, look at
what's going on right now in our political situation in
America, and also in many parts of the of the
world. Nationalism is on the rise. Fascism is on the
rise. authoritarianism is on the rise, conspiracy theories are on
the rise. All of this is directly related to lack
of education. Look at who votes for example, for Donald
Trump, the people who vote for Donald Trump, one of
the most clearest distinguishing features of those who do and
those who don't vote for Donald Trump is that those
who do, by and large, don't have a college education.
And that's why they get suckered into the kind of
nationalistic ideologies that this con man is, is peddling. Because
when you go to college, at least what the college
will teach you, if you're going to good college, they
will teach you how to evaluate your sources, how to
distinguish which sources are high quality, which are low quality
sources, they will set standards and norms for you intellectually,
they will, they will instill in you a sense of
intellectual honesty and integrity. They will steer you away from
radical ideologies and conspiracy theories, because this doesn't pass academic
muster, you see. And that's very, very valuable. Otherwise, what
we get is we got a population of morons and
half the population even more, basically doesn't have a college
degree, college education. So they don't have any of these
kinds of standards, they become very easily susceptible to all
sorts of propaganda, conspiracy theories, cults, ideologies, that become very,
very toxic, and ultimately can lead to things like you
know, authoritarianism, Fascism, Nazism, and so forth. Serious stuff, serious
stuff. So I am very pro education. Again, like I
said, my critique of the university system is that it's
actually not enough of the right kind of education. For
example, the most important things that a human needs to
know the practical skills, the kind of stuff that I
teach with my channel with actualize that org, the self
help skills, the psychology skills, this the deep existential understanding
of reality, practical life skills. These are not taught in
university at all. I mean, it's, it's just absurd. It's
completely absurd and backwards. Really, what I'm teaching here is
rule through my work, through actualize that org is what
university education should be about. But of course, it's not
about that at all. And it can't be because it
would be too big of a political powderkeg. Because the
stuff that I teach, actually, will seriously transform your whole
life and society. But that's exactly what a pyramid scheme
doesn't want, is to be deeply transformed. And revolutionized, right.
So there's vested interests, that keep this corruption in place.
And another problem with with university that I was actually
shocked to discover is that even if you select the
major that you're interested in, like I selected philosophy, but
actually, I couldn't. And I wasn't allowed to study the
stuff that I really love within philosophy. I had to
study philosophy that was, according to their strict little schedule.
Like if you want to graduate in four years, you
have to take classes on a very strict schedule. And
a lot of times what would happen is that there
were like, there was a philosophy class that I really
wanted to take. But I couldn't take it because it's
time slot conflicted with another philosophy class that I had
to take, because it was like a formal requirement of
getting the degree. So I had to take this one,
which I wasn't interested in. But the one I was
interested in, I couldn't take because the time slot was
a conflicted. And this happened to me numerous times. So
I was actually very disappointed with with academic philosophy, because
the most interesting aspects I had to learn myself just
off on my own, and in a sense, university was
taking time away and all the homework assignments and all
the all the readings and all the tests and essays
that I had to write all of that was taking
time away from me just studying philosophy. It's actually much
better to study philosophy off on your own than it
is through some sort of formal university system. See, the
reason I say that colleges is designed for dumb people.
It's designed for people who are not capable of disciplining
themselves and educating themselves. So they go into this mechanical
meat grinder process. This process is just a set of
steps of paint by numbers that You go through these
steps, you go through these classes, you do these things,
and then supposedly you're educated. And now, they give you
a certificate. But I mean, that's so stupid, because all
the subjects have so much depth and nuance to them,
your certificate says nothing about how much you really understand
about your subject. See, just because you have a philosophy
degree doesn't really mean you understand philosophy, even if you
have a philosophy PhD, that doesn't mean you understand anything
about philosophy, I can run circles around a philosophy PhD
professor, cuz I've studied philosophy so deeply on my own,
but I don't have a PhD. So most would consider
me like a bad philosopher, because I don't have a
PhD. But actually, in the actual substance of understanding, my
understanding is way deeper than any academic philosopher, or any
physicist, or any psychology, like my understanding of human psychology,
is an order of magnitude deeper than any academic psychologist
or therapist. In a university, why is that precisely because
the university doesn't allow you for the really deep understanding,
they allow you, or what they do is they sort
of, they funnel you into a very standard way of
thinking about your field. And that can be very limiting.
If you're someone who's ambitious, like me, and really wants
a lot out of life. So you have to figure
out how ambitious Are you? How self driven, are you?
How motivated are you? How willing are you and able
are you to discipline yourself? Because if you are good
at all those things, then maybe you don't need university.
University is mostly for sheep. Not for independent, highly creative
thinkers. It's like a religion. You see, for a lot
of people, what they need is they just need a
standard meat grinder system that they go through. Like with
religion. Religion works for a lot of people precisely because
it involves no thinking. Most religious people are not interested
in asking deep metaphysical questions and epistemic questions about the
nature of self, and life, and reality, and death. And
these sorts of things are not interested in contemplating this
stuff at all. What they want is they just want
to be told when to arrive, who to listen to,
and what to believe. So it goes like this, someone
tells them, okay, show up on Sunday, from 9am, to
1pm. Listen to this guy standing at the pulpit, he
will tell you everything about life, and everything about death
and the afterlife, and how to live the good life
and what you need to do. And you need to
follow these 10 Rules these commandments. And as long as
you follow those, and you say 10, Hail Marys, and
you come and you confess your sins, you know, once
in a while, then you're good, you're gonna have the
good life. See, for many people, that's extremely appealing, because
they're just sheep, they just want to go through this
mechanical process. They're not interested in actually getting dirty with
life and trying to figure it out for themselves. And
this is true for many people who join institutions, groups
and organizations. It can be companies, corporations, nonprofits, political parties,
and universities. There is an appeal to that kind of
highly institutionalized bureaucratic mechanical system, you don't need to think
very deeply, you're not constantly confused. You don't need to
worry about disciplining yourself, because they tell you when to
show up and what you need to do. If you
had to do that all on your own, if you
had to figure out how to educate yourself all on
your own, that would be a serious challenge. But also,
it might come with a serious reward or benefit that
you couldn't get any other way. One of the illusions
that universities sort of fools you into because it's convenient
for their pyramid scheme, is this idea that your your
credentials, or your degree is worth anything. Or that your
grades matter. They don't. Your degree means nothing. Literally nothing.
It doesn't matter what your degree is, doesn't matter what
your major is, doesn't matter what your grades is, none
of that matters. What matters is how much value are
you able to offer the world? How creative Are you
able to be? How much are you able to help
fellow human beings in ways that they need? If you
can do that, then you'll have an easy time surviving
in the world. And if you can't, no matter how
many degrees you have and majors and what major you
are or what grades you get, that doesn't matter. Never
in my life has somebody asked me, Hey, what were
your grades like, back in university? Never, never not one
of my employers, not one of my clients, they don't
care. And for that matter, nobody ever has asked me
for my degree or for a certificate on anything. It
doesn't matter. Of course, some of course, I get hundreds
of 1000s of YouTube comments over the years. So reading
all those, of course, some people do ask me sometimes,
but But generally, like, no serious person asks me for
my degree, on anything. Because the value I offer the
world does not depend on any degrees or certificates. All
that's bullshit. That's just human bullshit. What it depends upon
is, Can I offer you some insights, some wisdom, some
techniques, some ideas and concepts that will be helpful to
you and you for yourself will clearly see that they're
helpful, or they're not. And if they're helpful to you,
you'll want to do business with me. And if they're
not, you'll go away. And that's generally how the business
world works. People don't care about what your qualifications are,
what they care about is what you can do for
them. So like, as a computer programmer, to be an
amazing computer programmer, you don't need a college degree. In
fact, if you spend four years by yourself, just learning
computer programming, I can almost promise you, you'll be a
better computer programmer than if you spend four years in
computer science as a computer science major. The real skills
are mostly learned outside of university, off by yourself on
your own working on your own projects. So that's the
reality of it. Now, is there you might say, well,
Leo, the way you're portraying this then University sounds terrible.
No, it's not terrible. There are benefits to university. So
first of all, getting a general education, a well rounded
education that is important. And honestly, most people don't know
how to educate themselves. So if the option is between
you not educating yourself at all, and just, you know,
going to work at Starbucks, versus getting four years of
a decent university education. I would much rather you get
this. Because if you just go work at Starbucks after
high school, you're gonna be an idiot for the rest
of your life. Probably. Read much rather you have this.
But, but you could have so much more than this.
See, there's there's so much more here. The question is,
how much are you really willing to invest here? Are
you really willing to go above and beyond what everybody
else is doing, and just being a sheep herded through
this meat grinder system. If you are, then I've got
some amazing ideas for you here in a minute. Let
me finish though, with the benefits of college. So it's
an easy way to educate yourself. It's, it's also very
good for socialization, actually. And that's one of the things
that I one of the biggest mistakes probably, that I
made in my life is that I focused so much
on career development, for the first 25 years of my
life, that I didn't put any of my skill points,
so to speak, into socialization relationships, and I was very
deficient in that department, with dating and so forth. Basically,
I was so focused on building this foundation for my
life that I didn't leave any room for, for dating
when I was in high school and in college. And
in retrospect, this was a mistake, because those were the
perfect times to develop socialization skills, dating skills, experience with
sexuality, and so forth. Because it's much more difficult to
develop these things later, after you graduate university. So you're
going to be missing a lot of opportunities there. But
also, I should warn you, though, that a lot of
people make the opposite mistake of what I made. I
swung my pendulum too much into the sort of career
direction. Most people though, I see them swing in the
opposite direction of they get so lost in relationships and
in dating and sexuality. When they're at this age, they
go, you know, to frat parties getting drunk and having
sex and all this and then falling in love into
these into these kind of shallow, frivolous and fatuous infatuated
sort of relationships. That lasts for months or maybe for
a year then they end and it's just a string
of broken relationships. And it just this sort of sort
of young foolish love, that ends up wasting a lot
of your emotional energy because you know, these relationships once
you fall in love in these relationships, you know, they
can be so emotionally draining that it is going to,
it's going to take all of your focus away from
your career, building this foundation for yourself, actualizing yourself developing
yourself. All the stuff that I talked about that you
know, forget it, you can, you can easily lose years
and years of your life, the prime of your life,
this critical phase of your life, to these sorts of
stupid, you know, sexual escapades, you have to be careful,
you have to kind of balance it out, find a
healthy middle ground there. So yeah, college is good for
that. And again, if if you're very clear about you
know, becoming an engineer or a doctor, then yeah, college
is great for that, too. But other than that, I
don't have much, much positive to say about college. Other
than that, it's better than working at Starbucks. I mean,
you have to consider alternatives. Like if you don't go
to college. This is one of the biggest fears I
have in giving this advice to people is that if
I tell people that node college sucks, and then they
just say, Okay, well, fine, and then they do nothing,
and then they just end up going to Starbucks. Well,
in that case, I would have rather shot a video
telling you how great colleges, because that would have served
you better. My point in criticizing college is to show
you a higher path. So let's talk about that a
little bit here. What is the higher path? What is
the alternative to college, the alternative to college is a
serious commitment to self education. Take all that time, and
money and energy and focus and emotional labor, and channel
it all into the most important skills that you will
need to survive and to succeed in life. And all
the things you're most passionate interested about? Create your own
curriculum, what do you want to study, don't ask somebody
else to tell you what that is. In this way,
your self education can be far superior to college, you
can learn a lot more a lot faster. Because what
you'll be learning is the stuff you really love. When
you're studying what you really love, you learn it very
fast, you've heard it very deep. And also, it'll be
a lot more practical. Because the way I recommend you
learn is not by reading textbooks, but by actually doing
projects. And this is how I basically taught myself most
of the skills that are most important in my life
that I have used to create a lot of success,
you know, I've created millions of dollars worth of success
for myself. And I'm still only in my mid 30s.
So I have been successful using these techniques. I'm not
just you know, sitting up here talking to us as
some sort of poor person who's barely scraping by, I've
been, I've been running my own businesses for 10 years
now. I've been financially fully financially independent, free of wage
slavery for 10 years, doing great for myself financially, you
know, able to buy myself a house, a car, everything
zero debt, no financial difficulties, how was I able to
do that by building really powerful skills, very marketable, valuable
skills. Mostly through doing my own projects, I would have
an idea of what I want to work on cradle
project for it work on it. For example, the way
I became a game designer and got hired by one
of the best studios in the world to work on
Triple A games. That's not easy to accomplish. How did
I accomplish that? I spent seven months developing a mod.
Actually I developed a mod for Oblivion is one of
the most popular mods called loss buyers. Maybe you played
it for Oblivion, spent seven months developing that full time,
full time, I learned so much about game development, developing
that mod. I made a lot of mistakes, but also
learned when you're developing your own projects, you learn skills
much, much better. I also taught myself web development, I'm
pretty good at Front End Web Development. I also know
how to do some back end web development. I'm fluent
in HTML. CSS, I'm really good with CSS. I know
some PHP. I do. I did a lot of graphic
design, front end graphic design for websites created a lot
of different websites that I didn't really publish but just
kind of for myself. And I was doing that all
throughout my teenage years, I was just kind of interested
in web development by working on these projects. And I
learned web development much better than I could learn it
if I went to university for that. So the way
that you educate yourself very deeply is that you work
with these projects, you try different projects, these projects can
be something that ranges from a month to complete two
months to complete, sometimes six months to complete. Don't work
on projects that take too long, because one of the
biggest mistakes you can make is you can come up
with a project that's so gargantuan and so ambitious, it'll
take you five years to complete it and then you
never will. So keep your project small also by tinkering
around with stuff like if you want to be an
engineer, one of the best ways to learn to be
an engineer is just start tinkering with whatever you want
to do. You know, if you're interested in robotics, start
tinkering with little robotics. You can go by like a
little robotic set online or at the store and start
tinkering with that and then start machining your own little
robotic parts and so forth. You know, buy motors and
buy wires and buy solar panels and hook them up
together. And then, you know, try to create something. This
is much more valuable actually, than just what you're going
to be learning at university. Also, through freelancing, you can
do freelancing work. Like if you want to learn to
be a computer programmer, a web designer, whatever, a writer,
you can take small, low paying freelance gigs. And these
freelance gigs. What's so great about them is because you're
gonna be interacting with a boss, somebody who's hiring you,
a client, this claim is going to have real world
demands upon you real business demands, not just some academic
bullshit, but real business demands. And if you're able to
meet those demands, that shows you what you need to
be successful in the world, how to survive, how to
earn a decent paycheck, and then you can take those
skills and you can keep amping them up, and then
keep raising your rates. And slowly, you can do better
and better freelancing. And then you can parlay that off
into an actual job, full time career for you know,
for some employer, and then you can use your freelancing
gigs as a, you know, as a nice resume piece
to show your employers that you know what you're doing.
Likewise, with these projects that you build, one of the
reasons these projects are so amazing is you can document
these projects. And you can create a portfolio of these
projects. And one of the best ways to get hired
is not with a degree. But with an amazing portfolio.
If you want to get hired as an artist, as
a computer programmer, as a web designer, as a filmmaker,
as a video editor, as a producer, as a whatever,
have a few projects make the very, very small but
polished, and present them to prospective employers and they will
want to scoop you up. Nothing impresses an employer more
than a well polished project, you don't, you don't even
need a bunch of projects, really one solid well polished
project in any field that you want to work in,
will be enough to land you a great job. So
this is a hands on project based education. And when
you're trying to accomplish these projects, of course, it's difficult.
A lot of times you you stumble and you you
run into technical challenges, trying to create these projects. But
that's how you learn the most, not by reading stuff
in a textbook or listening to Professor by actually trying
to do it, and failing and failing and failing and
failing. And then but pushing yourself to succeed no matter
what, despite all the failure. And through that you will
learn you will find the books, the tutorials, the mentors,
and so forth that are necessary. Speaking of which, there's
amazing, just utterly amazing untapped potential for self education. Now
through the internet. You can easily buy cheap books on
any subject that you want to learn about easily on
Amazon used books for for pennies and dollars, you can
find them easy, easy, easy, why pay universities, ridiculous amounts
for you know, hundreds of dollars for textbooks 1000s of
dollars for textbooks, when you can buy better books on
Amazon, much cheaper. This is part of the university grift
and the pyramid scheme. They upsell you on these ridiculous
textbooks. That don't even teach you the best skills. I
mean, if you were paying $200 for a textbook that
taught you best skills, okay, I can justify that. But,
but it doesn't. That's the problem with there's much better
ways to learn. Right now on the internet, you can
find online courses, tutorials, videos, workshops, seminars, training programs, conferences,
on almost any subject, you want to learn, you want
to learn business, you want to learn marketing, you want
to learn sales, you want to learn psychology, you wanted
to learn life coaching, you want to learn art, you
want to learn 3d modeling, you want to learn programming,
you want to learn engineering, whatever it is, you can
find courses for it online. A lot of times for
free, sometimes for for money, sometimes you'll have to pay
$200 $500 $1,000 for a course. And you might say
well $1,000 for a course that's a lot. That's that
sounds like a ripoff. No, it's not. Actually it's a
much better value than what you're paying in a university.
You're so overpaying in a university, precisely because it's a
captive system. Once you're in the university, they expect you
to buy all their books and take all their programs
and all their courses. And for that you're paying 10s
and even hundreds of 1000s of dollars. Investing in your
own education is one of the best investments you can
make. It's such a good investment that I would I
would give you this advice. Don't even worry about how
much it costs to buy a book or an online
course or a video or a workshop or a seminar.
All of this stuff will pay for itself many many
times over over the course of your life. A seminar
or workshop a well selected one will teach you so
much more than any single college class could. There are
a lot of very specialized amazing training programs available. You
can find training programs about art, illustration, you know, design,
media, marketing, sales, almost anything, go search for them. Sometimes
they cost 1000s of dollars, don't be cheap, be willing
to pay that. Appreciate the value that these training programs
are giving you. Conferences, go to conferences and meet people
who are interested in the things that you're interested in.
For example, one of the one of the most important
things I did when I was trying to become a
game designer, is I went to the Game Developers Conference
held in San Francisco every March. I remember I went
when I was like 23 years old, I was really
young. It was actually my first time that I ever
flew somewhere outside of like my home city, without my
parents. So this guy, I convinced them to buy me
a ticket, I said, you know, I need this, I
need to go to this conference, because maybe I can
make some connections and get a job. So my parents
agreed. So they bought me a ticket. And I flew
out there and got a hotel cheap hotel, stayed in
San Francisco for a week, made some important connections, spoke
with other designers and developers at this conference. And I
actually there was like a employers booth there is like
section with with employer booths, I went to these booths,
I got business cards from all the you know, the
people who are all the studios that were looking to
hire designers. And then from from that alone, I almost
landed a game design job from that alone. Because the
connections that I made, I learned a lot about the
industry through that. So whatever profession, you're going to be
a part of make sure you go to the conferences,
it's worth it, sometimes the conferences can cost $1,000 or
more. And then you have to add on top of
that, you know, hotels and airfare, it's worth it, it's
worth it. Because you can make important connections, find employers,
find mentors. And, and that's a powerful way to learn
too is through a mentor, try to find yourself a
mentor, find people who are already successful in the field
that you want to be successful in and then see
if you can, if they're willing to mentor you, if
there's some, you know, low level work that you can
do for them. And then in return, they they share
their wisdom and insights and experience with you. That's a
very powerful method. Another method for self education is modeling.
And modeling is sort of an NLP concept. Actually, what
it means is probably not what you think modeling means
you find some role model of a professional or somebody
who you respect, who's doing what you want to do,
who has a certain skill set that you want. And
then what you do is you carefully you talk to
them, you interview them, and then you you break down
exactly what it is that that they do to be
successful at what they do. So maybe you find like,
a really successful business person that you admire. And then
you do an interview with them. And then you ask
them specific. Okay, so how did you become so good
at business? Like, what kind of books do you read?
And then how much time do you spend like in
the morning on the internet? And how much time do
you spend on email? And how much time do you
spend, you know, doing conference calls? And how much time
do you spend reading books? And how much time do
you spend actually, with your employees and, and you break
all this down and then you try to actually replicate
that in your own life. And then by doing that,
you can replicate their their results. So there are enormous
opportunities for self education. The the biggest caveat I have
to give here, though, is that warning. It's easy to
fool yourself that you're going to educate yourself, but then
actually be lazy and not do it. So the self
education approach is really only suitable for those who are
very ambitious, very driven, very passionate, and are willing to
discipline themselves. It is hard to discipline yourself. You University
helps you with that. Because it gives you a specific
schedule, you just go to the classes at the right
times. And then the rest is sort of easy. But
nobody's going to give you a schedule. When you're self
educating. Nobody's going to tell you how many pages you
should read per day. Nobody's going to tell you which
books to read, which courses to take. You can easily
just slack off and watch TV or play video games
or smoke weed or go have sex or go jerk
off or whatever. You can you can do that in
place of self education, and waste a lot of time.
And if that's going to be you, then I'd rather
have you go go to a university, where at least
they will give you some discipline and structure. So you
see, it all very much depends upon you. Only you
can decide what the right choices are in your life.
Do not make the mistake of outsourcing the executive decision
making for your life. Don't ask anybody to tell you
what your major should be. Don't ask anybody's opinion about
what your major should be. Not your parents, not your
friends, it doesn't matter. Only you can know what your
major should be. And don't ask others to tell you
whether you should go to university or not, or whether
you shouldn't become a business person or not. Or whether
you should learn a specific skill set like should I
learn computer programming or not. You have to decide that
depending upon where you see your life going. So you
need to have a vision of where you're going to
go. All of the most important skills that I developed
to lead to my success today have come from independent
self education, from reading from books, from tutorials from projects,
These skills include web development, game development, programming, philosophy, psychology,
self help and personal development, dating and relationships and sexuality,
online marketing, sales, business, nutrition, health and fitness, socialization. Increasing
my self esteem and confidence, public speaking. And of course,
the spiritual topics that I talk about. These are in
a sense, some of the most important skills you can
learn. And speaking of which, here are a list of
skills that you should be laser focused on for the
next five or 10 years of your life developing proficiency
and expertise with the following skills. Because these are the
skills that are the foundation that everybody needs to really
create a fulfilling life for themselves. And these will not
be taught to you for the most part in university.
That's the worst part. You have to take responsibility for
building these yourself. So business sales and marketing. These are
hugely important. Even if you think that you don't like
business, sales and marketing. I don't care if you're an
artist. I'm a very artistic creative person. Personally, I don't
like business. I don't like sales. I don't like marketing.
I hate marketing. I hated marketing with a vengeance. I
forced myself to learn it, because I knew I had
to in order to escape wage slavery. And so I
did. Only thanks to that, was it possible. If you
don't understand business, sales and marketing, you're gonna be struggling
financially for the rest of your life, you're going to
be financially clueless, and dependent on others for the rest
of your life, basically. Next is self help and personal
development. Go to a bookstore. Ask for the self help
aisle, every book and every topic covered in that self
help aisle is full of the most valuable information that
you could possibly learn in your life. All of that
will transform your life. And if you want a really
good list of specific books, I have a list of
self help books that I review, over 200 there, these
books will transform your whole life go check it out
on my website, university does not teach self help topics
at all. It's an embarrassment. It's just a complete travesty.
This is one of the most important fields. Don't let
others poopoo Self Help for you and tell you that
it's a bad field full of pseudoscience and an airy
fairy nonsense, nothing can be further from the truth. The
Self Help field is one of the most practical fields,
which is why it's one of the most successful fields.
More self help books are sold than probably any other
books. Year over year over year. It's not a fad.
The reason it is this way, it's a multibillion dollar
industry. The reason it is this way is because it's
so useful to people. The next skill set is Psychology.
You need a deep understanding of human psychology and your
own psychology. Not in an academic sense, but in a
practical sense, what I teach through actualize that org emotional
mastery is another skill set. Learning about your emotions. That's
also something I teach through my videos. But you can
find books on that as well. Mastering your emotions, then
of course dating relationships and sexuality. There's a lot to
learn there and they're not going to teach that to
you and university for sure. language is important learning proper
and good writing and speaking skills. And what they teach
you in university is not at all adequate for the
kind of writing and speaking skills you need. In the
business environment. History is important to learn. I think there
are a lot of deep lessons from history. And actually
history is one of the things that university excels at
teaching. But you can also learn history just as well
by yourself, not within a university, you don't need to
pay 10s of 1000s of dollars to learn history, you
can find online courses and so forth to do that.
The next set of skills is spirituality, philosophy, epistemology and
existential questions about reality. You might think that spirituality is
some sort of airy fairy thing. And it's not important,
because it's not tangible. Nothing can be further from the
truth. You basically, it's impossible basically, to have a fulfilling
life without a spiritual connection. Your rationality is not going
to carry you, I don't care if you're a scientist,
if you're a nerd, if you're a computer programmer, you're
not going to have a sixth truly successful what I
consider a successful life without delving into spirituality, and philosophical
and epistemic topics and existential topics, topics that have to
do with life and death. With what is the nature
of reality, this is also something, I covered a lot
of depth here and actualize that org. And then lastly,
awareness, consciousness and mindfulness, these skills. And educating yourself about
what awareness is and how it works, and what consciousness
is and how it works and developing mindfulness skills, meditation
skills, absolutely a game changer, crucial, absolutely crucial. And it's
a travesty that none of this is taught in universities
at all. Truly, We are in the dark ages. So
now, the decision is up to you do you want
to go to university or not? Again, it very much
depends on your priorities and who you are, I can't
tell you what to do. I've shown you the pros
and cons of some of the various traps that are
here. One last bit of advice I want to give
you is that if you're thinking of going the sort
of self education, Route, be careful, don't fool yourself, self
education is difficult, you're gonna have to work harder to
self educate yourself, then by just going to university, it'll
be harder. But also the payoffs will be greater. And
if you're going to go down that road, then here's
some advice for how to convince your parents of this.
See, because your parents probably want you to go to
university. And they meant they may not trust you. For
example, with your self education approach, they also might not
trust you, with a certain soft major, like maybe you
want to become a philosophy major or sociology major, they
might not trust you with this, they might want you
sort of like the classic Indian family, you know, they
might want you to become a lawyer or a doctor
or an engineer or something like that. So what do
you do in this case? Well, first of all, you're
18 years old, maybe you're 20 years old, at this
age that you're at, you're basically a grown adult, you
have to start acting like that. You have to stand
up for your own passions and your own values. So
sometimes your parents will give you bad advice. One of
the worst piece of advice your parents can tell you
is to become an accountant. When you hate accounting, or
have no passion for accounting. It's one of the worst
pieces of advice. So one of the ways to help
get your parents on your side is to show them
that even if you're going to choose a major like
philosophy, or like sociology or whatever, that you have a
tangible plan for your survival, because that's what your parents
are really concerned about. See, even more so than you
being educated, they just want you to survive, which is
why a lot of these Indian families will want you
to become a doctor or a lawyer because they know
that if you're going to be a lawyer, you're going
to survive without much difficulty. But if you become a
philosopher or an artist, or a filmmaker or a game
designer, then they think that you're probably gonna be starving
and asking them for money. So you can assuage some
of those fears, by coming to your parents with a
practical plan of how you're going to be developing your
most essential and important survival skills, separate from your university
education, whether you go to university or don't I still
recommend the self education approach. Even if you go to
university. That's not enough. That's not enough to succeed in
life. Even if you go to university, you're going to
still have to be developing most of these important skills
by yourself. Nobody is going to teach you self help,
or meditation or spirituality or Business and Marketing skills at
university. And these are crucial skills that you're going to
need, and they're going to pay dividends for you for
the rest of your life. So for example, one of
the things that I did when I switched to philosophy
is I told my parents that yes, I'm switching to
philosophy, but don't worry, because I'm going to be seriously
developing practical skills in game development and other things that
are gonna I'm going to be building a portfolio, I'm
going to be building, you know, my resume and developing
these tangible skills, programming skills, web developer skills, all these
skills that I'm going to use to get a job.
So don't worry that I'm taking philosophy. That helps. And
then, of course, more than just talking about you got
to demonstrate it, your parents have to see that you're
serious about it, and that you're doing it every single
day. It's not enough just to say it, and then
go play video games all day, or smoke weed, or,
you know, hanging out with your friends all day. You
got to actually be serious. Now's the time to be
serious, you're an adult, start acting like it. If you
want your parents and others around you to treat you
like an adult, if you want to be able to
drive a car and to buy booze and buy weed
and this sorts of stuff. And you want people to
take you seriously start acting seriously. See, the problem is
you want people to treat you like an adult. But
then you still behave like a child. It's time to
get serious. It's time to take the growing up process
seriously started to take life seriously, time to start taking
life seriously, time to start taking your own development Seriously.
Stop. Stop, just expecting others to grow you. That's what
was happening through the first 12 years of your education
through elementary school, middle school and high school. Basically, the
adults in charge, were trying to serve you for your
own benefit, to teach you things that they thought you
might need later in your life. That's what was happening
throughout the first 12 years of school. And you just
went along with their plan. The whole beauty of education
is to finally break free of all the stuff that
you were told you had to learn. And now start
to learn the stuff that you really care about. And
do that for the rest of your life. Education does
not end after university education only begins after university. And
it continues for the rest of your life. And then
you can use me as a resource to help with
that. Because the whole point of my channel and actualized.
org is to is to teach you for the rest
of your life to give you insights, the most powerful
and practical insights that you need to transform your life.
So as we're wrapping up here, I want to give
you four, four key key lessons specifically for you, youngsters,
and those in the college range that you need to
remember. So first lesson is clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity. Keep
clarifying what you want out of life, what your passions
are, who you are. Secondly, tailor your life to who
you are your unique strengths and passions. Don't want a
life that everybody else has want a life that only
you can have a unique life, a life that's custom
fit for you that fits you like a glove. That's
what all of your Executive Decision Making should be geared
towards right now. The third point is lifelong learning, commit
to lifelong learning and start doing it from today onwards.
Do it every single day, that least one hour a
day. Maybe two hours, maybe four hours. And if you're
doing this in lieu of university, then six hours, eight
hours a day. And the fourth key is be proactive
about this whole process. Don't just sit back and think
that things will just work out. Things will not automatically
work out. Success will not come to you automatically. A
job will not come to you automatically. A great career
will not come to you automatically a life purpose will
not come to you automatically. All of this requires serious
effort, discipline and determination and commitment on your part. You
have to be out there hunting for it like a
pig hunting for truffles. That's the only way you're gonna
find a truffle It's not just gonna magically somehow just
land on your dinner plate. All right now, I want
to recommend a couple of my videos, that will be
very helpful for you to watch after watching this, if
you've got value out of this one. First, I have
a two part series called life advice for young people
parts one, part two, check that out, that's perfect for
you. Also, I have one related to this, which is
called life advice for high school and college students go
check that one out. I have another one called How
to Escape wage slavery, go check that one out. And
then of course, I have hundreds more that are also
going to be very valuable for you. And I have
the life purpose course. It's a paid course it costs
some money, but given what you're going to pay for
it, and the value that it would give. And the
clarity would give you in your life. The life purpose
course is all about clarity is 25 hours of helping
to clarify what you want out of your life. And
then how to construct a plan to get it. It's
very practical, has lots of exercises and techniques, gives you
resources and books. And it I mean, this is the
complete package, you couldn't have asked for a better course,
if you're unclear about the trajectory of your life, this,
this course will change your whole life. So consider investing
in that if you want. Alright, that's it, I'm done
here. Good luck with your decisions. Good luck with whether
you go to college or don't go to college. I
hope that regardless of your choice, you choose to invest
seriously in your life. Invest seriously in your self education.
And you don't confuse, don't confuse now. Education in the
university system with serious self education, these are two totally
different things. All right, you're only going to get from
life, what you put into it. And remember that institutions
and bureaucracies are designed for the lowest common denominator, they
are not designed for the most ambitious, and self actualizing
humans, because we're too rare. Most people are happy being
cheap. If you want to rise above being a sheep,
then you're gonna have to invent your own methods, you're
not going to find ready made solutions, you're gonna have
to invent them yourself. But that's also what makes life
so interesting and exciting is inventing those methods. All right.
That's it here. Please remember to click that like button
for me and come check out actualize that org There,
you will find the extra resources, you will find my
book list, which is a great way to begin your
self education. In fact, with my bullets, I guarantee you
this, if you read the over 200 books on my
book list over the next five or 10 years, just
that information alone will completely transform your life, and will
be 10 times more valuable than anything you could learn
in university, I promise you that. But here's the caveat,
you have to read all those books. And then you
have to actually apply everything in the books, you have
to apply it, it's not enough just to read it
and apply it. So check that out my life purpose
courses there, you can find that as well. You can
find my blog where I post exclusive content, you can
find the forum where you can chat with others who
are struggling through similar issues like you. And the last
thing I'll say is that if you are looking to
build an amazing life, you have hit upon the mother
lode right here with actualized. Org, you're not going to
find a more transformative, comprehensive and deep set of teachings
anywhere online, then what I'm offering, of course, take that
with a grain of salt, I am self biased here.
It serves my interest to say so but I think
my content is pretty good. It's pretty deep. It's pretty
broad. I think that if you can't build a good
life from the stuff that I'm talking about, then something's
wrong. Something's wrong with your head. It's all right here
for you. And if you don't get it from me
Of course I also I don't just monopolize My Teachings.
Of course I also refer you to other experts and
other teachers out there I recommend many different great teachers
and thinkers and experts and enlightened masters and meditation teachers
and business leaders and whatever you know role models so
my approach is very multi perspectival I'm not just teaching
you someone ideology actualize. org is not an ideology, really.
It's a it's a meta survey of 1000s of different
teachings and teachers and picking the best parts from all
of them. See, I don't discriminate. I don't just study
Western stuff. I started I study Eastern stuff. I study
sermonic stuff. I study spiritual stuff. I study New Age
stuff. I study hard scientific stuff, all of it. Because
what I'm looking for is the best of all of
it. I'm not loyal to Any one field or any
one technique, or any one method or any one school
or any one ideology, and I recommend that you also
adopt this multi perspectival meta approach in your self education
and you'll be amazed at how far you can get
with that.
