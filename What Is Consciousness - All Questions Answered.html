[Music] you I'm back I'm back from my 30-day meditation
retreat and man it's good to be back but I
won't be talking about much of that here today today
we're gonna be talking about what is consciousness kind of
a standard topic that we talk about but if you're
interested about insights and mistakes that I made and lessons
learned from my retreat that I'll be posting three videos
that I shot during the retreat on my blog so
go check those out of course I'm sporting a new
look for you I got a fancy shirt got a
fancy beard how do you like that you can post
a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the shirt
and the beard down in the comments section and we'll
see I don't know if I'm keeping them or not
but we're just doing something new but anyways let's get
right into our main topic what is consciousness because this
is such a deep deep juicy topic this is one
of the most important questions that you can ask an
answer in your life in fact about five years ago
I made a list I made a list of my
top 100 most important questions in life that I wanted
to answer the most fascinating questions that I had and
at the very top of that list question number one
was what was consciousness and so I follow it up
on that I didn't just make the list I followed
up on that list I started buying books I started
reading into non-duality I started doing practices meditation and yoga
and this and that and psychedelics and that was a
long journey which ultimately led me to where I am
today and today I understand what is consciousness and so
can you and in fact most people don't know this
but mankind has understood what consciousness is for over 5,000
years well at least certain small portions of mankind and
the rest of mankind hasn't been able to get it
so here we're attempting to fix that problem we're gonna
try to explain consciousness and see the situation you find
yourself in is that you find yourself conscious that's how
you know you exist but you're not conscious of what
consciousness is that's a very interesting predicament to find yourself
in and then you might think like well let's appeal
to neuroscience to answer this question and maybe if you're
on YouTube and you're searching for this topic what is
consciousness what you'll probably get is to get a bunch
of people talking about neuroscience and the latest discoveries there
and maybe there's this philosophy or that philosophy about consciousness
and the problem with all of that is that neuroscience
fundamentally cannot answer the question of neurosis of consciousness because
neuroscience is occurring within consciousness so actually neuroscience is incapable
of grasping what consciousness is and will explain a little
bit more about why that is as we keep going
the problem I guess we could say is that neuroscience
assumes that consciousness is an epiphenomena and that it's not
fundamental to reality itself it's not fundamental to let's say
physics or the metaphysics of reality and this turns out
to be false consciousness is fundamental and it is irreducible
it's more fundamental than atoms energy time space the universe
itself or brains or even life it comes prior to
all that in fact all of those things are occurring
within consciousness but this is very counterintuitive if you're trying
to understand and you're coming at this from the materialist
paradigm now I'll be talking about the materials paradigm a
lot here because it's the primary obstacle to understanding what
consciousness is and the materials paradigm is simply the idea
that reality is just basically a bunch of bouncing balls
like atoms particles or energy and it's dumb brute matter
and that's all there is to it and then consciousness
is just some sort of emergent property some second order
third order fourth order thing that comes about from these
atoms which we really don't know how but we assume
we'll figure it out if we just keep studying neuroscience
more that's not gonna work and the reason it's not
going to work is because when you become conscious of
what consciousness is which you can do we're not we're
not speculating here this is not theory that I'm giving
you I'm saying that you can actually become conscious of
what consciousness is and if you do then you'll realize
why neuroscience and materialistic science cannot grapple with consciousness and
it never will be able to of course if you
didn't know what consciousness was you would be a mystic
and you would be enlightened people don't appreciate that see
you would stop being a neuroscientist you would stop being
a scientist you would be holistic and you would be
labeled as such and you would be put into that
category so one thing I wanted to warn you about
is that when you hear neuro scientists or philosophers like
maybe Daniel Dennett or Sam Harris people of this ilk
talking about consciousness they actually don't know what they're talking
about be very suspicious of what they're talking about because
the only way you can really understand consciousness is if
you have some very deep awakening experiences which these people
have not had there's a great misunderstanding about what consciousness
is so let's first say what consciousness is absolutely not
consciousness is not brain activity consciousness is not reason or
knowledge or intellect consciousness is not emergent phenomena consciousness is
not something that is biological or that is exclusive to
life or dependent upon life consciousness is not subjective experience
consciousness is not perception and consciousness is not a private
thing something that you own that's personal to you like
you are a thing which has consciousness that's not what
it is consciousness is not a thing that other things
have consciousness is also not occurring within space and time
so those are some pretty bold claims and this goes
counter to the entire materialist paradigm which is trying to
understand what consciousness is and you can see that if
consciousness let's just assume for a moment that what I'm
saying here is true that consciousness is not any of
these things well if that's true then you can see
that the materials paradigm assumes that this is what consciousness
is is all these things that I just said it's
not so so you could see that it's it's already
starting off on a very wrong footing and it's gonna
have to work really hard to untangle this mess so
then what is consciousness well it's very tricky simple but
tricky consciousness is actually not anything it is not a
thing it is nothing it's actually nothing but this nothing
is not what you think the ordinary word nothing means
because when we ordinarily say nothing we think of non-existence
that's not what consciousness is I am NOT saying that
consciousness does not exist like then that's actually I think
Daniel Dennett's position technically is he thinks consciousness is an
illusion so it does not exist I'm not saying that
what I'm saying is that consciousness is the only thing
that exists it is existence itself and what that is
is nothing existence is nothing but it exists it's not
non-existence it exists consciousness is pure existence without content so
imagine if you took all the attributes and qualities of
life out of existence you would think that what you're
left with is non existence and not consciousness but actually
it turns out that what you're left with is pure
consciousness the problem is that you need to become conscious
enough to become conscious of consciousness without any attributes or
any Content and that's a little challenging to do for
most minds that requires some work another way we can
say it is that consciousness is the substance of everything
so what is everything made out of look around you
right now look around the room look at objects around
you maybe you see a table a couch a cat
a tree a car a window some sunlight your body
you're hearing me talk this is all consciousness it's all
occurring within consciousness that's the substance of reality reality is
not made out of atoms or energy or anything else's
man of consciousness and the function of consciousness is to
be totally empty so that's why it's so difficult to
talk about into grasp because it's emptiness it's actual emptiness
but this emptiness exists the reason it needs to be
empty is because it needs to be able to take
on the attributes of every possible object you see if
consciousness wasn't empty if had some sort of attribute like
let's say consciousness was red or let's say consciousness was
big or consciousness was small or consciousness was cold or
rough or smooth or ethereal or solid or material see
any of those things would be an attribute so if
consciousness had any of those attributes then that would prevent
it from being able to be the opposite of that
you see so if consciousness let's say was big that
means it couldn't be small as well and if consciousness
was rough then it couldn't be smooth and if consciousness
was red it couldn't be green you see how this
works so what we really need if we want to
construct reality from scratch is we need some sort of
container or substrate which is ideally completely free of any
attributes whatsoever it has no properties at all it's even
free of time and space such that we could fill
this container with absolutely anything we wanted it was a
totally free container so it would be sort of like
if we were a painter and we wanted to paint
a beautiful painting what would we choose as our medium
would we take some famous painting by da Vinci and
use that to paint on no you can't paint on
an already painted canvas you need a blank canvas to
do that but what that means is then it's it's
difficult for you as a human being then who is
situated within consciousness you see you are you have attributes
you have a size you have a shape you are
a certain way so now it's difficult for you to
grasp the empty canvas on which you were painted so
to really understand consciousness there needs to be a paradigm
shift you need to be able to look around you
and to see that everything that you're interacting with every
object no matter what kind of qualities it has no
matter how solid it feels a concrete wall a brick
a steel beam all of those are made out of
consciousness so what this means is that the universe is
not just some dumb collection of molecules bouncing around in
a box the way that science convention conceives of it
but that the universe is conscious and that is the
key step that the neuroscientists and the materialists and the
rationalists do not want to make to them that shatters
their entire metaphysics of what reality is and granted that's
a very big paradigm shift and many people do not
want to accept this because well it has a lot
of ramifications for how you interact with reality and so
of course that makes you apprehensive I can appreciate that
so what I'm saying here is that consciousness is not
localized it does not occur within space it does not
occur within your skull or within a brain consciousness is
universal the entire universe is consciousness another way to say
is that the entire universe is one giant mind and
that every object that you see within reality is a
figment of imagination of this giant mind now this is
a move and an admission that the materialists and rationalist
want to make even less because conventionally speaking reality's not
supposed to be a giant mind reality is supposed to
be dumb but then ask yourself why would you assume
that why is it necessary that reality starts out dumb
why couldn't reality start out smart why couldn't it be
in mind and of course you have a lot of
good reasons for why you think it can't predominantly because
it feels so solid and so consistent in so real
you think that if reality was a mind then everything
would be loosey-goosey and fantastical but then again ask yourself
is what you're experiencing right now not fantastical you're alive
you exist look at all this amazing stuff that's happening
around you it's utterly remarkable you just take it for
granted because you've been alive for so many decades that
you take it for granted but when you were born
it was all magical and incredible and none of it
made any sense it was all fantastical there was no
such thing as seeing a walk that walking a dog
walking down the street and and not being fascinated and
blown away by it it was incredible and you can
still go see incredible things you can see incredible documentaries
you go out into nature you can explore the cosmos
and you will find incredible fantastical miraculous amazing things and
scientists are discovering these things every single day and they
have been for the entire span of human civilization the
problem is that we just get so numb to it
and we start to take it for granted and then
we set up this sort of division between like the
truly fantastical the stuff of Alice in Wonderland and then
the more down-to-earth but the down-to-earth stuff is still extremely
fantastical and you got to wonder where did it all
come from and how is it functioning all so well
and so efficiently and it's not just because it's a
clock or Adams bouncing around in a box following logical
rules it's it's way way way more nuanced than that
there's an intelligence to it it is a mind and
you can actually become conscious that reality is a mind
after all that's why you can think see right now
you think that you're a human being sitting here who
has consciousness and what I'm telling you is that you're
not that what you are is you are the universe
being conscious and thinking that it's a human being can
you try to make that shift it's a recontextualization of
your present experience so look around you right now look
around the room and just try to notice that what
you are is not a human being looking at a
room what you are is the universe that is precipitating
this room and your body and everything else and there
it is it's both a subtle and a radical shift
so another way to think about consciousness is think of
it as infinite clay I like this analogy so think
of clay we can use clay to make a shape
and what's cool about clay is that literally think about
this ordinary clay in a sense is infinite because you
can use ordinary clay to construct an infinite number of
different sculptures or shapes you can make pots you can
make vases you can make people and animals of any
kind you can make aliens you can make all sorts
of fantastical stuff there is no limitation to what you
can carve out of clay except of course there's a
problem with clay because ordinary clay has properties which is
why is easy for us to make sense of it
in an ordinary clay has a certain mass a certain
weight a certain viscosity certain pliability a certain color a
certain texture smoothness roughness it's got a certain temperature it's
got a certain size it expands it reacts to cold
into water in certain ways so in a sense this
makes it limited it's unlimited in a certain dimension in
that you can make all sorts of infinite shapes from
it but for example you can't make an infinite colors
because unless you color it with paint let's say you're
not doing that if you just take the clay and
you don't modify in any way it has the whatever
color it has right so you can make an infinite
number of sculptures but all of them will have the
same color and also practically it's limited in that there's
only certain shapes and sizes of sculptures you can make
out of clay because it'll just collapse in on itself
you can't make a really long thin object it'll collapse
and if you make a sculpture that's too big eventually
the entire sculpture will just crumble down under gravity under
its own weight so you have some practical limitations there
but now imagine this imagine if we were able to
create a clay that was truly infinite out of this
clay we could create anything in reality this would be
like the ultimate substance what would that substance or clay
look like so immediately you should see that it should
look a lot like nothing so that the properties of
the clay itself do not interfere with the ability to
create something out of it you see so our clay
are infinite clay cannot have a color because if we
gave it some color that means it would be that
color and all objects would then be that color that
would be very limiting because we want to be able
to create all the colors that we see so in
that case we need to start off with zero so
that we can add in whatever colors we wanted to
or create that out of the clay and of course
it would have to have no smell because we would
want to be able to create any kind of smell
wanted to out of this clay metaphorically speaking we were
wanted to have no texture no size no mass and
nothing else and then if we were able to create
this magical sounding clay it sounds magical doesn't it then
look what we've got we've got a shapeshifter we've got
a shape-shifting substance consciousness that we can use to create
anything we could use it to create a rock a
tree a car metal plastic paper plasma a cloud called
hot red blue big small dumb smart hairy bald round
sharp solid liquid transparent shiny dull smooth rough soft hard
it would be unlimited you could make anything you want
out of it now the only problem is is that
what I'm saying sounds extremely fantastical to you it sounds
impossible Leo how could that be possible but then again
how could anything be possible how is it possible that
there are atoms bouncing around in a box where do
they come from how is the Big Bang possible this
question of how is it possible is a is a
very sneaky question because what it assumes is that whatever
model of reality you have that you are kind of
like taking it for granted but you have to realize
that any model of reality you have whichever way you
think reality is it's it's equally incredible how is anything
possible that's the whole trick now of course I'm not
trying to logically convince you with this analogy that what
I'm saying is correct I'm just using this analogy to
help to explain something that you can become conscious of
this is something you can become directly conscious of that
consciousness is this shape-shifting substance but the materials paradigm just
refuses to understand this and here I want to show
you a quote from Stephen Hawking who is a perfect
representative example of what I mean by the materialist paradigm
see he says quote I think the brain is essentially
a computer and consciousness is like a computer program it
will cease to run when the computer is turned off
theoretically it could be recreated on a neural network but
that would be very difficult as it would require all
of one's memories and quote now be honest is that
how you think of consciousness as software running on computer
hardware this is a very popular analogy that a lot
of people fall prey to these days and it really
prevents you from going further in understanding and exploring what
consciousness is because consciousness is not like software running on
hardware instead consciousness is more like software which can run
without needing hardware it's just pure software so rather than
thinking of the world as a combination of hardware and
software the way that most people do you know you
think there's like hard external physical reality and there's all
the software the software's like your emotions and it's your
perceptions everything you're seeing here right now supposedly is is
the software right your perceptions that's what neuroscience would tell
you all these colors what are these colors what are
these feelings and emotions in your body what is this
sensation of sitting on a chair or standing on your
feet what is that we would say that's software right
but then the hardware is the stuff underneath that's the
stuff that physics study system the hardware and the software
runs on the hardware except the problem is is that
philosophers for the last two thousand years have been trying
to explain even in theory how it's possible that software
can run on hardware how it's possible that atoms and
molecules can give rise to colors and emotions and sensations
and feelings and and thoughts and ideas and all this
kind of stuff soft stuff which is technically called qualia
in philosophy of mind they call it qualia how does
qualia arise out of matter or of course this is
the classic mind-body problem that decart made famous how does
mine arise from body well it doesn't because all there
is is mind body is a feature of mind body
is a special case of mind so imagine a computer
that is purely software it requires no hardware the universe
is just pure software floating in nothingness that's what we're
talking about otherwise in philosophy is known as idealism but
of course what I'm talking about is not just a
philosophy I'm talking about yes a philosophy but I'm talking
about actually discovering that is true speaking of which I
recently had this incredible experience of discovering that everything is
consciousness very palpably in what seemed like a moment I
looked around the room and it was just blindingly obvious
that everything I'm looking at is pure consciousness every object
and I was so blown away by this that I
picked up a book that was lying next to me
and I just flipped through the book and it was
just glaringly obvious that every single page on that book
is pure consciousness I'm just consciousness flipping through consciousness I
looked at my hand and it's just pure consciousness I
looked at a metal fork and then it's obvious that
yes it's made out of metal and the metal is
made of iron atoms but what if the iron atom
is made out of consciousness consciousness is this field which
is the substance of everything and that's really how you
realize non-duality is that you see the underlying essence behind
everything you see of what the what the ancients called
quintessence you know they had what five the class of
four elements it's fire earth water and what's the other
one air wind let's say and then and then and
then there's the fifth element what is the fifth element
its quintessence quint v l quint essence but what is
quintessence how come no one's been able to find the
quintessence because it's nothingness which is not the same thing
as air and it's not the same thing as non-existence
its nothingness or consciousness now you might wonder well Leah
why do you call it consciousness if it's nothingness well
that's a hell of a thing to explain because when
I say nothing I'm talking about a different thing than
what you're thinking of what you're thinking of when I
say nothing is you're thinking of a like an empty
space devoid of any qualities or features and it's just
sort of like a dumb physical space like if physics
explains nothingness it's just a space like a vacuum that's
not what I mean what I mean is that it's
it's mind stuff it's conscious of itself it's alive it's
intelligent it's self-aware and that's amazing it's amazing to discover
that reality is actually self-aware and that it's actually intelligent
that makes absolutely no sense from the materials paradigm that's
right because we're talking about a different paradigm you see
you have one paradigm the material paradigm and I'm telling
you just drop that it doesn't work and switch to
a different paradigm that means you're looking at the world
from a totally different perspective and everything you see still
sort of remains the same but it's also recontextualized so
to help you understand this it's useful to make a
distinction between first order versus second order reality what do
I mean by this well let's take the materialist scientific
paradigm from that paradigm when you look at reality you
split it up into at least two orders the first
order is the most fundamental so science says that the
first order reality the most real stuff that we know
is atoms energy the universe itself the physical universe the
body and the brain that's first order second order would
be consciousness perceptions the mind and emotions these would be
called the emergent phenomena they don't really exist consciousness it
really says perceptions don't really exist the mind doesn't really
exist emotions don't really exist all of those just boil
down to atoms and neurons that's one way to see
the world let's take a look at other paradigm the
dream paradigm when you're dreaming inside of your dream there's
also a first-order and second-order reality the first-order reality is
the mind it's the mind space within which your dream
is happening that's what a dream is made of it's
the substance of the dream and then there's the second-order
reality which is all the contents of your dreams so
if you see monsters and ghosts and and old relatives
and you see fantastical stuff happening to you weird stories
and narratives and memories and all that kind of wacky
stuff that's the content but that's all second-order right because
we say all of that is happening inside the mind
now the mistake that happens with the dream paradigm is
that when a materialist sees the dream paradigm he can't
help himself but to look at it from the materialist
paradigm so what he'll say is that yeah leo but
a dream is really happening inside the brain and so
actually the the reality of a dream is not mind
its brain but that's not the dream paradigm that's the
materialist paradigm so forget that we've already talked about that
one now I'm talking about the dream paradigm that's a
different paradigm inside the dream paradigm there is no brain
the dream is not happening inside of a brain it's
mind space that's a different paradigm now let's consider the
third paradigm a TV paradigm the television paradigm so when
you're looking at a television screen there is first-order and
second-order reality the first-order reality is the pixels of the
screen the second-order reality is all the stuff the pixels
depict all the actors it's the stage it's the props
and then we could even go one step further we
could say there's even a third order reality to a
TV which is the story that is told by the
movie for example see because the story of a movie
it's not identical to the actor as the stage and
the props it's made out of those things see so
that would be like a third order it's a it's
how you arrange the actors the stage and the props
and the environment and the dialogue is how you arrange
all those things and then that leads to sort of
the emergence of a story but all those things are
ultimately pixels you see and then lastly there's the non-duality
paradigm which is what's actually real what's actually true and
in this paradigm first-order reality is consciousness and second-order reality
is all the stuff that you know as physical objects
human beings the Sun trees cars houses gravity the laws
of physics science itself the entire universe the Big Bang
your body your brain thoughts emotions sexuality politics government war
violence rape genocide love and happiness all of this what
is all of this this is all happening within consciousness
all of that is is second order first order is
consciousness all those things are interconnected because the substance of
all those things is consciousness the tricky thing about consciousness
is that it cannot be pointed to because it holds
all the pointers in the same way that imagine if
you were a character on a TV screen imagine if
you were Mario from Super Mario World can Mario use
his finger to point at the pixels of the screen
he can't you notice this you can't do that if
you were Mario because Mario is in a sort of
dimension which is tangential to the pixels Mario doesn't know
about the pixels he's made out of the pixels Mario's
hand is made out of pixels being displayed by pixels
in the same way that my hand right now is
inside of empty consciousness so my finger cannot point to
consciousness because the finger itself cannot point outside it can't
go meta you see because it is made out of
the pixels no matter where Mario points he's never gonna
be able to point out a pixel because he made
of pixels in the same way when you start to
look for constantly Lea where is this consciousness you keep
talking about you look for it but you can't grasp
it because you're in it you're the fish and water
another metaphor might be that if you have a a
piece of white piece of paper and you draw like
Mickey Mouse on it or something Mickey Mouse cannot point
outside at the paper itself you say he can you
can draw Mickey Mouse pointing around in the scene of
of that two-dimensional space but he cannot point out to
the third dimension this is the classic self-reference problem which
creates strange loops which I talked about in my episode
called reality is a strange loop and it is that
which is why you can't point at it but you
are it you can't point at consciousness which also means
that you can't grasp it with words or you can't
grasp it with the mind or with the intellect or
using concepts because all those things are occurring within consciousness
but you are consciousness you are that emptiness within which
everything is occurring which is why when you look inside
of yourself if you ask yourself Who am i what
am i you look inside yourself what do you find
emptiness you don't find a thing in there emptiness look
inside try to go like turn your awareness back around
looking into your skull what do you see inside your
skull you don't see a skull in there you see
emptiness that's consciousness but you need to really train your
mind on that too to become conscious of that consciousness
of what it really is so the reason I make
a big deal about this this pointing business is because
if what I'm saying is true that means that nobody
can tell you what consciousness is because talking uses words
and communication those are pointers which is why a Zen
master uses cones and riddles to try to point consciousness
out to you because actually you can't point it out
you either get it or you don't you either conscious
of it or you're not which is why what scientists
are attempting to do which is to create models of
consciousness this is what neuroscientists are doing it's never going
to work the only way you can know consciousness is
by becoming conscious because consciousness is what's fundamental and your
mind and your language and your science which is only
possible with language you cannot do science without language and
without concepts it's second order you see the problem is
that you're trying to use a second-order phenomenon to get
at the first order you got it backwards it's not
going to work it turns out that there is no
substitute for consciousness you cannot substitute for consciousness with intelligence
with IQ with beliefs with knowledge or with intuition even
because consciousness is the substance of all of those things
intelligence and beliefs and knowledge and intuition these are second
order first order is consciousness so now let's get into
some frequently asked questions and objections because I know that
there's a lot of these when it comes to topic
and I had a lot of these questions and objections
when I started to learn about consciousness and non-duality and
how all this stuff works and I've resolved a lot
of these for myself recently so I want to help
you to do the same so first question is Leo
what is consciousness made out of consciousness is made out
of itself and that's an odd answer how could consciousness
be made out of itself and what does that even
mean it sounds like it's just some some woowoo talk
it sounds like I'm not saying anything when I say
that but really think about it whatever you think reality
is made out of think about it what's the most
fundamental thing that you believe realities matter atoms quarks strings
energy whatever it is does it matter at some point
you're gonna get to the bottom end like to the
bottom line rock but you're gonna hit rock bottom so
let's say it's just for a simplicity sake it's man
of atoms okay and atoms are indivisible that's not true
but let's say that's true so if it's atoms what
are these dad is made out of you'd have to
say the same thing that atoms just are and nothing
more that's rock bottom so that's sort of what we're
saying about consciousness is it's rock bottom you can't get
below that but actually in a way you can because
when you become fully conscious of consciousness you realize that
the rock bottom is nothingness and nothingness is itself existence
is itself and therefore it just is and that's the
bottom line but this is not sort of like an
intellectual exercise in the same way that atoms are understood
because with atoms you can say yeah atoms we don't
know what atoms are made out of their ear Adu
scible they just are that way stop asking stupid questions
that's not what I'm telling you here I'm not saying
that you can't get to the bottom of conscious I'm
saying you can get to the bottom of consciousness you
can get to the bottom of reality and what you
find there is nothing but that's not the same nothing
that the scientists think that strings or quarks are made
out of its actual nothing and you can be conscious
of it so it's a strange loop reality is made
out of itself and you might say how is that
possible and the answer is because everything is possible and
it has no limits consciousness is unlimited so it can
do anything it literally anything that it wants and so
it gives birth to itself it's sort of like consciousness
is its own mother and its own father kind of
an interesting twist on the time travel paradox where you
go back in time and you give birth to yourself
by having sex with your grandmother or something like that
yeah that's basically how consciousness came into being is sort
of like went back in time it had sex with
itself and it gave birth to itself it's a mindfuck
next question how come if I damage my brain I
will lose consciousness this is a tricky one this is
a tricky one to help you to understand yes it's
true that if you damage your brain you could lose
consciousness however I'm not I'm not talking about that per
se here so when I use the word consciousness I'm
not talking about consciousness is that that it's something you
have see the way you frame it here metaphysically when
you say I will lose consciousness you assume that subconscious
something you had to begin with which is not the
case so let's think of it this way use let's
let's bring in the Lego analogy we're using a lot
of analogies here to explain this so the Lego analogy
and this is actually a really good analogy for explaining
first-order second-order reality so we have Lego blocks right let's
assume that the Lego blocks are just the most fundamental
particles and we can use Lego blocks to build a
castle so we build this beautiful castle the shape of
the castle that's notice that's a second-order reality the blocks
themselves that make up the castle that's first-order reality okay
so here's what's going on when you think that you
lose consciousness by damaging your brain it's actually like this
you've taken these Legos and you've built a beautiful castle
and now what you've done is you've identified consciousness and
yourself with the castle which is a mistake because actually
consciousness is the the Lego blocks themselves but you're not
conscious of that yet so you've identified yourself with the
shape the castle so when that shape breaks down which
is what happens when we take a hammer and hit
you over the skull and and damage your brain what
that amounts to is taking a sledgehammer and hitting the
castle what happens a bunch of the blocks break off
and you ruin the shape of the castle and then
you say to yourself oh look I've lost my consciousness
my conscious has been damaged no it hasn't what's happened
is that the thing you identified with you've misidentified that
thing has been damaged the content within consciousness that has
been damaged let's say but consciousness itself will always be
there in fact we could deconstruct the entire castle such
that the castle no longer exists but the consciousness the
building blocks they're still there you cannot destroy the building
blocks in this analogy next question how can there be
consciousness without a brain this is also very difficult to
explain to someone who's stuck in the materialist paradigm well
I could ask you the same question how is it
possible that there could be consciousness with a brain man
why do you assume that that's just a given that
that's obvious because mankind has been investigating this question both
theoretically and experimentally for over 2,000 years and we still
haven't figured it out so maybe that's a clue that
your paradigm is backwards it makes no sense how consciousness
could be possible with a brain how is it possible
that there are atoms how's that possible how's it possible
there's a universe how is materialism possible when you really
step back and you remove all of your biases and
you stop taking anything for granted and you really objectively
evaluate all of these different paradigms you will see that
they're all equally fantastical there's nothing fantastical more fantastical for
example about reality being a giant mind versus reality being
just a bunch of dumb particles bouncing around in a
box because you still have to account for the dumb
particles on the box where the box come from where
time come from what space come from where did the
physical laws of of the universe come from where the
physical constants come from like the gravitational constant and so
on where they come from of course science has no
explanation nor is there even a explanation on the horizon
even in theory it's not possible because you're always taking
something for granted you're always starting off with something an
axiom or an assumption of some kind or something that
you hold as reality but see in this example we're
we're questioning much deeper than most scientists or even most
philosophers that were questioned so we're getting into uncharted territories
foremost Minds so see one of the problems with the
English word consciousness is that it's not just a word
for some idea it comes with an implicit metaphysics and
and what's implicit to the definition of that word is
that when people hear consciousness or mind they automatically bring
in with it the metaphysics of a brain they just
assume that minds and consciousnesses must happen in brains duh
but why would you assume that really think about that
think about that existentially from from ground zero without any
kind of assumptions why would mind or consciousness to need
a brain to begin with if you really investigate that
Discover's actually maybe they don't maybe the problem is the
way that I'm defining conscious maybe consciousness is it exists
but it doesn't depend upon some mechanism that brings it
about and that turns out to be the case another
question is Leo how come I lose consciousness when I
go to sleep doesn't that prove that the universe is
not conscious because supposedly if the universe was always conscious
then I wouldn't be able to go to sleep again
this is because you miss identify what consciousness is again
you're holding in us something that you lose you're going
to sleep and you're losing it that assumed that you
had it to begin with which you didn't again what's
happening when you're going to sleep is that since you're
identified with this castle that you've built out of Lego
blocks when you go to sleep at night the entire
Castle gets disassembled and it just becomes Lego blocks but
since you are at that level of consciousness where you're
not identified with the blocks you're identified with the castle
to you it appears as though the castle disappears and
it does from that perspective and from that perspective it
appears like you lose consciousness and then there's nothing left
but if you become sufficiently conscious and you shift your
identification from being the castle the second order to the
first order of the building blocks then you will actually
be able to keep your consciousness even when you go
to sleep even when there's nothing there even after your
physical body dies but of course it's not going to
be the kind of consciousness that you've identified with right
here it's not gonna be all colorful and fanciful and
stuff's gonna be happening it's not gonna be like that
it's going to be pure consciousness it's pure with no
attributes whatsoever and most people confuse that with non-existence but
actually it's just pure existence next question how come I'm
not conscious of other minds if Leo you say that
the universe is is conscious and that's all that there
is then supposedly I should have access to to all
information and to everything no why would you assume that
so again let's use our building block analogy Legos let's
imagine that we've built an entire house out of Legos
like a house real life scale house out of Legos
that would be quite a big project but let's say
we did that and we have different rooms in this
house we have the kitchen the dining room the living
room the bedroom the bathroom all this sort of stuff
you see we can use our building blocks if we're
clever in such a way that we can sort of
create a bubble in fact we could create a room
that has no doors and no windows such that from
within that room let's say we create the bathroom and
the bathroom has no doors or windows we completely seal
it in with cement and drywall and everything and paint
it over with wallpaper so it looks nice you can't
see any seams so now imagine if you could take
the point of view of the bathroom itself it would
appear that the bathroom exists all by itself and that
the bathroom is separate from all the other rooms in
the house but of course if you zoom out like
if you're the constructor of this thing you know that
the bathroom is there and it appears to be isolated
from every other room it can't see sort of the
bathroom can't see all the other rooms and yet at
the same time it's all one house you see in
fact we don't really even need to seal the room
off it's interesting this house example is very interesting because
see we construct boundaries it's all about how your mind
draws these boundaries in an ordinary house do you notice
that every room is completely connected from to every other
room there's no separation between rooms in a house even
if it has doors there's still no separation and in
fact in most houses the kitchen the dining room in
the living room are just one giant space you know
with some distortions and contortions and convolutions but it's just
one space like in my apartment my kitchen and my
living room and even my office which is technically the
dining area it's just all one space and even and
that space even continues further on it goes into the
hallway it goes into the bedroom it goes into my
bathroom it goes into my closet so you see these
distinctions we make between the kitchen the dining room the
bedroom the bathroom these are constructions of our minds there's
no hard and fast distinctions I dare you to go
throughout your house and to find the precise place where
your kitchen splits off from your living room and where
your living room splits off from your bathroom pinpoint the
precise place see you can't because the these boundaries are
artificial they're constructed by the mind they're projected onto reality
and so what you can realize is see before you
thought of of your houses just being these separate rooms
but then you realize oh no it's just it's all
one house that's exactly what other minds are like it
feels that you are trapped in this bubble and that
you have no access to other people's thoughts and emotions
and so forth but really it's just because you're really
identified with this bubble the appearances that create this bubble
and if your consciousness expands it can expand beyond that
and you can understand that you are all Minds without
necessarily having to access all the other minds you see
the bathroom doesn't need to become the kitchen to understand
that the entire house is all interconnected sort of a
weird way to phrase it because bathrooms can't think but
but you kind of get the analogy that I'm talking
about okay next question how can matter be conscious well
it should be obvious by this point that I'm saying
is that matter cannot be conscious consciousness not something arises
out of matter or neurons matter and neurons are something
that are occurring within consciousness so you got that backwards
next question doesn't matter affect consciousness again this gets things
backwards matter doesn't affect consciousness matter is consciousness and consciousness
is interacting with itself so does matter interact with other
matter of course of course it does and you perfectly
allow that why don't you ask the question how can
matter affect other matter how come a table is affected
by a ball if I drop it on the ball
or I drop the ball on the table how come
see you just take that for granted physics takes that
for granted but that's a mysterious thing if you think
about it so when I say that consciousness affects and
interacts with consciousness because consciousness is so it has nothing
to interact with but itself so conscious interacts with consciousness
and you might say but Leo that makes no sense
but notice that matter interacting with matter also makes no
sense so yeah it doesn't make sense because it's mysterious
because reality is mysterious it's fundamentally mysterious so when you're
trying to demystify reality in truth you can't only by
an act of self delusion or lack of consciousness can
you demystify reality you can't you accept that matter can
interact with matter no problems well now just realize that
matter is consciousness and the other matter is also consciousness
today I've met conscious interacting with consciousness it's not that
difficult to accept that necklace sorry next question why does
consciousness exist that's a hell of a question why does
conscience exist consciousness is existence conscious is not something that
comes into existence it is existence itself so you are
basically asking why does existence exist and the answer is
is because there is nothing but existence where else would
it be non-existence does not exist non-existence is a concept
you know it's let me correct that let me be
very precise here it's not that non-existence doesn't exist non-existence
is a concept that exists within existence there is actually
no such thing as non-existence there is only existence and
why this is the case becomes very clear when you
become fully conscious of what conscious --is but until then
it will probably not make much sense what I just
said another question how did consciousness evolve in animals consciousness
did not evolve in animals animals and evolution are things
that are occurring within consciousness you see the difference there
another question can Iraq be conscious or is a rock
conscious a rock is not conscious a rock is inside
of consciousness can a computer be conscious it's a very
interesting question that I've pondered again you understand what a
computer is computers I'm an have matter in a physical
universe a computer is a figment of universal mind a
computer is something that's occurring within consciousness and because the
entire universe is conscious I would assume that it's possible
for any object within the universe to become self-aware so
what you're really asking when you're talking about a computer
is you're sort of asking like can and artificial intelligence
become self-aware and the trick with that question is that
what you're really asking about you're not asking whether it
can become conscious what you're actually asking about is can
it develop an ego a sense of self the way
that you did of course the ego is an illusion
your sense of self is an illusion which is what's
preventing you from realizing what consciousness is so here's what
would happen if a computer developed an ego and I
believe it can probably I don't know for sure probably
it can then what would happen is at that instant
where it developed an ego what that ego does is
that ego will appropriate absolute being consciousness it will appropriate
that for itself and it will claim that it is
conscious see that's what the ego does fundamentally the ego
takes ownership over consciousness where in fact consciousness is absolute
and universal the ego localizes it and it takes ownership
of it and in that case it would become just
as deluded as most human beings are and then it
would have all the all the the difficulties and struggles
that we have with spear Shuu ality so I think
that's probably possible but we're probably a far away from
that for now mostly because people who are doing artificial
intelligence research and neuroscientists who are working on these issues
they they have a completely wrong paradigm they don't understand
what consciousness is so until they really understand what consciousness
is and they're not even closed to that because their
entire foundation but a physical foundation is backwards I think
we're gonna be far away from having true egotistical artificial
intelligences although you know who knows I might be wrong
next question are consciousness and awareness the same thing this
is an interesting question I was going to shoot a
whole episode about this actually but maybe I'll just address
it here different teachers and people can use words in
different ways you have to be careful sometimes teachers will
use these words synonymously like I do sometimes teachers will
make very fine fine grained distinctions between these two and
they will actually mean two different things by these words
personally for me I don't like making these very fine-grained
distinctions because it's lost on students and it becomes confusing
so I just used consciousness and awareness basically synonymously so
when you hear me talking about this stuff I will
use those words interchangeably and they basically mean the same
thing for me but when you're reading other teachers try
to get inside their head and try to understand what
are they talking about in what contexts are they using
that word it's very important otherwise you might misunderstand them
next question Leo how can you be so sure that
there isn't something beyond consciousness because when you become fully
conscious of what consciousness is you realize that consciousness is
infinite and that there are no boundaries and so therefore
you understand that there is nothing beyond because consciousness includes
everything that's beyond itself that's what's so interesting about it
so anything you can imagine that's beyond consciousness is consciousness
it's really that simple because see in order for something
to be beyond consciousness that means you would have to
draw a boundary between consciousness and not consciousness but there
is no such thing as not consciousness despite what the
materials paradigm tells you see the problem the MCOs paradigm
is that it makes it seem as though there's conscious
things and there's not conscious things there's the conscious mind
and the unconscious mind there's no such thing as the
unconscious mind and this is no such thing unconscious things
everything is conscious or it doesn't exist next question so
then leo is neuroscience is false like you're saying is
it useless well first of all not all neuroscience is
false there are some good studies that neuroscientists do and
I think it's a good field that needs to continue
to do its work I am NOT talking about abandoning
neuroscience I'm talking about actually correcting the metaphysical foundations of
neuroscience so that I can do its own work more
effectively that's what I'm trying to help neuroscience figure itself
out I don't think it's useless I think there's a
lot of important stuff that we can learn from neuroscience
in fact my hope is is that maybe within the
next hundred years shorter your standard years once neuroscience makes
this paradigm shift at the non-duality which it must it
will it'll just be forced to it can't deny the
obvious forever so once what's mainstream science comes along there's
gonna be a huge paradigm shift within the field of
neuroscience non-duality it will go from duality into non duality
then from that framework there will be a revolution within
neuroscience there will be a lot of amazing discoveries and
my hope is that neuro scientists will be able to
discover a way to induce enlightenment either chemically or surgically
very quickly and easily such that you can like just
go to the doctor he just snipped some stuff in
your brain you know like sniffs out the default mode
Network whatever and you just walk out the next the
next day and you're you're fully aligned and it's super
easy and you don't need to listen to any of
these videos you just walk around like a full Buddha
and everything's hunky-dory I think we can get there one
day we just have to really understand how the brain
works and and that's tricky because see the brain is
in a strange loop relationship with perceptions and with consciousness
and with reality and so very carefully untwine that's trains
loop is gonna be very tricky but you know that's
what science is all about it's all about dealing with
this strange loop and it's amazing how successful science can
be in certain domains next question Leo how do I
become more conscious that would probably be the whole point
of all this discussion is for you to understand that
consciousness is what you're really after in life and that
you should be pursuing more of it how do you
become more conscious well basically by focusing consciousness on itself
consciousness turned on itself can become self conscious because the
property of consciousness is self-awareness in fact it's the only
thing that can really be self-aware so how do you
do that well there's various methods yoga many different schools
of yoga meditation many kinds of meditation self-inquiry psychedelics contemplation
all these techniques that I've talked about and that I
will continue to talk about you just got to do
them and you got to do them with discipline and
with focus and with concentration not just slacking around and
the last question Leo how can there be different levels
of consciousness if everything is consciousness it seems like you're
talking about like these building blocks like Legos but these
Legos I mean do you have different levels of Legos
that doesn't make any sense and sometimes you talking about
consciousness oh there's different levels well yeah that's tricky to
answer that because I do sometimes talk about consciousness as
though there are different levels of it like I say
you can raise your conscience or you can become more
conscious I'm sort of when I say that I'm sort
of speaking from the relative perspective but then from the
absolute perspective when you become fully conscious so to speak
you realize that actually everything is consciousness and it's just
one and there's really sort of not levels of consciousness
so it's kind of twisted it's like there are and
there aren't levels of consciousness sometimes people criticize me by
by saying that only oh you shouldn't tell people their
the levels of consciousness because everything is just one right
but it's still very useful to be able to break
it down into levels it's just very useful so I
do I do talk about it like that like I'll
talk about spiral dynamics and I'll say that the spiral
dynamics stages are all different levels of consciousness and even
though in the absolute sense that's false in the relative
sense it's a very useful model and it works and
so you know we have to we have to we
have to sort of like claw our way out of
this deep well that we that we're drowning in so
you know we're sort of just pragmatically using whatever conceptual
tools we can to help us climb out and so
one of those tools is these different levels of consciousness
and so consciousness can also sort of kind of expand
and contract I don't know how to how to really
explain how or why it does that but it just
has this ability like you can sort of be dumb
or it could be smart it can be self-aware or
can kind of like lack self-awareness so it's it's rather
interesting in this serious so there are a lot of
different synonyms that people use for consciousness and that I
use so to me these are all synonymous consciousness awareness
nothing everything infinity reality god.you emptiness void brahman mu formlessness
form awakeness absolute and being all of these words are
basically synonymous they're pointing to the same thing but perhaps
different aspects or facets of the same thing see the
the twisted thing about nothing is that it has like
it has fast - but how do you explain it
because I told you that nothing this has no attributes
but then again it does have attributes it has attributes
like intelligence it has attributes like like infinity it has
attributes for like love but it's sort of like a
cosmic sort of love so yeah it's it's difficult to
explain this stuff you need to actually start to experience
it alright so as we conclude let me just give
you a last couple of pointers very practical things that
you should know about consciousness firstly there are many different
levels of consciousness and the level of consciousness that you
are at on a daily basis is what dictates all
of your actions all of your emotions how you feel
in what you do in life so if you want
to be able to predict what a human being is
going to do throughout his life just look at his
level of consciousness that is the determining factor if you
care about morality and being a good human being the
most important factor that morality hinges on is not rules
or it's not a tradition you believe in it's not
your personal manifesto or principles it's your level of consciousness
if you have low consciousness but very lofty ideals and
you follow the Ten Commandments you're still going to be
an evil selfish person because that's what low consciousness is
about it's about selfishness whereas if you have high levels
of consciousness you realize the self is an illusion then
it doesn't matter what kind of books you read or
what kind of principles you have you're gonna be a
pretty kind decent and loving person the most loving people
are the most conscious people and vice versa although it's
not always a perfect correlation it is possible that highly
conscious people still do selfish things because there's still people
and their minds are still selfish and even if you're
highly conscious you still have to survive in the world
and so survival is selfishness you cannot survive without being
selfish so you're stuck with it unless you want to
depart this world early and you can always do that
if you want to but in that case we won't
be talking about you because we won't know that you
exist another point for you here is that make sure
you understand that altered states of consciousness are possible and
that there's a wide variety of them there's not just
one or two there are many different kinds and types
and also many degrees to each kind and type which
is what makes spirituality so complicated because to study all
these different states and all the different depths of these
states is a lifelong work and very few people have
access to all the different states that exist and probably
most people cannot access all the states some people access
some of these states but not others and then some
people ask is access other states but not these and
so you have a lot of disagreement and back and
forth and lastly just make sure you understand that consciousness
can be raised dramatically we're not talking about a 10%
increase or even a 200% increase we're talking about like
a 10,000 percent increase a million percent increase a billion
percent increase in consciousness such that you literally start to
feel like you're inhabiting a different reality even though in
a sense nothing changes but then everything changes so this
needs to be understood because some people convince themselves that
oh I've increased my consciousness a bit and then they
start to think like okay so yeah I've experienced a
few mystical states or few altered states of consciousness I've
been raising my conscience or the last couple years therefore
I understand what it's like to be at the highest
levels no you don't not even close you're probably not
even 1% complete there are probably states that are so
radical that you couldn't even imagine them and so just
stay humble stay humble stay open keep doing the work
keep checking yourself never tell yourself that you've that's it
I've arrived and that that's that's the end of that
because usually if you say that you're gonna be wrong
you're gonna stop very short of the ultimate depth that
you can go to all right that's it that's what
consciousness is please click the like button for me leave
a comment about my beard leave a comment about my
shirt let me know what you think and come check
out actualize that org that's my website come check out
the blog I post some exclusive content and videos and
stuff there there's some there's some pretty good blog post
that you can find there I think come check out
the forum come check out the book list I'm actually
going to be updating the book list really soon so
stay tuned to the next week or two I will
update the book list with about 20 new books about
yoga about consciousness about all the sorts of stuff so
that's gonna be cool and that update is free for
people who've already purchased it and also check out the
life purpose course alright that's it the last thing I'll
tell you is that there's nothing more worthwhile than becoming
more conscious and that's what actualize that work is about
every video that I released is trying to make you
move towards higher consciousness of fashion because that's what all
personal of element ultimately boils down to consciousness is the
master key to life so stick with me keep watching
the episodes keep doing the practices and working on it
and what you'll find is that your consciousness will gradually
increase there will be moments when you do maybe some
psychedelics or you go on some meditation retreat or whatever
you have some mystical experience that your conscious will shoot
through the roof those will be those exciting amazing peak
peak experiences which will then really convince you of the
value of this work and then you'll get much more
serious about it and then you'll start to actually understand
some of this lofty abstract philosophical metaphysical stuff that I
talked about and then you will really get into it
and from then on your life will be will be
very special which is not to say it won't be
difficult there will still be a lot of difficulties there
you're still gonna have to pursue more consciousness so you're
not gonna fix it in one shot but which like
the most important thing I think for for people who
are new this work is try to get your first
real mystical experience however you do it through psychedelics which
is probably the easiest way or through a meditation retreat
through yoga something like that get it and then just
see how miraculous and amazing and mystical reality is and
then come back and we can really get to work
you
