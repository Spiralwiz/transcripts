hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're gonna talk about what is ego let's talk
a little bit about what ego is I'm sure you've
heard about it I'm sure you've heard people talking about
the problems that the ego can cause for you you've
probably heard about ego death you've probably heard about both
positive and negative size of ego so let's talk about
ego and specifically let's talk about how you can understand
this concept and relate it to success and personal development
how to get more success in your life by understanding
ego all right so what is ego ego is basically
that that aspect of yourself that you consider you so
that is when I say you and I say your
name and you think yeah that's me that is ego
ego is basically your self-image of who you are so
ego is a complex construct in your mind it's sitting
both at the conscious and very very deep subconscious level
so ego is that I that you think you are
it's the thoughts and the emotions that you are identified
with it's the beliefs that you think are rock solid
and completely true it's what you think reality is like
so that whole construct and it is a very big
and deep construct it's like a gigantic iceberg and only
the tip of it only the tip of it like
the the 10% of it is sticking out of the
water and the other 90% are all submerged and really
you don't know what they are is just operating is
just working so the ego is you and the ego
has a couple of features that it does so the
ego the fundamental thing that the eeo does is that
it separates itself from everything else that's out in the
world so if you're coming from the ego and this
is 99.999% of people including myself is what you do
is you say okay this is me and everything else
you look at as not you right that desk is
not you that other person is not you that other
country is not you so you are a very distinct
you or just your mind and your body the skin
that you've got and everything beyond your skin is something
else so you have that very clear separation this is
something that you get as a biological entity as an
organism who needs to survive and depends on survival and
reproduction and so we as a species and really every
living organism has a sense of this the sense of
eyeness the sense of this is me this is what's
really really important and the other stuff not so important
sure you can love your spouse and you can love
your kids and you can you can love the business
that you built and you can even love your your
iPod or your iPhone but there's still a big difference
between that and really being identified with yourself so the
ego is that identification with yourself now why are you
talking about ego what's the big deal okay so it
seems that this is kind of a kind of a
an intuitive notion well the problem there is that the
ego is very clingy and the ego is very self-preservation
'el and so what it does especially if you're trying
to get to higher levels of achievement and success and
consciousness in your life is that the ego tends to
hold you back because it's got a lot of inertia
and weight to it and it doesn't always want to
go out there and explore reality for what it really
is because what's happened is that ego has been built
up regardless of how attached you are to yourself right
now the fact is that you and your notion of
you is highly highly illusory and fictitious and I know
you don't want to hear that and I don't want
to hear it the ego doesn't want to hear it
but it's a very arbitrary way in which the ego
came about it just came about through the experiences that
you had in the early childhood and then early adulthood
all the way up to now and every experience that
you had in your whole life from birth to this
current day this current second has has added something to
your ego and what's created is created this giant yarn
ball of all these different strands all tightly interwoven and
now it's like an object it's like a thing it's
got its own mass to it and it it's hard
to reorganize that it's hard to go in there and
pull a strand out and and create something actually useful
out of it something that's going to get you a
better level of performance and so that's what a lot
of personal development is about is about working with your
ego because if your ego is too big and that's
what we say when you would say someone Oh someone
yeah he's got a really big ego what does that
usually mean that means yeah he's kind of a he's
a jackass he's stubborn he's not open-minded right and that's
that's kind of what it is but that's very surface
level understanding of you go much deeper understanding of ego
is that you've got these beliefs and you've got this
big network this ball of yarn and that is responsible
for all your behaviors all your actions all your beliefs
all your thoughts and this is a very arbitrary thing
even though we think that this is so precious that
we can't change it that if we changed our most
cherished beliefs then then something horrible would happen the world
would collapse and in reality what happens is that the
world would not collapse only your ego would collapse what
would happen is that your ego would evolve to a
higher level of consciousness to a new state and in
that new state if you do this process correctly then
that ego will be lessened it will be less judgmental
it will have less boundary between itself and the rest
of the world it'll be more calm it will be
less neurotic it'll be more comfortable and it'll be in
a position to perform better so you get better result
out of your life when you numb that ego down
and you rub it out and you kill it and
the ultimate end of this is the process and the
state of enlightenment which you can reach in which Buddhist
monks for example reach after decades of meditation and contemplation
is that what happens is through a very rigorous training
process they literally numbed down their ego so much that
they dissolve it and they no longer have that boundary
between themselves and the rest of the world and they
feel a sense of oneness that we can't even imagine
I have not gone through this process although something that
I'm working on actively right now it could take me
some time to get to where I want to be
there but they go they've gone through this process and
so now they have a sense of oneness with the
world with the universe and that's what they talk about
oneness that one point in mind that enlightened boot of
mind it's that you are no longer distinct from anything
else you see yourself as part of everything else connected
to everything else and you no longer judge things as
good and bad and you no longer cling to your
beliefs so much and you no longer resist suffering and
you no longer resist pain you just kind of go
with the flow and when you do that well you
get a tremendous sense of a personal power control over
yourself emotional stability because nothing can shake you because what
do you care you are one with the world literally
you do not care because you see as everything being
part of you you see you being part of everything
else so there is no good and bad there is
nothing that needs to be corrected there is nothing that
is distinct from you your body getting cut or even
death is not a big deal because it's you're just
part of the system this kind of a deep deep
notion the first time you hear about it you might
think that's kind of kind of wacky kind of far
out there and metaphysical and not really not really the
thing for me but the fact is that this is
what happens it's just that most people this happens to
everybody I would argue it's just that most people do
not reach that complete state of enlightenment what happens though
is that throughout your life whether you even undertake this
process or you don't you're going to be forced to
adjust your ego to the circumstances that are happening to
you except what's gonna happen there's gonna be a lot
of resistance so for example maybe you have a horrible
breakup you have a divorce and that just has a
big traumatic scar on you on your ego and now
your ego has has had to change to adapt to
that to that pressure that was put on it or
maybe you do meditation meditation makes you feel you do
a little bit of meditation everyday and that meditation makes
you feel a little bit more calm more relaxed a
little bit more connected to the world you're not completely
connected you've still got your ego but it's a little
bit rub you know rubbed out a little bit numb
numb down and so through this this kind of process
of just living life and learning about life and experiencing
the ups and the downs your ego your ego kind
of evolves and it goes from the kind of ego
that it was when you were a kid basically it
was all me me me me me me me you
know yelling at your mom to come to come help
you to come give you give you some assistance give
you some pleasure give you some safety and some comfort
kind of going away from that and becoming more responsible
more independent more open-minded and slowly as you're exposed to
more experiences in life you become more and more open
minded and you start to see that good and bad
is really a more relative thing than you ever thought
it was and as you're getting that as you're getting
that notion and your egos is kind of expanding out
and it's dissolving you start to notice that it's easier
to control yourself you start to notice you're not so
neurotic you're not so anxious you're not so worried all
the time your thoughts do not have a a grasp
over you maybe you don't identify with certain thoughts the
way that you used to in the past simply because
you've you've suffered too much from that I mean and
that's basically what Buddhist monk do is they sit for
hours and hours every day for tens and tens of
years until eventually they kind of just they're they're eager
just kind of like like it it crumbles under its
own weight and then they get this relief but I
think all of us are go through that process this
is a gradual process that you go through and so
that is basically what ego is and I think that
you know all of us mortals unless we're Buddhist monks
all of us mortals I have a really strong sense
of ego and I'm not really expecting you to go
out there and to to solve that problem right now
I just want you to be aware of it I
want you to understand how judgemental you are this is
huge how many judgments are you making per day practice
just spend a day monitoring how much you're judging things
and by judging I simply mean putting a value on
it because there's two ways to go about life one
way and I there's something there's it's a spectrum but
we're going to talk about the two poles of this
spectrum the two ends one end is where everything is
judged according to some sort of metric some sort of
value so everything I look at I'm like The Terminator
I'm scanning it and I have like a target in
in my mind and this target is saying target acquired
good bad do this do that that's one way the
other way is to just be in life be totally
in the moment and everything's okay nothing is bad nothing
is good everything just is it's being right those are
the two far ends of the spectrum and most of
us are somewhere in the middle although I would argue
much much further towards this scanning and judging type of
type of mindset and then the scanning judging mindset everything
that you're looking at you're judging and you're evaluating you
know oh he didn't do that oh he just threw
a cigarette butt at the window he's littering that's bad
oh she told me that she didn't like my shirt
she was rude that's bad or it's like oh she
didn't approve me because of what I said that's bad
or oh he did something here which is good and
we go through our whole day and a whole week
and a whole life like this judging everything has some
sort of purpose things that happen to us that are
favorable to our ego we love and we're excited and
happy about and the things that are unfavorable we're depressed
about we're miserable about we're frustrated about and so what
happens is that we go through life in this up
and down playing this up-and-down game this whole game of
chasing after things that are good and and avoiding the
things that are bad and as your ego is dissolved
and you see yourself as more part of the whole
universe and just start to take in the being and
be more in the present moment then you start to
dissing you move away from the judgment and you become
more at peace more calm more your natural you you
raise your level of consciousness so that's ultimately what do
you go is about it's about raising the level of
consciousness I'm going to wrap it up here I'm signing
