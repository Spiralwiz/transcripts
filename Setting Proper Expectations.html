a Leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about setting proper expectations for
success [Music] this episode here is a cornerstone of success
if you don't understand this topic about setting proper expectations
I guarantee you you're going to be frustrated and you're
not going to be able to seed in many areas
in your life including self-actualization work and enlightenment work it's
amazing how much expectations matter they affect your ability to
follow through and your ability to succeed just having the
wrong expectations can spell the difference between success and failure
do you know what the most common failure point is
for I would say every human being on earth who
has ever undertaken any kind of project or endeavor why
did they fail because they underestimate the time energy cost
and emotional labor that their project or endeavor requires to
be actualized it's just that simple just having the wrong
idea about the timeline of your project whether you're building
a house or you're building a business or you're trying
to get enlightened or you're trying to make money or
you're entering a new relationship or you're trying to raise
your kids or you're trying to make your marriage succeed
why do you fail in all those things because you
underestimate the time energy cost and emotional labor involved and
consistently what I see in people and what I see
myself so of course I'm talking about from my home
direct experience and if you validate what I'm talking about
in this episode against your direct experience you'll start to
see that everything I'm saying here is very valid what
we usually do is we accept something for nothing we
expect big growth big life changes big paydays big business
successes big military victories amazing relationships with our kids we
expect all this for nothing and then we wonder why
we don't get it well it's because there cost associated
with all these things and especially I want you to
become aware that if you want something that's rare and
valuable that is not widespread through society for example high-quality
marriages that's a rare and valuable thing or you want
a business that sustains itself and pays you a passive
income so you can travel around the world and work
remotely that's a rare and valuable thing you don't see
every guy on the street with that kind of thing
that immediately should tell you that there is a pretty
heavy cost involved with creating that situation in your life
and then it's going to be up to you to
investigate what that cost is and whether you are willing
to pay that cost and that's something that people very
naively just don't do I mean this is this is
just such basic stuff it's such common-sense stuff that I
hesitate to even call it foundational but I mean it
is foundational because without this you can't have any success
the consequences of wrong expectations are that you get easily
frustrated with your project and your progress and therefore you
quit prematurely another consequence is that you're never able to
really accomplish anything in your life nothing big do you
notice that pattern in yourself where you try to do
something big with your life but it just never happens
and then just fall back down to your default position
and maybe you look back through history and you see
all this is a trend I keep failing to make
big things happen in my life well this is probably
why probably because of your expectations I mean there's other
factors of course it's not the only factor but it
is a very basic and important factor that I that
I see people struggling with so if you're struggling with
success take everything on here that I'm saying very seriously
so let's just give you a couple of examples to
highlight the absurdity of some expectations that people have about
things so for example what if I came to you
and said hey I expect to become a doctor and
you say okay great what's your plan and I say
I'm going to become a doctor in one year you
would laugh at me you would already be able to
predict that I would fail because my expectation is so
out of whack with the reality the situation of becoming
a doctor the reality is that if you want to
become a doctor you're going to spend a good eight
years in medical school and that's just to get to
starting to do your residency doing your rounds and I
mean that's just to get to the very newbie phases
of being a doctor so that's you know you're you're
off by a factor of eight now when your estimates
are out by a factor of eight chances of catastrophic
failure are are very high above 90% what if I
came to you saying that I expect to build a
100 story skyscraper all by myself and you say what
do you mean all by yourself don't you have a
team a team of people and workers no it's just
going to be me I'm going to build the whole
thing you see that's never going to work I already
failed with that expectation because what I should have done
is I should have done my research and realized how
many man-hours does it take to build a hundred story
skyscraper I don't know I haven't on the research but
I can tell you it would be longer than a
human lifetime so it's that's a project that's impossible to
complete by yourself impossible there's no way you can do
that and it's not just a factor of not enough
time but also just to lift those heavy beams and
to put them in place requires at least two or
three or you know a team of people work in
that you can't do that as a solo human being
what if I came to you and said that I
expect to be an amazing world-class pianist piano player in
one year of practice again you would just dismiss me
as as a total newb I have no chance of
succeeding in that and I would get very frustrated with
my practice if I expected to play the piano as
good as the greatest world masters because he out here
I would be six months as am I brought into
my process of becoming a master pianist I'll be playing
the piano I would be comparing myself to Mozart and
Beethoven and the greatest piano players of all time or
composers or whatever and and then of course I would
be comparing myself and I'd be saying I'm not even
close to that and I would become so demoralized that
I would just quit I probably quit less than a
month into the whole process what about expecting to turn
a profit in your business in under one year if
you're starting a new business that's also a very ridiculous
expectation if you expect that some people they start a
business and they say oh well my business is going
to turn profitable in a year so because of that
I'm gonna I'm gonna buy a bigger house I'm going
to take out a loan and I'm going to get
a new car just like they're already spending the money
they're expecting to get but of course they're grossly under
estimating how long it'll probably take them to really become
profitable in their business usually by a factor of three
or five might take you three or five years to
do that rather than one now that doesn't mean it's
not a good idea to start a business it just
means you need some realistic expectations based on what's actually
statistically common in the marketplace I would bet you that
if you did the statistical analysis every single business ever
started in the last 50 years you would see that
the average for a business aterna profit was was probably
more than than three years and that should ring some
alarm bells for you in your planning and in your
strategizing if you're an entrepreneur starting a new business what
if you expect to become enlightened from going to one
meditation retreat oh boy you're in for a for a
rude awakening they're not going to happen what if you
expect to master and understand all of life from having
one enlightenment experience oh boy you're also in for a
rude awakening you're going to be very disappointed it's not
going to happen what if your affecting to self-actualize from
just sitting there watching all of my videos over and
over and over again as if watching my videos is
really growing you ignoring the part where I tell you
that you need to do one percent Theory to 99%
action and that all this stuff has to be embodied
you're also going to be very disappointed going to be
wondering why why am I not growing why do I
know all this stuff but then I'm so frustrated and
depressed and and I feel so bad about myself and
I'm procrastinating all this yeah of course of course you
award about that what else could you have expected obviously
that's the case if all you do is read books
about how to disassemble car engines that does not mean
that you are qualified to actually disassemble and reassemble a
car engine just from reading a book the book is
a good first step but then you need lots of
practice disassembling engines piece by piece one at a time
probably starting from little engines just taking apart one little
part and then putting it back and then take a
second engine to parts out put them back and then
make sure it all works and then you do that
a bunch of times and then you you take a
big engine you do it once the big engine you
probably fail a couple times on the big engine you
need somebody else to come fix your screw up for
you and then through that process then you'll be qualified
no matter how many books you read won't be enough
or let's say you're expecting to lose 50 pounds by
your wedding time which is a month from now or
something using some kind of gimmick like a diet pill
of course you're going to fail of course because you're
not really seriously thinking about the foundations of what it
takes to become successful in anything in life you're just
skimming the surface of it you're a dilettante the expects
patience that you set determine your level of perseverance which
means when you will quit how quickly you will quit
and of course perseverance is one of the most important
factors in how successful you become in any endeavor that
you undertake and in your life as a whole that's
going to directly correlate to your ability to persevere so
if you want to really be able to stick with
stuff and not to quit you need to be able
to set very realistic expectations because if you set unrealistic
expectations then you get blindsided by reality blindsided by the
marketplace blindsided by your emotional reactions you're going to quit
because it's going to be so frustrating and demoralizing for
you and that's probably the biggest reason that people fail
in life is because of this think of some time
in your life where this is true for you you
could probably think of it does and think of the
times where you were able to succeed why did you
succeed it's probably because you had some realistic expectations you
really understood the the significance and the challenge that was
ahead of you and you prepared yourself for that mentally
you put in the proper plans and strategies and you
were able to succeed you avoided being blindsided by reality
expectations also determine how you judge yourself and your progress
if you think you're not progressing fast enough in your
meditation practice with self inquiry with personal development with your
business or any other aspect like your life purpose always
you have to go back to the drawing board and
ask wait a minute do I have the right expectations
where should I be compared where other people are usually
in this sort of process see because if I'm trying
to become a doctor and I start to judge myself
for not being a very good doctor and I'm only
one or two years into my medical practice hey that's
totally normal that's okay but if I somehow get the
wrong idea that it's not normal and then I'm behind
the curve then I'm going to quit or I'm going
to think that there's something wrong with you and sort
of judge myself I'm gonna start to feel guilty mr.
ask myself oh why why am i such a bad
doctor why am I not as good as everybody else
out there why am I not able to succeed maybe
there's something wrong with me they may have bad genetics
or whatever what in fact all it is is just
your expectations are out of whack expectations also of course
determine how good you feel about your work when you
set unrealistic expectations then you need to rush through your
work because you have a cramped deadline and then of
course they don't have time to really savor your work
you start to cut corners in your work and you
don't feel good about that and you feel like you're
still behind the curve expectations determine how much and how
hard you practice and practice is critical towards developing mastery
in any domain of life and determine how you strategize
and make plans when you expect something to be easy
and effortless and quick you don't have the urge to
put a proper strategy in place you don't through the
think through the logistics of the problem because hey it's
just an easy thing we'll just kind of fly by
the seat of our pants and things will just work
out and you can see how the disastrous this is
for example in military situations so military campaigns need to
be very careful about their expectations because when you expect
when in general for example or a leader expects an
easy victory over their opponents well oftentimes they get destroy
just completely obliterated on the battlefield because they haven't really
thought through what it would take to invade a city
or occupy a country see well you see this especially
with many of the wars that United States have started
in the last century with Korea Vietnam the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars all of this you see the problems here
right is that people make it sound easy and we
get tempted into it because like oh well America has
a very strong military we can defeat everyone with our
advanced technology and in a sense that's true but it's
also very deceptive because even though you have advanced technology
you do very quick blitz sort of invasion okay fine
you can you can blow up some tanks but then
what what plans do you have in place then see
then you get into a disastrous quagmire and then it
all backfires on you well that's just another further example
this and you know when we were invading Iraq we
were promised it's just going to be easy it's going
to be a breeze we're going to we're just going
to destroy the Iraqi troops within a couple of weeks
and we're just going to walk through Iraq and people
will be showering us with flowers and roses and rainbows
and butterflies and then everything will just be peachy right
I mean this is ludicrous it's ludicrous so learn your
lessons from that and apply it to your own life
and notice where in your own life you do that
see when you think that a situations going to be
challenging then you need to prepare then it's like how
do I gather my strategic resources what kind of resources
do I need do I need more money do I
need to save up money do I need to like
save up energy do I need to read books do
I need certain resource do I need to talk to
some experts don't you to get some legal advice do
i what do I need see do I need to
allocate time when you clear out my schedule do I
need to stop watching TV and smoking pot and eating
pizza all these become important considerations when you're really serious
about understanding the the full consequences of a big goal
because what we're really talking about here is I have
a giant goal for my life I want this thing
here or this amazing thing here I want enlightenment I
want a great marriage I want a PhD education ok
fine yeah you want that but are you willing to
work for it are you going to put the right
strategies in place that's mostly the difference between successful and
unsuccessful people is that unsuccessful people they have big dreams
but they're very sloppy with their follow-through and with their
strategy and with their expectations it all begins with wrong
expectations you know by the way why experts and experience
is so valued in business so for example if you're
if you're looking at job posts on monster.com or some
kind of resume website right where they're asking you for
your resumes you're trying to apply for jobs you know
that some companies they always value experience and they always
say ok we need a guy with five years of
experience in this or we need a girl with 20
years experience than this and then of course they pay
you appropriately for that why is that it's not an
accident it's because an expert someone who has lots of
experience can tell you what it really takes to succeed
within some project or endeavor and they can be relatively
accurate about that whereas a noob will underestimate the situation
by factors of 5 or 10 or 100 that's why
noobs are dangerous noobs are dangerous in the military noobs
are dangerous and government noobs are dangerous at every field
of life and if you're a noob at something that's
okay just all you need to really to not make
that a catastrophe is just to recognize that that your
expectations could be really off the mark and then you
can take steps which I'll tell you here in a
minute how to correct that how to avoid the biggest
problems with being a noob but that's why CEOs and
military generals and scientists and engineers all these people they
are valued by how many years of experience they have
because it's through the brute force of experience where reality
has slapped these people really hard before they were noobs
they got slapped now they become experts after years of
doing this reality has robbed them of their fantasies and
has allowed them to now fine-tune their expectation filter in
their minds so now that they set realistic expectations here's
an example that's that is really good like let's say
you're building a house if you go to an inexperienced
architect and you have this dream for building your dream
house and you say okay I want I have a
million dollars to spend to build my dream house and
you plan all this out you spend months architecting with
him this dream house a noob architect will go along
with that whole procedure for you and then and then
try to build your house for you whereas if you
go to an expert architect the first thing he'll ask
you is okay what's your budget a million dollars okay
tell me basically what you want or expect to be
able to build for a million dollars and you you
tell them well I want to I want to sauna
and a hot spa and I want a garden with
koi fish and I want this many acres of land
and you know I want big screen TVs and I
want 20 rooms and the guy will tell you no
that's going to cost you five million dollars not a
million five million you have five million and you say
no all I got is two million tops okay so
he'll say then scrap your project because it's not going
to happen you're going to be in for a rude
awakening what's going to happen if you go through with
this project is you're going to have a half-built house
which is then going to get foreclosed on in its
half-filled state it's just going to be a ghost house
because you're not going to be able to complete the
whole thing see that's where an experienced architect is very
good because an experienced architect could put your expectations into
line and of course you as the as the inventor
of the your dream house with no architecting experience and
maybe you've never built the dream house before in your
life of course you have the most ridiculous expectations for
what you think you can accomplish with a million dollars
you're going to completely underestimate what it takes to build
your dream house probably going to take five times more
than you think it's going to take a lot longer
than you think a lot more planning this is a
very common the reason I mentioned this this dream house
example it's an extremely common area where people get blindsided
people who try to construct their own homes did you
know the consistent story from them is that it takes
five times more time five times more money and five
times more hassle than they ever imagined it would take
not to say you shouldn't do it just to say
have the right expectations that's all we're talking about here
managing your expectations is especially important for solo projects if
you're working in a big company usually that corporation organization
will already have some experts who will temper your expectations
of course they're not perfect a lot of times they're
wrong but when you're just working on yourself by yourself
on some project you want to start your own small
business your own blog you want to let's say do
some kind of art project like you want to write
a novel you want to compose a music album you
want to shoot a documentary you want to shoot a
feature movie in all those situations you're doing that little
solo project sort of thing notice how easily people give
up on their solo projects extremely easily because they have
no other enforcement mechanisms if you're working at a job
with hundred people there's a lot of pressure on you
to perform there whereas when you're by yourself it's so
easy to quit to give up unless you're understanding the
things that I'm talking about here and of course this
is very true for consciousness work so if you're trying
to get enlightened if you're doing self inquire if you're
doing meditation if you're doing any kind of contemplation work
if you're just doing any shadow work on yourself any
kind of therapy work whatever yoga all this stuff these
are like solo projects that you're doing for the most
part you have to really manage your expectations the scope
of your projects must match your will and your resources
and this is why I like to shock people sometimes
with harsh examples of how long it takes to accomplish
some of the stuff that can be accomplished with personal
development for example I commonly say that enlightenment takes a
thousand hours plus and I get criticism from this especially
from enlight people they were criticized me they'll write me
little clever comments they all Leo you're misleading people telling
them that enlightenment takes a thousand hours plus what nonsense
is this what book did you read this from well
you got to understand my perspective and also the audience
that I'm speaking to when I say that yes technically
enlightenment doesn't have to happen in a thousand hours it
could happen right now in five minutes and that's what
they'll tell you all you're already enlightened in five minutes
you can just realize it it's so easy that's only
half the perspective that's really coming from the enlightened person
yeah once you're enlightened it's super easy but that doesn't
help a noob what a noob needs to hear is
they need to hear the reality they need their expectations
properly set and the fact is that if you do
a statistical analysis of all the people who do meditation
and who become enlightened through whatever means you I mean
I haven't done this so I don't know but I'm
willing to bet good money that it would be a
thousand hours plus to get enlightened that's just the fact
and the reason I like to cite that fact even
though sometimes it makes enlightenment look a little daunting like
all thousand hours leo why do you make it look
so challenging because the greatest danger we're doing enlightenment work
is false expectations it's thinking that enlightenment just like this
flimsy little things like all enliven people think that all
they hear about Lyman and then they expect that they
will attain immortality and realize the nature of all of
God in all of reality in all of its infinity
that they'll just realize that over one weekend give me
a break people have devoted their entire lifetimes to this
that's how deep of a pursuit this is people have
pursued this for twenty thirty forty years like a full-time
job and you think you're going to do it in
one weekend in five minutes give me a break that's
a totally wrong expectation to set to people when you
give that peep people that expectation which is what a
lot of the NiO at bitings do which is some
of the criticism I have against people like a cart
Ola and so forth who I mean their teachings are
totally valid but when you're mainstreaming enlightenment like that what
you got to do is you got to hide the
fact that it takes a thousand hours because nobody wants
to hear that you see and that's a general trend
within our culture that's a general reason why I like
to fight these sort of high figures because I like
to be conservative and I like to I like to
set your expectations proper that's a rare thing because every
single marketing course will tell you and teach you to
mislead your customers expectations we do this as a culture
and marketing is very terrible this is a very negative
influence it leaves people on it unable to pursue mastery
to self-actualize or to to go off and and achieve
success is a very big problem see because what marketing
does is it exploits your false expectations because good marketers
know that the easiest way to sell you a bunch
of crap and to earn a lot of money for
themselves is by convincing you that the thing they're selling
you is quick easy and emotionally effortless and that you
can just pay some money you can be completely brain-dead
you'll have to do any kind of critical thinking and
they'll just give you a solution and you're done and
you can forget about your problem because that's the easiest
way to sell the people if I offer you that
kind of magic pill solution you're going to buy whatever
I'm selling now of course you're probably going to be
disappointed when you realize that life doesn't work this way
and you cannot become a successful self actualizing conscious human
being through this sort of process and this is a
very a very negative influence that marketing has on a
culture it might be a more negative of an influence
than religion has on our culture and a lot of
a lot of scientific and atheistic people say all well
religion such a negative influence on our culture what about
marketing what about Commerce it's such a misleading force and
it's really hard to even run a business it's hard
to even sell self-help products and information when you are
honest with people about what it takes for them to
then get the results that you can get and people
can get some amazing results from self-actualization and consciousness work
and meditation but they are constantly misled and lied to
about what it really takes to do that constantly because
they know that if you're told the truth you won't
do it now a case could be made that Hayley
oh you know it actually is a good idea to
lie to people about how long it takes the enlightened
and how much work it takes because if they knew
up front they would never even start so we got
to trick them into it well you could make that
case I mean if you want to if you want
to teach enlightenment in that fashion okay I you know
that would be your approach I personally don't like that
approach I'd rather be more straightforward with people about it
because I think that if I set false expectations a
lot of people will fail now of course people can
criticize me and say well DeLeo you're setting very conservative
expectations and you're making it sound so hard it's so
difficult that no one's even going to do it and
therefore you're going to scare a lot of people off
yeah that's that's some of the pros and cons of
the different approaches to teaching in different ways that's why
different teachers have different styles of teaching because they resonate
with different pros and cons and I'm not particularly saying
that my method is the the one true best method
I'm just saying that this is one that I have
sort of favored from my own reasons because this is
kind of how I like to be taught how I
like to learn personal development I personally find it very
offensive and highly unethical when people teach me something but
then withhold the real effort that it takes to accomplish
the results that they are talking about in their advertising
so in their advertising it will always talk about all
look at this woman who lost a hundred pounds eating
our Subway sandwiches or whatever or it's like all look
at this person who's made a million dollars doing our
marketing scheme our affiliate pyramid marketing scheme you see oh
look at this person like our character Lee he just
got enlightened overnight one you know one thing happened in
a BAM you got enlightened but these I don't even
care about these kinds of examples because these are exceptions
you can't base a sound life strategy on these kinds
of examples these are freaks these are accidents you base
your life strategy on the averages what I'm interested from
a marketer if marketer was really honest he would say
here are a thousand of my customers and out of
a thousand of my customers to get the result that
I'm promising here the average was that they put in
a thousand hours of work that would be honest that
would be honest marketing but of course nobody does that
they do the exact opposite of that highly misleading so
when I talk about business for example I often am
conservative with my expecting I try to set for you
for your business I tell you know think three five
years down the road it might take you that long
just to get it going or when I talk about
life purpose I talk about in in five or ten-year
time frames where it's like think about your life purpose
five ten years down the road not one year down
the road because in one year even though you can
get good results in one year it's just the wrong
expectation it's the wrong timeframe and it leads to failure
this just really as simple as that and it contributes
to this to this culture that we have this this
this kind of get-rich-quick mentality which I hate I just
hate this mentality and what I hate the most is
how much it is employed within personal development which is
the most disgusting and unethical thing I think that that
personal development as an industry does is is it employs
these these sleazy tactics the low consciousness tactics that exist
everywhere else and they are somewhat understandable you know if
a low consciousness tactic is used to market some Wall
Street product to me like a stock or something I
can understand that Wall Street is all about low consciousness
earning money but when it's marketed by a self-help guru
or buy by an enlightened master or by a meditation
teacher that is now that's to me that that's so
out of integrity with what this work is really about
if to realize that our minds are lazy your mind
is lazy and therefore what that means is that we
will constantly underestimate the costs of our projects the timelines
the schedules we get cocky about these things we get
cocky about entering into wars we get cocky about how
to make big significant changes in our lives which is
not to say that these things necessarily have to be
hard or take long just have realistic expectations I see
that one of my jobs in this whole process of
guiding you in this field of self-actualization is to correct
your expectations based on all the research that I do
now how do you set the right expectations for yourself
it's actually quite simple there's just a couple of steps
you need to do which newbies don't do and they're
very common-sense steps so number one do research into the
thing you're trying to succeed at whether you're trying to
build a house or a great marriage or anything else
or get enlightened do the research study the people who
have already succeeded in these fields in these like-minded projects
and endeavors and just see what it took them get
fascinated about the behind-the-scenes of everything in life and especially
the stuff you're trying to succeed at so what I
mean by behind the scenes is one of the things
I used to love I don't watch movies that much
anymore but when I used to watch a lot of
TV and especially DVD movies and stuff I would love
to get a DVD movie and then more than the
movie I would love to watch the making of of
the movie maybe you can resonate with that it's amazing
I would get more enjoyment watching the making of looking
behind the scenes how is the movie actually made like
I remember watching the behind the scenes of James Cameron's
Avatar or George Lucas's Star Wars like that's infinitely fascinating
to me I'm actually by books about Star Wars I
would read in detail how did George Lucas write the
script where the stories come where all his ideas come
from were of what we're all sources and it's just
amazing the study that's a how did I'll come together
what were the business aspects of putting together Star Wars
is it's a pretty crazy story of how it came
to came together it almost didn't come together he had
to she had to go through hell to make that
stuff work it was really difficult so when you read
that the reason the behind the scenes are so important
to what I'm saying here this is actually a tactic
for you try to set right expectations is because when
you look behind the curtain at how the magic trick
is achieved you see all the guts of how the
sausage is made you see that process and you go
wow oh my god I didn't even think about that
oh so much more work than I thought and time
and again you discover this if you study amazing musicians
amazing and actors or amazing business people or you know
amazing artists you look at their process and you see
that it's so much more work than you ever thought
it was to produce that little thing because you know
when you see a nicely polished movie on the on
the theater screen it's only like 90 minute movie and
you would say well how long help how hard could
it be to make a 90 minute movie just 90
minutes I mean if you divide that 90 minutes into
seconds you know it's it's only like what a thousand
seconds or something so that much and then you know
you think that well how much can a second of
movie cost does it really cost a million dollars but
then when you take up into account of budget of
a movie like Avatar which I think had a budget
of like over 100 million dollars you see that and
then divide that by how many seconds the film is
and then you get a sense of how many millions
of dollars a single second of film footage costs it's
it's absurd right it it's like oh I never thought
it was like that and then you get to see
the process of these people go through and that's very
eye-opening and then that aligns your expectations properly so I
always encourage you to go out there and study all
the people that you admire get down and nitty gritty
into their process see what they actually had to do
to succeed our culture presents very false notions of how
they succeeded oftentimes our culture makes it look easy read
biographies - it's also important when you read biographies of
successful people you learn also sort of the guts of
what it took for them to do what they did
their thought process what kind of plans they made their
attitude their problems with money their problems with handling logistics
that's all very important stuff how do they persevere a
lot of biographies talk about perseverance you talk about fear
they talk about failure a lot and these are all
things you got to learn if you want to become
successful talk to experts don't just read the but actually
try to go interview somebody in your field like you
want to become a musician go interview a musician you
want to become a film director interview a film director
you want to become enlightened go interview an enlightened person
talk to them doesn't have to be a formal interview
just talk to them pick their brain ask them questions
about the behind-the-scenes process it's really amazing to take in
the light master sit down with them and then ask
them okay so tell me the guts of your journey
how did it really happen not the polished up version
that you put on the back of your book but
how did it really happen and then that really tells
you oh okay that's why it's so hard because yeah
this guy spent like 10,000 hours in agony meditating and
now he's so damn enlightened well of course of course
and of course I'm not there yet because I haven't
I haven't gone through that I wasn't that hardcore you
see these people who are deeply enlightened they're very hardcore
people and I go yeah of course of course I
didn't achieve enlightenment in 1 year or in two years
of self-inquiry of course of course wrong expectations very importantly
also to set the right expectations is to just at
some point you have to realize and give up this
whole notion of quick fixes stop looking for quick fixes
stop asking for freebies I was at the supermarket the
other day just buying some food too much much opping
and I hear over the loudspeaker some lady comes on
she says attention all customers right now we have some
store special if you go to the back of the
store we are giving out free gifts to people come
get your free gift right now and a bunch of
people around me ran to the back of the store
to get their free gifts and I completely ignored it
and just went about contemplating whatever I think I was
listening to actually some some audio book or something I
was listening to my audio I just kept listening to
it I didn't even it didn't even cross my mind
to go there but because I needed some bananas I
had to go through that part of the store anyways
so I just went there to grab my bananas not
to get some freebie and then of course I know
what the game is right the game is that they
get you to come there to get their freebies but
then of course they pitch you on some other stupid
and the freebie they give you it's not something you
even need all those people that were getting those stupid
one dollar freebies or whatever they just got suckered suckered
into standing there and wasting their time in their mental
energy listening to this marketing pitch for a stupid freebie
it's because people have this mentality of quick fixes I
don't want quick fixes I don't want anybody to fix
anything for me I don't want it to be easy
that's a that's an attitude I've cultivated almost to an
erotic degree where sometimes people do actually offer me freebies
and stuff and I just say no when actually the
freebie could have been helpful to me so in a
sense maybe yeah maybe I've gone too much in the
opposite direction but I see most people most people are
just like they're clipping coupons and this is this whole
coupon clipping mentality you know just uh from a very
pragmatic common sense perspective if a business is offering you
freebies why is it doing that is it doing that
to be nice to you know when a business offers
you freebies it's because they're earning more on the freebie
from you then you are from getting that freebie you
see how it works so generally speaking whenever you get
those kind of offers just ignore them focus on what
you're doing in your life focus on your life purpose
focus on your meditation practices focus on the that you
can control not what other people hand out to you
and lastly how do you set right expectations make conservative
estimates you know someone on the forum on the actualized
forum asked me there's a long thread there with personal
questions that people ask me and somebody asked me Leo
in one of your past videos you talked about your
own life and you said that you expect to live
till like sixty years old and then the question was
why did you say sixty years why do you say
that you're going to only live to 60 most people
live to 70 or beyond because I'm making a conservative
estimate you see the problem with most people is that
they assume that they're going to live forever and if
they have all the time in the world to accomplish
all their dreams and I know that that's a trap
so I counteract that by the in conservative estimates so
when I think of myself that I'm going to live
for 60 years okay hey that tells me I'm already
past the halfway mark I'm 32 past the halfway mark
uh that gets me to action because I don't want
to be 59 and and then still have a bunch
of that I want to accomplish in my life you
see and also because I know that when I'm going
to be 60 I'm going to have less energy and
it will have less mental capacity I'm going to have
more diseases and medical conditions I might be alive but
I might not be able to think or to walk
by that point see so yeah you technically people live
till like what they're 77 or something that's roughly the
average I think in the United States average lifespan like
seventy five seventy sevens like that but you got to
wonder what condition are those people in after let's say
they're 65 are they're really doing anything with their life
most of them aren't many of them are in wheelchairs
can barely walk in nursing homes in hospital beds so
I mean at that by that point you don't really
have much life left you're just sort of like just
hanging on by that point now of course doesn't have
to be that way if you have a good diet
and good exercise and take care of yourself and you're
a bit lucky then you can push way past that
you can be very active even in your 70s and
so forth so nothing it can't I'm just saying that's
some conservative estimates so that hey you know when I
get to 60 or 70 and I'm still alive and
I'm still kicking and I'm still active and I still
have energy I'm not in a hospital hooked up to
some IV thing then I can be pleasantly surprised I
give you happy about that I could really enjoy that
I'd rather undershoot with my estimates than overshoot because imagine
you think you're going to live till 80 and then
tomorrow you get in a car crash and you're going
to be lying your hospital bed for the rest of
your life that happens too so be careful a lot
of people die in car crashes a lot of people
have heart attacks a lot of people have brain disorders
now it's important that you don't take everything I'm saying
in this episode as meaning that you now need to
set low expectations or to not dream big I'm a
big advocate of dreaming big but in a realistic way
with the understanding that a big dream requires big strategy
and big planning the bigger your dreams the more realistic
and pragmatic you have to be realistic doesn't mean your
dreams have to be low and small and like everyone
else's it just means that you recognize that to make
a big dream real takes a lot of work and
you gotta take take it very seriously it's not a
flimsy thing get truthful about what it's going to cost
you and then really ask yourself are you willing to
pay that cost and balance out your optimism and idealism
with realism and pragmatism this is another example where balance
and personal development and in life in general is so
critical striking this dynamic balance between the two and I
can't tell you exactly how to strike that balance because
for that you need lots of experience life lots of
experience in your domain that you're trying to master lots
of experience in your life to find out what's too
optimistic and then what's too too realistic in the sense
that see if you're too realistic the problem with that
is is that then you underestimate what you're able to
accomplish so if you look out and you see that
everyone else is taking ten years to become enlightened you
say well it's going to take me ten years and
then that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so don't let it
limit you is the point that's that's a see that's
funnel that's subtle how do I teach that to you
I don't know I'd have to I'd have to do
a mind meld with you you'd have to suck in
all my life experiences from my mind into your mind
to do that so unfortunately doesn't work that's why you
need to put this stuff into practice and then through
trial and error through the mastery process you yourself will
become an expert in the areas that you need to
become an expert at and in life generally speaking now
the last question that I want to address here is
some people might think the leo what about this idea
of having no expectations so it sounds like what you're
setting saying here is rather than idealistic expectations I should
have realistic expectations but what about the possibility of no
expectations at all might not want sight not that be
better that's an interesting question I think if you're an
advanced practitioner of personal development and consciousness work maybe you've
had enlightened experience or two then you might be leaning
towards this idea of like well how about I just
approach my next project with no expectations at all with
sort of a blank Zen mind that could be a
valid strategy although I still think that you can get
into trouble there I think that for most people that
wouldn't work simply because it's very hard to have no
expectations you need some serious spiritual practice to get to
that point in first place so for most people definitely
won't work as a strategy but then even if you
get to this place have no expectations I'm just trying
to imagine like how would that work if I'm trying
to build like a serious project like a skyscraper or
a big software development project could I really have no
expectations when I start a business or I want to
construct a house with no expectations I just I don't
I don't see that that approach would work because you
need to you need to budget you need to plan
your energy your time your resources you would need to
have at least a rough idea of how long it's
going to take you to accomplish this project because if
you literally have no expectations that sort of means that
you don't know whether it's going to take you like
a month to build your house or ten years to
build your house and you're cool with it either way
now I mean I mean maybe you can get so
Zen that you don't give a if it takes you
a month or a year or ten years to build
your house but uh but I think the real world
will just make that impractical because if it takes ten
years to build your house well um it's just not
going to work for you I think your project will
just probably fail so I think that you even if
you could get the Zen attitude you still need to
study specifically the kind of expectations that are realistic in
the domains where you are trying to manipulate reality and
create the kind of result you want see success is
different from Zen Zen is about accessing existential truths and
absolute reality and then the game of success is all
about manipulating reality and if you want to successfully manipulate
your reality then you got to play by those rules
and you can have to plan to strategize alright that's
it I hope I've convinced you the importance of expectations
and that you take this to heart and start to
realign some expectations you might have especially when it comes
to self actualization to actualize org and to maybe your
psychedelic experiences and also to all your enlightenment and annotation
practices all right I'm out of here please click the
