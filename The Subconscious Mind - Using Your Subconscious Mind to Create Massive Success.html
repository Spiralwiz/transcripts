hey this is leo for actualized.org and in this quick
self-help segment we are going to cover the subconscious mind
we're going to talk about what the subconscious mind is
how it influences your life and the results that you're
getting in your life your success and your fulfillment in
life and then also how you can start to work
with your subconscious mind to get it on board to
get you the kind of result that you want all
right so i'm only gonna have i'm only gonna have
about 10 to 15 minutes here to cover this topic
but the subconscious mind is an extremely deep topic that
i'm very very fascinated by and it's also crucial for
the kind of results that you are or are not
getting in your life so if you're frustrated with things
like losing weight starting a business performing well on your
job or anywhere else in your life that you're not
getting the results that you want you got to realize
the most important thing is that you got to start
to understand your subconscious mind so the fact that you're
watching this video and you're researching this topic is a
very very very good first start but i'm going to
cover the subconscious mind a lot more in depth in
other videos so let's break into it what is the
subconscious mind well basically what you've got is you've got
your conscious mind which is what we tend to think
of as our mind right it's us it's who we
are it's everything that we think it's everything that we
feel throughout the day it's basically what we would call
consciousness or awareness that's like the conscious mind the subconscious
mind and this is what most people do not understand
unless they've really studied this topic and thought about it
deeply the subconscious mind is really responsible for everything else
that's happening in your body and in your life all
the behaviors so the subconscious mind those are the things
below your awareness level below your awareness threshold that are
operating on you these are the habits that you have
these are the beliefs that you have this is the
self-image that you've cultivated what you think about yourself what
you think about your capabilities and your limitations and your
weaknesses and your strengths this is also going to include
your map and model of reality this is it goes
really deep here but this is basically your model of
reality and what you think is right what you think
is wrong your values like the stuff that motivates you
on a very very deep level that stuff is all
subconscious we tend to think that that's conscious but really
that all sits below the level of awareness unless you've
done a lot of introspection and personal development work and
so what tends to happen is that the subconscious is
driving a lot of what you do throughout your day
literally i would say 95 of the things that you
do throughout your day are done subconsciously or even unconsciously
subconsciously means that when you're executing your morning routine or
when you're even having a conversation with a friend a
lot of the things that are happening there the behaviors
you're not breaking those down in your mind and saying
okay i need to pull out the toothbrush put the
toothpaste on it stick it in my mouth scrape it
around for five minutes then pull it out rinse you're
not thinking all that that's just happening spontaneously in fact
what you're probably thinking is you're probably thinking about something
totally different while you're brushing your teeth you're probably thinking
about the fact that you've got maybe a big meeting
at work coming up and you got to prepare for
that or maybe the electricity bill is due or you
gotta work on your business and there's some problem that
you gotta tackle so you're probably thinking about something like
that versus the mechanics of brushing your teeth so the
question then is who's brushing your teeth really is it
the conscious you or the subconscious you and if you
really ponder this and you start to notice different areas
in your life where stuff is just happening it's just
happening spontaneously without a lot of your conscious effort and
maybe even awareness in the moment then that is a
sign that is happening from your subconscious mind and that's
really what it is is that we have habits and
we have beliefs and we have just everything that's going
on in our lives that is coming from a unconscious
place and this is a really important idea because this
means that if you want to get a change in
your behavior if you want to get a change in
your beliefs if you want to get a change in
your life and you're not happy with the way that
things are running right now then the real solution if
you really want to solve it permanently and you really
want amazing results the real solution is going to happen
on a subconscious level not on a conscious level because
simply because your behaviors which are contributing to the results
that you're getting the action that you're taking those are
those are coming from the subconscious so if you have
certain beliefs that are holding you back if you have
certain limitations about who you think you are your self-image
how confident you are how good you think you look
how what you're what you think you're capable of or
not capable of that is going to hold you back
and you're not even going to realize that you could
spend years hitting your head against the wall trying to
lose weight for example or trying to be more successful
in relationships or in dating or trying to start a
business and fail at it simply because you've got this
stuff below the surface you don't even realize that it's
there so what can you really do about this well
the trick is that it is under the surface and
it's not something that you can just go in and
immediately fix the other problem is the subconscious mind doesn't
really respond very well to just a one-time conscious input
so you might think well the way to fix that
is to for example go to therapy and maybe we'll
dig up some stuff in the past about uh about
something that happened to me in my childhood some traumatic
event and then that will surface and that will clear
up and all of a sudden now i will be
better in my relationship or all of a sudden i'm
gonna be better at the gym or i'm gonna be
better with managing money whatever and while that can happen
that does happen sometimes generally the problem with that is
that just knowing about it is not enough putting a
little bit of awareness on it is is good is
a good start but the subconscious mind it's really an
animal mind and this you can think of that all
animals are really operating on a subconscious level so they
do have an awareness they do have consciousness but they
don't have that kind of prefrontal cortex thinking that we
tend to associate with just normal consciousness they're operating more
on a subconscious level so it's more instinctual more behavioral
and what they really respond to what kind of response
or stimulus that kind of system responds to is carrots
and sticks so it's really good at understanding when you
give it incentives and you incentivize again and again and
again and it's really good at understanding sticks being hit
over the head again and again and again so that's
why that's why if you've ever had big changes in
your life or big transformations it's usually happened because you've
either gotten yourself on board with some sort of really
inspiring vision and you drilled that vision into yourself through
some sort of process of visualization and that got a
shift in your subconscious or conversely this is probably more
likely the case if you don't do a lot of
personal development work is that you tend to go the
negative model and what happens is that your subconscious is
reshaped by basically hitting your head against a brick wall
time and time and time and time and time and
time and time again until finally something clicks something gives
in and what's basically happening in both those models is
that your subconscious is being re-trained and the important thing
to understand here is that that takes time you cannot
simply retrain the subconscious mind with one stimulus you can't
just give yourself one carrot you can't give yourself one
stick you have to do it again and again and
again and again and again and that's why consistency and
persistence is a key hallmark trait of really successful people
because they achieve their success by going out there and
growing themselves and working on their subconscious whether they realize
what they're doing or or they don't they're working on
their subconscious and they're altering it by either doing this
visualization process and creating amazing visions and goals for themselves
and repeating them to themselves ad nauseam until they just
are totally immersed and they totally believe it and they
literally reshape their beliefs reshape their self-image and are able
to go out and do amazing things or it's the
other way around they they hit their head against the
wall and they fail again and again and again and
they just keep struggling and struggling and struggling but they
just keep at it because they're they're naturally persistent people
and just keep at it and they keep at it
they keep at it they have faith and then some
stuff clicks for them and they move on to the
next level and they evolve and then they evolve some
more and they evolve some more and they just through
that process of persistence are able to remold their subconscious
mind to get it to the point where it's doing
what what they want for them and so that's kind
of the process and that's why change is difficult and
that's why change can take a long time and that's
why a simple one-time motivational speech or reading a book
one time or going to the gym one time or
thinking positively for one day is not going to really
create a really meaningful deep level of change in yourself
because that's going to take place on a conscious level
and it's going to feel nice and you might even
be very inspired and you might feel great about yourself
for the moment but it's not going to be a
lasting thing because everything about you that's that's very permanent
and lasting that is that is embedded deep in your
subconscious and so if you want permanent lasting results if
you want to eliminate some deep-seated negative habits then what
you got to do is you got to do the
opposite is you got to have some deep seated positive
habits some deep-seated positive thoughts that you're constantly thinking so
it's a question of positive versus negative patterns and these
patterns are like etched into your mind etched into your
mind and your beliefs are even deeper because you have
your thoughts that you're having and then you're having the
beliefs that are kind of creating the model of reality
and this is a really really deep concept where you
can do a lot of amazing very advanced personal development
work is when you start to really work with this
idea and you start to use techniques that start to
create these groups and you start to align your life
with this whole idea that what you're really doing to
get success is not going out there and getting some
external results or taking some action or hitting the gym
really hard what you're really doing is you're working on
yourself and you're working on the subconscious mind of yours
and you're really analyzing it you're introspecting on it you're
journaling about it you're doing the visualizations you're doing affirmations
you're doing various techniques you're maybe going to therapy whatever
and you're you're basically trying to get stuff to come
out up from your subconscious and then you're also trying
to instill stuff with your conscious mind into the subconscious
but of course your conscious mind is limited because you
only have so much willpower throughout the day and there's
only so much you can do using your conscious mind
that's only going to get you so far in life
what you really got to do is you got to
be smarter than that and you've got to start thinking
about okay i've got this limited willpower how can i
use it how can i not waste it and use
it to imprint those grooves on my subconscious mind so
then the subconscious mind does all the heavy lifting because
what's really nice is that once you really train your
subconscious mind in any activity whether it's a sport a
musical instrument running a business or being good with people
in relationships or just mastering your own psychology for example
by stopping eliminating worrying and instilling positive thought habits when
when you do that then after a while you build
those habits and it's just like ah it's just like
a relief finally i can i can actually have some
change in my life and i don't need to constantly
stay vigilant with it right it's like i can now
go to the gym and i don't need to be
always on guard about falling off track i can be
a little bit more at peace with it because i've
built the habit i've imprinted i've imprinted that idea into
my subconscious and now i can really use that and
use that willpower that i have i can put it
to other purposes so this is a really powerful advanced
level concept i'm going to wrap it up here i
think i gave you a pretty good sense of what
the subconscious mind is the action items for you from
this video are awareness i want you to gain more
awareness i want you to spend a little bit more
time throughout your day noticing the things that are happening
that you're doing you are doing them but it's the
subconscious part of you that's doing them really think about
that and think about the fact that your subconscious mind
could be more aligned with your conscious goals and desires
than it currently is that is the first step and
then i have so many other techniques and ideas about
how to really reprogram your subconscious mind this is personally
