            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the Ego</b>: The ego is an aspect of oneself that is identified as self. It is a complex construct of self-image, beliefs, thoughts, and emotions that reside at both conscious and subconscious levels. Like an iceberg, only approximately 10% of the ego is consciously understood, while the remaining 90% operates subconsciously.
</li><li><b>Ego, Identification, and Separation</b>: The ego separates itself from everything else, considering anything beyond one's physical body as external. This delimits identity to oneself and is deeply biologically ingrained. On some levels, even personal attachments to family or material possessions are perceived as separate from oneself.
</li><li><b>Ego, Inertia and Personal Growth</b>: The ego's inclination to self-preservation can lead to stagnation. It resists exploring reality and may hinder personal growth and higher achievements. The ego is built based on a lifetime of experiences starting from early childhood.  Changing the ego is difficult due to the interwoven complexity of these experiences.
</li><li><b>Building on Ego for Success and Development</b>: Personal development involves working with the ego that can be obstinate and close-minded. The ego, arbitrary but constant, is responsible for all one's behaviors, actions, beliefs and thoughts. Altering the ego does not collapse one's world but evolves consciousness to a higher state resulting in a calmer, less judgmental and more comfortable self.
</li><li><b>Ego Dissolving and Enlightenment</b>: Ultimately, numbing down and dissolving the ego leads to a state of enlightenment. With consistent practice, such as meditation, one can reach a state of oneness with the Universe, seeing oneself as part of everything else and no longer judging things as good or bad. This process requires considerable time and effort, but it leads to a more open-minded and calm state of mind.
</li><li><b>Ego Dissolution and Evolution</b>: The ego plays a significant role in personal development. When we stop clinging onto beliefs and resistances, we attain a sense of personal power and emotional stability. This is because we perceive ourselves as part of the larger world rather than separate entities, leading to abatement of divisions on what's good or bad and an easier acceptance of life events, including death. Evolution of the ego occurs naturally throughout life as we adjust to various circumstances, experiences, and practices such as meditation. This process helps to diminish the ego over time and promotes an overall feeling of calm and relaxation.
</li><li><b>Adjustment through Traumatic Experience</b> : Traumatic experiences such as a terrible break-up or divorce leave scars on the ego and necessitate its adaptation. This results in a shift from a "me-centered" ego to a more responsible, independent, and open-minded one. Over time, you grow more open-minded, realizing that good and bad are relative, which further expands and dissolves the ego.
</li><li><b>Increased Self-control and Reduced Anxiety</b>: As the ego dissolves, individuals start to notice increased self-control, decreased neuroticism, anxiety, and worry. This reduction in worry and thought preoccupation leads to a less invasive identity. Buddhist monks sit for hours each day for years to dissolve their ego, but every individual goes through this process gradually.
</li><li><b>Observance and Lessened Judgement</b>: There is a universal tendency towards judgmental thinking and evaluation in human nature, which leads to an incessant chase for good and avoidance of bad, causing emotional turmoil. However, dissolving the ego helps us to move away from such judgement and become more present in the moment, leading to increased peace, calm, and a higher level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Conclusion and More Resources</b>: Leo concludes the segment by emphasizing the importance of raising conscious levels, asking viewers to comment, like, and share the video, and offering further content for those interested in learning more about ego management on his website, Actualized Work. He also offers a weekly newsletter providing tips, techniques, and strategies for working with the ego.
