            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4MCnc2Ip8g8' target='_blank'>Why Women Use You For Money - And How To Never Get Used Again</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>why women use men for money</b>: Leo claims it's men's misunderstanding of female attraction that opens them up to being used. For instance, men often assume women are attracted to wealth, leading them to lavish money and gifts on women in an attempt to court them. 
</li><li><b>the real nature of female attraction</b>: According to Leo, what actually attracts women is emotional stimulation by a man, his confidence, and his status. A man's financial status doesn't affect his dating success. 
</li><li><b>misconception of male providers</b>: Leo criticizes the typical men's mindset of impressing and attracting women by showering them with expensive and lavish lifestyles. He suggests this approach comes from a misunderstanding of women's real needs and desires.
</li><li><b>women's perspective on men's lavish spending</b>: Women, seeing men spending freely on them, go with the flow and accept these gestures. However, these gifts don't necessarily translate to attraction towards the man. In fact, such supplication can often be perceived as desperation by women and can make men seem less attractive.
</li><li><b>the wrong equation of giving money and receiving love</b>: Leo explains that men wrongly assume that giving money and gifts will make a woman fall in love with them. This misconception can lead to disappointment and resentment when women accept the money, but don't reciprocate with affection.
</li><li><b>money and supplication equated with inferiority</b>: Since women prefer men with a sense of higher confidence and status, men who use material things to win them over can be seen as inferior or less attractive. Moreover, trying to attract women with money tends to put men into the "provider" role, which makes them less attractive to women.
</li><li><b>benefits of emotional stimulation over material possessions</b>: Unlike money and gifts, emotional stimulation can create genuine attraction between men and women. Men who are capable of emotionally stimulating women are more attractive than those who use money as a tool for attraction.
</li><li><b>negative impact of using money for attraction</b>: Using money alone to attract women generally leads to unfulfilling, superficial relationships. Men who follow this approach tend to be left disillusioned when women choose other men who may not have the same financial resources, but are better at emotional stimulation. 
</li><li><b>false label of women as materialistic</b>: Men often label women as gold diggers or materialistic when they see women going for other men, despite being lavished with money and gifts. However, Leo suggests that women are not driven by wealth, but rather by emotional connections. Trying to turn women into "whores" of material things is not effective according to Leo. 
</li><li><b>wrong assumptions leading to resentment towards women</b>: Men who don't understand the nature of female attraction often hold bitterness towards women, which can negatively affect their future relationships and dating situations. Leo encourages men to understand and work on providing emotional stimulation to women rather than relying on providing material things. 
</li><li><b>need for self-improvement instead of looking for shortcuts</b>: Leo criticizes men seeking shortcuts for attracting women and stresses the need for personal growth and self-improvement to genuinely attract women. He also emphasizes the need to stimulate a woman emotionally instead of trying to impress them with material wealth. 
</li><li><b>misunderstanding female attraction and personal growth</b>: It's important for men to study the areas they want to improve in, such as understanding and attracting women. Learning from others who have mastered these areas and dating multiple women are highlighted as ways towards improving this understanding. Leo discusses the importance of personal development in attracting women and encourages viewers to keep the conversation going in the comments, and to subscribe to his newsletter for more insight on topics like confidence, masculinity, and adding passion to one's life.
</li><li><b>Men using money to attract women</b>: Leo reemphasizes that using money as a means to attract women often leads to superficial relationships. Women may take advantage of the financial benefits but will still be on the lookout for someone who provides emotional stimulation. He states that treating a woman with emotional care is more important than providing her with money for genuine attraction and connection.
</li><li><b>Media influences on relationship expectations</b>: Leo discusses how mainstream media often portrays a poor model of relationship where men are expected to provide for women, thereby encouraging a misconception that women desire financial support. He recommends men to transition from a provider mindset to one that focuses on being fun and emotionally stimulating.
</li><li><b>Detrimental shortcut approach of using money</b>: Leo explains that the use of money is often seen as a shortcut to attracting women. He negates this idea, asserting that this method is only effective in attracting those who are purely interested in the money, not genuine attraction. He argues that this approach stems from a desire for an easy way out, and reluctance to improve weaker aspects of their personality. 
</li><li><b>Personal growth as a key to attractive personality</b>: Leo encourages personal development and building up one's personality rather than using money to attract women. He shares his experience of investing time in understanding and improving himself for better interaction with women, stating that it required extensive work and dedication but was ultimately more rewarding than using money as a shortcut.
</li><li><b>Practical example of using personality over money to attract women</b>: Leo shares a personal example of when he successfully attracted a woman of high status and beauty using his personality, not money. He highlights how other suitors who used the money approach failed to attract her. He explains that the woman was unaware of the money-oriented intentions of her suitors and he pointed it out to her, further evidencing that money is not an effective method for genuine attraction.
</li><li><b>The Guy Trying to Win Her Over with Money and Favors</b>: A man was involved with a woman, providing financial support and helping to further her nursing career in the hopes of eventually marrying her. Despite his efforts, the woman did not feel attraction towards him, rather she felt obliged to reciprocate his feelings because of the help he had given her.
</li><li><b>Personal Encounters Demonstrating Emotional Attraction</b>: Leo shares personal anecdotes where he attracted women by being carefree, confident, and not supplicating to them. He displayed indifference even when other men were trying to court these women, which made him more attractive to them.
</li><li><b>Asserting Confidence over Providing Financial Support</b>: Leo's stance exemplifies how emotional stimulation can triumph over financial support in attracting women. By asserting his confidence and showing that he doesnt care whether the woman chooses him or not, he manages to evoke a stronger emotional response from the women and subsequently, more attraction.
</li><li><b>Understanding How Attraction Works</b>: Its important for men to understand how attraction works, focusing on emotionally stimulating women, rather than trying to buy their affection. Leo emphasizes that attempting to use money as a crutch to attract women never works.
</li><li><b>Personal Development over Seeking Shortcuts</b>: Men looking to improve their success in the dating sphere should focus on personal development and understanding the dynamics of attraction. Leo stresses the importance of studying areas one wants to improve in, gaining practical experience, and learning from others skilled in the field.
</li><li><b>Engage the Audience and Call to Action</b>: At the end of the video, Leo encourages viewers to share their thoughts in the comments and to like, share, and subscribe to his free newsletter on actualized.org, offering future videos and exclusive content to help individuals with their personal development goals.
