            <ul>
    <li><b>Passion for helping others change their lives</b>: Leo, Leo, founded Actualized.org to assist others in transforming their lives as he succeeded in doing. He speaks from his past struggle and constant search for techniques and information that could bring happiness, freedom from fear and anxiety, and financial security. 
</li><li><b>Investment in personal growth</b>: Leo invested over $100,000 in personal development materials, leading to radical changes in his life. This includes starting a business, financial independence, significant improvements in his dating and fitness life, and more positive thinking. 
</li><li><b>Ability to change and the power of information</b>: Leo emphasizes that we are now in an information era where products and resources are available to aid in creating the life that we want. This requires taking initiative and following certain principles of success, which are also the principles of change.
</li><li><b>Understanding what you want</b>: According to Leo, it is important to understand and articulate clearly what you want in life to avoid aimless wanderings. Knowing your goals, vision, and values are fundamental for positive changes. 
</li><li><b>Shaping your inner game</b>: The most significant part of the process of change is the psychology and inner game which includes the individual's beliefs, mindsets, emotional control, discipline, and mental techniques. Leo argues that sustainable change in the external world is only possible after modifying the inner game.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-mastery</b>: Leo advocates for the concept of self-mastery. To create lasting, positive change, individuals need to understand their emotions and psychology deeply. This includes identifying self-sabotaging behaviour, detrimental belief systems, and employing strategies that are sustainable. 
</li><li><b>Personal development blueprint</b>: Leo's personal development blueprint, available at actualizado.org/blueprint, covers 100 of the greatest personal development concepts. This resource helps individuals understand how to find their life purpose, identify their values, and get all the inner game elements in place to achieve lasting success and change in their life.
