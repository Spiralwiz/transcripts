            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/CKpY8ksL1UE' target='_blank'>Staying Hungry - How To Use Pain For Growth</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Reminders of origin helps in staying motivated</b>: Leo points out that it becomes necessary to remind ourselves of our origins, especially when we have achieved an appreciable level of success. He talks about his experiences of fighting for survival and success, and how opening old emotional wounds have refreshed his perspective.(<b>Leo's story about fighting a legal case in Toronto</b>: Leo tells a story about a difficult legal case he fought in Toronto after being ditched by his lawyer. The old client not only owed him and his partner $23,000 but was also counter-suing them for $55,000. It was deeply stressful and brought out his fears and emotional triggers related to money.)
</li><li><b>Experiences that evoked do-or-die mentality</b>: Leo recounts various situations that elicited a do-or-die mentality, such as studying in high school and college, losing weight, starting a business and working on his dating skills. He points out that these situations demanded immense emotional labor.
</li><li><b>Combatting complacency due to success</b>: In the video, Leo emphasizes on the growing complacency that comes with an increasing level of success. He ruminates on the need to keep a killer instinct alive instead of coasting on past achievements. He identifies this as a common survival instinct that eventually leads to a comfortable rut hindering growth. 
</li><li><b>Importance of maintaining loftier goals</b>: Leo also discusses the need for enabling creative motivation beyond mere survival instincts. To achieve higher levels of potential, he finds it essential to have larger goals and is personally driven by the impact he can have on people.
</li><li><b>Making an impact as a base need</b>: This part of the video sees Leo stressing on equating the desire to make an impact with basic human needs like food, water and sex. He aims to keep pushing himself to work hard, as he used to during his early career and college days, to continue making an impact.
</li><li><b>Losing Drive After Achieving Moderate Success</b>: Leo points out that a lot of people tend to lose their raw determination and drive to overcome challenges and achieve their goals once they have reached a moderate level of success. This often leads to complacency, which causes them to get stuck in a rut and leads to feelings of frustration and lack of motivation. 
</li><li><b>External Circumstances Forcing Change</b>: Often, people remain stuck in their rut until an external circumstance forces them to re-evaluate their lives. These external circumstances could range from life-changing events like the breakup of a relationship, an eye-opening comment or a business collapse, to traumatic experiences like a theft or a death in the family. Such events often shock individuals into realizing that life is short and they have been worrying over petty matters. Once they are jolted out of this rut, they can often regain their zeal for life. 
</li><li><b>Conscious Control and Bold Actions</b>: Leo emphasizes the idea of taking conscious control of your life to get out of a rut. He argues against complacency and advocates for decisive, bold actions to induce substantial change and progress in life. These might include living in a new country, breaking up a relationship, quitting a job that no longer serves your interests, or initiating a fresh business venture, all of which needs to be done in an intelligent, well-planned and strategic manner. 
</li><li><b>Returning Thirst for Life</b>: Leo discusses how a challenging situation in life can restore your thirst for life, as fighting for your life, though not always pleasant, is far better than being stuck in a rut. The ideal situation is to strive for loftier goals and values but do so with the killer instinct from the past. 
</li><li><b>Value of Intensity and Passion</b>: Leo shares his recent experience of impressing others with his intense argumentative skills in a legal trial, stating that a do-or-die approach can be very powerful. He suggests creating similar circumstances in your own life if you're feeling stuck and emphasizes the importance of perseverance and trust in something bigger. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion and Call to Action</b>: In conclusion, Leo reaffirms the need to stay hungry in life and overcome complacency. He invites viewers to share their comments and visit his website, Actualized.org, for content related to self-actualization and mastering one's psychology.
