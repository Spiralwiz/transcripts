hey this is Leo for actualised org and we're continuing
on with my blueprint series over 100 of the greatest
personal development concepts of all time distilled from over $100,000
of all the personal development material books and seminars that
I've studied and continued study so the concept that we're
covering in this video is called information intake what is
it why is it important and then let's get into
the body what is it this concept simply means that
if you want to be successful and really fulfilled in
your life then you got to watch out for what
kind of information you're taking in to your body and
to your brain specifically so what kind of information are
you feeding yourself are you feeding yourself high-grade information or
low-grade information most people out there are feeding themselves low-grade
information from sources like TV tabloids newspapers internet bloggers and
columns gossip these sorts of sources these are bad sources
so you gotta watch out for where your information is
coming from that's what this concept is as far as
why it's important well hopefully you can tell that if
you're going to be feeding yourself bad information then you're
not going to be able to get good output from
your system think of yourself as a system you're a
mind and your body and just like if you feed
yourself low-grade food you're gonna get low grade performance physically
the same is gonna happen with your mind if you
want to be out there and you want to be
a creative person and I don't mean just creative in
a sense of artistic been the larger sense of creative
I mean creative creating an awesome life for yourself and
of course also being creative at work and going world-class
and doing something really powerful with your life to be
creating an awesome life you need good source material because
the the old maxim is true garbage in garbage out
and that's why it's really important to watch the sources
of information in your life for me personally this has
been a really important principle that I've implemented and I
actually got this idea from Steven Chandler's book a hundred
ways to motivate yourself highly recommend that one so let's
get into the body of this and I really want
to start by reading a quote and the quote is
this the world of people goes up and down and
people go up and down with their world warriors have
no business following the ups and downs of their fellow
men love that and that's from Carlos Castaneda and his
book The Wheel of Time it's actually a really powerful
book where he talks about the difference between the layman
and the warrior and he has this idea of being
a warrior or a shaman and that warriors act differently
they have a certain purpose that they're driven by and
that they live more detached from the world and they
live detached from the affairs of the everyday man and
so that's really why I think information intake is important
is because really number one the biggest problem is that
when you're taking in low-grade information it makes you reactive
and low consciousness and that's the exact opposite of what
we want for you because if you want to create
an exciting awesome life then you need all the high
consciousness that you can get I know personally for me
I'm very very particular about what kind of information I
let into my system into my mind into my environment
I don't want any low grade sources of information you
know why because we already live in a fairly negative
social environment the media is negative the people that we
hang around with unless you're hanging out with an exceptional
social circle they tend to be negative friends family coworkers
those can be negative sources always you know second-guessing you
doubting you giving you reasons for why you can't accomplish
something or flat-out giving you false information false beliefs reinforcing
false beliefs keeping you in your comfort zone so this
is what negative information does for you right and it
also makes you fearful it makes you scarcity based thinking
that there's not enough to go around and so when
you're inundated with all this type of information all this
evidence your mind tends to capitulate after a while it
says you know what they're right I should be afraid
of this I should be afraid of the economy going
bad and I should be afraid of World War 3
and I should be afraid of a zombie apocalypse and
I should be afraid of losing my relationship and I
should be afraid of starting a new business because now
it's not a good environment and I should be afraid
of going and doing something exciting and new and traveling
someplace so all these things kind of keep you in
your box and that's what you want to avoid with
negative or low-grade information as I like to call it
so specifically what do we really mean here by low-grade
that simply means cut out television cut out cable news
cut out traditional newspapers cut out tabloids Facebook Twitter gossip
from your friends pessimistic friends if you're hanging around a
lot of pessimistic people in your social circle you're socializing
with pessimistic people cut that out and then of course
mindless internet browsing and I'm sure that there's other sources
of negative information out there but that's a pretty good
list to start with make sure that you eliminate those
or at least watch your your exposure to them because
well quite frankly a lot of those sources are very
very negative and very limiting and you don't want to
be limited by those beliefs personally myself I don't want
to be I don't want to be letting any sorts
of information or beliefs or facts into my into my
consciousness into my awareness that's gonna be limiting my potential
so for me I'm looking for high quality sources of
information and what are those well high quality source information
in the abstract is gonna include things that are true
accurate holistic complex ideas these are going to be scientific
psychological or artistic in nature the advice and the information
is going to be actionable something that's not idle philosophy
it's gonna be thought-provoking it's going to be high consciousness
it's going to be positive it's gonna be empowering it's
gonna be uplifting and it's gonna have some vision to
it it's gonna be motivating it's gonna be inspiring these
are the kind of sources of information that I want
so that's in the abstract what you're looking for but
you know where do you go and find this stuff
so specifically high quality books seminars workshops a bunch of
different information products right now we're kind of in the
information product era where there's literally an information product out
there on almost any part of life that you want
to master whether it's relationships or learning how to be
better at Photoshop learning a language learning how to start
a business anything you want and even within each of
those categories there's information products that are very very specific
to specific types of issues and problems that you're facing
and of course it could also be artistic things right
going to a museum and seeing great art or going
on on a trip to the Grand Canyon and seeing
something beautiful and inspirational there so it doesn't just have
to be straight self-help advice type of stuff it can
also be that artistic stuff but make sure that it's
higher quality right just consider the difference between going to
a museum for for your Saturday off go into a
museum and seeing some nice art or going to the
zoo and seeing some some beautiful nature some animals they're
seeing that versus spending that time browsing random blogs on
the internet or looking at your Facebook feed or watching
TV all day or watching the news getting stuck in
one of those marathon news watching sessions I've been there
so just consider the difference and consider what happens to
you psychologically when you're always immersed in the negative versus
this empowering stuff that I'm talking about when you're immersed
in the negative then you go into a low consciousness
state right your mind shuts off you become comfortable you
also get reinforced with all these ideas about all the
problems that are out there in the world and you
start to feel bad about prospects you start to feel
bad about your prospects you start to feel about about
society's prospects the world's progress prospects whereas when you're reading
or immersing yourself in this empowering positive type of information
then all of a sudden you're you're optimistic you have
a vision for what you could be you have a
new vision for what society could be you have a
new vision for what the future of humanity can be
and that's really awesome and it also makes you think
right a lot of the stuff if you're reading the
right type of information that it's going to be thought-provoking
it's going to be inspirational it's gonna teach you more
about yourself teach you more about the world and of
course we want it to be accurate and objective we
don't want disinformation so that's basically the rundown of good
versus bad types of information personally for me how this
has worked is that I've really over the last I'd
say four years since I really learned about this idea
I took it to heart and this was one of
the first self-development principles that I really started to implement
very consciously because I thought that he made a lot
of sense and I was very very I'm an analytical
type of guy and I like to read a lot
of stuff and it made sense to me that I
should really start to make a shift because I was
already reading some things that were good but I still
had a lot of sources of negative information like I
was watching tons of cable TV I was watching a
lot of news I was watching a lot of political
shows and those can just be so negative and so
low consciousness that they're the exact opposite of what I
wanted for myself and I knew that if I wanted
to be this living this awesome kind of life where
I was living a high consciousness kind of life then
I needed to shift that balance and I should replace
all those negative sources with positive sources so really it's
just a process of replacement and this is not too
hard to do cut out TV replace TV with reading
books replace TV with watching if you like to watch
stuff start watching shows that at least are making you
think that at least have some artistic merit to them
you know watch the Discovery Channel if you're gonna watch
TV watch something like the Discovery Channel or the History
Channel instead of reality TV or cable news right at
least start with that shift and then once you make
that shift maybe you can progress from Discovery Channel to
something even more like I like to progress and I
progress to watching the teaching company lectures which is an
awesome resource of college lectures that you can basically watch
on DVD on all sorts of topics science history psychology
math whatever you're interested in you could find amazing topics
on it and then you can watch those instead of
TV so a really good way to do that news
some people might dispute me here on news and say
that well isn't news given making you more worldly is
it isn't it making you more aware of what's happening
out there in the world and kind of educating you
and you could say that in some sense it's nice
to listen to the news now and again to be
aware of what's happening in the world you know if
there's a new war going on you probably want to
know about it if somebody gets elected or unelected you
want to know about that some catastrophe happens maybe learning
about that but I would actually say that you're better
erring on the side of caution not watching any news
at all I haven't watched news in about three or
four years at all like nothing I don't care about
it at all what you start to notice is that
it's really not a problem if something big does come
up your friends will come and tell you about it
you'll hear about it through the grapevine but what I've
also noticed is that it's really nice to take your
mind off of it because even when there are calamities
and important things happening in the world the fact is
that you want to be able to focus on things
that you're creating think of yourself as a creator in
your life your creative force and all the attention that
you're using thinking about something that you have no effect
on then that's you wasting your resources those resources could
be put better to whatever it is that you're specifically
doing in your life right if there's a war in
Iraq or if somebody gets elected to office or there's
some scandal my involvement in that is quite limited so
I think that unless you have a direct tie a
causal there's a causal chain between what you're doing and
the event that's being broadcast then you really have no
business immersing yourself in it even knowing about it if
it's that important you'll hear about it through the grapevine
but for example some war in Iraq unless I'm in
the military to me that's not my business my business
is to focus on what I'm doing and that's a
really powerful shift to make so go ahead and really
think about whether the news that you're watching is really
doing you that much good and if you're still skeptical
about outdoors you to do a 30-day challenge where you
totally cut yourself off from the news and then actually
see don't make this a philosophical argument see it do
it try it and see if it actually gets you
better results I can guarantee you that it will because
you're gonna focus that energy towards something much more productive
it's gonna get you more to the high consciousness level
that you want to be at all right so that's
kind of what I did is I I weeded myself
off of cable news I we did it myself off
of paper news any sorts of news cable television totally
I don't own cable anymore if you told me that
five years ago I would say that you're nuts that
I did this but I made that shift I've made
that transition because it was important to me and now
I slowly immerse myself more into books in two lectures
on and DVDs and documentaries and selectively watching movies not
through cable because the problem of cable is that you
can always get hooked on it but I do it
very selectively I'll pick the movies that I want to
watch but generally I do a lot less of that
and now I'm doing more reading and getting high-quality information
there so that's basically it the prescription here is really
to be very mindful of the kind of information that
you're getting right and we talked about media but also
it bears repeating that you can also get negative information
from the people around you depending on how social you
are I'm not that social person so for me that's
not a big issue but if you are very social
be mindful of that be mindful of the kind of
people you're hanging around with at work be mindful the
kind of people that you're hanging around with in your
social circle when you're going out at night or whatever
it is you're doing your your friends and you know
what if you've got very pessimistic friends that are limiting
you or you've got family members that are really limiting
you in the kind of information that are feeding you
then you might want to consider cutting them off or
having a heart-to-heart with them or at least spending less
time with them or doing something to make sure that
that information is not seeping into your consciousness and dragging
you down because that can be a very negative source
as well all right what you're going to find if
you do this is you're gonna find that it becomes
easier to actually do personal development it becomes easier to
stay up stay up on your goals it becomes easier
to live a high consciousness life because if you're always
dragged down for example right now if I had cable
TV in the house if I was always looking at
newspapers if I had a circle of negative friends and
I had an addiction to Facebook and Twitter and internet
browsing if I was doing all that stuff you'd be
very hard for me to live a charged kind of
life I could not be creating the business that I'm
creating I could not be out there studying the kind
of stuff that I'm studying and I could not be
having the kind of influence I want to have and
for me when I imagine the kind of ideal life
that I'm living ten years from now none of those
things that I just mentioned are in it I just
don't have time for it they're not valuable enough and
they're ruining my state of consciousness instead I see myself
reading amazing books and talking with amazing people joining mastermind
groups of people that are really smart people that are
really positive and people that are out there and achieving
something with their life rather than looking at a cable
news political show about people just point fingers at each
other and blaming each other and saying how terrible the
world is and how everything is going hell right so
think about where you want to be and think about
the goals that you have ultimately and what your highest
vision is for yourself and do you see yourself really
having room in that kind of life and that kind
of vision is there room for cable TV is there
room for news is a room for Twitter is there
room for for pessimistic friends probably not all right so
I'm gonna leave you here go ahead and do a
little bit of analysis reflect on your life and then
commit to making some changes commit to doing something to
shifting that balance so you've got more of the positive
and less of the negative right because we don't want
you to be reactive we don't want you to be
reacting to the world we want you to be influencing
the world yourself all right so I'm signing off go
ahead and post your comments I want to hear about
how this topic and this concept has played a part
in your life and what kind of changes you're going
to make also if you like it go ahead and
share this like it make sure that it spreads around
