hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to address the question of what's wrong
with ego why is ego such a bad thing if
you've been following along with actualize our content you see
certain themes these overarching narratives developing and patterns that you're
seeing within personal development these larger patterns and one of
these patterns that should be becoming quite obvious to you
is the role that ego plays in your life and
in personal development but I want to expand on this
notion because it's a very very important thing and it
really cannot be overstated sometimes people wonder like well Leo
you rag on the ego a lot you talk about
the ego as though it's a very bad and evil
thing and what's wrong with ego I mean what's wrong
with being selfish so what if I'm biased towards myself
so what if I'm trying to improve my self-image so
what if I'm trying to build myself up and so
what if I'm just pursuing success blindly isn't that what's
going to make me the happiest so what if I'm
building up my identity so what if I have all
these belief systems and structures in place so what I
mean look my life is going well and people around
me are doing the same stuff and it seems to
be getting better and better and isn't that what personal
development is about is about building up the Eco so
let's really investigate this issue uh what I'm going to
claim is that the ego is the cause of the
majority of the unhappiness you have in your life and
that what's wrong with it is it's very simple it's
the exact same mechanism of wrongness as when you decide
to spit into the wind so what's wrong with spitting
into the wind quite obvious the mechanism clearly backfires on
you and if you spit into the wind it comes
back into your face and this happens rather quickly and
immediately so you'd have to be a total fool not
to see what's wrong with spitting into the wind but
with ego it's a little bit trickier than that because
the ego likes to operate through self-deception and subtlety and
sneakiness and counterintuitive nasubi cuz the consequences of ego are
subtle and they're spread out over time so imagine if
you will that you decide to spit into the wind
one day and you do but the wind rather than
hitting you right back in the face with your spin
it takes your spit all the way across the world
it rides on the wind your spit rides on the
wind for a whole month it circles around to South
America to Africa Antarctica to the North Pole and Europe
and all these places and then finally it comes back
and hits you in the face and that takes a
month for that whole cycle to complete but see by
the time it does hit you in the face you
don't say oh yeah I spit into the wind a
month ago and now it's hit me in my face
you don't do that what you do is you say
oh someone spit in my face who spit in my
face who is that [ __ ] that's what you
do that's what the ego does and therein lies the
whole problem that's why we have to really go in
there and inspect what's going on we can look at
these long-range consequences now before I get any further I
need to clarify what I mean by ego so what
is this term that we're talking about it's nothing other
than what you believe you are right now it's not
some aspect of you some evil nefarious aspect of you
it's not arrogance this goes way beyond just arrogance and
the common day usage of the word ego which basically
says you know if we say that someone is egotistical
we say that they're selfish what I'm talking about is
a much more expanded understanding of selfishness which actually includes
your very existence as a human being just by the
very fact that you are sitting there right now and
your entire life is revolving around you and your existence
that is ego so this thing right now that I'm
talking to I'm talking to a thing aren't I we
hold you as some sort of thing a human being
a creature and animal whatever you feel like you are
that soul that you think inhabits your mind maybe maybe
that's how you think of yourself or maybe you just
think of yourself as just a body and a mind
and a brain that right there that is ego it's
the entire identification that you've constructed from the very basic
identification of just identifying with your mind and body and
brain and maybe soul if you identify with that and
your very basic needs for food water and shelter so
that you can keep surviving in this existence so that's
the very basic foundation but then all the add-ons that
you like to add on to that so it's how
you look at yourself it's your self-image it's how cool
you think you are it's all the problems you think
you have in your life it's all the positive characteristics
that you ascribe to yourself it's all the beliefs that
you hold it's the personal story you have of how
you grew up and where you went to school and
who your parents were and how you're connected to all
that that's your entire identity now most people think that
this is just taken for granted as like oh well
this is how life is this is what is physically
true but that's not what's physically true that is ideas
in your mind and various images that have been wedded
together in a rather arbitrary way but to you because
it is you it seems unquestionable and what I'm claiming
is that that that entire identity structure is the problem
and that's what I refer to as the ego so
let's start going deeper and deeper and actually getting into
the specifics of how the ego backfires in your life
and how it creates much of the suffering in your
life because until you start to become aware of this
then what I'm just talking about is way too abstract
and it doesn't seem practical so to make this practical
we can take a look at what's wrong with ego
from another perspective one way to answer that question is
to say well basically what's wrong with ego is every
single problem you have in your life and everything you
hate about life and I want to show you how
that is but to do that first we need to
actually get clear about what you hate about life so
what I'd like you to do in a second is
you're going to pause this recording and you can do
very quick assignment form you're going to plaid piece paper
in a pen you're going to pause this and you're
going to make a list a quick list just spend
a few minutes on this make a very quick list
of the top 20 things let's say that you don't
like about life whatever that might be might be you
know I hate my parents and my spouse is mid
nagging me and my my kids are doing something wrong
and my boss is doing something wrong and I don't
have enough money all this kind of stuff so whatever
that is for you so go ahead and pause this
recording and do that assignment okay welcome back so you
have your little list now your list might look something
like this this is a sample list it's not my
private list this is just a sample example that I
came up with so it might look something like I
hate having money problems I hate my job my spouse
annoys me my kids are getting bad grades in school
I can't sleep well I feel depressed sometimes even sometimes
I have suicidal thoughts I feel stressed and tired I
don't have time to myself my boss is an idiot
my parents are creating problems for me because they're so
stubborn and dogmatic government is corrupt I'm scared of getting
cancer losing weight is very difficult for me and I
don't like how I look and in general my life
is difficult and it's a struggle it feels like an
uphill battle all the time so that's the list that
I came up with just as an example your list
probably looks something similar to this now here's the shocker
and here's something where you have to really open your
mind and try to consider this from my perspective what
if all of this stuff on this list your list
is the result of ego and is not an inherent
facet of life let that sink in for a second
because most people what they say is they just have
kind of a sort of knee-jerk reaction they just say
oh no only oh that that can't be the case
that can't be the case this list of stuff that
I hate about life it's this way because this is
how life is and there's not much that we can
do about it this is just how life is we
have to accept life exactly as it is but consider
that that's not the case in fact consider that that's
a defense mechanism of the ego if you say that
and that in fact life is not inherently that way
it only appears that way because you've been living your
life with a very strong ego and so this list
of things is actually a list of the things that
the ego creates for itself this is a list of
every backfiring consequence of the ego this might seem a
little far-fetched because you might say well leo how is
you know government being corrupt a consequence of my ego
isn't that what you're saying and how is it that
you know my stubborn parents who don't want to do
the right things how they are are you saying there
are consequence of my ego or how is it that
the stress and tiredness that I have because I work
two jobs full-time how is that a response and a
consequence of my ego or the money problems I have
that's not related to my ego is it is that
what you're saying and yes that is what I'm saying
but you have to remember what I said earlier is
that the ego has subtle subtle subtle and sneaky long-range
consequences it's not simply a matter of a causes B
B causes C and that's the end of the line
if you think of the consequences of ego as just
following this very simple two or three step chain of
consequences or this chain of cause and effect then it's
not going to seem plausible to you what I'm saying
instead you have to think of it more of like
a causes B B causes C C causes D D
causes e FG all the way down the line to
Z and so there's a pretty long chain there and
what that requires is you actually honestly examining this chain
to see what's really going on so I want to
help you to do that and what I want to
do is I want to give you a list of
all the typical consequences of ego that happened in the
average person's life your life of course and then it'll
be your job to investigate further how exactly your ego
is responsible for these consequences specifically in your life because
I don't have time to go into each one of
these I actually sat down and originally I just wanted
to create a list of all the bad stuff that
results from ego and the list ended up being huge
it's a huge list because the ego is responsible for
so many negative things basically in a nutshell all your
suffering in life as a very simple rule of thumb
you can just say where am i suffering in my
life okay I'm suffering here okay how did I do
that how did my ego do that okay and then
you go and investigate and you will eventually discover how
the ego is doing that but see for most people
that's so far-fetched that they can't even believe that it's
possible that they themselves are creating their own problems so
let's give you a little taste of this list firstly
fear and anxiety this is pretty much all created by
Iko every single fear and anxiety that you've ever had
in your life think about the significance of that that's
all related to your identity also think about all the
anger bitterness hatred violence and intolerance that you've encountered in
your life especially the stuff that you've generated so who
are you angry at who are you bitter at who
do you hate who have you even done violence to
and where are you intolerant in your life all of
that pretty much almost all of it is grounded in
your identity and in your ego and think about how
much suffering that creates for you also outrage and unfairness
do you feel outraged sometimes do you feel like life
is unfair that people treat you unfairly well that's pretty
much a consequence of ego your ego guilt and regret
do you have deep regrets in your life do you
feel guilty about doing stuff that you shouldn't have done
or not doing stuff well that's mostly all ego related
how about annoyances do you face annoyances in your life
the neighbors annoy you the dog annoys you the kids
annoy you your spouse annoys you believe it or not
that's very much tied with your ego criticism and blame
pretty much all instances where you are critical of other
people you are negative about other people or situations and
you blame others that's all connected to your ego that
stuff does not exist without ego emotional pain is largely
ego created depression is very largely ego created dissatisfaction disappointment
with life do people disappoint you does your government disappoint
you does your boss disappoint you are you just not
able to find the fulfillment and contentment in life that
you wanted to find that's because of ego almost no
other reason shyness and insecurity do you have that problem
do you have confidence problems do you feel inauthentic do
you feel like you sell yourself out that you break
your own word and break your own values and act
out of integrity what do you think that is that's
all a function of your identity that's not inherent to
life how about not liking yourself do you not like
yourself do you not like your personality or maybe you
don't like your physical appearance a lot of people think
that not liking their physical appearance that this has something
to do with like well I'm not as beautiful or
handsome as I thought I should be has nothing to
do that it's all connected to your identity into your
ego think about how much suffering you've created in your
life because you did not accept who you were psychologically
as a personality as a character and who you are
physically as this body sitting there right now how about
boredom loneliness and neediness you have these problems think about
all the times you were born lonely or needy in
your tire life what if I told you that all
of that was a consequence of ego and it didn't
have to be that way that would be pretty significant
wouldn't it how about stress and chronic fatigue do you
suffer from those those are all ego created there's no
reason that life should be inherently stressful and there's no
reason you should always be fatigued addictions do you have
addictions any addiction okay what it is drugs porn sex
food TV alcohol coffee anything this is all connected to
your identity into your ego sexual misconduct do you have
that problem cheating do you have that problem that's all
ego created how about lying dishonesty and the spreading of
untruth every single lie you've ever made in your entire
life and every instance where you were dishonest was pretty
much related to your ego exploitative and manipulative behaviors think
about how many of those you engage in how much
suffering they end up causing you in the long run
that's all connect it to ego there's no need to
manipulate or exploit anybody without ego how about relationship problems
pretty much every single relationship problem ties back to ego
if people are leaving you if people are being needy
with you if you're having quarrels and arguments there's a
lot of drama in your relationships you don't know how
to communicate in relationships there's various fears inside your relationships
there's jealousy problems sexual problems all this stuff where do
you think this is all grounded in right your ego
how about self sabotaging behaviors do you have that problem
that is purely ego how about money problems you have
money problems those are largely ego created do you have
motivation problems those are pretty much all ego created do
you have decisiveness problems are you indecisive are you afraid
to make a choice do you make choices based on
fear what is that but ego do you have gender
identity confusion like you're not sure how much of a
man you are or how much of a woman you
are or whether you even are a man or a
woman and you feel insecure about that well what is
that that's pure ego are you working the wrong job
or career and you're staying stuck year after year after
year in the wrong job in the rear the wrong
career even though you should be moving on well that's
kind of - here you go - how about the
inability to realize your dreams if you have big dreams
in life and you find yourself unable to move towards
them over the long term that's connected to your ego
how about the inability to realize the highest spiritual experiences
possible life there are some amazing profound and deep spiritual
experience that are possible for you stuff that would bring
you to your knees and tears of joy and bliss
and most people have never experienced something like this or
if they have maybe it was some random one-time event
and it's not something that happens consistently for them and
the only reason that is is because of ego ego
is the obstacle to the deepest spiritual experiences nothing else
how about the inability to love others having commitment issues
being afraid to say I love you being unable to
be kind or compassionate towards other people in your life
basically not being able to be a benevolent force in
the world that's ego that's the result of ego all
those problems how about creative difficulties do you have difficulties
as an artist do you struggle with yourself as an
artist whether you paint draw make movies music whatever that's
all ego that's ego fighting with itself getting in its
own way how about feeling offended and self-righteous do you
get offended easily that's ego how about Dogma and ideology
have you been tricked and seduced by various cults or
ideological programs or schemes and then lost years of your
life to that that's ego obsessive thinking that's the function
of ego hurting loved ones have you accidentally inadvertently hurt
loved ones close to you like your children your spouse
your parents your siblings and so forth and then later
regretted it why did that happen if you take a
close look it was because of ego how about doing
damage to other people maybe business partners clients and so
forth that's done because of ego how about damage to
the environment if you've ever littered or polluted that's a
consequence of ego and lastly on my list is a
dying of sorry death you do realize that you if
you stay on the current track that you're on the
egotistical track that you will die a very sorry death
unless you're fortunate enough to die like an instantaneous fatal
car crash or airplane crash something like that then chances
are you're going to die kind of a slow death
we're gonna have time to contemplate and reflect on your
life and your actions and behaviors and what do you
think you're going to feel on your deathbed if you're
dying a slow death you're gonna you're going to realize
all the egotistical things you've done in your life and
how of your life you've wasted and how many people
you've heard and just how miserable your entire life has
gone and you're gonna perhaps maybe you won't but perhaps
you're going to realize how all of this was the
result of the ego and that's going to create a
lot of misery and suffering in your last moments of
life which is rather a shame so that's the list
by no means is that the end of the list
you could certainly come up with more examples of how
ego affects your life in negative ways that creates suffering
for you that you probably don't want to keep experiencing
over and over and over and over again so right
now I want you to take a look at your
list pull out your list of stuff that you said
that you hated about life and point your finger to
that entire list run your finger up and down that
list and just realize in your mind that all this
stuff on this list this is all related to your
identity into your ego it's not just a consequence of
life it's a consequence specifically of how you choose to
live your life and how attached you are to your
sense of self and your sense of identity and what
I'm claiming is possible is to let go of these
attachments and then this list will dissolve slowly over time
items on the list will just dissolve out of your
life and then you'll get happier and happier and happier
until you can dissolve the entire list if you go
that far but also let us not forget about the
collective consequences of ego so what I described so far
is mostly personal consequences so this is like the mechanism
of you spitting in the wind it coming straight back
into your face obviously stupid right obviously stupid to live
your life that way but let's also take a look
at what happens on a societal level when we all
live to uh indulge our egos so firstly and we're
kind of taking a historical perspective here so let's take
a look through history at how ego has played itself
out every single war in history can be traced back
to ego also genocide conquering and extermination of other nations
and peoples and slavery these can all be linked back
to ego working on a collective level same thing for
scams Ponzi schemes and thefts same thing for rape and
the abuse of children and women also financial exploitation capitalism
and communism so all the negative effects of the capitalist
system the communist system that you might have studied through
history or that you experienced for example with capitalism still
happening today and it's really still in full force today
such as monopolies and businesses exploiting their customers and so
forth how about caste systems and power hierarchies for example
like the Indian caste system extremely oppressive caste system and
these sorts of caste systems have in one way or
another existed for thousands of years all around the world
we're lucky in the 21st century especially in the West
here that we really don't have that anymore but think
of how oppressive that was for thousands of years how
about all corruption bribery and nepotism that goes on in
government what is that but ego how about religious intolerance
bigotry and homophobia where does that come from ego all
the religious conflicts that have ever occurred in history have
all been the result of ego because religion creates a
very strong identity for you and then you want to
go there and you want to fight and kill and
do whatever in the name of pervert of preserving that
identity structure which is by definition the ego how about
historically the suppression of reason science and authentic spirituality what
does that come from again that comes from ego egos
protecting themselves and therefore needing to suppress science reason and
authentic spirituality because these things are threatening to the ego
how about cults and intellectual exploitation that has occurred throughout
the years and the centuries that's related to ego cult
leaders what are they they are egotist strut amok and
the cults followers what are they they are weak egos
who need the protection of a leader how about witch
trials and scapegoating or like the McCarthy trials of the
1950s and 60s what is that that's all ego how
about dictatorships gangs and syndicates the Mafia and all this
kind of corrupt and abuses of power corruption abuse of
power where did all this come from ego how about
political gridlock the extreme partisanship that exists in government these
days where's that coming from ego how about the oppression
of human rights and civil liberties throughout pretty much all
history what has been the source and the motivation for
that it's been ego the ego needs to protect itself
and therefore in so doing it likes to oppress human
rights and civil liberties and lastly how about the destruction
of the environment the destruction of the rainforests the pollution
of the of the air pollution the rivers and the
oceans overfishing and all this kind of stuff where does
this come from it comes from the kind of greediness
that comes with ego and the sort of carelessness and
indifference that comes with ego and that's basically what or
else all our social problems are so all the problems
we have with government with wars this kind of stuff
it really isn't any different from what happens with the
destruction of the environment because in the end what we've
got is we've got a very interconnected ecosystem that we're
living in right it's this ecosystem of humans which also
includes animals it includes plants and basically the entire planet
as one ecosystem and as much as we like to
think that we're separate from that because that's fundamentally what
the ego thinks the ego thinks that I am here
and I am separate and I am more special and
more important than everything else out there and I will
kill everything else out there just to preserve what's here
now you might say well Leo you know that's just
survival what's wrong with survival but see there is something
very wrong with survival survival runs amok and then what
happens is that it backfires so it's the same problem
of what's wrong with destroying the environment well there's nothing
wrong with cutting down one tree but when everybody on
earth cuts down one tree after a while we run
out of trees see and then it becomes a problem
so that's what all these things historically and collectively have
been it's been individual egos that have been trying to
get a little bit more for themselves and then collectively
it produces a very bad environment and produces bad social
and political climates that you don't want to live in
in some extremes it's very very bad think about Nazi
Germany concentration camps think about all the horrors created by
the Spanish Inquisition and all this kind of stuff think
about slavery slinging racism think about various witch trials that
have been held throughout history and all the people who
have been shut up and silenced and killed and imprisoned
in the name of protecting some kind of collective identity
see the ego doesn't just happen as an identity for
individuals but then individuals come together to create collective identities
and those are even more dangerous than individual identities but
they basically function in the same way so here we
can see some very serious consequences for ego can't we
now you might think well Leo that's just how history
is that's not just how Humanity is is just how
it's supposed to be this is what life naturally looks
like and what I would suggest is that know let's
question that assumption what if that's not how it's supposed
to be what if it's that way only because we
are letting our egos run amok and the problem here
is that we're sort of [ __ ] where we
eat and if you go to the park and you
take a crap in the park one time that might
not be a problem and you might say well so
what yeah I took a crap in the park but
you know what Leo I don't use the park anyways
I don't care so what if some some old lady's
walking by and she sees that turd sitting in the
grass it doesn't matter to me okay but then you
know what like 10 20 years later you have a
child of your own and you take him to the
park and then what well if somebody else is behaving
along the same lines of reason that you were 10
20 years ago and everybody goes take a dump in
the park then that's not going to be reap lezin
for you see so basically what we're talking about here
is sort of Karma what goes around comes around and
I want you to start to notice how this Karma
is taking place personally for you in your own life
how you're [ __ ] where you eat in your
own life but then how you're also contributing to the
collective problem see and the important thing here is that
you don't just point fingers at others but that you
actually take responsibility for the fact that you are contributing
to this problem and that the solution is not to
get other people to stop but to stop yourself from
doing this and the only way that can happen is
by first recognizing oh yeah I am doing it I
am doing it I'm hurting myself I'm hurting others and
I'm hurting the environment and that this is a consequence
a direct consequence of the way that I hold my
identity that's where it begins if you're a student of
spiral dynamics and you've heard me talk about that model
elsewhere I won't cover it here because the very deep
model but I just want to point this out for
those advanced students is that with spiral dynamics you have
different stages you have stage red blue orange green and
so forth well one thing I talked about when I
talk about spiral dynamics and other episodes is how the
pendulum swings back and forth between stages so spiral dynamics
basically how the psyche evolves both individually and collectively that's
what this model explains so first like you got stage
red stage red is a very kind of criminal highly
narcissistic egotistical stage but then what happens is that as
that stage runs its course the psyche realizes it becomes
self-aware enough to realize that you know what being a
criminal has its problems it's not it's not as nice
as I thought it was and the problem is is
that I'm hurting my loved ones by being a criminal
and also I'm really shooting myself in the foot by
being a criminal so let me stop being a criminal
and they're the ego kind of sees its own ramifications
and it lets go and then the pendulum swings towards
blue which it should movement away from ego and it's
a movement towards collective consciousness but of course there's problems
with blue because it's a very hierarchical and dogmatic and
kind of religious and then the pendulum swings back again
to orange and orange is similar to red but it's
not as bad so it's again egotist it's kind of
success-oriented you know how do i acquire more success and
achievement in my life and you you go with that
for a while but then eventually you realize ah you
know if I just live my life in a way
that I'm only concerned about acquiring the most success for
myself personally and maybe for my family that's still not
good enough I'm still not satisfied because I can still
see the consequences there's still a lot of damage being
done to others around me and to the environment and
that damage comes back and hurts me and my loved
ones so that's not sustainable and then again there's a
shift and so it kind of goes back and forth
and back and forth and back and forth and the
reason that happens is because the ego progressively becomes more
and more self-aware of its own backfiring mechanism so I
want you to take note of that and to start
to notice this happening in your own life as much
as you can the sooner you can start to recognize
this and take responsibility for it the sooner you can
really grow yourself internally and start to escape some of
these problems denying the problem is only going to make
it worse seeing and accepting it and then starting to
work with me on it that's the solution and now
you might say well Leo so what do you want
me to do do you want me to kill myself
I mean it sounds like what you're saying here is
anti my survival and that's right it is anti your
survival but not in the extreme that you might think
so the ego likes to say well if you're threatening
my survival [ __ ] you leo I'm not going
to listen to you why should I because after all
you're threatening my survival and my family survival know what
I'm telling you is to become more responsible about the
way that you survive and to notice how your survival
is actually endangering you you see when someone becomes obsessed
about survival they can actually kill themselves and that's the
problem you don't need to kill yourself that's not the
solution here but what you do need to do is
you need to recognize that you are spitting into the
wind and that your spit comes back in your face
and also hits other people nearby you and also toxify
z-- your environment that's what we're after here now to
be very precise I want to make sure that you
don't confuse what I'm saying here and that you don't
take what I'm saying as something like the ego is
inherently absolutely bad and wrong and evil that's not what
I'm saying when I say the ego is bad I'm
simply saying that it's bad for you not that it's
absolutely bad not that there's anything inherently wrong with it
it's bad in the sense that it creates suffering for
you now if you don't like to suffer in your
life then you might want to consider stopping that but
if you're one of those people that does like to
suffer and believe it or not there are a lot
of people out there who do like to suffer to
wallow in their own suffering up by all means continue
to do that you're free to create suffering and there's
nothing inherently bad about suffering other than that it's not
pleasant to you and it's not pleasant to your loved
ones and it's not pleasant to see other people around
you suffer see so don't make that mistake don't demonize
the ego just notice how it backfires this isn't a
moral issue this is more of a like a physics
issue in that the mechanism is very physical in the
way that it operates just like spitting into the wind
this evolutionary phase that were going through as a human
species where we are creating collective suffering and damage to
the environment and we are acting in egotistical ways in
some ways it's a necessary step humanity has to go
through this step but it doesn't have to stay there
forever so if there was a point in your life
where you need to really look out for your survival
and so forth I get that that's fine but don't
stay there longer than necessary move through that step and
then move on to the next step because what I
talk about in all my content is not how to
survive I'm concerned more about how to thrive how to
achieve your full potential as a human being in other
words we're talking about fulfillment true fulfillment and happiness and
one thing you start to realize when you start to
study all the psychological stuff that I have studied is
you realize there's a very simple formula of work here's
the formula is that happiness equals the reciprocal of ego
reciprocal if you remember math class it's like the fraction
so 1 over X 1 over some variable so here's
a formula for happiness in your life happiness equals 1
over ego and if you remember math class then you
remember that when you have a reciprocal equation like this
that means that if you have a very high ego
and it's 1 over the variable that means your happiness
is very low the higher the ego the lower the
happiness that's what reciprocal relationships are and conversely if you
have a very low ego as ego approaches 0 happiness
approaches infinity that's what happens in a reciprocal relationship so
that's basically what's at play in your life now the
question is how long will it take you how many
decades of your life will it take you to realize
that this is the function that is governing your life
maybe you'll get it today as I'm speaking right now
but chances are that you're only going to scratch the
surface because you actually need to see see it happening
it's not enough to just believe me on this because
you won't be very convinced it'll be just some intellectual
philosophical notion you got to see it happening and when
you do see that you sort of unlock the entire
secret to all personal development in a nutshell all personal
development boils down to is becoming more aware of the
ego becoming so aware of it that eventually it dissolves
into zero and as you do that over the years
dissolving this ego deconstructing it lower and lower and lower
and lower and lower and lower let's say you start
at a ego the size of a million then you
reduce it down to one hundred thousand then you do
sit and reduce it down to ten thousand to one
thousand to a hundred to ten to one and then
up you know approaching zero the closer you get there
your happiness just exponentially increases more and more and more
and more and more and it's actually this is mind-blowing
it's actually possible to experience moments you're probably never going
to reach a stage where you have zero ego for
the rest of your life but it's possible to have
moments in your life where you have zero ego and
those moments are the best times in your entire life
these are the peak experiences because literally when your ego
is at zero happiness is infinite and you can actually
experience moments of infinite happiness they're profound moments but it
really requires zero ego and for most people the idea
of zero ego is repugnant because of course as the
ego when we say ego we're really talking about you
so zero you the way you interpret zero me is
oh [ __ ] no me no happiness no I
don't want that but you got to realize that that's
the ego talking that's not the real you talking the
real you actually can see which it's wisdom and it's
intuition it can see like yeah this ego it's getting
in my own way I am getting in my own
way let me take some steps to reduce that and
see how it affects my happiness levels and sure enough
you go and you try that you realize like oh
yeah every time I actually reduce my ego my happiness
increases oh that's a pretty amazing discovery what if we
extrapolate that what would happen if I had zero ego
could it be that I'd have infinite happiness is that
possible could it be that good and actually it is
that good but that doesn't mean it's easy to get
there because of course the ego will not go willingly
it will struggle and resist all the way so to
actually start to take action on all this theory that
I told you your assignment for the next week or
maybe make it even your assignment for the next month
however long you want to work on this is to
notice on a very minute-to-minute daily level when you're suffering
and then to connect that to the ego ask yourself
how is my identity producing this suffering that I'm experiencing
right now in my life that's a very powerful question
extremely powerful it's not easy to ask that question when
you're in the midst of suffering because when you're suffering
all you care about is removing the suffering you don't
care about looking at the suffering very carefully and tracking
it to its root causes you just want a quick
solution the problem though is that if you just always
look for the quick solution you never get to the
root and so the suffering keeps repeating so anywhere in
your life where you do have repeat suffering like let's
say you keep going to work and every morning you're
at work is like oh I don't want to start
work I don't want to start work I don't want
to start work and it's just that way like every
morning for months for years maybe and you're sick of
that well ask yourself how is my identity creating this
suffering and be willing to look past just one or
two steps of causation it might be more like five
or ten steps of causation for how this actually works
so that's your job is to figure that stuff out
and the more you can do that and keep track
of that and become aware of that then the more
really true deep inner work you're doing and if you're
not doing this then really you're just changing stuff on
the surface and therefore you're going to you're going to
have all this suffering repeating in your life over and
over and over again and eventually my build up to
the point where you become depressed or it creates all
sorts of serious dysfunctions in your life so there's a
lot of reasons here to take what I'm saying to
heart and to really begin the tough process of introspecting
and connecting your suffering to your ego that's the solution

post your comments down below share this EPS with a
friend and lastly come check out actualize that order right
here this is my newsletter there's other stuff there there's
a life purpose course I have a book list I
have a forum go check out the forum the forum
can be a great resource you know some people on
the forum they just sit there just [ __ ]
away but also like I found I've been surprised to
find like amazing resources people give book suggestions video suggestions
other stuff like that and you know I've learned from
the forum as much as the people that are there
so that can be quite useful for you on this
journey but anyways you know stick around check out the
newsletter stay on track meet with me on this process
in the future a lot of the material that I
talk about is going to be advanced material about how
to reduce and dissolve the ego different techniques and different
methods for becoming aware of the very sneaky ways in
which the ego works see because it's not obvious how
the ego does these things if it was obvious then
you probably would stop doing it so the ego does
it in very subtle ways and that requires explanations concepts
that's where these videos can be very useful to you
so I hope you stay stay with me for this
journey and I'll see you soon with more you
