[Music] the nine stages of ego development part two so
we're continuing on here with our three-part series on cognitive
development and yes there's going to be a part three
because i looked over all the content that i want
to cover in the later stages and there's just so
much more to say so much more value to extract
from the later stages because after all that's what we're
focused on so it's going to be worth your time
to stick around for part three as well in fact
the most exciting part of our work the most important
part of our work will be in part three but
in part two you're also going to get a lot
of value here so don't think that this is some
sort of uh weak sauce episode this is powerful stuff
this episode alone can change your whole understanding of mankind
and your own development in relationship to it so i'm
really excited here to get into this material for which
i should credit once again suzanne cook greuter because she's
done some amazing brilliant work articulating these different stages her
articulation her wording uh is is just superb go download
her free research paper it's 90 pages long i recommend
you print it out read it highlight it study it
in addition to listening me talk about it you see
this material that we're covering here is so deep and
so profound and so potentially life transforming that it's not
that you just watch one of these episodes or even
the whole series and then you say okay yeah i
got it leo and then you just go about your
everyday life it's like no you study this over and
over and over again you're gonna have to watch these
episodes three five times in order to fully get all
the juice that's here and you have to watch them
again throughout the rest of your life as well because
there's just so much stuff here so anyways let's get
into it a very quick recap of the stages we've
already covered we've covered the symbiotic the impulsive the opportunist
the conformist the expert and the achiever all in part
one we've covered that that's most of the people on
this planet the vast majority probably 80 plus percent and
then now we're going to be talking about the post-conventional
stages and i'll explain what post-conventional means here in a
few minutes so hang in there if you don't quite
know what that jargon means but the post-conventional stages are
roughly 15 to 20 percent of the us adult global
popula i mean yeah of the us adult population but
globally it's going to be a lot less than that
so if if you're looking at third world countries underdeveloped
countries it's going to be way lower than 20 percent
so here in the post-conventional category we have the pluralist
stage which is roughly 11 we'll be discussing today and
then we also have the autonomous slash strategist stage which
comes after that at roughly five percent of the u.s
adult population and we'll be discussing both of those today
and then next time in part three we'll be concluding
with the construct aware and the unitive stage which are
very rare and but also the most important really to
our work here so a few general points about this
model remember it's a scientific model or at least it
claims to be so what that means is that every
scientific model has its limits sometimes i see people taking
models like spiral dynamics or this ego development model trying
to apply it to animals or characters within movies like
you have to understand that that's not what these things
that's not what these models are are designed to handle
you can try to stretch it but also beware of
trying to go stretching it too far and then it
goes into some ridiculous absurd category where you're trying to
you know fit something into into some place where it
doesn't really belong to fit another general point is that
remember that each stage here has the capabilities of the
earlier stages underneath it sometimes people get the idea that
you completely outgrow a stage and you leave it behind
and you never tap into its capabilities ever again like
i used to be in a conformist and then i
became an achiever or i was an achiever and then
i outgrew that and i stopped achieving no that's not
how it works it works more like grades in school
each grade builds on top of the next grade you
know fifth grade incorporates the information you learn in first
grade and second grade and third grade you're still able
to read you're stable to able to do math you're
still able to reason you still understand history it's just
you understand it in a more nuanced more sophisticated more
advanced form and oftentimes when you understand it in a
crude form you make mistakes you fall into various traps
you swing your pendulum too much into one direction or
some other extreme and you get into unhealthy territory but
usually as you explore a stage fully embody it learn
it experience it master it over a period of five
or ten years you become familiar with it and then
you exhaust it and once you exhaust it then you
begin to move into the next higher stage but just
because you sort of exhausted it doesn't mean that you
don't ever tap into those capabilities you still do like
even advanced stages can still conform in a group environment
in fact it would be dysfunctional if you didn't know
how to conform but there are healthy and unhealthy ways
of conforming and so also it's important to note that
none of these stages are good or bad you have
to be very careful about falling into this trap of
thinking that well a lower stage is evil or it's
it's toxic or it's bad no most of these stages
are necessary they're a necessary part of human development just
like being a child or being a teenager isn't inherently
good or bad it's in fact it's it's necessary you
can't blame a child for going through puberty it's necessary
if you wanted to become a healthy adult but there
are more and less healthy ways of going about it
so really our our job here is to point out
the traps and many of the unhealthy ways and to
try to encourage healthy development at every stage and every
stage has its usefulness and its purpose remember again depending
on how you're fitting in with your environment so it's
all about the fit between the organism and its environment
in many parts of the world the environment is such
that very advanced stages even if they could exist like
you could maybe fly someone from an advanced country into
a primitive country he couldn't really thrive or survive in
that primitive country because his mindset is too advanced for
that kind of environment right you can take a yogi
and throw him into a war zone and he's he's
not going to fare too well another general point is
that what's what's so amazing about these different stages remember
like you're you're sort of each stage is its own
reality but the higher stages are a higher reality that
incorporates the lower reality so the higher stage can understand
the lower stages because it went through them and it
has more experience of them and because it's able to
take a higher perspective remember moving up stages basically gives
you more perspective so with a higher perspective you can
see the lower perspectives sometimes it's challenging like it's it
can actually be challenging for a high level person to
see and fully understand uh what it's like to be
a low level person but generally they can do it
but what tends not to work is that the lower
stages cannot fathom the higher stages and in fact usually
there are there's a whole host of defense mechanisms that
the lower stages use in order to deny that the
higher stages even exist because of course even to admit
that there are stages and that you're at the lower
end of the spectrum rather than the higher end of
the spectrum for many uh low-level people this itself in
itself is already a problem because it's extremely threatening to
their ego because it says well hey you mean i'm
not the best i'm not as good as i thought
i was yeah that's basically what i'm telling you that's
bad news the good news of course you can become
a lot better but the bad news is that to
become a lot better you have to first admit that
you're not as good as you think you are and
again remember lower stage people will have this kind of
defense mechanism and say oh leo so you're saying i'm
bad no i'm not saying you're bad i'm just saying
that the development of your mind is not as advanced
not nearly as advanced as it could be as some
of the highest most developed humans that have ever lived
so this is just a radical amazing possibility that's being
presented to you with this model at the higher stages
see you have to be humble enough to admit when
there's something above your understanding that can be very difficult
so even though you might hear the higher stages one
of two things will happen usually you're going to deny
that these are even possible or that they're real or
that they're beneficial anyway oftentimes you'll just dismiss it as
woo-woo or as nonsense or as just fluffy airy and
practical stuff or it's just philosophy or whatever those are
common defense mechanisms another common defense mechanism is that you
will [Music] it'll just the information will just go in
one out one ear and out the other ear and
it like won't even register in your mind because to
really understand the higher stages you have to develop through
the lower stages first it's sort of like a first
grader is not going to understand 12th grade mathematics it
just it won't compute you have to have a certain
foundation established to be able to enter a 12th grade
you know calculus class or something and to understand what's
being talked about to a first grader a calculus class
might seem like gobbledygook and like woo nonsense you know
what are all those scribbles on the chalkboard it means
nothing you guys are insane doing all this scribbling yeah
that's that's what it looks like to a person who
has no foundation in mathematics so it can just be
aware that it can seem that way analogously it can
seem that way about the higher stages that we're going
to be talking about they can seem kind of outlandish
and they could not make sense that just means you
haven't gotten to them yet try to keep your mind
open uh also a common misconception is that people tend
to think that well if it's a higher stage that
means it's perfect and a person at a higher stage
needs to be like a saint not necessarily there are
dysfunctions even at the higher stages not you're not immune
from dysfunction or pathology or self-deception at any stage although
it does tend to improve as you go higher so
there's there's some correlation but it's not a perfect correlation
so this sort of simplistic idea of like oh well
that person did something that i think is morally wrong
therefore he can't be as high as some stage x
no it just means that maybe he is at stage
x maybe he is very advanced but sometimes he makes
mistakes sometimes he fools himself sometimes he has a false
belief here or there sometimes he does something immoral according
to your standards see again it's your standards that we're
talking about here uh also keep in mind that you
do tend to regress stages when you are threatened or
stressed so that's important to understand uh also understand that
awakenings and mystical experiences are possible at any stage so
mysticism is not just exclusive to the highest stages it
can happen at any stage but what's important to understand
is that when it happens at the lower stages it's
going to get interpreted through that low level of cognitive
development the mind is going to be rather crude and
so like when a fundamentalist christian has a legitimate mystical
experience he can misinterpret it or just i guess there's
no misinterpreting here it's just he will interpret it in
a way which is going to be very sort of
christian very fundamentalist very medieval and very exclusive so it's
gonna be like yeah i experienced jesus jesus came to
me delivered a vision to me and that just demonstrates
to me that my religion is the only true one
and all of you other guys you buddhists and muslims
and and hindus you're all devils and of course there's
some truth to that there's still a legitimacy to that
mystical experience but the mind because it's so simplistic it's
interpreting in a sort of black and white moralistic way
that a conformist would so really what we want here
is we don't want just mystical experiences and awakenings we
want them of course but we want them at the
highest levels of cognitive development that's where things get really
really good and then there's less dysfunction so there's more
likelihood of dysfunction and devilry and unhealthy behaviors at the
lower stages of spirituality than the higher stages of spirituality
because remember spirituality occurs at all these different stages in
different ways all right so let's talk about the post-conventional
so what is post-conventional as that category as that label
what does that mean it's the beginning of deconstruction so
up to this point basically the ego was busy constructing
itself as the conformist and as the achiever and as
the expert uh there was all this construction going on
by the mind the mind was in a sense constructing
reality and wasn't aware of how it was constructing reality
and it was so busy constructing reality for its own
survival purposes trying to be an expert trying to earn
money trying to put on a show for people trying
to be a good boy or girl to conform to
your society in your family and so on uh so
you're so busy doing this that the mind it never
even occurs to the mind that a deconstruction process might
be beneficial to it so there's sort of like this
arc that happens in this nine stages of development you
start off the first half of the arc which we
already covered in part one all of those stages uh
that part of the arc is the ego developing itself
constructing itself and then you sort of reach the apex
of that construction process right at post-conventional the pluralist stage
as we're going to start talking about here in a
minute and at that pluralist stage that's when the mind
becomes open to the possibility of deconstruction what do we
mean by deconstruction well it means turning your focus inwards
into your own psyche and mind starting to analyze it
and starting to really question yourself starting to reflect about
your beliefs your ideas and starting to realize the socially
constructed nature of reality so a lot of the stuff
that were that previously the mind would consider as objective
as material as real as scientific as absolute like the
word of god or the holy bible you know the
holy bible is considered the absolute and you don't question
it now you start to question it now you start
to deconstruct it but not just the bible you also
start to deconstruct rationality logic science uh government politics maybe
the capitalist economic system under which you were raised or
if you were raised under a socialist one then you
maybe start to deconstruct that one you basically start to
deconstruct all aspects of your culture you start to question
it and you start to ask yourself well is this
really true for all people everywhere or is it just
something local and sort of rather arbitrary to my little
culture my little sub subgroup my family unit my my
corporation my religion or something like that so relativity is
a huge theme of the post-conventional stage relativity becomes acknowledged
whereas before it wasn't for the mind to be able
to think relativistically this is a huge leap in cognitive
advancement and there isn't just a sort of an on
off switch of like relativity or no relativity uh rather
there's many degrees of relativistic thinking and usually people are
capable of some degree of relativistic thinking but it's very
minor and so as you move through the post-conventional stages
it really ramps up you become much more relativistic in
your worldview and then it gets really radical at the
later stages the very last few stages that we'll be
talking about next time in part three so there's a
realization at the post-conventional level that the meaning of things
depends on one's relative position in regards to them on
one's personal perspective and interpretation of them there is deep
self-reflection that is beginning to happen awareness of one's own
unexamined beliefs becomes a uh almost painfully uh brought into
one's consciousness you have to wrestle basically with with old
beliefs that you've been programmed with in childhood and by
your religion by your culture by science and all this
in school in university now you start to examine these
beliefs more critically rather than just accepting them as a
given or taking them for granted the mind also opens
up at this level to uh something beyond rationality new
epistemic modes new ways of knowing the world than just
logic which was very popular in the expert and achiever
stages which were the conventional stages conventional is very logical
and then post-conventional is sort of post-rational which often gets
con confused with pre-rational sort of the pre-rational post-rational fallacy
conflating that distinction noticing of illusion and self-deception begins at
this stage all problems become a matter of perspective and
the mind so the problems aren't necessarily out there in
the world maybe it's more about how i think and
relate to the world there's an ever decreasing defensiveness and
less blaming of others as we move up these stages
and a lot of this defensiveness falls away in the
post-conventional stages language starts to be questioned and it becomes
complex so the previous stages basically took language for granted
whereas now language because it's it's sort of the the
medium through which the mind thinks and understands things that
medium itself becomes transparent to its it's starting to become
transparent to itself and it's starting to observe itself and
language is kind of doing the sort of self-reflective looking
in on itself and questioning itself and languaging about languaging
so it kind of becomes meta and the language becomes
meta materialist assumptions are starting to be questioned although not
completely but they're starting to be the full illusion of
materialism is not broken until even beyond the post-conventional uh
for that you really need to get to the transcendent
into the unitive which we'll be talking about in part
three although objects are seen as permanent their meaning is
seen as context dependent so remember we said that the
ego is a meaning creating machine and so in the
past the ego was creating meaning that that's what we
mean sort of by that first half of the ark
the construction of the mind it's constructing the world and
its meaning of the world and while denying that it's
doing so and then when the deconstruction process starts that
meaning you start to think about wait wait a minute
was that meaning baked into the objects and the situations
or am i projecting that meaning out into the world
because i have this ego that has certain needs and
has certain biases and therefore it's projecting those biases on
the world and that's skewing what is what it's seeing
out there and sure enough that's exactly the case of
course and you you discover ever deeper layers of that
the boundaries of concepts are seen to be much more
flexible in the post-conventional stage so what does this mean
well uh concepts were before you know like a concept
like science in the conventional stages science is just sort
of thought of as a static thing well yeah science
we know what science is we just take it for
granted that science is just this static thing it's done
a certain way people have been doing it you're either
doing science or you're not doing science it's either science
or pseudoscience or it's science or it's religion and then
there's no like blurring of that boundary but then at
the post conventional you realize wait a minute science what
is science what defines the boundaries of science maybe science
is not a a static thing maybe science evolves it
morphs it changes maybe the boundary between science and religion
is not nearly as sharp as we thought maybe there's
a lot of similarities between science and religion as an
epistemic mode how do we tell the difference between science
and pseudoscience see and so and now the the science
concept starts to sort of break down because the boundaries
become flexible now of course people at the conventional stages
they get freaked out by this they think this is
a problem because like oh leo well this means that
we're not being scientific anymore and we're going to devolve
into some sort of religious fundamentalism again no it actually
means that we're going beyond see science took us beyond
religious fundamentalism but now we're trying to discover something beyond
science and sure enough there is such a thing but
you have to open your mind to it and you
have to start to work with these different flexible boundaries
but a lot of people just aren't open to this
they perceive what i'm saying now as some sort of
uh you know trojan horse uh you know cult way
of uh of like skirting the rigors of science so
that i can sneak in my own cult new age
you know spiritual philosophy and then this is sort of
like my new religion that leo is trying to push
on people by talking about how science is flexible no
that that's to misunderstand and that's to be stuck at
the conventional stages so anyways another thing that happens at
the post conventional is that the mind can look and
compare whole systems of thought in organizations with increasing distance
so you're able to step outside of your whole thinking
system and to look at the world from different thinking
systems there's an increased interest in uncovering hidden assumptions about
oneself and one's society at the conventional stages there's just
you you feel this there's just a lack of interest
people like if you have conventional stage friends or co-workers
or family members you maybe bring some spiritual ideas to
them or you you talk about some epistemic notions that
start to question materialism or start to question capitalism or
start to question you know gender norms or whatever and
to them thinking about these these hidden assumptions of science
for example this is like they don't understand why this
would be valuable they think it's nonsense uh they have
all sorts of defense mechanisms and ultimately they just don't
care they don't care to question any hidden assumptions and
therefore their experience of life doesn't go very deep they
can't really understand life very deeply because most of life
is hidden with these with these assumptions that that you've
been taking for granted your whole life that you have
to start to self-reflect about it and to start to
deconstruct uh the post-conventional is now able to look back
at previous belief systems as systems seeing them as systems
so like christianity you can step back from and say
that's a belief system islam that's a belief system buddhism
that's a belief system there's different kinds of buddhism different
kinds of sub belief systems within buddhism see uh and
so therefore of course my own belief system whatever maybe
i was a buddhist or a christian that also is
a belief system you're sort of stepping outside of yourself
and you're able to sort of objectively evaluate yourself without
being stuck in that system that's the crucial capacity here
that the mind is bringing online with the post-conventional is
that ability to to step outside of one's paradigm or
one's worldview although there's a lot to that and it's
not so easy and it's not perfect here don't don't
think that even though i'm describing these things that some
post-conventional person is going to be perfect at doing all
of this no they're still going to make mistakes and
fall into delusions and traps and illusions so you know
this this breaking this whole quest of breaking out of
illusion this is a very deep quest and there's many
degrees of it so just because you've broken a few
out of a few illusions doesn't mean you've you know
you're you're completely 100 free of of illusions usually that's
not the case and there's now an appreciation of the
existential metaphysical psychological and epistemic issues and questions which at
the conventional and lower stages simply didn't register did not
compute people didn't care about them at those stages and
that's why when you talk about my material the stuff
that i talk about with most people with normies you
know normies are basically conventional minded people they they see
no value they don't appreciate any existential sort of self-development
work they don't appreciate any metaphysical questions they think it's
nonsense they think it's a waste of time they think
it's impractical they would rather be out there earning money
or having sex or buying a house or snorting drugs
or driving a fast car but if you do care
about these metaphysical existential psychological epistemic issues then that's a
good indicator that you're at the post-conventional or at least
moving into it all right so now let's talk about
the first post-conventional stage which is the pluralist about 11
of the us adult population so at this stage there's
a realization that things are not what they seemed to
be at earlier stages because the interpretation of reality always
depends on the position of the observer so this is
basically relativity by the way if you want to go
really deep on relativity check out my episode called understanding
relativism part one and i still need to release a
part two but we we go deep there relativity is
a hugely important perhaps one of the most important things
i talk about and also one of the most misunderstood
things that i talk about is relativity so the pluralist
realizes that there are multiple perspectives and exploring these perspectives
now becomes fascinating whereas in the previous stages one entrenched
oneself into one perspective like you just become a christian
and you want to be more and more of a
christian to hell with all other perspectives because they're evil
and wrong here now the pluralist realizes wait a minute
there's all these different perspectives all these different cultures to
explore all these different worldviews this is very fascinating i'm
not sure anymore which is true i can't be as
absolutist and certain as i was when i was a
conformist and so now i have to go and explore
and there's so much to explore so your mind opens
up to reading new books and experiencing new cultures trying
new things and looking at the world in different ways
and that process in of itself is is rewarding it
gives you sort of a thrill to do that your
mind feels like the the straight jacket has been taken
off there's a realization that observation influences what is observed
so objective judgment becomes impossible so this is actually very
much like they talk about the observation problems within quantum
mechanics and actually quantum mechanics is sort of a a
post-modern model and a postmodern way of looking at the
world and in fact in a sense we could say
post-modernism was really ushered in with einstein's general relativity and
then quantum mechanics which came shortly after it um and
the the two key philosophical and epistemic deep lessons of
of sort of the general relativity and quantum revolutions in
world view is that we moved away from the sort
of strict static newtonian world view where time and space
and matter were seen as just these fixed given external
material things and we could just take them for granted
is true now with general relativity and with quantum mechanics
you know einstein and niels bohr and others started to
question is there even such a thing as reality is
there such a thing as time is there such a
thing as space is there such a thing as matter
and energy and can we even does it even make
sense to say that we are observing an atom or
that we are measuring energy in some objective sense when
we are doing science as it turns out no you
can't do that because there's that entanglement that quantum entanglement
problem which basically says that uh when you're measuring some
sort of tiny subatomic particle or quark or whatever the
problem becomes that the very mechanism that you're using to
probe the particle itself is entangled with the result that
that particle gives back to you so when you probe
that particle one way is a particle when you probe
it another way it's actually a wave it's not a
particle so is there even such a thing as a
particle well no because the notion of particle is already
relativistic by saying there is a particle that already implies
some way in which you're probing that thing that's there
but then the question sort of arises well what is
the thing that's there if it's not a particle and
it's not a wave what is the what is it
there until we probe it and uh to understand that
go check out my uh two-part series uh called uh
quantum mechanics debunks materialism where i go into a lot
of depth explaining those sorts of things um so there's
a realization of course now with this relativity that uh
judgment becomes impossible because how do you judge a thing
when you're aware of the fact that every judgment you
make comes from some sort of arbitrary relative position and
depending on where you're standing you're gonna be judging things
in different ways because you're gonna be seeing them in
different ways how do you resolve that problem who is
the ultimate arbiter whose judgment is the best well a
christian might say well it's god or a muslim might
say well it's it's the quran you just look in
the quran and you know there it is written what
what are the right things to do but but that's
the you know that's the conventional stages at the post-conventional
stages you can no longer rely on some sort of
book as an authority and you know even like an
expert or achiever might say well it's science science adjudicates
what is good and what is bad what is right
and what is wrong what is true and what is
false we can make scientific judgments but even that needs
to be questioned at the post-conventional stage because you realize
that well what is science how do we know that
science has some sort of absolute understanding and judgment upon
the universe isn't science just one way of looking at
the world after all how can you say science is
the best way of of discovering the truth when maybe
there is meditation when maybe there's uh uh psychic abilities
when maybe there is voodoo how can you say that
voodoo is less legitimate than science this is what the
post-conventional pluralist uh problem is it's sort of it's an
epistemic problem that you start to face because now there's
there's this before there was just like a single world
view that you were locked into now it almost becomes
the opposite problem now there's this proliferation once you open
pandora's box of relativity everything becomes relative all these different
views multiply and there's this sort of a cornucopia of
different perspectives and at the pluralist stage you're struggling to
make sense of it all because while there are all
these different perspectives and views and cultures and lifestyles and
cuisines and so forth yes that's all that's all interesting
and good but at the same time life still places
very concrete demands upon you for survival so the challenge
for the pluralist is that while you're exploring all these
views at the you also have to try to manage
life and this can be difficult because when you become
so relativistic that you stop judging things it becomes difficult
for you to make decisions in your own life it
becomes difficult for you to be able to distinguish between
different levels and qualities of you because not all views
are necessarily equally practical so one way that you can
sort these views is on practicality does it work is
it functional is it going to help to create a
healthier life for me but but this sort of understanding
really doesn't come online yet for the pluralists so the
pluralist is going to spend a good five or ten
years probably struggling with this and this can create a
lot of confusion and uh turmoil in one's mind the
pluralist also realizes that we cannot help but filter our
observations through our personal and subjective lenses this is a
very important realization for the mind it humbles the mind
it makes the mind start to become aware of its
own biases so what kind of lenses are you using
to look at politics with to look at religion with
to look at science with see at the conventional stages
a scientist might say something a conventional scientist might say
something well science is just the objective method of discovering
objective truth and that's really all there is to science
you're either doing it you're either doing it very rigorously
or you're not you're either being rational or you're not
but a post-conventional scientist would say wait a minute that's
not all there is to the story even when i'm
doing science how do i know which forms of science
because there's not just one there's many different varieties of
science many different ways to do science so how do
we know which ways of doing science are better than
others and does it even make sense to say that
there's one best way to do science because after all
don't we have our personal biases because the scientist is
not some objective neutral impartial observer the way that conventional
people think the scientist is entangled with the science that
he's doing he has his biases and various metaphysical and
epistemic assumptions that he brings to the table when he's
doing his science for example isaac newton assumed that time
and space were absolute that was just taken for granted
and he did all his science based upon those assumptions
and then einstein came along and he said wait a
minute we can't take that for granted what if time
and space are not absolute what if they're relative and
that opened up a whole you know new domain basically
for advanced physics advanced cosmology and so forth which has
borne amazing fruit but it goes even beyond just the
stuff that einstein was doing or niels bohr or something
like that um this problem of of adjudicating and correcting
for the biases in our own lenses when we're doing
science this is a very deep problem and many scientists
today if they're conventional they don't realize the depth of
this problem they think that they're just doing science objectively
without realizing that their mind and their state of consciousness
is very much the lens through which they're doing their
science which is distorting the science that they're doing so
their version of science becomes very limited that doesn't mean
that all the science is wrong or bad it just
means that you can expand beyond it in the same
sense that isaac newton's mechanics it wasn't strictly speaking wrong
uh we still use it we still teach newtonian mechanics
and physics classes in high school and even in college
and it's extremely useful but it's again it's a scientific
model which has certain limits and then what einstein did
is he came along created a new model which was
broader which had a higher elevation perspective which incorporated newton
but then allowed us to understand even more about reality
and so in general that's sort of what's happening here
is that as your perspective expand expands it's not necessarily
that you're invalidating and disproving everything that came before you
you're just building on top of it and you're seeing
it and recontextualizing it in a higher more relativistic perspective
that's what's really going on and this can keep happening
forever you can keep zooming out and keep doing this
forever out and out now and that's what basically this
whole process of of development is about there's an awareness
at the pluralist stage of cultural conditioning you're starting to
see how much your culture programs you and that you
really are not in control of your own beliefs and
values as much as you thought you were the pluralists
can no longer disregard enorm the enormous diversity of people
and their beliefs values and preferences so in the past
in the conventional stages a lot of the reason that
they worked is because this was a usually an earlier
era where people lived in a less globalized society there
was no internet there were no books etc and so
you could just live in a little village or a
little town your whole life somewhere rural in the suburbs
or whatever and you didn't meet many diverse cultures and
therefore you could maintain a very limited narrow world view
based upon your community and your community usually all thought
the same have the same beliefs same values same preferences
but now when you can just buy a ticket and
travel around the world uh very cheaply quickly or you
can just skype people zoom people and um you can
watch youtube videos of people from africa and from the
amazon all this crazy stuff books are cheap and free
available every everywhere all the time it's easy you can
just download stuff you can watch movies all around the
world from different cultures you can watch documentaries and 4k
hd and all this and so this makes uh the
diversity so blatant and obvious that you can't deny it
anymore you can't just stay in your little bubble to
stay in your little bubble you have to deny all
of this stuff all these different cultures and different cuisines
and so the more you travel around the world the
more you interact with different diversities diversity people of different
diversities what i meant to say uh then it it
radically expands your worldview and oftentimes that's all you need
to do to to move into post-conventional is just go
travel around the world to exotic places i don't mean
other like conventional developed countries but go travel play like
if you're from a developed country from america or from
from europe travel someplace exotic and different travel to south
america travel to africa travel to asia and explore you
know explore india i guarantee you it's gonna you're gonna
that's not just gonna be an interesting experience for you
it's not just gonna be cool or mind opening it's
going to actually lead you to an existential and moral
crisis because you're going to see things there you're going
to see crippling poverty you're going to see disease you're
going to see inequality you're going to see violence you're
going to encounter laws and norms and people eating insects
and other weird animals and things you're gonna see such
weird things there if you bother to look that it's
gonna it's gonna shock you you're gonna be in for
a culture shock which will then lead to an existential
and an identity crisis because you're going to start to
ask yourself well i've been living in this little bubble
my whole life and look at how the rest of
the world lives it doesn't live the way that i
live i've been living in this you know cushy uh
american suburb environment maybe where i grew up and that's
not how the rest of the world lives and you'll
see also how backwards the rest of the world is
and you'll also discover ways in which there's wisdom in
in the sort of primitive cultures as well that we've
lost touch with here in the west in more developed
countries so again it's not all good and bad there's
pros and cons to it but it will certainly jostle
your worldview wide open the pluralist starts to now see
all world views as seemingly equally valid and worthy of
consideration this is both a good thing and a bad
thing because now you start to think of like nazism
as a legitimate valid worldview but is it really at
the same level of world view as like the world
view of a of a of a yogi or a
saint yeah i mean on a certain absolute sense you
could say they're equal who who you know who's to
say that that hitler's worldview was any uh any worse
than than jesus's or the buddhas but also there is
a difference but that difference doesn't uh really become apparent
until we go beyond pluralism the pluralist stage to the
next stage so at this point the pluralists are sort
of lost in this proliferation of different worldviews the diversity
of worldviews and isn't clear how to adjudicate between them
because that's sort of what relativity implies is that you're
losing your criteria for judging different things because who's to
say it's all relative um there's a desire in the
pluralist to be fair and even-handed so the pluralist sort
of naturally just wants to value and honor all ideas
equally um the truth becomes very difficult to find at
this stage become because everything starts to become relative and
the pluralist might even deny that there is such a
thing as truth very commonly a pluralist will say something
like well that's true for you but it's not true
for me and for conventional people when they hear pluralists
saying that uh they can cringe at that because they
say well but but what about the facts what about
objective reality i mean are you aren't you going crazy
with your relativism you're just saying that there's no such
thing as truth anymore we can't even agree on a
basic fact like can't we agree that that that that
car over there is is red i mean isn't it
red we all agree it's red right so what's wrong
with that isn't that a fact of of nature well
it's tricky because it would seem so but then when
you go deeper in your consciousness and you go more
post-conventional you realize that actually it's not so easy to
agree that that car is red for example we have
colorblind people who might not see the red car as
being red and i mean that's just a very crude
example there there's there's much more tricky examples of it
so so the pluralists can fall into this trap of
starting to believe that there's no such thing as truth
and then they get rigid about it and they say
well no there can't be truth because everything is relative
but then isn't that a truth but see so they're
still wrestling with this to them this is not clear
at later stages you will discover that actually there is
such a thing as absolute truth but it's not what
the conventional people thought it was it's something else in
fact the absolute truth is that everything is totally relative
but uh we're getting ahead of ourselves here also the
plural to the pluralist uh the mind can now stand
outside the system it grew up in and observe itself
and its culture from above so very good and important
ability the pluralist is good at questioning hidden assumptions values
and beliefs there's now a realization of self-deception as a
defense mechanism so your mind uses self-deception in order to
construct its reality and to convince itself that the reality
it constructed wasn't constructed but that's just how reality is
that's how reality is created i've talked a lot about
this in the past in various episodes but specifically if
you want to learn more about self-deception this powerful concept
check out my my three-part series called self-deceptions part one
two and three where i go into many many different
self-deception mechanisms that the mind is capable of and how
it tricks you into constructing reality and that that's a
theme that i cover over and over again in various
ways throughout all of my content as i'm sure you're
aware now uh so with this realization of self-deception and
again at this stage it's only just beginning so i
don't want you to get the idea that oh well
if i'm a pluralist that means i've completely eliminated self-deception
because now i understand it no you're just barely beginning
to open your mind to the possibility of self-deception you
have no idea yet how deep it really goes you've
just scratched the surface of self-deception whereas the conventional stages
they didn't even take self-deception seriously as a thing the
possibility that your own mind could be completely spin doctoring
you this wasn't a thing at the conventional stages it
just wasn't a possibility but now it's becoming a possibility
there's an awareness of how easily the human mind fools
itself and not just the human mind of other humans
but of course the human mind means my mind because
i'm a human see so while at the conventional stages
of course people will admit that people fool themselves they
will always make an exception for themselves see the mind
is clever here so the game that the mind is
playing is that he'll say well yeah sure there's lots
of deluded people in the world in fact most of
my enemies are deluded people people who are not like
me are all deluded people but people who are like
me are not deluded we're aware of the absolute truth
now of course that itself is the deception uh as
you come to realize at the higher stages so if
if other people are so easily fooled what are the
chances that you are one of those people fooling yourself
thinking that you're an exception to this trend that everybody
is so easily fooled see so now this comes into
awareness and self-deception cultural bias become the greatest dangers now
the greatest dangers of the post-conventional stages are not some
enemies out there they are not the nazis they are
not the terrorists they are not the you know whatever
the uh the the satanist and the demon worshipers and
the and the pedophiles and all this sort of stuff
that's not the greatest danger the greatest danger is your
own mind and the beliefs and software that were programmed
into your mind that was taken for granted all the
assumptions the hidden assumptions that you never questioned that you
were indoctrinated with by your culture as you were growing
up including religion science politics economics and morality and everything
else all of that that's the greatest danger that's a
huge realization if you can realize just this much you're
in the top like five percent of people on this
planet it takes a lot of work to realize the
significance of what i just said although it's it's pretty
simple and it's very obvious in retrospect but so many
people are in denial about it because this will lead
to an existential crisis for you the first time you
start to realize this and it's not just something you
realize once this is this is a process of years
we're talking about years and decades of realizing how deeply
you have deceived yourself how deeply your culture has programmed
you there's a realization that things are always more complex
than they seem at the lower stages it's very easy
to act sort of arrogant where you learn a little
bit about some topic and then you think you understand
everything now at the post-conventional stages you realize that all
of my opinions and all of my theories they're way
too simple for dealing with the actual reality of the
situation so when it comes to something like you know
police brutality at the conventional stages you could sort of
break it down into a couple of sides that got
sort of a binary well let's fund the police more
or less defund the police let's you're either pro police
or you're anti-police sort of this sort of stupid binary
uh but at the post-conventional stages you realize wait a
minute it's much more complex than that there's not a
pro-police anti-police this issue is complex it involves training it
involves funding it involves systems it involves uh different cultural
uh views it involves morality and it involves politics like
it involves all this sort of stuff but there's no
clear easy answer to the issue of how do you
improve the police yeah you can blame and point your
finger but blaming and pointing your finger at at different
sides doesn't resolve the problem the pluralist mind is capable
of venturing beyond culture this is huge there's an appreciation
now in this mind of epistemology questions concerning the nature
of knowledge how do we know what we know most
adults never bother to wonder how do we know what
we know how do we know anything at all how
do we know science is true how do we know
rationality and logic can be trusted how do we know
we can trust religion how do we know we can
trust spirituality or anything from the new age how do
we know anything how do we even know that we
exist for conventionally minded people these questions seem silly and
abstract and stupid once you get into the post-conventional you
realize how important these questions are in fact you realize
that these are the most important questions that you should
be asking so the pluralist is able to question how
one comes to know and believe things now a distinction
is starting to be drawn between beliefs and reality and
that how we think reality is that's totally separate from
reality itself and that even science when we're doing science
that is not reality itself that is us thinking about
reality which again is totally separate from reality itself which
of course opens the the question or the door to
the question of well then what is reality itself independent
of us thinking about it and interpreting it and modeling
it and theorizing about it and believing in it what
is that well that's a very profound question which will
require more stages to fully understand the pluralist realizes that
all groups and societies see it as their mandate to
mold the minds and hearts of their members and of
course we're not just talking about other groups we're also
talking about my group and my society so i am
not immune to this that's the key difference between a
conventional and a post-conventional mindset is that the post-conventional starts
to realize that i am not immune to all of
this brainwashing i'm very much a part of it so
how do i break free of this brainwashing when even
the books that i'm reading are just more brainwashing when
i go buy a book about how to un-brainwash myself
that book itself is the brainwashing that i have to
br brainwash myself from see the problem here where we
get into sort of strange loops and sort of these
loops that feed back on themselves that's exactly right that's
that's the problem of self-reflection which will only fully get
realized at much later stages there's an awareness of how
much society and environment has shaped one's point of view
one's world view beliefs and values the mind is seen
as completely contingent on historical context geographic place economic circumstance
education the structure of society culture media advertising and language
this is huge when you realize this see to most
people most conformist people their mind simply cannot compute the
simple fact that the only reason you're a christian is
because you were born in a christian country to christian
parents that's it that's the only reason you're a christian
if you were born in a muslim country to a
muslim family muslim parents you would be a muslim this
does not compute to a fundamentalist religious person and like
like likewise actually uh there's there's an even deeper level
to this problem where for most atheists and scientific materialists
it does not compute that the only reason you're an
atheist scientific materialist or rationalist is because you were born
in a developed country in the 21st century or the
20th century maybe uh at a certain era in history
where materialism and science and rationality are taken as absolute
truths and you've adopted those through the education system and
so forth this does not compute in the minds of
most scientists they can't see past this they think that
actually the science and the materialism and the rationalism that
this is the one true way relative to all the
other religious mumbo-jumbo that's found in the history books that
came before but they can't see that yes science is
is more advanced and more correct so to speak than
all the stuff that came before but then there's there's
new levels to science there's things beyond science which science
cannot comprehend because of the very nature and limits that
science imposes on its own self by being science science
blocks itself off from certain aspects of reality but most
scientists can't fathom this because they're just at the conventional
level there's also an appreciation of how media advertising culture
all of this influences us there's a there's an understanding
now of also how much language plays a role before
language was taken completely for granted now languages seem to
actually structure our thoughts we can only think the things
that our language allows us to think the distinctions that
our language makes are the distinctions that then our mind
categorizes reality in projecting those distinctions and then sort of
creating a feedback loop where we are using confirmation bias
and then see our own projections and then to convince
ourselves that that is what reality is actually like when
it's just relative perspective you start to question the education
system now you start to see that there's no such
thing as some objective perfect education system every education system
has certain biases and limitations in it whether it's a
religious or a secular education and the structure of society
now starts to be questioned where before stuff like um
like capitalism for example in america especially you know we
just take capitalism for granted that's just the way the
natural way that governments work the way that economies work
but is it really so natural you start to see
how artificial it is you start to see how it's
manipulated and changed and socially constructed there's nothing natural per
se about capitalism at least not in the way that
it's it's actually done in developed countries so you start
to question that whereas someone who's a conformist doesn't question
capitalism they just believe that capitalism is right and then
again if you grew up in in communist china or
in soviet russia you would think that communism or socialism
is is superior and the right way to do it
and you really believe it's the right way the funny
thing is is that these people on like fox news
these conservative types who rail against socialism and marxism and
communism that these very same people the structure of their
mind is such that if they just were born rather
be more in america if they were just born in
soviet russia 50 years ago they would be staunch communist
party members vehemently fighting for communism against capitalism because again
like i said in part one it's not the content
that's so important it's the structure of the mind see
yes a capitalist like a dogmatic capitalist and a dogmatic
communist it might seem like these are polar opposites but
actually if you're looking at it from a higher elevation
you see that they're very similar to each other just
their ideas are different the content of their mind is
different but the structure of their mind is the same
they're both dogmatic in the same way they're both failing
to see the the pros and cons and trade-offs of
the other system they're both stuck within their little narrow
paradigm and they're both busy defending it without being aware
of what they're doing they're both unable to step up
to a higher elevation look downwards and to see how
maybe the two could be reconciled as a sort of
a yin and yang thing so at the pluralist stage
there's a realization that the mind has far less control
over being molded than you previously believed at the conventional
stages yes you thought there was brainwashing but you didn't
consider yourself to be brainwashed now the post-conventional stages you
realize holy not only is there brainwashing but i'm the
biggest fool because i fooled myself into thinking that there
was no such thing as brainwashing and that itself was
the brainwashing the brainwashing was that i am the only
one who wasn't brainwashed which of course means i was
the most brainwashed you start to see that see that
takes a sort of a meta self-reflection you see how
you need to take a higher meta perspective to be
able to see that education itself is now seen as
a source of self-deception even reading science textbooks and math
textbooks this itself can become a self-deception because you're you're
taking them as an authority and yes 99 of science
is taken on blind faith through authority that's what you
realize when you get to the post-conventional stages at the
conventional stages you believe no leo science is not about
authority science is not like religion science is totally different
science is about facts it's about empiricism it's about studying
things about being rational this is not based on authority
then you realize actually 99 of everything you know about
science is pure belief no different than a christian or
a muslim believes in allah or christ or whatever else
have you ever actually done any science yourself how much
science have you actually done almost none all of it
is belief based all the science you learned in school
was all belief based that's just that's just how it
is but of course people at the conventional stage are
in denial about this because they need to draw a
firm distinction between science and religion and this is very
threatening to start to admit that maybe science is no
better than religion maybe science falls into the very same
traps and problems that religion falls into maybe science is
also an ideology maybe science is also a belief system
maybe science also takes certain things for granted yeah that's
that's super threatening because then you have to wonder like
well then how do i discover what's true if we
can't do it through religion if the bible can't tell
us if my culture can't tell me what's true if
science can't even tell me what's true how then it
must be hopeless then there's no truth and and yeah
you're gonna have to spend some years or decades struggling
through all that so understand that what i'm describing here
is a long journey your mind needs to work through
all of these questions and problems i'm sitting here after
doing 20 years of this epistemic work now just spewing
all this at you as though it was easy but
i racked my mind over this for thousands and thousands
of hours and now it's easy you know in retrospect
it wasn't easy going through that process it's very very
challenging which is why most people don't do it it's
emotionally laborious it's confusing there's paradoxes and things you don't
understand and then you know your ego doesn't want to
admit that it was wrong and you start looking like
a fool to yourself in retrospect you start to look
back at your past at the arguments and conversations you've
had with your friends and teachers and you see how
stupid you were how all of your beliefs and all
of your opinions and ideas that they were just childish
childish uh fairy tales uh and yet you thought you
were so right this is extremely threatening and very few
people are willing to admit these things to themselves personally
i've been doing this work this epistemic work i've been
doing it since i was like 16 years old and
honestly it shocked me that most people my age weren't
doing it and then i later i learned that people
even who are twice my age were doing it they're
just not interested in it and now i realize that's
because they're stuck in conventional and i was post-conventional i
was post-conventional basically since like 16 years old um of
course i still had to work through conventional stages i
was just you know tapping into it again barely tapping
into it you have to realize that all of these
stages and categories and so forth there's a lot of
depth to them so you can kind of tap into
it at a certain age but that doesn't mean you
fully understood it exhausted it or solidified yourself in it
or that you can fully embody it really it's taken
it's taken decades for me to be able to fully
embody those original uh first glimpses and realizations i had
when i was 16 years old or 20 years old
of this epistemic stuff so at the pluralist stage there's
also now a turning away from material achievements to inner
experience and self-reflection the inner world becomes so interesting now
that getting some money or some sex or a fast
car these things become like child's play you start to
lose interest in them and also probably because the stage
prior to this was the achiever stage so you've probably
achieved a lot of that stuff you probably did already
earn some good money and you probably did already get
your fast car and you had a house and you
you had some sex and you did some drugs and
you you went partying and you did all this stuff
and you've achieved already a good chunk in your life
and now you ask well what's more it seems like
i've already achieved so much am i just going to
keep achieving more of the same it doesn't really fulfill
me anymore there needs to be some deeper dimension to
to life and so now you're ready to go into
the inner dimensions the dimensions of consciousness the psychological dimensions
there's an ever deeper discovery of how one's subjective how
subjective one's worldview is this is both liberating and confusing
it's confusing because there's now unlimited ways of seeing the
world and you're struggling to make sense of it all
remember the ego's primary job is to make sense of
the world and so now what we're doing is we're
sort of taking the way that you were making sense
of the world the conventional ways we're pulling that rug
out from under you and we're not replacing it with
anything and so you're left in a sort of state
of vertigo for years and maybe for a whole decade
you will be in a state of of vertigo trying
to just reorient yourself and there's a very strong temptation
to to regress backwards and just to cling to something
you know let me go back to my religion let
me just go back to science let me just find
some way to anchor myself into some sort of cohesive
way of making sense of the world and that is
the trap if you really want to be courageous you
have to let go of the need for any kind
of anchors and let yourself be groundless and rudderless for
a while maybe for a few years maybe for a
decade uh as your mind is struggling to figure all
this out and as you're exploring all these different perspectives
so even though it's confusing and can be emotionally taxing
it's also hugely liberating in the sense that now you
have so many more options and possibilities you're not straight
jacketed anymore to one way of doing things to one
you know to one way of doing spirituality to one
way of searching for truth now you have multiple ways
and that's great some of them are going to be
terrible but some of them a few of them you'll
discover are going to be way better than anything you
thought or had before now at this stage at the
plural stage it becomes interesting just watching oneself trying to
make sense of oneself you ever done that you're doing
something and then you're just watching yourself doing it and
seeing how like a monkey you are how you're just
like a robot like a zombie just going through the
motions of doing something and then maybe even the question
enters your mind why am i even doing this thing
in the first place i never even i never even
questioned why i should do this thing why should i
go to church why should i read the bible why
should i wash my hands why should i uh read
a book why should i do these now some of
them are legitimate to do you know maybe washing your
hands is a good idea especially these days um but
then some of those things you realize uh the only
reason i was doing it was because i was like
a monkey imitating others who were doing those things and
i thought they were smart and then i realized that
they weren't smart they were just pretending to be smart
because they were just copying other monkeys who were pretending
to be smart but actually none of them were smart
so who's really smart how do i even determine what
smartness means anymore the pluralist now abandons purely rational analysis
in favor of more holistic organismic approaches which take into
account feelings intuitions and context this is huge huge huge
you see this problem a lot on youtube you see
a lot of youtubers who are in that spiral dynamic
stage orange zone where they are hardcore scientific materialists i
call them also rationalist atheists often they are and uh
and they they love to criticize religious people uh they
love to they love to criticize deepak chopra and all
the woo stuff and teal swan and oh yeah they'll
they'll just jump on anything new age they'll just jump
on of course they they do the same thing to
me this is the pre-trans fallacy that ken wilbur has
beautifully articulated and labeled uh like if you go to
if you go to the rationalist wiki there's a rationalist
wikipedia uh it's it's com it's a complete mockery of
rationality and science but but they pretend as though they're
being rational and scientific but if you go there you
can you can find me you can search my name
in there you're going to find a terrible entry that
that that completely misconstrues everything that i say in the
name of course debunking me so they think that they
can debunk me by just you know uh going through
these scientific materialist rationalist talking points of how you know
oh he's just some new age cult leader blah blah
blah blah blah not realizing that they're just falling into
the pre-trans fallacy um and i totally get it you
know i don't really hold it against them they just
can't do any better because they're stuck in rationality so
uh the post-conventional realizes the limitations of rationality it actually
realizes that intuition is more powerful than rationality and it
starts to feel and to get a lot of wisdom
and insight into reality from feeling from consciousness rather than
through linear logical thinking or proof or analysis the idea
that for a thing to be true it has to
be formally proven this is one of the most toxic
and unscientific ideas that exists amongst people who otherwise consider
themselves to be scientific so the pluralist now is going
from the purely logical into the psychological domain you see
because actually what you realize is that one of the
ways one of the chief ways in which your mind
fools you and deceives you is with logic because logic
can be used by the by the mind actually the
left hemisphere is responsible for logic in right-handed people if
you're left-handed then it's reverse the left hemisphere is responsible
for logic and for the logical way in which the
ego mind the ego basically lives inside of logic inside
the left hemisphere and it's responsible for dissecting the world
and for rationalizing everything in order to preserve the ego
so this is what the rationalists and scientists and and
atheists don't understand they don't understand that by just taking
logic for granted that opens to sort of a back
door for the ego to co-opt that logic and to
use that logic to justify whatever it wants every evil
and deluded person in the history of mankind has considered
himself to be rational and logical and has used reasons
and logic to justify his evilness and his delusion it
doesn't matter whether religious or scientific theists or atheists or
anything else everybody has logic the question is are you
using your logic well and ironically when you're being very
strict about your logic and you're demanding everything to be
logical and you deny anything that isn't logical that is
a misuse of logic the highest use of logic and
reason is to realize the limits inherent to logic and
reason and then to let it go that doesn't mean
that you become illogical and irrational like a fool you
can still do logic and you can still reason but
you're careful about it now logic becomes self-aware at this
stage or at least it's starting to it just it's
starting to and in order for logic to become self-aware
it has to become psychological psycho dash logical you have
to now state start to take into account the various
sneaky uh psychological ploys and tricks that your mind employs
when it's doing logic there's now an exploration of experience
and discovery is more interesting and important uh than reaching
a goal or making a product so a pluralist would
rather just explore different perspectives maybe travel around the world
experience new people and relationships rather than just working like
some achiever towards some money goal or to launch some
product there tends to be a distrust at the pluralist
stage of conventional wisdom and hyper-rational methods and this is
a good and valid distrust because they can't be trusted
scientific certainty and the judgmental frame breaks down pluralists like
to scrutinize their own assumptions and they relish in the
novel mental freedom that comes at this stage all values
are now seen as relative but survival still demands making
choices and judgments which the pluralist struggles with rather than
solving problems one must figure out what to define as
the problem at this stage see as the cliche einstein
quote goes i mean it's cliche because it's really good
it's very appropriate is that you can't solve a problem
at the same level of consciousness that was used to
create it and that's what you realize with the post-modern
i mean the post uh post-conventional stages problems are now
seen as an interplay between polarities neither one of which
can simply be eliminated the conventional traditional mind thinks that
oh all we got to do to make the world
good is just kill all the evil people if we
kill all the rapists murders and pedophiles and terrorists the
world will be a paradise and then you realize no
no that that attitude itself is exactly what makes the
world evil you can't just kill all the criminals and
rapists and terrorists uh first of all because in the
process of doing so you yourself will become a criminal
uh rapist and a terrorist um uh but also because
the reason that these terrorists and criminals and so forth
exist is actually a differences in perspective they have different
agendas than you different perspectives than you and so who's
to say who deserves to be killed you see when
you think you can just improve the world by killing
everybody else who is who you don't like who doesn't
fit your perspective well but then everybody else also will
think of the world and approach the world in that
way you see so if a christian believes that well
we should kill all the muslims and a muslim believes
well we should kill the christians and a buddhist believes
well we should kill those two then what do you
got you've got chaos you've got war what's necessary is
actually an understanding of the difference in perspective that all
three have and to see that actually we can find
common ground between these perspectives such that we don't need
to kill each other we can mutually co-exist we can
find a way in which we can actually find common
ground work together and to do that we need to
be able to see through each other's eyes rather than
demonizing each other or thinking that the world would just
be better if those people didn't exist and a lot
of scientific people fall into this trap as well they
convinced themselves that well if if religion just didn't exist
the world would be a great place let's kill all
the religious people or maybe they don't go that far
but they'll say something like if we could just get
rid of all the churches you know in 100 years
all of religion will be gone i know because i
used to think this way i went through a hard
rationalist scientific materialist phase in my life an atheist phase
in my life where i i would i would i
remember i would tell myself something like in a hundred
years all of religion will be gone and mankind will
be freed up and there will be this this flowering
of science and rationality that will transform society and everything
will be peachy i had this fantasy i didn't understand
that that's just that's just the same problem as you
know a muslim thinking that uh just you know get
rid of all the infidels and the world would be
a better place it's not gonna work that way uh
the pluralist enjoys paradox and contradiction without needing to eliminate
them that's a huge step forward can the conventional mind
cannot deal with paradox conventionally minded rational and logical people
they don't understand paradox they can their mind cannot handle
strange loops cannot deal with circular causality and that sort
of stuff and in fact they take paradox as evidence
of contradiction and in fact they use the paradoxes that
result from post-modern and post-conventional thinking they use that as
evidence on their side for the fallaciousness of post-modernism and
uh post-conventional thinking when actually it's not this is not
a that's not a bug this is a feature the
post-conventional mind sees paradox as a feature not a bug
and it can even relish in the paradox paradox can
be seen as delicious and beautiful that's ultimately where you
want to get to with paradox because paradox is the
core feature of reality we might say and i'm going
to shoot an episode in the future that's going to
be all about paradox and how paradox works and i've
already talked about a little bit in in a couple
of episodes uh my googles and completeness theorem episode and
also in my reality is a strange loop episode so
check those out if you want to see more about
that so linear logic gives way to a more holistic
understanding not everything needs to be proven in order to
be embraced at the post-modern stage at the pluralist stage
value is placed upon insight and breakthrough like the kind
of insights you get through contemplation or through meditation these
are dismissed by the conventional mind as just being subjective
hallucinations or something which is why many scientists don't take
insight seriously when in fact insight is the is the
core foundation of all scientific breakthrough but it takes a
genius scientist to really be capable of understanding the power
of insight and what insight is there's now a playful
exploration at this pluralist stage and the imagination is set
free because you've got so many perspectives and the more
perspectives you explore the more creative your mind becomes and
you you you see new possibilities new interesting combinations because
creativity is basically a combination of of diverse source material
and so now your source material exponentially explodes and so
does your creativity and your imagination uh the pluralist now
looks for connections and subtle clues rather than analyzing independent
parts so the pluralist is all about connecting the dots
that's going to be sort of the mode of understanding
reality whereas at the conventional stages like the expert and
the achiever their whole way of understanding reality was just
to dissect it into parts and to think that the
the parts once we dissect them all if we add
them all together it's just going to be the same
as if we split them all apart so the sum
and the the separate parts that they're all the same
but the pluralist realizes that the sum is not the
same as the independent parts something is lost when you
dissect an animal or you know you throw a frog
into a blender and you blend it up and you
you break it down into a bunch of cells and
molecules that is not the same thing as a fully
functioning frog you can't understand a frog by throwing into
a blender and then looking at it under a microscope
you can only understand a very narrow sliver of what
a frog is by looking at it that way you
also have to look at it psychologically you have to
look at sociologically you have to look at it zoologically
you have to look at it spiritually you have to
look at it in a sort of a in a
social way you have to look at it in a
political way there's so many different ways that you can
understand what a frog is and how it fits into
the larger universe than just throwing it into a blender
and dissecting it under a microscope useful information can now
come from beyond science at this stage sources that used
to be viewed with ridicule and skepticism such as intuition
feeling dreams meditation self-reflection insight these now become highly valued
and you can see this like the rationalist wiki uh
if you go look at rationalist wiki all their different
page entries not just on me but on everybody else
that they that they cover the sort of debunking attitude
that they take a lot of times what they're sort
of doing is they're ridiculing and they're misusing skepticism in
order just to perpetuate their scientific materialist conventional worldview without
realizing that that is what they're doing they just take
skepticism and rational ridicule as uh as somehow being you
know the height of human intelligence when really it's not
it's quite stupid check out my episode called true versus
false skepticism where i talk about how skepticism is misused
and weaponized by rationalists and how to use skepticism properly
there's a lot of value to skepticism and i consider
myself a skeptic that's how i started doing philosophy is
with skepticism but but man you can really misuse skepticism
and you see it all over youtube all over youtube
these days it's so popular just to ridicule anything that
doesn't fit the sort of traditional conventional rational scientific materials
paradigm just ridicule it uh with this very flimsy false
skepticism um you know people will ridicule insight they will
ridicule meditation they will ridicule spiritual techniques they will ridicule
yoga they will ridicule chakras they will ridicule various healing
modalities they will ridicule intuition and they will ridicule feelings
and emotions they will ridicule femininity they will ridicule holistic
thinking because their mind just wants to dissect reality in
a very linear analytical way and they don't know any
other way to understand reality they have it in their
minds that that's the only way when in fact it's
just one way out of an infinite number of ways
big picture thinking becomes important to the pluralist there is
now a shift from being to feeling i mean sorry
from from doing to being and feeling so the achiever
was all about running around doing stuff and uh the
pluralist is like no let's sit back let's feel let's
let's get in touch with our being now of course
oftentimes to a conventionally minded rationalist person this feeling and
being stuff seems hippie and new agey and woo-woo and
it seems like it's not real it doesn't seem tangible
but that's because yeah it's it's a more uh it's
a more advanced way of interfacing with reality than just
logicing everything to death or grabbing something by the throat
the way that you were used to the lower stages
see as you go higher in the stages your consciousness
becomes more abstract you're capable of doing abstraction at higher
and higher levels and higher elevations and so therefore uh
the reason this new age stuff can feel kind of
airy fairy is because in a sense it is it's
more spiritual spirit meaning breath meaning it's more ephemeral it's
more abstract it's more purely conscious rather than grossly material
you can't necessarily grab it with your hand but that
doesn't make it any less real or any less true
in fact actually it's more real it's more true the
more abstract your insights get so this is something that
a conventional mind doesn't understand there's now an awareness the
plural stage of how emotions aren't just in the head
but are diffused throughout the whole body so the mind-body
connection is now recognized as a valid legit thing it's
actually seen as very important and that actually what you
discover is that while you were in the conventional stages
you were so stuck in your head that you often
had even diseases and ailments in your body because you
were disconnected from your body you were carrying around anger
sadness frustration uh trauma in your body from childhood you
were carrying this stuff around with you uh and then
and as you start to feel into it it starts
to release but just that feeling in process itself can
be scary it can be threatening it can feel alien
because many many people in the world haven't even felt
their bodies haven't felt emotions they've never consciously experienced anger
or sadness uh because they just numb themselves out with
television with porn with drugs with food and all this
sort of stuff they self-medicate in all these different ways
to avoid feeling and also because they think so much
they're stuck in their heads that they they don't realize
that these emotions are actually not in the head they're
in the body and so when you start to realize
the importance of integrating the mind and the body together
this opens up a whole new domain of self-improvement work
of spiritual work of healing work but of course a
lot of traditionally minded people will think of this as
just new age airy fairy nonsense and of course it
seems that way from their perspective because they're stuck in
their head they're thinking about it they're not actually feeling
into it you can't understand feeling and emotion by thinking
about it more you have to realize oh thinking about
it is not how you actually feel let me stop
thinking let me start feeling let me really become conscious
of my emotions let me do some mindfulness practice but
for that your mind has to be open see so
it'll for most people like it was for me you're
probably going to spend a good five years kind of
resisting it and then it'll take you another five years
uh to start to actually feel and it is gonna
be a long multi-year process of gradually feeling into your
various emotions and slowly opening up your body maybe by
doing yoga or whatever maybe doing some shamanic breathing like
i had an episode in the past and that will
establish the mind-body connection and you will realize that how
you feel in your body is oftentimes related to how
you think whereas at the conventional stages if someone has
a disease or someone has depression they will tend to
attribute it to a material cause like oh i'm depressed
because um of you know some material i don't have
enough money that's why i'm depressed so uh let me
either go get more money or let me go get
some anti-depression pills which will solve my depression for me
that's how it sort of conventional mind thinks whereas a
post-conventional mind will start to say wait a minute maybe
my depression is more psychologically based maybe there's trauma in
the past i haven't dealt with maybe it's just the
fact that i'm not fully feeling in my emotions let
me feel where is the depression in my body maybe
it's in my chest maybe it's in my heart maybe
it's in my my hands maybe you know what what
might be the cause of that and you start to
explore that you start to maybe do some bodywork or
you know bioenergetic type stuff or whatever yoga and then
you start to establish that mind-body connection and then you
realize that oh the depression wasn't some material thing it
was more of a spiritual thing more of a psychological
thing and then that opens up new ways of dealing
with it healthier ways so there's a recognition at this
pluralist stage that feelings thoughts and the body sensations all
intertwine and affect each other how you think affects how
you feel but also how you feel affects how you
think what you put in your body affects how you
think and how you feel how you use your body
can expand your ability to be creative and so forth
and this is not just airy fairy new agey stuff
i mean it's real just go actually try this stuff
and you'll see these very real connections between these things
you can't separate the mind from the heart the logical
from the intuitive or uh facts from feelings this this
stupid binary idea of like oh there's facts and then
there's your feelings man so like the rational people the
same people they just go with the facts they have
very distinction between facts and feelings that ben shapiro likes
to use that itself is grounded all in his own
feelings there's nothing factual or logical or objective or rational
about what ben shapiro is doing he's being completely ideological
and governed everything he's doing every show he does everything
coming out of his mouth is completely governed by his
ego which is all governed by feelings but he's so
disconnected from it he's so robotic you can tell in
the way he holds his body his his facial muscles
all this stuff it's so you know he's you can
see he's trying to hold it together to kind of
uh play that good boy you know uh judeo-christian kind
of like conformist stereotype of what a good jew has
to be uh and uh and yeah it's just it's
extremely predictable there's nothing intelligent about it it's just he's
behaving like a robot and it's not there's nothing i'm
not trying to pick on him it's just he's he's
one good example of of millions of people who live
this way they're very very repressed you know when you
when you repress your sexuality you have to also have
to repress your whole body your muscles have to be
tight you have to you know you're denying yourself that's
what a lot of christians and catholics uh muslims and
so on they deal with the sort of the guilt
and the the the pressure of constantly having to deny
your animal urges but at the pluralist stages are sort
of opening up and this is well you know where
the hippies come from so the hippies very much were
pluralists and so the hippies are into free love and
uh they're into psychedelics their minds are more open they're
into exploring different cultures and so on you know but
then of course the hippies get demonized why the hippies
get demonized who do the hippies get demonized by they
get demonized by these hyper-rational people or the conformist people
it's the conformists the achievers and the experts and opportunists
i guess as well who all demonize the hippies because
the hippies is that is that sort of that next
quantum leap into from the conventional thinking to the post-conventional
ways of thinking which is very threatening to them it
takes a lot of work to become a hippie being
a hippie is very advanced see that's what many of
the rationalists don't understand they think a rationalist thinks like
a rational scientist thinks he's more developed than a hippie
actually he's not he's not unless he happens to be
a scientist and a hippie then then maybe he is
you can also do that at higher stages so uh
logic and science are no longer absolutes but one and
one out of many different valid episodic epistemic modes pluralists
are concerned with making a unique and personal contribution to
the world independent of any socially approved roles or tasks
pluralists often withdraw into external uh from external affairs and
company life to um or ordinary daily routines so they
they like to live more unconventionally which of course also
corresponds with hippies you know hippie doesn't want to be
a square a square is basically a word that hippies
invented for all the conventional thinking people who just go
to a nine-to-five job and just you know punch a
clock and work at a factory or you know work
on wall street these are squares ben shapiro is a
square don't be a square um the pluralist likes to
turn inward instead and to search one's own unique gifts
and answers to one's own burning questions that's what search
becomes about it's about self-exploration and self-expression that's what hippies
are into now of course also don't get me wrong
when i say the word hippie i'm stereotyping it doesn't
mean that you literally have to become that stereotypical hippie
who has long hair and you know smokes weed and
uh and is you know can't keep a job just
be careful with the stereotype because there's a lot of
demonization that has happened of the post-modern world view like
a very common misconceptions i see is people say well
if i be so i thought leo if i become
a pluralist like you're saying here i'll become a hippie
and that means i won't be able to have a
job i won't be able to raise kids i won't
be a responsible adult i won't have any money i'll
be broke no it doesn't have to mean that those
are all extreme stereotypes yes you can become a hippie
to such an extreme that you become homeless and you
live out of a you know a a 1960s style
volkswagen van uh you know uh deal and pot on
the side to you know to to make money to
buy your you know organic kombucha and then you and
you're going to music festivals and like that becomes your
whole life and and you're wearing like a poncho like
a dirty poncho reminds me that homer simpson's episode about
hippies where homie homer becomes a hippie anyways yeah it
like these are gross exaggerations it doesn't have to be
this way at all a pluralist can be capable can
be a computer programmer can maintain a job you know
you can still maintain the abilities of the lower stages
you can still have money as a pluralist and so
on let's just be careful uh pluralists are good are
good at finding novel ways of looking at problems uh
they like to inspire others to pursue their own interests
explore yourself man like that you know go on a
personal journey go on a vision quest hippies will tell
you that um pluralists can sometimes appear amoral because they
seem so relativistic i'm commonly accused of that i think
a lot of people when they watch my content think
of me as some sort of amoral person because i
can be extremely relativistic in the way that i speak
about things like murder and rape and terrorism i can
speak very relativistically about these things because i'm not attached
to them i don't demonizing these things and that makes
me look immoral actually it's a higher level of morality
it's a sort of a transcendent morality where you're not
you're not attached to demonizing anything and you you see
the validity of every perspective even when you look at
a rapist you understand the raper's perspective that's very threatening
to many conventionally minded people because they've made a cottage
industry and their whole life have been demonizing you know
these bad people these criminals they've been demonizing them for
so long that even in their own mind to be
able to look at a rapist or a criminal or
a terrorist relativistically without judging them that to them already
is evil they judge themselves for not being judgmental and
then they judge me and they judge others who are
not judgmental uh enough for them they judge us as
you know being evil and criminals and satanic and all
this because hey you know leo if you were a
good person you should judge rapists and you should judge
hitler and you should judge nazis and you should hate
them and you should hate terrorists no man that's just
that's your square way of thinking i'm beyond that so
i don't have to i don't play by your rules
uh uh one of the chief anxieties for pluralists is
integrating the different sub aspects of one's own psyche so
you start to realize that there are different parts of
your self there's a feminine side there's a masculine side
there's a there's a hippie side to you there's a
square side to you there's a rational side there's an
intuitive side there's an emotional side there's a hyper stoic
side and you have to you have to sort of
corral it and make all these work together and so
this is a big challenge for the pluralists because at
the conventional stages this wasn't done these subparts were denied
so once you start to allow them in to have
a conversation with each other you know that that presents
its own challenges because they all want competing different things
you have to some somehow uh pacify them and and
reconcile them integrate them for the pluralists there's a fear
of being reabsorbed into the lower stages of the rat
race those square stages are perceived to be the rat
race there is a dread that one's work life won't
allow for individual self-expression and creativity if you say that
it can feel isolated at this pluralist stage you can
feel isolated from others who don't understand the post-conventional mindset
because most people are conventional so here you start to
feel like you're kind of lonely you don't know how
to find like-minded friends which just means you have to
upgrade your friends to more post-conventional ones there can be
relationship problems especially when one partner like you is post-conventional
but your spouse or your girlfriend or your boyfriend is
conventional and they don't understand your post-conventional ways they want
to kind of drag you down to be conventional like
them but you fear going back to that square way
of living and to you just feels inauthentic and so
you can't do that so there's there's no conflict although
both of you are still probably not going to be
aware enough to realize that that is what's causing the
conflict there are a couple of traps here with this
pluralist stage one is that it tends to judge all
hierarchies as oppressive without recognizing the validity of some hierarchies
two is it trapped that it tends to treat all
opinions values and worldviews as equally valid when in fact
they aren't equally all valid from a survival standpoint and
in the end if you're here and you're alive you're
gonna have to be making decisions and certain evaluations but
there are healthy and unhealthy ways of making evaluations you
can make evaluation without being judgmental about it another trap
is that extreme relativism leads to indecision and false equivalency
well that's sort of similar to what i was just
saying and then another trap is that diversity and equality
itself can become an oppressive position so this is sort
of like some of those extreme extreme social justice warriors
who just kind of go overboard with their egalitarianism and
then they they start to go so overboard they want
everything to be so equal and so diverse that actually
ends up sort of backfiring and it turns into oppression
some of the conservatives love to complain about this uh
most the time they overblow this uh it does happen
but it happens a lot less than right-wingers will portray
on youtube that's for sure it's a lot less of
a problem than someone like jordan peterson would like you
to believe although he's made his whole career out of
uh out of this like one point and many of
the intellectual dark web type of people have made entire
careers out of just uh over exaggerating the problem of
of pluralism on this point of diversity and equality sort
of the whole cancel culture stuff it's really a distraction
from understanding the so that the the value that pluralism
provides a world view this is a enormous leap in
consciousness to get to pluralism and yet it's so dismissed
and so demonized by the right it's quite disgusting and
quite dysfunctional and problematic but don't get me wrong also
these pluralists they're not perfectly non-judgmental they certainly will judge
others who do not hold their egalitarian beliefs is that
a contradiction of course it is but they are not
yet conscious enough to see that contradiction nor are they
spiritually developed enough their ego is not small enough to
the point where they can just let go of all
judgment including the judgment of those who judge and those
who don't hold egalitarian hippie ideals the pluralist still doesn't
fully appreciate that others are not as developed as they
are they're generally very tolerant of diverse ideas behaviors and
reactions and cultures but they can come off as dreamers
and non-doers because they're not so concerned with material achievements
as the previous stages because they're more deeply inter concerned
with their interiors they tend to prefer to live on
the fringes of society they are capable of entertaining contradicting
ideas and they tend to have an attitude of well
it just all depends man it all depends so if
you come to to a pluralist and you ask them
hey what should i do should i go to college
or not should i get married or not should i
leave my religion or not they'll say well it all
depends there's no simple answer okay and with that we've
spent way too much time on the player list let's
move on to the autonomous strategist which represents about five
percent of the us adult population so the strategist can
take a system's view of reality a strategist can comprehend
multiple interconnected systems of relationships and processes both internally and
externally the first stage here this is the first stage
that recognizes the need and value of all the lower
stages so this is huge once perspective becomes so high
that one's realizes that all the lower perspectives so to
speak are all necessary and play their function in the
same way that you recognize when you're an adult that
kids need to go through different grades in school and
that just because your kid is in fifth grade doesn't
mean he's bad or wrong or evil he's in fifth
grade because that's the age he's at and that's what
he needs to you know that's the material he needs
to go through to move on to sixth grade and
the seventh grade into eighth grade and then ultimately to
become like you so how can you judge and demonize
them for doing that when you did it yourself when
you see yourself moving through all these different stages when
you remember how it was like to be a conformist
and then to be an expert and to be stuck
in rationalism at the achiever level and so on when
you remember all this and you sympathize empathize with it
then you have compassion for all these different perspectives and
you realize that yeah people are stuck oftentimes in these
stages but uh judging them for it demonizing them for
it is not going to work that's a low consciousness
way of dealing with the situation this is the first
stage that really expresses and embodies the global worldview the
pluralist stage that came before can express can talk about
the global worldview but can't fully embody it yet because
it's still too judgmental most of the world is not
as developed as they are but the strategist is now
even developing this capacity a truly global worldview an inclusive
worldview the strategist can perceive systemic patterns and long-term trends
there's a sense of oneself as part of ongoing history
uh the strategist sees oneself through an evolutionary lens not
just the self but society and the whole world all
of us are going through this evolutionary process it's a
messy challenging chaotic process that involves many different overlapping systems
and we're all a part of it we're all entangled
with it and the strategist is able to see that
and to appreciate it and to kind of project forward
the strategist can can look backwards at the evolutionary path
of society and then the self himself herself uh one's
culture as well and then project that forward as well
we can project forward the the evolution of mankind of
our society of our culture of our country of our
family of our company and of ourselves thoughts and feelings
can no longer be isolated forming a dynamic interplay the
strategist can now make meaning autonomously independent of conventional ideas
now there's an idea to actually generate new ideas and
new meanings independently of culture or your society or what
your co-workers are doing or what your teachers and friends
are doing or what your family is doing to truly
think independently this is such a rare ability and i'll
talk about that i'll have a whole episode in the
future about how to truly think independently it's a huge
game changer if you learn to do it the strategist
takes responsibility for their interpretation valuation and sense making and
life stories this is huge most of the prior stages
find clever ways to shirk responsibility and even the pluralist
will still shirk responsibility but the strategist is taking a
lot more responsibility and basically that's what going up all
these stages are when you get to the very highest
stages you become so responsible for everything uh because you
realize that there's literally nobody to blame other than your
own mind and so you take responsibility for how your
mind is interpreting evaluating and making sense and meaning out
of reality and this this this changes everything for you
the strategist is consciously committed to making a meaningful life
for uh herself and others through self-actualization the strategist has
successfully integrated those sub-personalities and sub-identities that i was talking
about with the pluralists just a few moments ago has
already integrated those and so the strategist is more grounded
there not so torn and confused as the pluralist was
the strategist is what you become after you've gone through
maybe a five or ten years of the pluralist sort
of flailing around playing with different perspectives being kind of
hippy-dippy and airy-fairy and wishy-washy and maybe sometimes not so
practical and and then but then you kind of out
of all that something starts to congeal and come together
something more solid and that's what the strategist is the
sense of self in the strategist is both differentiated and
integrated at the same time remember i talked about how
these stages oscillate between differentiation and integration of the ego
self well this is now starting to to bear fruit
as something cohesive and whole the strategist tends to have
a a sense of transformational mission the strategist is not
just here on this planet to enjoy himself to titillate
herself with pleasures of the body or even the mind
uh the strategist is here on a larger mission the
strategist is infused with a grand purpose and vision of
what could be of what mankind could become of what
the world needs to move forward in the evolutionary process
so the strategist is sort of a midwife to the
birthing of a new humanity through this evolutionary process by
understanding it and working with the various systems that are
involved and by transforming oneself through self-actualization to uh become
better in helping well to basically to become a better
midwife for mankind in whatever way that is there's many
different ways in which you could be a midwife for
mankind don't take it literally uh it's a figurative abstract
way of speaking about it uh the strategist worries most
about failing to observe universal principles so they tend to
be very principled people they they want honesty authenticity truth
you know whatever principles they hold they will tend to
want to walk their talk not just talk but actually
hold themselves to that high standard and oftentimes one of
their downfalls that they will guilt themselves for not being
able to meet these you know high principles and high
standards because it's difficult to transform the human animal the
human chimp in order to fit in with these universal
principles and ideals you know to be free of self
bias to be always truthful to be authentic to be
independent and not uh reactive to not be just blindly
emotional to not just be strictly hyper rational you know
to follow and observe these principles to up principles of
universal justice and compassion and so on non-judgmentalism this is
very difficult you got to really work for decades to
train the human uh monkey mind to be able to
actually walk that talk there's a deep appreciation now of
how challenging it is to be a mature responsible adult
and how rare one's capacities are so if you're a
strategist you're in the top one to five percent of
the population and what you've achieved is remarkable is very
very rare and you're in a unique position now to
be a leader and to help mankind to figure out
all of the stuff that you've figured out and because
you've gone probably through decades of inner work to get
to where you are because you weren't born this way
certainly not and you didn't just learn this in school
you had to teach this to yourself if you got
this far now you can help others to do the
same unlike pluralists strategists have a more realistic sense of
what it takes to actually change old patterns habits and
systems so a lot of times these hippies airy fairy
pluralists they will get some utopian ideas of how to
transform society which will not work because they don't take
into account the actual evolutionary developmental process that most human
psyches have to go through and have not yet gone
through but the strategist can now see that and the
strategist can now manipulate and work with the systems in
such a way that it would it will allow people
to that old idea of moving up the spiral so
this is sort of the spiral wizard idea you're helping
others by meeting them where they're at rather than just
assuming that that they will just buy into your hippie
ideas i know that i heard a news report a
few years ago some years ago probably five or more
years ago where you know some hippie lady wanted to
fly to uh syria and iraq this was right in
the middle of the sort of the heyday of isis
and beheadings and so forth she wanted to to fly
there and to like to present her hippie ideas to
them of peace and love and all this without realizing
that these these these um these people in syria you
know these warlords in syria and iraq they're not going
to care about your ideas of hippie love and so
forth they will kill you they will behead you if
you let them so you know don't don't think that
they're gonna like sit there in a drum circle with
you that works with your hippie friends in san francisco
uh or in austin texas or wherever in california um
but it's not gonna work in syria and iraq and
the pluralist doesn't understand that but the strategist does so
the strategist plans for that and so in this sense
the strategy is a bit more grounded and realistic with
their especially with their political ideas the strategist wants to
hone oneself as an instrument of change you see because
you appreciate that to be able to lead mankind towards
those ambitious visions that you have you need to work
a lot on yourself because you realize that i'm not
good enough to do it yet the strategist is very
painfully aware of his or her own foibles and underdeveloped
shadow aspects because you know the strategy is not perfect
but the strategist is uniquely aware of his own imperfections
which is a great thing that doesn't mean you fix
them all but at least it means that you're aware
enough to be sort of humble about it and also
to have a sort of a plan and to see
the importance of fixing that stuff in the future see
like for example for me i know that if i
want to lead people to amazing things that i know
are possible for mankind in the future i need to
work so much on myself and that's what i spent
like the last five years doing i could have poured
all this time and money into my business to earn
more money to put out more juicy you know click-baity
videos and so forth i would have had double the
subscribers that i have now if i did that but
i made a deliberate choice to actually solidify my content
and really work on myself understanding this content deeply for
myself such that when i speak and teach that it's
coming from a from a deep personal understanding of this
stuff rather than just stuff that i read in books
and just regurgitating you know beliefs that i found elsewhere
and so forth because i need to be able to
actually embody this stuff otherwise the work is going to
be phony and then it's not going to be able
to serve people properly see the best way that i
can serve you is to fully embody the things that
i say and i say a lot more than i'm
able to embody so sometimes people get the wrong idea
that just because i talk about something that i'm able
to perfectly embody it that's not the case at all
first you have to be able to understand it and
articulate it then it'll take you years and decades to
fully live into it actualize it embody it so i
work on that a lot behind the scenes you don't
really see me struggling through it but i do i
struggle through it every day and i'm painfully aware of
of all of my inadequacies some you know people like
to criticize me so much i've heard thousands of comments
over the years of people criticizing me and telling me
things uh that they think i don't know about myself
it's like oh lee you're being arrogant and you're doing
this and you're being you're doing this there and oh
you're being self-biased here it's like yeah i'm already aware
of all that so first you have to become aware
of it that's a big step then the next big
step of course is resolving the stuff you're aware of
and then changing it that's even harder so you know
i'm slowly chipping away at it there's a lot of
work left to do but yeah it can be very
painful to become aware of all of your own inadequacies
um i don't just mean like inadequacies in the sense
that like oh um i'm not good looking enough i
don't look alpha enough i don't have big enough muscles
like these sorts of these are the issues that a
conventional you know achiever mind might be concerned with but
at this strategist level the mind is more concerned of
the sort of deeper existential inadequacies psychological inadequacies that one
has because now you're not you're not worried about having
big muscles or something or attracting girls at this stage
you're more concerned about how do i help mankind and
you're very aware of how limited you are in that
and you're aware of how much work mankind's needs how
much help they need but also at the same time
you're aware of how much help you need but also
you're aware of how much help you've already given yourself
through you know decades of inner work and self-actualization and
so forth and you're aware how challenging that is but
you're also aware of how amazing it is and you're
trying to guide people towards it and so it's just
it's just it's a complicated thing and you're aware of
also how complicated all this is and that it can't
be you know there's no simple solutions that you can
just give to people that will solve all this you're
aware that this this is a maturation process that is
uh it's tricky it's challenging there's so many traps there's
so many ways to go wrong but on the other
hand it's so valuable the strongest motivation for strategists is
wanting to help others to evolve strategists oftentimes are people
like humanists developmental psychologists coaches consultants thought leaders and conscious
executives strategists makes very good coaches a lot of life
coaches are at this stage uh business at the strategist
stage now involves taking into account not just profits it's
not just about maximizing profits like it was for achievers
now it's about taking into account tangible and intangible outcomes
so profits are still important but also now intangible outcomes
are important the physical and mental health of the staff
is important the aesthetic work environment is important work-life balance
is important and serving the community is important and serving
mankind and the globe is important the ecology is important
so all these complex factors now come into play when
you're doing business rather than just maximizing profits see if
i ran actualize that org purely to maximize profits i
would have hired a couple of marketing guys a long
time ago and actualize.org i could milk this for for
millions i could milk it for millions i'm not kidding
you um but i just don't care to do that
like it isn't it gives me no satisfaction in fact
it would it would break my heart to do that
to my own business to run it in such a
profiteering way so i lose probably 80 percent of all
the monetization potential of actualize.org i just i just literally
throw it away it's like burning money literally i'm i've
probably burned a few million dollars in potential earnings over
the last five years simply because i just refused to
like i refuse to sell merch i refuse to do
to run sponsorships or ads inside of the videos there's
ads at the start of the video but you know
those are just like standard youtube ads um like i
could really squeeze this thing if i wanted to but
i don't because it's just my interest is not in
that i don't care about that what i care about
is uh developing myself and then helping others to develop
and to understand the deepest aspects of reality and to
me the money is is just there and it's nice
i don't get me wrong i'm not complaining about the
money i earn i i earn decent money from from
my work i'm quite satisfied with it but um but
sometimes i do wonder like man what if i just
go back to milking you know what if i just
go profiteering and milking you know i could buy myself
like a much better house and drive a much better
car and all this sort of stuff not that i
i couldn't it's just like uh you know i could
buy myself a nice car today but it's like i
don't i don't want to it like it gives me
no no satisfaction to do that to me driving a
a twenty thousand dollar car versus a hundred thousand dollar
car adds nothing to my life like nothing nothing it's
a joke when i see people like you know picking
out expensive cars it's a joke to me because to
me it just looks like they're just wasting their life
even the time you spend looking at fancy cars it
to me is just a waste of life but hey
you know that's just me you might have a different
point of view maybe you'll get there someday maybe someday
you'll see it as i do or maybe not i'm
not saying there's anything wrong with liking fast cars or
something i mean you can like it it's fine you
can have your you know your hobbies and so forth
but also stuff will fall away as you become more
conscious and more developed strategists do have an attachment to
others transforming themselves i'm certainly guilty of that uh you
can be a little bit too attached to having others
transform when they are not yet ready to transform not
everyone is ready to transform i had to sort of
learn that the hard way when i first started actualize.org
i sort of was very aggressive with my you know
pushing others to transform nowadays i'm a little more laid
back and if i see that a person is close-minded
or unwilling to to understand something if they're too argumentative
i'm not going to argue with them i'm not going
to try to open their mind i'm just going to
let them bask in their own ignorance and and then
they'll they'll either come around or maybe they won't and
that's not on me that's on them where before i
was placing that burden on me to change them it's
really not my job to change anybody and so in
this sense i become more detached but still there's some
attachments of course left developmental thinking is now an aspect
of cognition for the strategist strategist takes into account how
the self and others evolve strategists are convinced that higher
development is always better and should be fostered at all
costs sort of just what i talked about that can
be problematic if you take that too seriously um yes
overall we want people to develop but we have to
recognize that most people actually aren't ready to develop most
people aren't ready for these videos most people aren't ready
for spiral dynamics most people aren't ready for reading a
90 page paper on ego development most people aren't ready
for awakening or enlightenment most people are just barely struggling
to maintain their job and to pay their bills that's
just where we're at developmentally as a species it doesn't
mean we have to stay there but that's just kind
of where we're at for the strategist every individual is
now responsible for finding his or her unique style and
actualizing themselves strategists are interested in psychological questions they now
recognize natural hierarchies where before the pluralist didn't like hierarchies
the strategist understands that hierarchies do serve an important function
some of them can be oppressive hierarchies but other hierarchies
can be healthy necessary and getting rid of them would
actually lead to chaos and to dysfunction and to worse
outcomes for all people so we have to tune our
hierarchies and of course get rid of the ones that
are antiquated or oppressive but a hierarchy is not inherently
oppressive all the time in this sense jordan peterson does
have a valid point but again he over exaggerates it
as well um the strategist believes that all human beings
deserve respect but not all are equally suited to doing
a task and not all opinions are equally valid some
opinions are really bad opinions some opinions will lead to
chaos into disaster and therefore they shouldn't be taken seriously
some opinions are highly delusional and self-deceptive whereas others are
less so and in this way we can sort the
good ones from the bad ones understanding while we're doing
that that good and bad here is not objective it's
still relative it's still perspectival um it's still not an
absolute in any sense but still relative to the domain
of survival we can make some distinctions and evaluations as
to what is workable what is good and what is
bad to the strategist life is seen as an open-ended
journey of never-ending growth and self-actualization strategists are very aware
of self-bias and they take it into account and they
correct for it as much as they can although that
doesn't mean they're perfect the strategist tends to find ordinary
constraints of life stultifying such as making a living and
working a eight-hour workday the strategist sees oneself as destined
for greater tasks far with far-reaching impact strategists are aware
of the performative contradiction of postmodernism what is that the
performative contradiction of post-modernism is this idea that all world
views are subjective and that none should be privileged over
any other but then that itself becomes the privileged position
that you shouldn't privilege any other positions but you're privileging
your own position by saying other positions shouldn't be privileged
and so in this sense you're you're you're creating um
you're not being fully self-aware so the strategist is able
to overcome that this this performative contradiction is is a
feature of pluralism that we discussed there's an even greater
increase of tolerance and appreciation of paradox at this stage
uh strategists become very aware of how influences within systems
are circular cyclical tapestry-like and very counter-intuitive this is part
of systems thinking go check out my episode called intro
to systems thinking for more about the counter-intuitive and cyclical
nature of systems and the strategist is starting to understand
circular causality and what i call strange loops or what
douglas hofstadter to give him credit calls strange loops go
see my episode reality the strange loop for more on
that the strategist spends even less time and energy defending
one's positions which a lot of the lower stages waste
a lot of energy doing uh inner processes become fascinating
complex and demanding to explore for the strategist the strategist
needs a lot of privacy and time for self-reflection here
the self is constantly experienced as tr as in transformation
and it's constantly being reappraised so there's no static self
anymore the self is always growing always transforming and you're
always wondering like well what should the self become tomorrow
or next year and here it's not about just acquiring
more money it's about how am i actually going to
change my mental models how am i going to change
the way i interpret the world how do i change
the ways in which i relate to the world this
sort of a meta you're doing now personal development on
sort of a very abstract psychological meta level rather than
in the earlier stages where your personal development revolved around
going to the gym and seeing how much you can
bench press and you know buying more expensive cars and
you know profiteering and squeezing more money out of your
business that's what self-development looked like at the achiever stage
the strategist takes responsibility for regulating one's thoughts feelings and
behavior even more so than the pluralist the strategist holds
that chances for self-actualization and self-fulfillment are essential for meaningful
existence there's deeper life purpose and legacy issues life purpose
becomes central to the strategist the strategist starts to acknowledge
and re-own shadow parts of itself that it spent its
entire lifetime denying the strategist tries very hard to keep
one's act together and to come across as reasonable mature
and self-aware to set a good example for others to
lead by example the strategist tends to present oneself as
an exemplar of humanity giving off a whiff of superiority
i'm certainly guilty of that yeah i'm guilty of a
lot of these strategist issues strategist has a very deep
understanding of human nature but it comes with a trap
of self-inflation you start to understand human nature so well
that you get become cocky and you start to now
get sort of a false sense of understanding you start
to think well now i understand everything now i truly
understand everything before i thought i understood everything but now
once i start to understand a little bit of self-bias
and self-deception i start to see it in me i
start to you know integrate different shadow parts of myself
and so on uh now i'm really actualized you start
to think and you start to get a little um
a little cocky and arrogant about that of course i'm
very well aware that i do that uh i'm working
on reducing that i think i've reduced it quite a
bit in the last few years uh but i still
got more work to do for sure so you guys
aren't telling me anything new when you tell me that
then i'm being arrogant i i know that i know
that uh but part of the reason i do it
is just because i do it as a form of
entertainment self-entertainment hopefully it entertains you as well sometimes i
do it just kind of tongue-in-cheek i be i'm like
sometimes i'm so over the top arrogant that i'm hoping
that you can see that i'm being like over the
top arrogant without explicitly saying it so that it's kind
of like a joke but also sometimes i truly am
arrogant so i know that with a strategist strong positive
and negative feelings can both be acknowledged within oneself so
the previous stages tended to deny negative feelings as like
bad stuff that we have to medicate our way out
of or to escape from whereas now the higher you
go at this stage you you become just more mindful
of the negative feelings and you start to kind of
i aikido them uh do sort of a jujitsu move
on them where you take the negative feelings and you
kind of find the positive in them or you you
fully feel them feel into them and then that transforms
their negativity and it's sort of like a a healthier
coping strategy self and others uh are accepted as complex
human beings with both positive and problematic traits and weaknesses
so nobody is good or bad nobody is satanic or
demonic or evil uh there's always trade-offs within personalities people
who are very strong in one thing tend to be
weak in other areas and that's just part of being
human and you have to accept that about yourself as
well you're not going to be this perfectly strong perfectly
uh well-rounded human as you imagine maybe in previous stages
you could be here you start to accept that you're
not going to be like that it's always a never-ending
process of slowly polishing yourself up but you're always going
to have some rough edges the sort of idea that
you will reach an end to self-actualization this starts to
go away there's never an end it's endless one of
the traps here for the strategist is identification as a
transformer you can identify as being this self-actualizing person and
that just becomes a new ego so you have to
be careful with that strategists can show impatience with slow
development of others certainly guilty of that to a degree
um there's a discovery at this stage of non-possessive love
that's a cool thing there's an increase in benevolence and
compassion towards oneself and others there's a recognition of subtle
distinctions in feelings and emotions so you're really starting to
make subtle distinctions now between different emotions and feelings that
you have you're able to feel into them and to
distinguish them and to kind of uh understand the message
that they're trying to communicate to you rather than just
being at the receiving end of them rather than just
being reactive against them the way that most people are
strategists tend to place high value on authenticity your life
becomes all about becoming more and more authentic how you
walk how you speak how you relate to people how
you do business how you make love how you make
money it's all about making those things more authentic to
your true self the strategist makes use of dreams fantasy
imagination and vision much more so than previous stages that's
powerful so your repertoire or your toolbox of ex of
what you can use to explore reality and your own
self expands dramatically at these post-conventional stages the strategist seeks
solutions to large-scale and long-term problems problems that plague mankind
so it's not just about earning a profit for me
if i'm going to build a business my business has
to somehow fix large long-term problems of mankind strategists seek
sustainable solutions that address deep root causes so we're not
just interested in some little surface level fix we want
to go deep into the root of an issue and
nip it at the bud so to speak or at
the root even better than the bud nip it at
the root the strategist is really able to think outside
the box the strategist stops using blaming as a defense
in relationships that's big notice how much you blame your
girlfriend or boyfriend or spouse for all the stuff that
goes wrong in your relationship and then imagine living a
kind of existence where you no longer blamed them for
the things that go wrong that's what starts to happen
here there's a deep concern for the well-being of future
generations strategist is going to be thinking generationally into the
future it's not just about my own lifetime it's about
future generations of humans and how they're going to live
and what's going to be good for them and what
we need to build what kind of infrastructure and systems
we need to create for them uh the strategist sacrifices
oneself for the greater good the strategist uh still has
difficulty accepting what is they're not fully enlightened so to
speak uh they still struggle with with difficult emotions and
difficult problems in life that occur their spiritual goal at
this point becomes to become enlightened these strategists tend to
be charismatic moral leaders who inspire others to follow their
great vision of an ideal world order for future generations
sort of exactly what i'm doing with actualize.org uh strategists
are able to forgive oneself leaving behind guilt and harsh
self-criticism see my episode how to forgive anyone who's ever
hurt you and then you can also apply that to
your own self as well how to forgive yourself strategists
tend to shift their humor to one that is non-hostile
and more existential their humor becomes more lighthearted and directed
at the folly of mankind rather than weaponized the lower
stages will weaponize humor against their enemies whereas now as
a strategist you realize i don't have any enemies and
so my humor just becomes about the human condition overall
that's still something i'm working on that existential humor ain't
got to work on that one um sometimes i do
still weaponize my humor and i'm trying to let that
go because you you realize that weapon using humor as
a weapon is another defense mechanism of the ego the
ego can lash out that way can gain a sort
of upper hand can make itself feel righteous by doing
that so that's something you have to unlearn and you've
probably spent decades learning that bad habit of weaponizing humor
at the lower stages the strategist is dissatisfied with life
when he or she feels that he's failed to live
up to his unique human promise and to one's own
vision of being an actualized self and what one expects
of oneself that's that's definitely something that i've experienced a
lot uh yeah that's one of the greatest pains maybe
of this stage is that you know your potential so
well but then actually actualizing that potential is so challenging
that it can become depressing or very frustrating because you're
sort of constantly dissatisfied because you're trying to become more
and more and more of yourself but you realize it's
endless where does it ever end you can't just sit
peacefully the way you can in some meditative pose the
way a yogi does at this stage yet strategists can
face the problem that they feel like they've lost their
sense of purpose after they retire because they're no longer
needed because they've invested a lot of their time and
energy into coaching and menting mentoring others helping others guiding
mankind but then once you retire you've lost all that
for a strategist they're able to have realistic appraisals of
situations unclouded by dogma and personal biases that's one of
the benefits of really understanding how bias works self bias
see my episode itself on self bias very important one
if you can really master understanding your own self biases
the net result of that why you want to do
that is that then you get an unclouded view of
reality which is quite nice unclouded by ego smog as
it's called david bohm called it ego smog the cloud
of egos mock strategists tend to become visionary leaders with
the capacity to see how systems interrelate and their long-term
implications the chief anxiety at this stage is not to
fulfill one's personal potential not to self-actualize failure to live
up to one's universal principles and a loss of courage
because one's vision and one's projects are so ambitious and
in a sense you're going against the grain of society
so it takes a lot of courage it takes a
lot of personal uh willpower and responsibility to to live
up and to actualize one's one's vision at this point
and lastly the strategist uses differentiated psychological vocabulary so very
sophisticated psychological vocabulary when speaking about people society cultures reality
spirituality and so forth and so there you go that's
the strategist now that's it for part two stay tuned
next week i will be releasing part three where we
will be talking about the rarest two most advanced stages
the construct aware and finally the unitive stage this is
really what we've been working up to i mean this
episode we just did for the majority of you honestly
this is the stuff you got to work on right
here what i just talked about these two stages the
pluralist and the strategist if you can master these two
you're going to experience a complete change in your reality
and then that's going to set you up for what
we're going to be talking about in part three and
if you can reach those stages that's really where life
becomes incredible that's where you start to tap into something
superhuman something transhuman which you couldn't even imagine was possible
when you began this whole journey but for the majority
of you what i just talked about this part two
keep re-watching it keep studying it read these sections in
the in the paper from suzanne cook greuter go actually
print out that paper don't just download it as a
pdf you have to actually print it out sit down
with a highlighter actually create like a three ring binder
when you print it out hole punch it create a
three-ring binder that's what i did sit there underline it
highlight it take notes on every every page of those
90 pages should be underlined to hell with notes in
the margins and on the backs and fronts of these
papers that you print out and then keep studying and
keep re-reading it every year as you're growing and you
will get more and more juice out of it and
