hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to start a
business okay welcome back so let's talk about how to
start a business really crack into it I'm going to
give you the foundation five years ago I started my
first business I got into small business online business development
and for me that was a huge just like totally
expanded my life totally life-changing experience when you start your
own business and you go from being an employee to
being a self-employed or even an employer if you have
some people working for you and it's a really powerful
experience it's one of the actually best ways to do
personal development so how do you actually go about starting
a business if you consider this then you've also probably
run against a couple of obstacles and we're going to
cover a couple of the key obstacle here key obstacles
here that are probably keeping you from really starting that
business and actually taking action on not just dreaming about
it I think the two biggest obstacles to starting a
business is motivation finding the time and then creating the
capital so let's cover each of those and then actually
I'm going to go in a little bit further and
also talk about marketing and a little bit of the
finances in the marketing aspect of starting a business which
is also very challenging or it can be when you're
starting off so first of all let's talk about motivation
motivation is important because when you start a business you
have nobody else that is driving you but yourself so
you really need to start to work on your motivation
and start to work on your psychology in fact that
is how I got into personal development and that rabbit
hole just ultimately led to where I am here now
five years from now shooting these videos and studying all
this stuff but eventually it started just very simply I
wanted more motivation to run my business the key thing
when starting a business you got to ask yourself why
do you really want this business what is it and
I would encourage you to find something within yourself that
this business really serves on a deep level this should
not be about simply money this should not be simply
about freedom from having a boss or freedom from having
to go to work and sitting meetings or just sit
around at home in your robe and work on your
own schedule that's not a sufficient enough motivation to really
drive your business your business should be about having impact
on the world in some sort of positive way and
your business should be about something that you're deeply deeply
interested in something that's very meaningful to you do not
make the same mistake that I made do not just
start a business that earns you money this is a
really really big trap because what's going to happen is
that even if you start that business and it becomes
successful even if you are able to do that and
I was the problem is that you're still going to
feel hollow inside it's going to be a hollow victory
and what's going to happen is that eventually you're gonna
have to drop that business and because you're not your
soul is not gonna be able to take it you're
going to feel like your soul is getting sucked out
of you until eventually you're going to come to the
hard decision to drop that business that's going to be
very painful once you do that you're going to be
back to where you are right now which is starting
the next business that is now actually going to be
living up to your true values to what's meaningful to
you so really consider before you start what is meaningful
and if you have some idea right now that you
think might earn you some money or is a good
business opportunity ask yourself is that really what is important
is starting an internet affiliate marketing business really something that
fulfills my soul is you know selling get-rich-quick products really
something it's going to fulfill my soul is starting that
that restaurant really something is going to fulfill my soul
or is there something more is there something else think
about that find something that is really you that will
make your life so much easier when you start a
business okay next is creating the time starting a business
and running a business and especially launching it those first
few years take so much of your emotional will or
it takes so much of your concentration so much of
your energy and quite literally time it takes time it's
very difficult to start a successful business even a little
business just a one-man shop it's really difficult to start
that and to make it big and successful by just
putting in a couple of hours every weekend it's really
hard and I mean I started I started that way
because I was working a nine-to-five job and I couldn't
I didn't have the financial luxury to quit my job
at that time and just work on my business full-time
so my only option was to do this on my
nights and on my weekends and it was painful it
was hard because I was basically kind of working two
jobs as working my nine-to-five and then also killing it
at home with a business on my spare time so
I didn't really have any other life didn't have a
relationship didn't have really any hobbies I was focused on
all the time was taken out and that's kind of
how it is when you start your business the first
few years is that it does suck up a lot
of your time and you're probably going to have to
be unbalanced in your life those first few years when
you start your business because well you only got so
much time and you got to prioritize stuff so the
the idea here is that you got to really think
long term and and ask yourself what is the payoff
going to be because I could see for myself clearly
five years ago that I could sacrifice the energy that
needs to be put out in the time work really
hard for a couple of years that will really set
me up and open up a lot of opportunities for
me in the future and it has the opportunities that
have opened up to me and the amount of free
time that I'm available now after my business is up
and running smoothly is has really transformed the quality of
my life in ways that I cannot even relate to
you in a single video so it's just it's incredibly
powerful and you got it you got to ask yourself
is it worth it is it going to be worth
it to invest a little bit of time right now
extra time work extra hard kind of kill yourself really
drain all your energy into this baby that you're creating
but then that baby is going to be supporting you
it's going to be supporting you for the rest of
your life it's going to give you certain dividends and
payoffs not just money but more importantly fulfillment freedom to
do other things so you have to you have to
kind of trick yourself and get yourself motivated in this
way and then you have to actually find that time
how do you find a time to start a business
well like I said if you're working at 9:00 to
5:00 and you have to for financial reasons keep doing
that it's not smart to cut off your job and
not have any means of support probably will get you
into trouble so keep doing that and start finding ways
to generate more time weekends holidays take your vacation time
off and use it to build your business how about
finding a way to maybe downsize the amount of time
that you're putting into work maybe you can start to
work part time maybe that will work for you maybe
you can just start to take one day off of
work every week and that will work for you you
know see what's possible for you and if all you
can do is just work on your weekends then that's
all you can do and so just start there it'll
take you longer to get it up and running but
you know at least at least you're doing something it's
better than sitting back and doing nothing don't be a
victim of the fact that you don't have the time
you have the time you just have to shift your
priorities around a little bit okay next point is capital
starting a business this is probably one of the biggest
obstacles that people have is something that requires capital or
at least a lot of businesses do and you might
have some idea for some invention that you want to
launch a book that you want to write and then
market properly a website you want to build some sort
of organization you want to create some sort of product
you want design and manufactured that you just realize you
don't have the capital for you know to design a
product manufacture it and then sell it might cost you
several million dollars to write that novel that you want
to write might require two years of research and and
study and then also time just sitting down and writing
the novel and so time equates to capital capital might
be required to hire some employees in order to do
whatever needs to be done for your business capital might
be required to run an organization capital might be required
to market your service and your product even if you've
already got a product and service that really doesn't mean
you have a business because you have not marketed yet
so the capital question well now is an amazing amazing
time in history because we've got the internet and we
had a lot of options for how to run businesses
and market businesses and totally free or low-cost ways when
I started my business I invested about $2,000 cash and
that's about all that I invested in it after that
everything else came from the profits as a Bennett that
the business generated so I took profits from the business
channeled it back into the business and use that to
build it up and basically that's called bootstrapping so that
would be my idea for you is start to bootstrap
a lot of ideas can be bootstrapped nowadays so that
is kind of an art and science in and of
itself and you have to you have to be clever
you have to be resourceful when you start when you're
a bootstrapping a business you have to start to look
for little shortcuts little free avenues of publicity cheap ways
to get services or products created or maybe just using
your own time as the chief vehicle and the chief
source of capital because your own time can be considered
free in a sense if you've got it you can
invest it in your product or your business and then
generate a lot of capital as long as you're investing
it smartly so it's finding out where your time can
actually generate the most quality product or service that is
the key there to bootstrapping a business but also you
know if you're not going to be able to bootstrap
your business and there's something that you really want but
you can't quite bootstrap then what you got to do
is you got to start saving up for it saving
up for it or look for investors look for ways
to convince people of investing in you there's venture capital
out there there's programs like Kickstarter or if you've got
a good idea you can post it on there maybe
people will contribute to your cause there are just angel
investors out there you can go find and there's a
whole art involved with being able to find angel investors
people to invest in your idea so that is out
there and you can also just save up money perhaps
you just want to work for the next couple of
years and you're working on a decent job that's paying
you extra more than what you're putting away or spend
on yourself and supporting your family for your you know
storing some of that away in a nest egg and
hopefully if you've got that savings and it's building up
then maybe you can calculate that two or three years
down the road you can have enough to go start
that that brick-and-mortar business maybe that you want to start
that actually takes more money and you can't really easily
bootstrap a brick-and-mortar business because there's just too much investment
upfront so all of those are options and you have
to really start to think about what is going to
work for you and you're going to have to really
deal with this issue of lack of capital all right
the next point is once you think about these issues
of what you're really interested in where you're going to
get the time how are you going to generate the
capital the next thing is to really start to do
research you just start to do a lot of research
start reading about the market segment that you want to
go into start reading about the niche start reading about
how business works how start reading about marketing and specifically
in those areas that you want to apply it in
start reading and doing a lot of research start to
understand who your potential audience is who your customers will
be and start to interview them if you can ideally
ask questions try to understand their psychology understand what it
is that they really want what are their desires what
are their biggest frustrations and biggest problems when you understand
that about an audience base your potential customer base that
is so so powerful because then you can use that
to optimize your product and your service in your marketing
to laser target that person to basically find and solve
that person's problem as efficiently as possible and when you
do that that puts you above the rest of the
competition who usually does not do a very good job
of understanding the audience's needs and desires and so their
product or service doesn't quite match up to it so
the best way for you to compete is to do
this research because the research is usually not something that
requires a lot of money it's just time time investment
on you and critical thinking skills do the research understand
your audience survey them question them really get to know
them and then craft something unique that really fits what
they want it's exactly what they want targets them so
that they are really interested in behind that product what
is critical when you're starting a business is to really
understand what is going to sell marketability especially when you're
bootstrapping because when you're bootstrapping you basically need the business
to start to pay for itself as soon as possible
and for that to happen you really need to make
sure that you've got something that people are willing to
buy you don't have years to sit and wait for
the product to catch on you don't have years to
sit and wait and to let your huge advertising budget
which some of these you know multinational global corporations have
like Microsoft or Google or Apple you don't have all
this marketing power and all these this huge bankroll to
to just sit and wait for a product to become
successful over a long period of time when you're bootstrap
you need something to be a hit right off the
bat and to do that you need to start to
really understand your audience and create something that they're going
to really really love and one of the keys to
doing that is to do an iterative type of business
model where you are you're really going out there and
you're not even creating a full-fledged product or service you're
just testing the waters and you're just seeing what could
potentially work and you're doing a little little proofs of
concept so if you've got if you've got some sort
of website that you want to create you put that
website up and you just see our people interested in
it you put up the most bare-bones version of that
website you don't build it this gigantic ginormous project that
takes you three years to create because that's too much
investment of time and capital and that might fail what
you do is you create something small something within a
month you put it out there you just see there's
even one or two people like it just test out
the waters the same thing with any part of business
you got to go out there and you got to
get a test case a proof of concept with feedback
that tells you that it's working and that this is
something that people are interested in and will pay money
for as soon as possible I think this is the
biggest pitfall with starting a business is just saying that
I'm all in and I don't care what the market
says going in they're not paying attention to the market
spending all your time and investment creating this beautiful product
dispute aful service and then finding out that the market
doesn't want it or it doesn't rate resonate with the
market or that marketing it would would be more than
your resources right now allow for so this is a
big big big pitfall if you're starting a business I
think the biggest takeaway is to go out there and
start doing these little tests well you'll also learn in
doing these little tests is you'll start to learn about
the market this is actually the best way to do
research is to throw stuff out there and see is
it hitting where is it not hitting where is it
not working then polishing it up and then throwing something
else out of the market and see how is that
resonating how is that hitting and then polishing up again
and then do another run where you're gonna find is
that this process of trial and error is going to
lead to your perfect niche and that perfect niche is
where you going to get your success your results and
your business is going to skyrocket it's going to be
profitable and everything's going to go well for you but
right now you're still in the early phases and you
got to start doing a little bit of this research
doing a little bit of this testing and you can
start to do that just on your time off on
the weekends little tests here and there to start to
see which direction you want your business to go in
all right so that is how to start a business
a lot more ideas that I can throw out here
