Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about the single most important
tool for sages, which is contemplation. A while back, I
released an episode about becoming a sage, and how that
is sort of the ultimate most advanced mission for actualized
how to work and what I really want to help
you to do. If you really want to take your
life to the highest level possible, I suggested that you
create a vision for yourself to become a sage, and
I talked about what being a sage is, well, fulfilling
on that vision. And on that promise. I mean, we
have been with all the episodes that have been coming
out. But specifically what I want to talk about is
the defining characteristic of a sage. And that is his
or her ability to really get a core of nature
at the core of reality. And how does the sage
do that? Through this process called contemplation, and specifically what
I want to focus on here, because contemplation is a
pretty deep topic, I want to focus on the single
most important question that a sage needs to use when
he's contemplating. And that question is, what is it? What
is it? Do not underestimate the power of this question,
this question right here. If you understand the full ramifications
that it can have on your life, wow, it could
completely transform the way that you live your life and
the way that you understand what reality is, there's a
lot more depth to it than would initially appear. So
what do I mean by what is it? Well, what
is color? For example? Or what is happiness? Or what
is success? Or what is space? Or what is science?
Or what are emotions? These are just a few examples
of what I mean by this very versatile question of
what is it? You replace the it with whatever object
or thing that you want to inquire about? And then
you get to work contemplating. Speaking of which, we should
ask ourselves the question right now, what is contemplation? You
see, we can apply this question to anything in life,
including to contemplation itself. So if you don't know what
contemplation is, you could what you could contemplate what contemplation
is. And you could ask yourself, well, what is it?
What is it really? What is it about? And then
see what your mind comes up with your mind to
come up with some interesting ideas. From the dictionary, though,
we look it up in the Merriam Webster Dictionary, they
say they have a couple of different ways of thinking
about contemplation. I was actually very surprised when I looked
this up, because the very first definition they have is,
quote, to concentrate on spiritual things as a form of
private devotion. Interesting, very interest. That was the first definition.
But they had more they said, secondly, a state of
mystical awareness. Hmm, that's very interesting. What does contemplation have
to do with spirituality and mysticism? We'll get to that
later in the episode. But also they have more mundane
definitions, the ones that you probably think of when you
think of contemplation, things like an act of considering with
attention, or the act of regarding steadily, or the act
of thinking deeply about something. So that would be the
more prosaic understanding of contemplation. So you have this more
prosaic understanding, which basically just means thinking about something steadily.
And then you have the more mystical existential version of
it's like getting to some sort of spiritual reality, and
even like a mystical state of awareness. That's very interesting.
What's the connection between these two? We'll get to that.
The way that I would basically defined contemplation though, is
I would say that it's openly pondering a question that
you are interested in, with focus and without bias, in
order to inquire into the nature of that thing, the
truth of it, or the very essence of what it
is. That's how I would define contemplation. How do you
contemplate it's very simple, you basically sit down and relax,
set aside some time and you select one question that
you are Have curious about, and you have to genuinely
be curious about it. Define what that question is, and
then sit there and just openly ponder that thing from
ground zero. And now it's very important that you do
it from Ground Zero, not based on what you read
in a book or what someone's told you or what
you might want this thing to be. Because otherwise, you're
going to go into hearsay and fantasy, hearsay and fantasy
is not contemplation. And then you just maintain that focus,
steadily questioning and questioning and questioning and just kind of
probing into the matter, whatever it is, for at least
five or 10 minutes straight without getting distracted and monkey
mind or other considerations or other questions. And if you
do that, you're basically contemplating that's contemplation in Nutshell. Now
there's a lot more that I could say to it,
I could give you a lot of different tips and
advice and different components to contemplation, we can start to
split hairs about what is and what isn't contemplation, how
it differs from meditation, and we'll talk about some of
that. But first what I want to do is I
want to show you the versatility and just how much
ground there is to cover with contemplation. Because it might
seem like oh, well, contemplation, yeah, okay, it sounds like
an interesting technique. But is there really that much stuff
to contemplate? I mean, Leo, what am I going to
contemplate in my life? Well, I'm glad you asked. Let
me give you a long list of examples. You might
be surprised by how much stuff there is. Here we
go. What is society? What is life? What is color,
what is sound? What is love? What is happiness? What

What is discipline? What is freedom? What is courage? What
is passion? What is skepticism? What is atheism? What is
prayer? What is open mindedness? What is terrorism? What is
intuition? What is beauty? What is surprise, what is information?
That's a pretty long list of stuff. And that's just
the beginning. You could keep going and going with that
list. Literally, what I want you to get is that
literally in every domain of life, at every level, whether
it's your career, your family, your relationships, your personal life,
or existential questions about the nature of reality, or scientific
questions, philosophical questions, artistic questions, it doesn't end, you can
keep asking what all this stuff is. You see, you
might be surprised that you never actually sat down and
really pondered any of this stuff. A lot of these
questions and things are just taken as elemental, and basic
and just given, we take them for granted. Like, have
you ever sat down? And honestly ask yourself, like, what
is science? What actually, is it? Not what did they
teach you in school about science? But what actually is
the process of science? Or how do you ask yourself,
what is society? Like what actually is society? I mean,
yeah, you're a part of society. But that doesn't mean
you understand what society is, essentially, what it's about what
its purpose is. Can you see how this one question,
what is the what is it question? If you actually
sat down and deeply contemplated each one of these hundreds
of questions that I gave you with this example? With
all these examples, right? Can you see how much more
depth of understanding you would have about reality? Most people
never ever do this. They don't live a contemplative life.
Because they just assume that oh, well, we already know
that stuff. So it's not worth wasting my time pondering
about it very deeply. And they turn out to be
very wrong in that there's something very deep that they
miss. You could contemplate existential questions, you could contemplate questions
for your career or your profession. Like let's say you're
an artist. There's a lot of different stuff within art
that you could contemplate and contemplate what color is what
form is what, what your particular medium is, if you're
a painter, what is painting? What is paint? What makes
good art? What makes bad art, all these things you
can contemplate? Why does art exist? See, how is art
differ from science. And so because you can, you can
ask a lot of questions. And if you're an artist,
and you really want to be successful at that, you're
going to need to go deeper than just learning basic
painting techniques, you're going to want to understand the essence
of what you're doing. Same thing, if you're a scientist,
you're gonna want to question that entire process of science,
and all the tools and distinctions that you make within
science, you're gonna want to question all those to really
get to the root of science, that's going to make
a big difference in how how much depth you get
out of your career. Of course, in your relationships, there's
a lot of questioning you can do about relationships, the
nature of relationships, in your personal life, there's a lot
of questions we can do about your emotions, how you
feel, to understand what each category of emotion is, and
why it's there. Can you see how that might be
useful? Of course, you're a philosopher, then you should be
questioning stuff all the time. That's what defines philosophers as
philosophers are always contemplating about the nature of stuff. So
really this question of what is it? This is a
philosophical question? And if you're philosophically minded, then you've probably
been asking this question in one degree or another, maybe
unconsciously, throughout your life. And the more you ask that
question of things, the more you get to the essence
of stuff. Of course, it's also possible to delude yourself
with a bunch of fantasies. And we'll get to that
in a bit. I'll talk about the dangers of contemplation.
So, hopefully, you can see the potential here and why
this is an important topic. Now, let me give you
an example of how you might contemplate so first you
select a question, such as in this case, let me
select the question like, what is art? Okay. The second
step is I need to be genuinely curious about the
question I need to care about it. It's not enough
just to ask it robotically. I need to really care.
I need to have proper motivation behind it. So let's
say I really care about art like I'm fascinated by
it or I'm an artist. So pertains to my job,
let's say. And then you start to ponder. And you
basically just ask yourself questions. The contemplation is just you
asking yourself questions about this topic over and over again.
And there's about a handful of questions that can get
you to contemplate from slightly different perspectives or slightly different
angles. So the first question is, of course, what is
it? So what is art? And then I might ask
myself that, and then I just kind of like leave
some room open in my mind to get the answer,
my mind will just generate some answers. You know that?
Well, art is like painting, that's an example of art.
And then sculpture is also art. And maybe architecture is
art. And maybe some sort of video mediums are also
considered art, like film might be an art form. Okay,
but then what is that? I mean, is it? Is
Art the actual canvas that it's painted on? Is it
the medium? Or is it something more ethereal? Oh, that's
a good question. Let me contemplate that a little bit
deeper, and see. So you just kind of keep asking
and probing and going deeper and deeper and deeper into
the nature of what this thing is. Another question you
can ask yourself, which is, what is its true nature?
What is its true nature? What is the true nature
of art? Matter? No, maybe it's maybe it's like a
form of expression? Maybe it's communication. But then what is
communication? What is expression? I don't know. Let me contemplate
that a little bit deeper and see what other kinds
of answers I can come up with. So you just
kind of keep, keep going that way. And you come
up with examples. And then as you come up with
examples, you try to find commonalities between the examples. And
you try to see like, Okay, what is it trying
to suss it out? Another question you can ask yourself
is, how did it come into being? How did art
come into being? Hmm, that's interesting. For that one, you
might need to go and actually read some history books,
and study the history of this thing. But you can't
just rely on the history books that can serve as
a sort of background knowledge, then you got to throw
away the history books, you got to come back and
check. Okay, how did art come into being? And really
think about that? Why did it come into being? What
are the elements that make it up so to speak?
What allows art to exist at all? Hmm, that's very
interesting. When I asked this question, I don't so much
mean, like, oh, well, it came into being because some
caveman painted it on a cave one day because he
was bored. I don't mean that. That sort of question.
Maybe you can't even answer because it happened so long
ago that you don't have access to that information. But
what you can answer is you can kind of just
kind of probe like, you know, what are the components
that allow art to exist at all? Human beings have
art, for example, but pigeons? Don't. insects don't have art?
So what is it about human beings that allows us
to create art? Why do we care about art? But
insects don't? That's some interesting stuff to ponder. Another question
you can ask yourself along these lines is, what is
its purpose? What is the purpose of art? Hmm, that's
interesting. Is it done to to motivate people, to inspire
people, maybe it's done to entertain people? Maybe it's done
to communicate something important? Hmm, I have to test all
those theories out against my experience of what art is.
See? And maybe my initial assumptions or theories end up
being wrong. When I keep pondering deeper. Another similar question
is, what is it substance? So what is the substance
of art? Is it a physical thing? Is that what
art? Is it physical? Is it actually made of atoms
and molecules? Is that what art is? Or is art
a sort of like, emergent property? A higher order thing?
Is Art physical? Or is it maybe conceptual and mental?
In nature? Hmm, that's interesting. And then you might want
to go in deeper and ponder what that is. You
know, what's the difference between art like real art made
by by a high quality artist, and just, let's say,
a kid's crayon drawing, which we might not consider art.
What's the difference mean though, isn't so. So you, you
find examples like that, which tend to suss out the
essence of the matter? And then you study that and
you ponder it deeper and deeper and deeper. And the
last question you might want to ask yourself is, what
is it significance? Or why is it important? Like why
do we even care about art? That's interesting. Like, what
would we lose if we didn't have art? What does
it contribute? Why do I care about let's say, if
I'm an artist? Why is it important to me? And
so these are some different angles at which you can
get at this at this issue. Right. But the core
question, the overall theme is you're trying to get to
the bottom of what it is. So that's how you
contemplate and you could sit there. And you can do
that for five minutes. Or you can do it for
hours, hours, and hours and hours. Now, let me talk
about some of the nuances of contemplation. So first, let's
make a distinction between contemplation, meditation, self inquiry, and concentration.
These are all different things, although they can overlap. And
there's some complexity here, which will probably leave you scratching
your head for a while, until you really contemplated the
nature of all these different things. And you've gotten some
experience with them. So first of all, let's distinguish contemplation
from meditation. This is tricky because they can overlap. But
generally, when you meditate, you're trying to sit there and
kind of empty your mind and you don't have any
goal or objective that you're meditating towards, you're just basically
relaxing your mind and freeing yourself of thoughts. And then
maybe if you're doing more advanced forms of meditation, that
you're actually trying to concentrate, your meditation becomes a sort
of a form of concentration, where you're trying to reach
a certain state, like an emotional state, or spiritual state,
or a samadhi experience. Or maybe you're meditating towards enlightened
something like that, or you're doing some form of yoga.
So that's different than contemplation in my mind, contemplation for
me is more a little bit more of an intellectual
activity, you're putting your mind into it, and you're really
pondering and thinking about one very specific thing. Whereas when
you're meditating, you're just using some technique to kind of
relax and quiet the mind. Now, what's tricky about that
is that actually, when you concentrate, I mean, when you
contemplate and you become really good at it, what will
tend to happen is that your contemplation will actually become
a sort of meditation, you're going to go into the
zone with it, your concentration is going to become one
pointed, and you're going to focus so much on the
question that is going to be hard to then distinguish
between what a contemplation is where it begins and where
meditation starts. But that gives you a rough idea. Regarding
self inquiry, self inquiry is basically a form of contemplation.
But it's a very specific one. In self inquiry, you're
specifically concerned with the question of who am I and
what am I? Now you can consider that as contemplation.
But will self inquiry is very specific, because you're really
using that specifically to attain enlightenment. And nothing wrong with
that. That's a good way to contemplate. But I want
to make you aware that there's a lot more stuff
that you can contemplate than merely. Who are you and
what are you, as I mentioned, with all the examples
above, and then there's concentration. The difference between concentration and
contemplation is that when you're concentrating, you can concentrate on
something that has no intellectual question behind it, so to
speak, for example, you can concentrate on a candle flame.
And you can build your concentration skills by concentrating on
a candle flame. But you're not really asking yourself anything
there. You're just sitting there and you're building your mind's
concentration, focusing abilities. And that's a good thing. And I'll
talk about that in the future. How to develop more
of that. But contemplation is different because you're actually really
curious about a question. It's more of a philosophical sort
of endeavor. See? Now another nuance of contemplation is notice
that there can be contemplation done on the personal level,
on one extreme, and then on the existential level on
the other extreme, so think of it as a spectrum.
You have a bunch of these questions that I threw
at you up up above already, on the one level
that you can ask yourself questions personally, like, Hmm, what
should I have for dinner tonight? You could contemplate that.
But that's sort of a shallow question to contemplate. A
more deeper question would be more towards the existential domain,
such as what is life? Oh, that's a little bit
more of a philosophical sort of sagely question. Okay. It's
a little more closer to this end of the spectrum.
And then he wants something very existential, you might ask
yourself, what is existence? And that's about as existential as
it gets, right? Because you're actually asking about what is
everything when you ask that question? So there's a whole
degree of things here. Now, don't get me wrong, though.
Personal questions are still important to contemplate. Now, while something
like you know what am I going to have for
dinner tonight, is pretty shallow and pointless. Something like, what
do I want out of my life? Now, that's a
really good question to contemplate. You should spend many, many
hours contemplating that question, or something like what do I
want out of my relationship? What do I want out
of my marriage? What is my deepest passion in life?
What is my life purpose? How could I actualize my
life purpose? So these I consider important personal questions, right?
It's not frivolous stuff, like, what do I want to
have for dinner? So, there's a lot that you can
do there, a lot of a lot of deep work
can go on there. But also, I want to encourage
you not just to get stuck on yourself and your
own personal stuff, but to go and question some larger
domains of life, like what is art? What is science?
What is logic? What is life? What is love? You
know, these more philosophical questions, I get the sense that
most people do not ponder these at all in their
life. And then their life reflects that. Because if you
haven't pondered these things, you don't know what they are.
You see, you might think you know what art is.
But even if you're successful artists, by pretty much guarantee
that if you haven't spent hours and hours contemplating what
art is, you don't know what it is. What you
have are just beliefs and ideas that you picked up
from culture. And most of those are probably wrong. You
need to actually sit down and do it for yourself.
It's not enough to just read books about it. See?
Now another important nuance of contemplation is that you can
have insights at the level of thought, or at the
level of being. Now this addresses that duality that we
saw in the definition from Webster's Dictionary, you can remember
the first one was something about mysticism and spirituality, well,
contemplation becomes spiritual and mystical. When it goes so deep.
That your answers the answers you get your contemplation are
not at the level of intellect and thought, but you
penetrate past the intellect past the mind, you actually transcend
the mind, and you get at the being level of
things. You actually merge with the thing that you're contemplating.
And your insight is at the level of being, it's
an existential insight. Now, this is tricky. This is not
easy to do. Most people have probably never experienced this
depth of contemplation in their entire life. I have only
experienced it once or twice, to break through the intellectual
level into the being level is very rare. You need
to contemplate for hundreds of hours for that to happen.
This is not going to happen by accident. And it's
not going to happen just by a random five or
10 minutes of contemplating here and there, you need to
be extremely serious about it, which is why it's so
rare. But this is why they have contemplative prayer in
the spiritual traditions, and many of the yogic traditions and
Advaita Vedanta, they talk about contemplation and there they use
contemplation for enlightenment. That's sort of the highest levels of
contemplation is when you break through towards the being level.
And the being level of things is not just who
and what you are, or what existence is. But other
things you can break through to the being level on
what another is, what love is, what God is, and
so forth. So that's really a deeper topic that I'll
go into more in the future, because it's not easy
to do. But at first, you want to start with
just the intellectual level, the intellectual level is still important
to understand. A concept or an idea or a thing
at the intellectual level is still valuable to you, right?
So even if you're going to start contemplating something very
existential, like what is reality, when you first start that
inquiry, it's going to be at the level of intellect.
For a long time, the first 100 hours of the
first 1000 hours of contemplating that question, it's gonna be
a lot of intellect, you're gonna have theories and ideas
and speculations and so forth. And actually, what you need
to do is you need to get past all that
to the being level. But if you're contemplating something like
arts, I'm not sure if you can break through to
the being level of art, but just the intellectual level
will be still valuable to you. Alright, so understand that
there's sort of a spectrum here, depth of insight. And
there's a big difference between just a little bit of
intellectual understanding and then massive, massive, being level understanding and
everything in between. Right, so you want to move your
way that way as you're engaging in this process. Another
nuance of contemplation means that don't confuse it merely with
thinking. Yes, you start it by thinking. But be careful
of thinking of it just as thinking. You want to
also hold open the possibility that you can break through
beyond thinking beyond mind to the being level. Also be
careful with contemplating and just speculating or theorizing about stuff.
It's very easy to sit there just like, oh, well,
yeah, what is God and let me speculate about God,
well, maybe God is this and maybe God has that
and just theories and speculation. That will lead to delusion.
That can be very dangerous and damaging. When you speculate
and theorize for a long period of time, you fall
into the philosophy trap, which is that you sort of
become the armchair philosopher, and you come up with these
very brilliant theories about how the whole world works. But
all these theories, they're just stories, and you're not conscious
that they're just stories. They're very self cohesive stories. But
that's all they are just very elaborate stories. That is
not the proper purpose of contemplation. Or contemplation, it's very
important that you, you really open yourself up, you're very
self honest, and you're very aware of what you're doing.
And you're very aware of the thought process, you want
to make sure that you don't get lost in your
thoughts. That's very easy, lost in your story. See, your
ego is going to distort any contemplative efforts that you
make. Why is that because your ego is largely composed
of your likes and dislikes, your desires, your fears, and
your hatreds in life. So if you start speculating and
theorizing, and coming up with stories and spinning that stuff,
based on what your ego likes and dislikes, you're gonna
fall into some of the classical traps that many philosophers
throughout history have fallen into, right? So you're just going
to be creating justifications for the ego. And that is
not proper contemplation. Because there, you're not really getting the
nature of the thing. You're projecting onto the thing. So
you got to be very careful with how you project
your preconceived notions and opinions on to the things that
you're contemplating. That's extremely tricky. Very, very tricky. And you'll
have to very carefully keep in mind, a lot of
the traps that I have spoken about in prior episodes,
especially the episodes, we're talking about epistemology, you have to
really carefully take into account all those traps because your
mind is the trickiest thing that exists in nature. The
deepest wisdom of humanity comes from contemplation. Not from science,
not from speculating, not from theorizing. But from contemplation. Very
careful, very precise, very rigorous contemplation. It's not easy to
do. And to get to that really deep wisdom takes
many, many hours, we're talking hundreds, 1000s of hours of
contemplation. Most of the spiritual and religious truths, if they
are true, spiritual insights have come through contemplation. Enormous contemplative
efforts were put forth by human beings to acquire that
wisdom. And now wisdom is genuine. It's not something they
made up. It's something that is transcendental. And you can
reach that for yourself if you're really serious. But before
you start to scare yourself off with the magnitude of
such an endeavor, start with the small stuff. What I
would suggest that your life would be enormously benefited by
just some basic, careful pondering into the nature of some
of the most basic stuff that you find in your
life, like, contemplating what is anger? What is happiness? What
is sexuality? What are relationships? What is self discipline, you
know, stuff like that. That'll be very valuable for you
to contemplate. It requires very strong focusing ability to contemplate
to the deepest levels, and that's the thing that holds
most people back. Anybody can contemplate for five or 10
minutes, that's pretty easy, although even that will be challenging
for many people, because we're so distracted these days that
we can't even focus for five minutes. But to be
able to focus for 100 hours straight on one question,
to break through to the being level is that's a
very rare, rare, very rare ability that needs to be
cultivated. You need to take that very seriously. And the
other thing that holds people back with their from the
very deep being level contemplations is that they're just not
radically open minded enough. And you've heard me harping about
radical open mindedness over and over and over again, in
my episodes, especially the the ones we're talking about a
customer ology, and enlightenment. And that's because to break through
to the being level of some of these very profound
truths, like what are you? What is existence? What is
love? What is God to break through to these requires
degrees of open mindedness that you can't, you can't even
fathom how open minded you need to be. And you
will not understand the importance of this until you spend
years, years, literally years contemplating and failing to get to
the being level of things. And then maybe you break
through after five years of trial and error, and only
then will you realize that oh, now I see what
real radical open mindedness was required in order to open
me up to that, to that degree of insight. You
see your paradigms, the problem is that all your existing
paradigms, really lock in your your minds imagination, is not
open to receiving the highest transcendental insights. Because you already
feel like you know, your paradigm already tells you what's
possible, and what's not possible. Of course, most of that
ends up being Baloney, it's just totally false. But you
won't know that until you exit those paradigms. And so
it turns into the sort of catch 22. And you
won't exit those paradigms until you do a lot of
very deep contemplating. Also understand that these questions that I
gave you as examples, you know, like, what is art?
What is science? What is God and so forth? These
questions, you could literally contemplate these questions for years. And
get more and more juice out of them. I sort
of like squeezing a really hard lemon, you could squeeze
that sucker for a long time, and there's always more
juice left inside. And you can always come back for
another squeeze. It's really important that you understand that there
are many levels of facets of understanding even so just
one of these questions, a question like what is art,
you could spend years pondering that question. And looking at
it from all sorts of different levels, all sorts of
different facets will reveal to you as you ponder it
deeper, and deeper and deeper. And as you have more
life experience. And as you as you develop more concentration
ability. As you meditate, as you self inquire, that will
increase your ability to understand what art is, and you
will go deeper and deeper and deeper with it. So
don't just stop at the surface. Most people The problem
is they stop at the surface of questioning. They ask
themselves a question like, Oh, what is science? And I
think about for five seconds, and like, oh, yeah, I
kind of know what science is done. Let's move on
to next one. No, no, what is science? You can,
you could, you could spend an entire eight years of
a doctoral program, studying what science is and still not
get to the bottom of it. Right? So there's so
much to contemplate there. So do not stop. Just because
you feel like oh, yeah, I've contemplated this question for
an hour. And it seems like I got some good
answers. And that's it. No, that's not it at all.
That's just the beginning. And the initial answers that you
get in the first dozen or two dozen hours of
contemplating a question, those are superficial answers. very superficial, and
oftentimes flat out wrong. Flat out opposite of what the
ultimate answers will be. So be careful about that. Another
warning I'll give you is that don't just look up
the answer. That is not contemplation. The point of contemplation
is to derive the answer for yourself. There's something very
valuable in that derivation process. You develop true understanding. You
own the answers and the insights, once they come to
you from that process. It's sort of like learning mathematics.
It's not good enough, you're not going to learn mathematics.
Just by looking up the answers in the back of
your textbook. You need to actually go through the mathematical
proof to understand how the mathematics works. See, so don't
cheat yourself by saying, oh, yeah, what is art? Let
me just go get an art book and let it
tell me what art is. That's not going to work.
Like that's what you've been doing your whole life. In
fact. That's why people don't contemplate anymore. That's why philosophy
is not considered a serious human endeavor anymore. because we
have so much information available to us in the information
age, that you can just go Google it and think
that like, oh, yeah, I got my answer to my
questions from Yahoo Answers, or from Google or from Quora,
or some other stupid social network or whatever. And that's
the answer. No, no, this is why people are so
lost. See, is because they have stopped thinking that contemplation
is important. And they have outsource this. And they think
that oh, yeah, other people can just do it for
me. Well, I mean, why would I need to go
through the hard labor of actually doing this? That means
it's hard work? Why go through all the hard work?
Like Leo, can't you just give me the answers? Why
don't you just shoot a video that gives me all
the answers to all these questions? That wouldn't help you,
you see, because your growth comes from deriving the answer.
And the point of all this contemplating is not to
be a smart aleck. And to say that, Oh, now
I know everything. That's not the point. The point is
to transform yourself. This process will transform you in unimaginable
ways. It's remarkable. Your entire relationship to life will change.
Every object that you contemplate your relationship, that object will
change. You're gonna have genuine insights, ones that you can't
just read in the book. Now you might object and
say, Oh, Leo's are so hard work. Why go to
all this trouble? Do I really need to go off
to all this trouble? Can I just like, find YouTube
videos that will explain all this stuff for me? Well,
how myopic is that? You still don't understand who you
that your number one problem is, life is ignorance. That's
your number one problem in life is ignorance. I don't
care how smart you are, you're still fucking ignorant. At
the bottom of it, you're still basically ignorant. You're as
ignorant as a child. You have a lot of information
and knowledge which was pumped into your mind. But that
does not remove the ignorance that's there. In fact, that
only makes your ignorance deeper, because now you actually have
stopped believing that you're ignorant. That's your number one. Problem
is ignorance. From ignorance stem, all your other problems. You
have depression, you have anger problems, you have relationship problems,
you have career problems, you have money problems. You have
meditation problems, you have problems reaching enlightenment, what is all
that that's all ignorance. That's what that is. Ignorance of
psychology, ignorance of yourself, ignorance of reality, ignorance of relationships,
ignorance of how the world works, how it really works
deep down inside, underneath the illusion. Because life I don't
know if you've noticed, this is a giant, magic show.
Giant magic show filled with illusions, everything you see is
illusions, you're just interacting with things at the surface level,
at the level of illusion. And one of the only
tools you have to break through illusion is contemplation. That's
what allows you to penetrate through the illusion to the
to the truth behind it underneath it. What actually grounds
the magic show. If you don't take this upon yourself,
and you think that you'll just get the answers from
books, or from other people or from your college professor
or something like that. You have no idea what you're
missing. And if you think you know what you'll find,
and therefore, it's not worth contemplating because you think like,
well, it's not worth contemplating. Because I already know the
answer. I already know it's not going to be worthwhile.
No, you don't. You can't know the answer to research
that you haven't done yet. That's the point of research.
Think of contemplation as basically a form of intellectual research,
grounded in your own mental faculties rather than grounded in
grabbing information from some database. And so if your life
sucks, don't be surprised that it sucks. If it sucks,
it's because you're not contemplating. That's why it sucks. The
more you contemplate the less your life will suck. There's
a direct correlation between those two. There is, of course,
that assumes that you know how to contemplate properly. A
lot of people think they're contemplating when they're not really
contemplating. They're rearranging their prejudices. That's a famous quote from
William James, one of the founders of philosophy. I'm not
philosophy but psychology, early fathers of psychology, William James, he
said most people, they think that they're thinking but really,
they're just merely real. arranging their prejudices. That's what you're
doing. A lot of philosophers do this. And that's why
a lot of philosophers is life's suck. Because when you
do true and proper contemplation, it actually improves your life.
It has to because you're discovering truth, the more truth
you discover, and the more you then want to embody
that truth, and then you actually do embody it, the
better your life is, the quality of your life is
directly proportional to how clear you are about what the
truth is, in every particular situation, and how well aligned
you are with that knowledge. That's basically it. The overarching
goal that I want to leave you with is to
live a more contemplative lifestyle. To contemplate effectively, you'd have
to change your life around, you ain't going to be
contemplating effectively. If you're playing fucking the latest video games.
And you're addicted to porn. And you've ever meditated a
day in your life. And you eat garbage food, and
you're busy working a 60 hour job, you ain't gonna
be contemplating shit. With that kind of lifestyle. A contemplative
lifestyle needs to be created, go see my episode called
Lifestyle minimalism, where I talk about how important it is
to remove the distractions from your life so that you
have enough free room and time. And you're not so
overwhelmed and stressed by your life circumstances that you could
actually sit down and then bothered to contemplate something for
five minutes, and not get distracted by something else. That
should be your overarching goal, you should be building this
building a contemplative lifestyle over the next year, two years,
three years and so forth. What I'm going to leave
you with is an assignment. This assignment will get you
to see the power of contemplation. Because unless you do
something like this exercise, I'm going to show you, you're
not really going to grab grasp the significance of this,
what I want you to do is I want you
to get a wristband like this, or a rubber band,
something that fits loosely around your wrist, put it on
your wrist for the next week, like this. I see
how it's loose, it's not tight. So I'm going to
cut off circulation. So it's gonna be on the whole
week, don't take it off at all, even when you're
sleeping and showering. And then you're going to contemplate the
following question, What is relationship? What is relationship? I want
you to contemplate that for the next week, you can
sit down for five or 10 minutes every day to
contemplate it. But also, the point of this wristband is
that whenever you catch a glimpse of this wristband, in
your field of view, remember, oh, yeah, that's what I'm
contemplating this question of what is relationship and then I
want you to spend even just 30 seconds contemplating what
a relationship is? What it really is, like really, really,
really, really, what is the nature of relationship? What is
its purpose? What is it substance? What is the significance?
What are all different examples and kinds of relationships? Ponder
that for the next week. And especially when you're interacting
with people, so the best time to contemplate something a
lot of times is when you're actually in the middle
of it. So when you're actually relating to somebody else,
like maybe you go to the store to buy some
food, and you're there to catch a checkout counter. And
you see your wristband, you're like, oh, yeah, relationship. I'm
relating right now to the clerk who I'm talking to,
to pay my bill. Or maybe you're with your children.
And you remember, like, oh, yeah, I'm relating to my
children. Right now. They're playing on the playground. And I'm
here looking at them sitting there watching them, I'm sort
of relating to them. And then think about what that
is what is relationship. Because otherwise, you tend to get
lost in abstract theories and intellect intellectualization. Right, do that
for the next week. And then just notice, at the
end of the week, just notice how different you relate
to relationships, how much more you understand about relationships than
you did before. And notice how different that is than
just reading about it in a book. Hmm, that's a
powerful assignment. So pretty easy, but it does take a
little bit of work from you this week. So I
recommend you do it. Because this could mean the difference
between you getting on track with a contemplative lifestyle or
not, which would be a huge difference in the trajectory
of your life going forward. All right, that's it. I'm
signing off. Post me your comments down below. Remember to
click the like button for me. Please share this episode
with a friend. And lastly, come check out actualized. Org
right here. This is my website. I have some goodies
and resources there sign up to my newsletter to stay
on track with the new content that I'm going to
be releasing. Check out my life purpose course check out
my book list. Check out the forum to get answers
to some of your questions for self actualization. But most
importantly, what I want from you is to come commitment
to this process, the process of growing yourself for the
rest of your life. That's what I'm pitching here. That's
what I'm selling, quote unquote selling. This is the most
important thing you can do in your life. One of
the easiest commitments you can make us just watch one
of these videos every single week, if you do that
for the next several years, here's what I promise you.
The content I'm releasing right now is going deeper and
deeper, you can probably notice if you've been onboard with
me for a while, it's getting deeper, and it will
continue to. And I'm going to be really focusing on
releasing foundational, existential level stuff that most selfhelp folks don't
talk about very much. And if you take action on
the things that I will be releasing the next year
or two, even only 50%, even if you only watched
50% of it and take action, only 50% of it,
your life will still transform in amazing ways. Right? I
hope this is clear to you. All the stuff I
talked about. It's not just theory, it's got to be
applied and embodied. And that's the really challenging part. And
that's where you come in, you got to see the
value of this, you got to put a vision together
of how much this stuff can transform your life. And
then that will fuel you to do the work every
week. Also, if you've been noticing, I keep releasing more
and more worksheets. Every single episode I tried to relate
and give you practical methods assignments that you can do,
because I know how easy it is to intellectualize all
this stuff and move nowhere. But if you start doing
little baby step assignments, that I'm giving you the worksheets
and so forth, building some of the habits like meditation,
self inquiry, and so forth, that I was telling you
to build for years now. Your life will be unspeakably
better, you will systematically weed out all the ignorance in
your life. That's basically what we're doing here is we're
weeding out ignorance, one layer at a time. But this
signal is very deep. So it'll take a lot of
work to weed it out. And don't fret about that.
This is the process. I've been doing this process for
like 10 years, at least, probably even earlier, back in,
when I was still a teenager, I was basically doing
this stuff without even consciously know knowing that I was
doing this stuff. And that's really the only reason that
my life is better than most people's lives. My life
is objectively better than most people's lives, not by accident,
not because I'm special. But because I've been contemplating and
inquiring and working on myself for a long time. This
is the most enjoyable thing you can do. It's a
bit of a pain to start. But once you get
the momentum built up a few years of doing this,
you build up the momentum, it's becomes the most rewarding
facet of life. And then everything else that you want
all the little petty things that you want, they will
either die away or you will easily get them and
then you will be shooting for much bigger things that
you can't even perceive right now. So make sure you
sign up. Stay tuned, and I'll see you soon with
more.
