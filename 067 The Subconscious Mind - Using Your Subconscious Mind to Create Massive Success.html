            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the subconscious mind</b>: The subconscious mind is responsible for aspects beyond our immediate awareness, including beliefs, habits, self-image, and perception of reality. It accounts for approximately 95% of our daily activities, acting spontaneously without requiring conscious thoughts or effort.
</li><li><b>Impact on daily activities</b>: The subconscious mind is seen in effect during mundane tasks like brushing teeth, which don't require active thinking but instead occur spontaneously. One is usually focused on other pressing issues while performing these tasks, indicating the subconscious mind at work.
</li><li><b>Role in personal development and mindset</b>: Specific limiting beliefs, habits, and self-imposed limitations in the subconscious mind can unknowingly hinder individual progress in various areas, such as fitness, relationships, or business. Therefore, achieving substantial and lasting change requires addressing and altering these aspects at the subconscious level.
</li><li><b>Subconscious changes require persistent effort</b>: While surfacing issues through therapy can bring awareness, the subconscious mind often requires more than one-off conscious inputs to change. It operates like an 'animal mind', instinctual and behavioral, responding mainly to consistent incentives or penalties. Breaking old patterns and instilling new ones need ongoing and methodical effort.
</li><li><b>Subconscious mind and success</b>: Results achieved in life, whether in personal or professional domain, are strongly influenced by the subconscious mind. To change the course of one's life towards desired goals, understanding and actively working with the subconscious mind are essential.
</li><li><b>Understanding and retraining the subconscious mind</b>: One way to change the subconscious mind is by continually motivating and inspiring oneself with positive visions or going through challenges that reshape the subconscious mind. This is a persistent and consistent process rather than a one-time effort.
</li><li><b>Role and nature of subconscious mind</b>: The subconscious mind needs to be reprogrammed over a period of time through continued efforts. Successful people repeatedly work towards reshaping their subconscious by setting goals and visualizing them or through their natural persistence despite failures. 
</li><li><b>Issue with one-time efforts</b>: Short term, one-time activities like listening to a motivational speech or reading an inspirational book are often ineffective in bringing about lasting change as they are only impactful at a conscious level, whereas lasting change comes from within the subconscious mind.
</li><li><b>Creating lasting change</b>: To create lasting results and eliminate deep-seated negative habits, one needs to develop deep-rooted positive habits and thoughts. Constant engagement in positive activities helps etch these patterns into one's mind, leading to lasting change.
</li><li><b>Techniques for subconscious mind work</b>: This entails exercises like introspection, journaling, affirmations, visualization, and therapy. The hefty work done by the conscious mind to make these changes eventually helps engrain the changes into the subconscious, which then becomes responsible for maintaining these positive changes.
</li><li><b>Limited role of the conscious mind</b>: Despite its ability to effect change, the conscious mind alone is not sufficient for lasting change due to limited willpower. The conscious mind is used most effectively when used to imprint new, positive patterns into the subconscious mind. 
</li><li><b>Relief after subconscious habit formation</b>: Once subconscious habits are formed, there is a relief since one doesn't always need to be on guard about maintaining positive habits. This freed-up conscious effort can then be directed towards other areas of life. 
</li><li><b>Awareness and alignment of conscious and subconscious mind</b>: Increasing awareness about daily activities and aligning the subconscious mind with conscious goals and desires can lead to better results. Reprogramming the subconscious with positive patterns is a long-term practice with effective results.
