Hi, this is Leo for actualised.org. We are what we
repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a
habit. That is one of my favorite quotes of all
time from Aristotle, commonly quoted quote, but very, very true.
And the more I'm practicing personal development, and the more
advanced I get, the more I realize how powerful this
message in this idea is, is that you are really
only as good as your daily routine. Listen, I've been
working on my daily routine lately. And by that what
I mean, is trying to get more consistency in what
I'm doing throughout my day, actually putting into practice the
things that I know I should be doing the know,
the things that I know I want to be doing.
And what you don't realize about yourself, if you're trying
to get more success in your life, you're trying to
get more results, that it's the routine, the quality of
your daily routine, the things that you're doing on a
daily basis, that is really going to determine how good
you feel at the end of the day, and how
much you accomplish, and really how far you're gonna go
in life. Here's the thing, every day you really basically
making are making choices, you can make a choice at
the beginning of your day, right as you're waking up,
to do the thing that you know you need to
be doing at that moment, or the choice to fall
back and go into comfort. So if you need to
wake up at a certain time, let's say 8am. And
you sleep in, that's you already breaking your routine, right
off the bat. On the other hand, if you do
wake up at eight, that's already one step that you've
taken towards the routine that you set for yourself. And
really successful, powerful people have successful, powerful routines that they're
living out, right? The difference is that if you're going
through your day, and let's say you set a list
for yourself of 20 things that you want to do
that day, if you go through and you do each
one of them, and you execute on all of them.
Maybe you can remember a day like that. How do
you feel at the end of that day? You feel
awesome, right? Why? Because you lived up to everything that
you set for yourself, you lived up to your full
potential, you went and you did the hard work, and
you're in Integrity with your values, the things that you
thought were important, right? The things that you think are
important, if you don't take action on them, then you're
going to feel dissatisfied. This is just natural mechanism of
your body. Abraham Maslow talked about this, in his concept
of self actualization is that people that are not living
up to who they know they could be to their
full potential. In the end, that is a need that
they're not meeting. Besides just having the basic need of
food, and shelter and security and friendship, there's also the
greater need to really actualize yourself and to do what
you know you should be doing to do the things
that you know you're capable of. And when you don't
do those things, for some reason, like fear, or laziness
or discomfort, then your body and your mind, let you
know about that. You don't feel very good. Do you?
Imagine creating a list of 20 things and then slacking
off and not doing a single one of them? How
are you going to feel at the end of that
day, even if you chose not to do the hard
tasks? And all you did was you sat around on
TV on the couch watching TV and eating ice cream?
And that was a good little bit of stimulation. But
how are you gonna feel at the end of that
day, you're gonna feel terrible, right? Because there's all these
things that you could have been doing all these ways
that you could have been advanced in your life. And
you can follow up on that. So for me what
I'm really realizing more and more and more, especially now
I process a lot of personal development theory. And now
I'm trying to actually get the results that the theory
is promising. What I'm really finding is that advanced personal
development is about creating a really strong routine and that's
something that I've been working on lately. For me a
strong routine as I'm executing it, right on putting in
the things that I know are going to make me
better As a person, better my career better my relationships
better in any aspect of my life, right. And these
can be simple things. So the way that you start
a routine is, you know, just from the moment you
wake up, did you wake up on time, by the
goal that you set for yourself. And then as soon
as you wake up, for example, for me, obviously go
into the shower. And right now part of the routine
that I have is I listen to some audio programs
while I'm in the shower. And so I go, I
put on my iPod is hooked up to a little
speaker. And so I listen to that for 20 minutes.
While I'm showering. If I do that, I come out
of the shower, I feel great, because now I'm pumped
full of pumped full of information, I'm starting to get
ideas about what I can be bringing into these videos,
like I bring into an article. And also ways that
I could optimize my life. So I've got that going.
Then after that, the next routine that I've got is
I take some supplements, I do a bit of detox,
I get some food in me. And then I go
and I do some visualizations and affirmations. And I read
my mission statement, you know, did I do that, if
I did, then that gives me another boost, another hit
of momentum towards my day. And then after I've done
that, I also do some meditation, which I just started
adding in there, I started to add an hour of
meditation every day, which I'm committed to. So now I'm
doing that, if I go through and I do an
hour meditation, that's another piece to the momentum. And then
from that meditation, I feel great, I feel really calm,
has a good place to start my work from so
then I can go start my work, did I execute
on my work, am I executing on that. And if
I am, then again, more momentum, build more momentum build.
So throughout the day, you're building momentum with this positive
routine. Whereas if you don't have this, you're really in
trouble. Because what you got to understand about yourself, if
you understand anything about yourself from personal development is that
you and every one of us is a creature of
habit. And it's the habits and the routines that I'm
talking about that are really determining the quality of your
life. You either have shitty habits, or you have good
habits. The question is, what do you have, if you
have shitty habits, then you're not going to be accomplishing
much in your life, you're not going to be performing
well, and you're not going to be fulfilled with yourself,
because you realize that you could be doing more. Not
only that, but the problem with the shitty habits or
lack of habits altogether, is that what happens is that
you're just like a leaf in the wind, you're being
blown around. And what happens after that is that you
start to become afraid of really yourself, you become afraid
of the laziness, right? Because you know that life is
full of challenges. And then in the end, if you
just sit around on the couch and do nothing, that
problems will creep up for you, you can do that
for a short period of time, we can't do that
forever, eventually, there's gonna be repercussions. You got to pay
the bills, you got to, you're gonna have to talk
to your clients at work after a while, and maybe
they're gonna be upset at you, because you weren't responding,
you're gonna have to talk to your friends, and maybe
they're gonna be upset at you, because you weren't responding,
you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to go to
work. And you have to perform there, you're gonna have
to go to the gym at some point, or there's
gonna be problems, right? You can't just sit around, there's
stuff that needs to be done stuff for you, that
you want to be doing. And so when you're not
following through on that, what happens is you know that
there's going to be these challenges. And when you start
to take this defensive attitude about life, where it's like,
oh, I'll just do it later. I'll do it tomorrow,
I'll push it off. That's not really as important that
I thought it was you start coming up with excuses,
you start procrastinating. And what ends up happening is that
you start to become afraid, there's just this anxiety in
the back of your mind. And I think the reason
that happens is because you know, that you're slacking off,
and that you're being a lazy slug. And that when
you're a lazy slug, you're not really powerful, you're comfortable.
And you're really afraid that someone's going to come away
or something is going to come away and take that
comfort away from you. And that can be in the
form of your spouse yelling at you to go take
out the trash, or the form of an angry client
whose email you didn't respond to and in a week,
or your body telling you that you need to be
going to the gym, right? So any one of these
or more and you start to take this, this defensive
attitude like well, I just want to preserve my comfort.
I want to preserve this comfort zone, I want to
preserve it as long as I can, so that nothing
interrupts it. So I'm nice and cozy and safe. And
everything's going smooth. And I'm just kind of in heaven
and, and blissing out, what happens is that you're very
weary. And it's a, it's kind of a bittersweet joy.
Because even though you have that comfort, you also know
that something's gonna come and disrupt that comfort sooner or
later, and that it can't last forever. And so you
feel weak, you feel afraid, you feel disempowered, and you
make stupid decisions. And really, you go down this negative
downward spiral of guilt, and shame, and trying to creep
your way back out, but then falling back down, succumbing
to the temptations of the comfort. That's what happens when
you don't have any routines, or you have negative routines.
On the other hand, if you have positive routines, and
you're following up on them, and you're actually doing things
in your life, that are making you higher, conscious, more
conscious, that are advancing your values, advancing your goals, advancing
your ultimate vision, making you feel the way you want
to feel those higher level feelings, and just generally living
up to your highest self. When you're doing that. How
do you feel that you feel on fire, you feel
excited, right? You also feel strong. And you get this
sense of fearlessness. After a while when you build up
that momentum. And let's say, yeah, you created a positive
routine for yourself, and then you've executed on it for
like a month. How are you going to feel that
if you executed flawlessly, every day for a whole month,
you're going to feel unstoppable, you're going to feel like
you can, you can bust through walls, you're going to
feel like you can move mountains. Because those, those routines
are instilling within you a sense of success, and a
sense of living up to your highest potential. And you
see yourself doing that. And all of a sudden, you
start getting new ideas, and you start feeling more energetic,
you start feeling more vitality, you start engaging in interactions,
more you start, you start having fun, you start joking,
you start coming up with more ambitious goals, and just
kind of builds and builds and builds. And so now
you've got this upward, positive spiral. And then you don't
feel lazy at all. And in fact, you feel fearless.
And it's like, Bring on the challenge, you want the
challenge, you welcome the challenge, because you're not in your
comfort zone, you're on your edge. And when you're on
your edge, it's like you feel like you can do
anything you feel you can go to the gym and
lift more you feel like you can take and contribute
more to a relationship, you feel like you can go
to work and execute and knock out a new project
really quickly, you feel like you can maybe work on
some idea or sub start a new project that you've
been putting off for a long time, everything becomes open
to you. And that's the kind of kind of life
that we're talking about here. This is what it means
to be really fulfilled in your life is to be
on that edge and to be taking action. And you
got to do that by starting to build up a
positive routine, right? Because it's gonna make you feel as
soon as can make you feel great. The trick is
that if you're going down that negative spiral, and you're
already down in this pit of despair, and guilt and
shame and procrastination, then it's going to take you some
effort to work your way back up, you have to
start reversing that trend. And I think the biggest thing
to realize about that is that you need to deal
with patient with it. Because if you've been going down
that spiral, and you've been going down and down down,
then it's going to be a tough, it's gonna be
a tough gearshift to then start to move all the
way back up. And you can't expect to jump all
the way to the top. And always is tempting, right?
Because when you're sitting there, and you've been procrastinating for
so long, to reverse that whole process, you wish that
you could just skip the pain of reversing and all
that you could just be back on top. But of
course, that would be too easy. You have to start
slow. And I think one of the tricks there is
to understand this concept of momentum. And this idea that
you've got to be a little bit patient with yourself.
And that you got to realize that it's going to
take you a matter of days, maybe weeks of slowly
ramping back up. You don't want to just all of
a sudden, you know, if you haven't been go to
the gym for a few months, just jump back in
the gym and start lifting like you were two months
ago, that's not going to work out you're gonna burn
yourself out and just really make it a pain for
yourself. Same thing at work, you know, if you haven't
checked a bunch of emails that you need to check,
committing yourself to going and fixing all of that in
one sitting. Probably not a smart idea. You're gonna want
to chip away at it and slowly ramp your way
up. Because the thing is that your your body and
your mind are not trained. That's what routines are good
for. So they keep you on track and through a
slow and gradual process. They train you up to handle
the stress to handle the challenge. And when you haven't
taken that, that gradual process And then you literally can't,
you can't have the stress by just jumping from not
going to gym, let's say and then all sudden going
to the gym and running a couple miles or lifting
some heavy weights can't do it, you have to build
your way back up. And that's why I love positive
routines is because they slowly get you towards your goals,
they slowly move you towards your vision. And it's really
powerful to be on track with that, because you see
every day that you're taking baby steps. And those baby
steps, even though one missing one baby step is insignificant,
not a big deal. But in the end is the
baby steps that get you to where you want to
go. I think the challenge is that most of us
struggle with creating a positive routine, I really want to
encourage you to sit down right now and figure out
what is going to be a routine that is executing
on your values and on your goals. What does that
mean for you? Does that mean waking up on time?
Does that mean hitting the gym? Right? As soon as
you wake up? Does that mean taking a shower brushing
your teeth? Does that mean eating a healthy breakfast? Does
that mean getting to work on time instead of being
10 minutes late? Like you usually are? Does that mean
spending some time with the kids before work? And then
what after that, you know, do you need to do
some meditation do you need to do some journaling? For
me putting these little pieces into place is where it's
really at. This is what really changes the quality of
your life and gets you much better results when you're
putting a habit into place. And it can be something
really small, like 510 minutes of journaling in the morning
about your goals, or maybe 20 minutes of visualization about
what you want to accomplish. Or maybe like I said,
eating that healthy breakfast and starting off that way so
that you don't get some sugar crash, or feel bad
about yourself, and about your weight and about your shape.
Because you're continuing to feed that that native cycle. So
breaking it in the morning, whatever that might be. Right?
building that up. That's, that's it, that's kind of the
secret, the secret of success is doing that. And successful
people that have routine like that, look at them, look
at what they do, they wake up early, and then
they're on top of it, they're doing stuff they're not,
they're not fall falling short on their daily tasks, they're
just not they have a really strong routine built up.
And chances are that they've been executing on it very
consistently, for weeks, months, maybe even years, to the point
where it's just automatic for them. And for most everybody
else, it's a struggle, we try to maybe do one
thing and other thing, try to get a routine up,
but we never kind of crystallize it, we never master
it. And so we always struggle. Because when you're trying
to build up the first time, there's that hump, right,
there's that initial large investment of energy, where there's a
lot of emotional effort involved. Later on, it gets really
easy, but right now it's gonna be challenging, and you
have to, you have to kind of bite the bullet
on that. But if you're always just putting in the
effort and and dropping it, and then putting in the
effort and dropping the routine, putting in the effort and
dropping it, then you're always putting in so much effort
and becomes really painful, emotionally taxing on you. And you
never get that long term benefit of just kind of
coasting and using that routine to just run your life
and run it really well. So you're always either down
in the comfort zone, or you're trying to get up,
but then you never quite make it. It's kind of
like a rocket trying to escape Earth's gravity, right? You
want to make sure that when you do that you're
fully committed, and you make a full burst, like you
really have enough fuel to get yourself out of Earth's
orbit, otherwise, you're gonna fall back down. That's kind of
what it's like when you're building a positive routine. So
I find that one of the reasons that this is
happening is because we don't have a lot of structure
in our lives. And I mean, like when we're in
school, or when we're part of a family, when we're
growing up, there tends to be more of this structure,
because you're not fully independent, you're not fully autonomous. And
you're you got your school, you got X number of
hours of schooling that you do, then you go to
maybe to sports, and then you go and you do
other activities. And then you spend time with a family.
And so what ends up happening is that you can
build some routines up with that. In fact, I remember
when I was in school, I really did a lot
of studying. And I because I valued academics. And for
me, that was a really solid structure. I built a
lot of a lot of my happiest moments were from
that because I was falling through and I had a
really positive routine. And I built that up over the
years and didn't really even consciously understand what I was
doing. I can only see that now in retrospect with
kind of the wisdom that I've accumulated recently. But then
I lost that, you know, after you graduate college, what
do you do? You stop studying, you stop reading. You
start slacking off more, and maybe your job has some
structure to it. But I tend to find that once
we become independent once we become autonomous We kind of
separate a little bit from our family, we're off on
our own doing our own thing, unless you're consciously thinking
about this stuff, and you're doing this personal development, and
you're journaling, and you're thinking and you're planning out what
your routine should be, then I tend to think I
tend to find that people don't have a routine really,
or they have really negative habits. And they're down in
that comfort zone, because they've been procrastinating for so long.
And so they're afraid they're not on their edge, they're
living really half the life, they're not living a full
life. And I want that to be totally different. So
what you got to start doing is you got to
sit down, and craft out what you want routine to
be. And it's really exciting, because what you do is
you create kind of a skeleton structure, something basic, you
know, maybe waking up on time, hitting the gym, going
to work on time, do all the meditation at lunchtime,
whatever, you know, set up a basic, something basic, something
you can follow through on pretty easily. And then over
time, what you're gonna do is you're going to add
in pieces, it's going to be like, like a, like
a module that you're building, right. So you got the
backbone of your routine, and then you're adding these modules
on. So you might find, you know, a technique like
visualizations, and then you might add that in somewhere in
your schedule, try to fit it in, and then see
how that works for you. Maybe it'll work really well,
maybe it's not going to work so well for you.
Maybe instead you'd like to add in something else, instead
of visualization. Maybe you want to do some journaling. Or
maybe you want to go and spend some time with
the kids, or whatever is important to you. And you
try these things you add them on, until eventually you
create something that's really solid, and you keep executing on
it, of course, every single day, every single week, so
that you build up a lot of momentum. And then
you've got something that is making you really fulfilled and
then also making you successful because you're taking baby steps.
And this routine should be designed in such a way
where of course you are working towards that career vision
that you have, or your business or your family, whatever
it is that you want to be productive in. But
it's also going to make you feel good, because you're
executing on it, and is putting you if you design
it right into higher consciousness state, right, because one of
the things for example, in my routine that I want
to put in more consistently is reading, reading more, doing
it more consistently that I've been doing it so far.
That's a really good one, right. And maybe you have
to also consider some of the stuff you might want
to cut out. If you've got some negative habits that
you've got, like maybe you're watching too much television, maybe
you're checking your email too much. Maybe you're on the
internet too much, whatever that might be, you know, maybe
you're texting too much throughout the day. And that's causing
you to lose focus. So this is where it's at.
This is where you do personal development. This is kind
of where the rubber meets the road. Because we can
talk about all the theory, and you can understand all
these advanced concepts. But in the end, it's the habits
that you build. It's the practice, right? It's one thing
to know something intellectually, it's another thing to actually implement
it in your life. So that's what I want for
you is I want you to sit down right now
and think about how you can create a more powerful
routine for yourself. And then go ahead and start in
the next day, commit to doing it, and commit to
doing it for at least a few weeks. Because that
initial hump you have to get through you have to
escape that. That gravity, get that escape velocity so that
you're out of orbit and then see how you feel
and see if that is not worth the effort that
you put into it. Alright, this is Lea, I'm gonna
sign off. Go ahead and comment, tell me what you
think about this of this concept. And then go ahead
and also share it like this if you like it.
