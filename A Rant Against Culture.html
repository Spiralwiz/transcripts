hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to rant a bit about culture ever
since I was a kid I've been suspicious of culture
somehow it rubbed me the wrong way and I mean
every type of culture not just a specific culture I've
always really disliked culture and for the longest time I
didn't know why so this would include gamer culture biker
culture pickup culture hippie culture goth culture tattoo culture American
culture academic or scientific culture corporate culture black culture drug
culture Christian culture Islamic culture Hindu culture Russian culture and
by the way I'm Russian originally a geek or nerd
culture and sports culture so that's just the tip of
the iceberg of all the cultures that are there a
lot of these are sort of subcultures some of them
are larger some of them are smaller but like I
said they've always rubbed me the wrong way and I
never felt like I fit in into any culture maybe
you can resonate with that and like I said for
the longest time I didn't know why this was I
thought it was just like I'm kind of weird I
don't know why I don't fit into any culture but
the more I started doing consciousness work and personal development
work I realized why this is and it's because all
culture is fundamentally artificial and limited and it stifles consciousness
that's the problem and I'm not picking on any particular
culture here I mean all cultures I'm painting deliberately with
a broad brush here all cultures are inherently limited they're
inherently artificial they're inherently arbitrary there are constructs of the
human mind they are biased inherently so they're moralizing they're
bigoted they're egoic they're inauthentic to individuals they force people
into pigeon holes and straitjackets very often they're neurotic they're
escaping just they're very clannish and they get aggressive whenever
they're threatened really what we're dealing with here when we're
talking about culture is we're dealing with the collective ego
so if ego is what you got going on personally
and we've already talked in the past about how many
problems the ego creates for us okay so when we're
self actualizing we're dealing with this ego and how to
overcome its limitations but it's not merely that we have
our own privately goes it's also that our private little
ego is very intimately wedded to the collective ego of
our society of our nation of our continent of our
religion of our scientific paradigm of our local community of
our city of our state you know it like you've
got all these layers to it and this ego just
like the individual ego which is a construct of all
these things that we cling to about ourselves well the
collective ego is just like that it's also a construct
it doesn't really exist in the sense that you can
point your finger at it and say there it is
there's culture it doesn't look like that right culture is
this kind of ethereal abstract thing you can't quite pin
it down and yet it's such a pivotal player in
your life and it influences you so much and the
problem here though is that it's kind of like you're
the fish and water the culture is the water and
the fish has spent his whole life living in the
water doesn't even recognize that there is influences from culture
what's easy recognizes influences from other cultures and a lot
of people have they're disliked culture like I don't like
that culture there I don't like this culture there I
don't like this country I don't like that nation I
don't like that football team I don't like those Republicans
or those Democrats or I don't like those philosophers or
those scientists or those religious people but then when it
comes to your culture that's you generally have a blind
spot and that creates many many problems now it's very
easy to denounce other cultures because we can see the
inherent limitations of other cultures but it's very difficult to
see your own culture and the influence it has on
you and the limitations that it places on you now
you might say well Leo what's wrong with culture I
mean aren't there good cultures out there isn't it a
matter of like avoiding the bad ones and finding the
good ones and what I would say is no it's
not that small of a problem it's a lot deeper
of a problem because all culture fundamentally is mechanical its
mechanical and everything that's mechanical prevents consciousness from growing and
given that your prime directive in life is to be
growing and developing your consciousness culture presents a huge huge
huge unseen obstacle for you you don't even know that
it's there it's like a glass ceiling that you keep
hitting your head against as you're trying to grow and
self actualize and you wonder like why am i hitting
this glass ceiling well it's because your culture is there
in the background now some cultures are a lot more
toxic than others so I'm not saying they're all equally
bad and I'm not saying that there's not some good
elements to culture but even if you take the most
spiritual cultures of all time like what would that be
maybe that would be you might say that that's like
something like Buddhism you might say well Lia what's wrong
with Buddhism that seems like a perfectly good spiritual culture
well if you start to do a little bit of
research you start to see a lot of dysfunctions a
lot of limitations a lot of problems with Buddhist culture
you start to see it really quickly if you do
just some objective research and the same will go for
any culture no matter how good you think it is
how spotless and how spiritual it always devolves because fundamentally
we're trying to do is you're trying to take consciousness
and then you're trying to distribute it to the masses
to a cultural mechanism and that always makes it mechanical
and then that always fails but before I talk more
about that let's really get specific here because I want
you to start to feel and to get a sense
of the magnitude of what I'm talking about here so
try to imagine with me right now just how much
your culture has affected you and when I talk about
culture by the way I don't just mean like the
very traditional types of culture like you might think of
Islamic culture it's pretty easy to see the culture in
Islamic culture or like maybe the culture and Buddhism you
can see it in that right these are very deep
old traditions or something like you know Judaism you can
see the culture in it or like Roman Catholicism in
the Vatican they have thousands of years of history so
I mean obviously that's culture but I don't want you
to make the mistake of saying like well because I
live in America or I live somewhere in Europe you
know uh and I'm not really a church-going type and
I'm not a really traditional type of person that just
because that you're like that that that means you're not
affected by culture no in many ways if you are
like that if you're living in a modern Western democracy
like America or in Europe or maybe Australia or someplace
you actually have it in a sense the worst because
your culture is transparent to you and yet at the
same time it has a lot of influences on you
that you probably haven't really thought of before so let's
articulate a few of these imagine with me how much
your culture has influenced the following things in you how
you dress how you wear your hairstyle the entertainment and
media that you like and dislike and that you consume
the food that you like or dislike and consume your
attitude towards drugs and alcohol your attitude towards prescription medicine
your attitude towards work business and career and how you
think business ought to be run the technology that you
use and also the technology that you don't use and
that you think of as hokey or as pseudoscience how
is culture influenced your education and what you even understand
education to be to think of education as going from
first grade to twelfth grade and then going to four
years of college if that's what you think education is
just think about how much that whole scheme has been
influenced by modern culture think about your ideas about how
kids should be raised and remember that you were one
of those kids who was raised according to the rules
of your culture of how kids should be raised also
your ideas and norms about family what a family is
what a family includes or excludes and how families should
function what a healthy family looks like think about your
views about sex and intimate relationships and romantic love and
marriage and how you view that huge chunk of your
life what you think is right there what you think
is wrong there and the way that you go about
having sex and the way you go about having intimate
relationships and what you believe love is and how it
actually works the mechanics of those things think about how
much your culture has shaped that try to also imagine
how much your culture has shaped your paradigms of what
you believe reality is people often think like all reality
reality is just reality we know what it is it's
just the facts no no no no no no no
no reality is not just the facts the facts are
held in the context of your culture and what's really
crazy and we start to realize just how much the
change the perspective on the facts can change so much
the significance you attach to the facts and what you
believe realities can change so much depending on your culture
because it's all about the context you see and culture
is the context for almost everything you do especially everything
you do socially with other people think about also try
to imagine this how culture has influenced your ideas of
science and what is valid science and valid knowledge versus
invalid science and invalid knowledge maybe you might call that
folk knowledge or pseudoscience this stuff is not carved in
stone this is part of your culture you see think
about history oh this is a big one imagine just
try to imagine this is so significant how much your
culture has impacted your knowledge of human history it's so
easy to overlook this because in school we'll just taught
history and we just think that all yeah history is
just history no history completely depends on the culture and
the country that you learned it from completely almost completely
if you grew up in Africa you would have very
different history lessons than if you grow up in America
versus whether you grew up in Australia versus whether you
grew up in Singapore or in China somewhere right these
would all be very very different histories they would stress
very different things and they'd have very different perspectives on
the evolution of humanity and civilization and if you were
a Native American you would have a very different sense
of history than Americans do also try to imagine just
how much culture has shaped your morality and your ethics
what you believe is right and wrong that's huge that's
huge also think about now getting a little bit more
personal how much your culture has shaped your values and
ideals about your own life what you want for yourself
your deepest desires and your goals can you see how
culture is a huge component of that it's not that
you were just born you just have some desires to
become successful or to to become a scientist or you
have a desire to become a a professional athlete you
know football play or something like that no can you
see that that's all part of culture also your ideals
about how you're supposed to look how tall you're supposed
to be what color hair you're supposed to have uh
what kind of clothes you should wearing all these ideals
you have how popular you should be how much money
you should have what kind of girlfriend or husband you
should have can you see that that's all culturally influenced
can you start to grasp the significance of this also
fears imagine how much culture shapes what you fear the
most in life what do you fear do you fear
not being liked do you feel being ridiculed do you
fear becoming homeless do you fear being excommunicated from your
church or from your community do you fear being called
a pervert or a charlatan what do you fear and
how is call or played into that what do you
believe what are your beliefs all the beliefs you have
how many of those are actually derived from culture how
many of those wouldn't even exist in you if not
for your culture how about gender roles you think a
man is just a man and a woman is just
a woman how much do you think culture played into
that what you think a man is and what you
think a woman is and what the ideals are for
both of them and how they should interact that's very
much culturally derived think about death what are your thoughts
and beliefs about death that's very much dependent on your
culture not every culture of use death as a bad
thing not every culture denies it and ignores it and
tries to run away from it the way that modern
Western cultures do think about language try to imagine how
much language which comes completely from your culture how much
that has shaped your perspective on all of reality including
science religion and all your reactions with all your friends
and all your beliefs those are all shaped by language
that's such a fundamental layer that we rarely think about
language is not just a difference in the words that
we use language actually affects the concepts you can hold
in your mind and how you actually think about reality
the very grammar of language structures how you think about
the world sports do you like sports think about how
much sports are a byproduct of culture spirituality are you
into spirituality have spiritual practices or religious beliefs I mean
that is hugely influenced by your culture health how do
you view health what do you think is healthy or
unhealthy this is all coming from culture and also your
hobbies whatever hobbies you have are you collecting stamps are
you collecting butterflies or whatever hobbies you might have that
you like to do I think about how much those
are probably shaped by culture as well a shocking revelation
is to realize that you are in a cult and
you don't even know it that's what culture is culture
is just a big cult and you know it's very
interesting because a lot of times people who are very
sucked into mainstream culture they will point to what look
like bubbles or subcultures within the mainstream culture and say
all look that's a cult like those Mormons are a
cult and and those Scientologists are a cult and those
people over there are like a cult and this is
a cult and maybe Leo like actualize that org is
starting to turn into a cult but the people that
I see that always point the finger and say oh
look at that cult what they're not aware of is
that the biggest cult you got to be afraid of
is not those little cults it's the gigantic over cult
the super set of all cults which is the national
cult that you grew up in which is almost completely
transparent to you and it feels just like reality to
you it feels like it couldn't be any other way
and then yet you know you go travel to a
totally different country which has a totally different culture and
you get this culture shock and all of a sudden
you see just how arbitrary all that stuff that your
culture has been doing really is but even if you
do go travel around that still won't be enough to
see the the tentacles of this thing you know your
culture the tentacles of your culture are buried so deep
in every orifice of your body um that I like
that image because it's a disturbing image you imagine giant
octopus with tentacles in every orifice of your body that's
what's happening to you right and the biggest thing is
that nobody told you this because of course part of
every culture is to deny that it's a culture to
deny its arbitrariness to deny the fact that it's a
construction so what is a culture really what is the
function of culture why does culture even exist well this
is a deep deep philosophical topic that you could ponder
for hours and hours and I encourage you to do
that but just to gloss over it really quickly what's
going on with culture I think is that you have
a collective identity a collective ego being created by individuals
that are coming together for purposes of survival and reproduction
basically and the culture facilitates that the culture is like
a higher order organization amongst social creatures humans in this
case primates monkeys whatever that then allows them to bond
better so there's a sharing of common values and beliefs
and ideas and so forth and this of course creates
a sort of paradigm or a lens through which all
of reality is viewed and it's not the cultures prime
objective to increase the consciousness of the collective or of
itself culture is mostly concerned with just a survival and
reproduction and out competing other neighboring cultures see and really
the really kind of deep almost cynical definition of culture
is it's a collective bubble of delusion that's what it
is think about this for a second if you had
a bunch of individuals as an individual you basically just
have kind of reality whatever reality is that's before culture
right imagine there's no culture at all it hasn't been
invented yet so you just have an individual in the
middle of the jungle and he's there within reality now
what's beneficial perhaps an individual is to come up with
visual ideas and constructs about reality but what's the problem
there well the problem there is that if you come
up with some fantasy about reality and it's only you
in the jungle well the jungle will easily kick your
ass won't it and your ideas about how the jungle
works won't matter very much they're not going to help
you that much because you're gonna have you know your
feet are going to be burned by the the brutal
nature of reality itself and so if you start to
have all sorts of fanciful beliefs about how reality works
within the jungle the jungle is basically going to kill
you okay so that doesn't work but let's say we
get together a hundred people now those hundred people if
they come up with some ideas and constructs about how
the jungle works well they've got more slack so to
speak because together what they can do is they can
actually take their ideas and because you're building this house
of cards each card reinforces and leans on the other
so these hundred individuals like nodes in a network can
come together come up with a construction and that construction
all the sudden takes on a very real significant meaning
that otherwise it couldn't have because each other node in
the network reinforces the validity of that belief or that
worldview and so in this way we can have a
construction such as money a totally arbitrary invention but also
very useful and also potentially very dangerous as we find
out with you know economic global collapses which we're starting
to face all around the world nowadays because of all
the shenanigans that go on the financial markets right but
you can start to see how money even though it's
a construction because we all believe in it it takes
on a reality of its own and that really if
you think about it from the standpoint of the evolution
of reality right it's like first there was the planet
Earth then there was bacteria then those bacteria evolved into
creatures and lizards and dinosaurs and then those died and
then we have mammals than we had humans and like
all of this was like nature was inventing all this
cool stuff and now with humans a really interesting invention
comes online which didn't really exist with the with other
creatures not on this scale is that we can just
manufacture our own fantasies and just by the fact that
we can take this fantasy and spread it around amongst
a billion people that fantasy takes on a life of
its own and it actually becomes sort of a pseudo
reality that's the power of belief that's the power of
collective fantasy and so a modern man lives in these
bubbles right these bubbles of constructed fantasies and these apply
to what clothing you should wear think about like nature
doesn't care what clothing you wear and yet it makes
a huge important difference when you're going to high school
what clothing you wear if you go to high school
with the wrong clothing you're not going to have sex
people are going to laugh at you they're going to
ridicule you your reputation will be ruined or if you're
trying to um feed your family by starting a business
or having a career uh it's going to matter what
clothing you wear and it's going to matter how much
money you have in your bank account and it's going
to matter you know all all this socially constructive stuff
is going to matter otherwise you will not get hired
for the job if you come into a job interview
and you tell them that you believe in Satan they
probably won't hire you even though Nature doesn't care if
you believe in Satan or not but other human beings
do and because you've now grown up in a society
which is completely dominated by the culture that we've created
in a sense like Nature has become a distant second
far down on the list of priorities your first priorities
are now to fit into the social matrix to impress
people to get people to like you to play politics
games to you know to earn money to to have
sex with the right people to get approval from the
right people and you know to play sports and to
to be in team and to to go to the
gym and to look healthy and to look ripped and
to have the right hobbies and all this sort of
stuff and to do spirituality in the right way and
what the culture does is the culture guilts you and
pressures you into subscribing to the culture and this happened
to you if you can remember when you were a
small kid that started to happen to you you as
a kid had your own natural inclinations to do this
or to dress this way or to to say this
thing here but then what happened your parents or your
friends or your teachers which were all enforcers of the
culture they basically beat that out of you by telling
you no no no no no no no and also
giving you rewards for obeying the culture and that way
they basically peer pressured and suckered you into believing and
playing this game and so it's a game and like
I said it's bad enough to only be dealing with
your own private ego but now you also have to
contend with the cultural ego and that's a that's a
much bigger challenge in a sense because your private ego
you kind of have you know you can you can
go to work on that but what's really difficult to
do is to change the cultural ego that's what politics
is all about and you know how nasty and difficult
that can be and all of this of course relates
back to you into the development of your consciousness and
what you have to realize is that the raising of
your consciousness which is your prime imperative in life is
a solo activity consciousness cannot be raised as a group
project consciousness is purely a solo activity now you might
say well Leo there's a lot of spiritual traditions and
it seems like I have more success working on my
spiritual habits like if I'm meditating in a group or
you know what about Buddhism or Hinduism or some of
these other traditions like Zen for example which is a
culture which have produced many enlightened people and they seem
to be able to successfully raise consciousness no that's an
illusion yes some cultures are more conducive to the raising
of consciousness but consciousness itself is only raised on an
individual level this is very important to understand it's only
raised on an individual level you might even look at
actualize that org you might say well actualize that org
that's like a little culture little subculture that helps me
to find a sense of community and a sense of
support for self actualized yes it seems like it does
that but in the end your ability to self actualize
will really only come down to your your own inner
work that you do or fail to do and any
attempt that you make to self actualize as part of
a group it's not going to work too well in
fact what's going to produce is going to produce all
the mechanical nasai described and it could produce all the
classic symptoms of a cult and this is inevitable because
this is how a collective ego works you see so
you have to realize this and this is why religion
will always fail at producing enlightened people as will any
other organizational community not in the sense that they can't
but in the sense that they will always encounter the
same kind of mechanical corruptions that happened with every mechanical
system and only to the extent that you're focusing inward
on yourself and taking sole responsibility for your spiritual and
conscious development only to that extent can you actually become
enlightened or can experience riot raising of consciousness within your
your group of your community see and to the extent
that you forget about that and you get lost in
the externals and in all the social relationships to that
extent you're not raising your consciousness and you're actually lowering
it your goal as part of the self actualization journey
is to become independent of all culture not to denounce
it be very careful here not to interpret what I'm
saying as culture is evil and bad and now we
have to judge everyone who's part of any culture and
then we have to denounce all culture no that would
be equally bad you want to transcend culture you don't
want to be reactive against culture you want to be
able to transcend it which means that when you do
interact with people who are deeply soaked in some kind
of culture that doesn't trigger you and you don't need
to tell them to stop you don't need to convert
them or proselytize them or to judge them or to
wag your finger at them no you're cool with it
but you yourself have transcended culture which means you operate
outside of culture which if you remember my video about
self-actualization where I talk about I give you a whole
list of all the features of a self actualized human
being according to Abraham Maslow's definition um there one of
the points one of the hallmark features of a self
actualized person is that they have transcended culture and I
see very few people who have really truly transcended culture
this is not an easy thing to do because we're
so blind to it so how do you do this
how do you actually go about seeing the cultural blind
spots well firstly simply by awareness just start to notice
all the elements of culture that are like these tentacles
that are crawling into every orifice in your body and
how they're influencing you start to see that just by
awareness of that alone you'll start to gain distance and
transcendence and that can go a long way you can
really ramp up that awareness but also by studying and
experiencing other cultures this is important people who have only
experienced one or two cultures tend to be very closed-minded
and very stuck in their culture and very defensive about
it whereas people who have experienced 3 5 10 different
cultures and have actually lived in those cultures they gain
a very different perspective on life they're much more open-minded
they're much more multicultural and they're generally just much more
chill human beings also cut any cultural feeds that are
feeding you with cultural information so stuff like all the
comedy videos that you watch on YouTube all the movies
you watch at the movie theater or on Netflix all
the magazines you read the tabloids that you read you
know the websites that you visit for your popular news
and stuff like that um the books that you read
so all the media basically is the most direct line
that feeds you culture and I know how much you
love your media your video games and your Netflix and
so forth so you know what the bad news is
that you might have to cut some of that stuff
even though it's fun and you love it at some
point you have to realize also how much it's reinforcing
all these beliefs and all these values and all these
ideals that probably aren't what you really want in your
life but they're being fed all those funny videos you
watch that you love so much they're all feeding you
the same cultural norms and ideas see and it's because
you love them so much they just enter your brain
and they just stick there and then you never even
question them so start cutting those cut those feeds also
be less social because all the socialization you do with
your friends guess what that's also feeding you feeding you
with gossip feeding you with the latest news feeding you
with the latest memes and the latest norms and latest
fads the newest movie they came out and this thing
happened to that person and oh what about this politician
look at what he did the sex scandal see all
that stuff feeds in in a subtle way it feeds
in and it's dangerous because it feels pleasant to gossip
about this stuff but then of course what happens that
you don't really have any solitude time so as you
become less social you're going to become more of a
loner and you're gonna have a lot more time to
reflect and to contemplate and to just be in solitude
and that's exactly what you need to start to undo
and extricate yourself from the culture also you should start
to question everything question everything that your culture has ever
taught you question every single belief that your culture takes
for granted and holds is sacred and unquestionable become a
true skeptic also embark on your own journey if you
want to extricate yourself from culture have something of your
own that you're trying to create you're trying to do
have a life purpose because when you're focused on your
life purpose you're trying to accomplish something big you're not
going to have time to engage in all the cultural
nonsense that goes around you and also you're probably have
to break some cultural conventions to accomplish that big objective
another huge win of psychedelics go try some psychedelics and
see how much that shatters uh your notions of what
your culture has taught you it will really break down
a lot of the beliefs and ideas and stories that
you have that you really feel are part of reality
but psychedelics will quickly tell you that now now they're
really just arbitrary constructions meditation is a huge pick up
a meditation habits are doing it every single day the
more you meditate the longer you meditate for years and
years and years as you keep doing that you will
slowly extricate yourself more and more from culture until eventually
you can completely break out of it or you know
I would say completely because culture is so deep that
even people who get enlightened are still largely run by
cultural norms I think of a Zen master a deeply
lighten Zen master well he might be extremely enlightened but
he's still very much at the at the affect of
his culture and a lot of times in nasty and
negative ways and be more with nature because nature doesn't
come with a culture when you're out in the woods
winter in a mountain top when you're in the middle
of the ocean when you're on a tropical island all
by yourself in the midst of nature and it's beautiful
and it's amazing that somehow shifts something in you where
you start to see reality stripped of all its cultural
constructs all the human that we constructed this entire matrix
you're sort of ripped out of it and you see
the majesty of reality bear without any adornments and that
can be a beautiful thing and that's ultimately what you're
shooting for is to live in reality free of all
the adornments because yes the adornments they seem kind of
Pleasant and sexy at first but then later you realize
that really they're just very gaudy these gaudy human adornments
that you don't need and it can be much more
satisfied and fulfilled when you just drop those so that's
it that's my rant about culture remember that when I
rant you got to understand that I'm kind of doing
a rant tongue-in-cheek I'm not really here bitter about culture
pissed off and sago culture we got to destroy all
culture no I'm just kind of doing it for entertainment
you know at this point I it's hard for me
to even muster a serious rant these days cuz it's
just like I don't really I'm not really attached I'm
not really attached to my beliefs or some ideas that
much so I just kind of rant when it's fun
to you know vent a little bit and because I
think that right now you know it's really lopsided 99%
of people are so immersed in culture that I feel
like if I rant about culture a lot that will
just be a nudge in the opposite direction right I
could shoot a hundred hours of ramp on culture and
that would still probably not be enough for you to
get to the point where you are actually on the
upper other end of the spectrum where you're actually denouncing
all culture and that's becoming neurotic I mean ultimately gonna
have to find a balance right it's all about balance
but right now I think you're you're safely on the
end of the spectrum where you can really cut a
lot of culture out of your life with no problems
only benefits alright so like I said that's it but
I do have a worksheet for you so go do
the worksheet fill it out to take all this abstract
stuff and to make it concrete it's got questions on
there that will really make you question how much culture
is influenced your life so that free worksheet is down
below just click the link sit I'm signing off post

is my website come check it out it's an easier
way to browse all my videos I have some exclusive
content on there subscribe to my newsletter stay tuned every
single week for more content that I'm gonna be releasing
because to self-actualize one of the things you're going to
have to do is you're going to have to dismantle
many of the constructions that you created or your culture
has created over your entire lifetime and that process can
be a tricky process it's difficult to navigate that whole
thing right there's a lot of sneaky little counterintuitive games
that your mind will play on you that will sabotage
you in that quest so my objective is to provide
you with the knowledge the big picture understanding so that
you can go on this journey and ultimately purify yourself
of all this artificial nough sand get to the bare
truth of what you are what reality is and then
to live from place of freedom in your life so
that you're not limited or controlled or bullied by all
this baggage that you picked up from your social matrix

more to share sign up stay tuned and I'll see
you soon with more you
