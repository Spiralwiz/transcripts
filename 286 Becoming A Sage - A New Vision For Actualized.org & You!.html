            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/z2wNbLO02Wg' target='_blank'>Becoming A Sage - A New Vision For Actualized.org & You!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>New vision for Actualized.org</b>: Leo Gura, Leo, aims to evolve Actualized.org to focus on becoming a sage, the ultimate vision he identifies for one's life. He intends to develop it into a platform that provides resources and guidance on this journey towards sagehood.
</li><li><b>Concept of a sage</b>: According to Leo, sages or mystics, not celebrities or politicians, are the greatest humans who've lived, extracting the most "juice" out of life. A sage is not about success or achievement, but about self-mastery and full life utilization.
</li><li><b>Lack of exposure to the sage option</b>: Leo acknowledges that most people are not presented with the possibility of becoming a sage growing up. Moreover, there's a lack of resources providing a clear, step-by-step guide on becoming one.
</li><li><b>Sage University</b>: Leo envisions Actualized.org to act as a "sage University," offering a substantial catalog of models, frameworks, techniques, and methods necessary for becoming a sage.
</li><li><b>Defining a modern sage</b>: Leo suggests that a modern sage combines Eastern non-duality with Western philosophy, science, and art. This person masters consciousness while maintaining a deep conceptual understanding, balancing intellect and awareness without being categorical or detached from reality.
</li><li><b>Vision and exploration</b>: According to Leo, developing a clear vision is more important than outlining specific steps to achieve it. The path to becoming a sage requires personal exploration and maintaining a strong vision for success.
</li><li><b>Processing negative emotions</b>: Leo discusses the importance of developing a strong energy body that can convert negative emotions into love and truth, thus resulting in an unperturbed and impenetrable individual. 
</li><li><b>Knowledge seeking and application</b>: Leo highlights the necessity of practical knowledge and theoretical learning for spiritual development. He encourages studying diverse fields and seeking uncommon knowledge to develop a deep understanding and strive for truth.
</li><li><b>Criticism of viewers</b>: Leo criticizes viewers for wasting their time on immaterial activities. He emphasizes the importance of having a sense of purpose and being goal-oriented in spirituality. 
</li><li><b>Self-actualization's long-term commitment</b>: Leo mentions that self-actualization requires a significant investment of labor, time, and learning over a long time horizon. He contrasts this with the common expectation of immediate returns in investments.
</li><li><b>Understanding the qualities of a sage</b>: Sages possess self-mastery that's not focused on success or achievement; it's a virtuous quality that separates them from the average human. Despite their seemingly ordinary lifestyle on the surface, their inner transformation is profound and easily sensed if one is attuned to it.
</li><li><b>Importance of turning inward for transformation</b>: Sages have undergone a radical inner transformation, evidenced by their effortless embodiment of truth, consciousness, love, and goodness, and their distinct way of thinking and relating with world. This transformation isn't just tied to enlightenment, but goes beyond that.
</li><li><b>Vision of a modern mystic sage</b>: The modern mystic sage is an amalgamation of Eastern non-duality and Western philosophy, science, and art. This creates a balanced individual with deep conscious mastery and a comprehensive conceptual understanding, who is both creative and productive. They are also active in solving real-world problems using their mastery and understanding.
</li><li><b>What a sage is not</b>: A sage should not be mistaken for a cold, intellectually-oriented individual with little self-knowledge or emotional mastery. Also, a sage does not force their beliefs onto others. These individuals often lack inner introspection and are outwardly focused.
</li><li><b>The path to becoming a Sage</b>: The path to becoming a sage is complex and involves personal exploration, rather than specific guidelines or steps. Having a clear and strong vision is crucial, and the execution will follow naturally. The focus should be more on the ultimate vision, than on the individual steps to achieve it. 
</li><li><b>The misconception of immediate success</b>: It is essential to understand that sagehood requires a long-term commitment, and won't be achieved instantly. Emphasis should be on long time horizons, years of labor, time, and learning for significant results. This is often contrasted with a common expectation for immediate returns on investments.
</li><li><b>Path to Becoming a Sage</b>: Becoming a sage requires a dedicated and committed approach, involving thousands of technical steps, much like the process to become a neurosurgeon. The path to sagehood is complex and the important first step is solidifying a strong vision that motivates and guides.
</li><li><b>Importance of Vision</b>: A strong vision helps to navigate the complexity of becoming a sage - those with a weak vision may likely seek reassurances and a step-by-step formula, while those with strong visions will forge their own paths. Leo encourages deepening the vision for sagehood, avowing its importance.
</li><li><b>The How of Becoming a sage</b>: A broad outline involves: setting truth as the top value, wanting truth for its own sake, prioritizing truth even over personal desires; rejecting materialism and cultural/societal norms; and embarking on a spiritual purification process that includes body, mind, emotions, and habits.
</li><li><b>Developing a Strong Energy Body</b>: A critical part of becoming a sage lies in developing a strong energy body, an ability to convert incoming negative emotions into love and truth. This is not a job of intellectual understanding but a complete body transformation on the energy level.
</li><li><b>Theoretical Learning and Uncommon Knowledge</b>: Becoming a sage also demands extensive theoretical learning as Osho, a renowned sage who reportedly read over 150,000 books, sets an example. It requires seeking uncommon knowledge, sifting through vast information to find the most valuable insights. The focus is not merely on gaining knowledge, but on applying learned wisdom in daily life.
</li><li><b>Raising Awareness</b>: The path to sagehood entails regular meditation, self-inquiry, contemplation, and exploration of various perspectives. It also involves an understanding of life, human beings, animals, language, truth, falsehood, illusion, society, politics, and more.
</li><li><b>Exploring Non-ordinary States of Consciousness</b>: A crucial element that differentiates a sage from an academic intellectual is the exploration of non-ordinary states of consciousness. This exploration enables a deeper understanding and insight.
</li><li><b>The Need to Explore Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of discovering and experiencing various states of consciousness beyond our ordinary waking state. Experimentation with methods such as meditation, breathing techniques, and psychedelics is recommended to broaden awareness. 
</li><li><b>Advocacy for Creativity</b>: As a component in becoming a sage, Leo encourages viewers to explore their creative side and apply their knowledge in a way that benefits the world. This idea is expanded upon in Leo's 'Life Purpose Course' which provides guidance on self-expression and career.
</li><li><b>Big-Picture Thinking and Love for Humanity</b>: Sages are differentiated by their holistic and big-picture understanding of life, as opposed to an academic focus on a singular field. They are compassionate individuals who show unconditional love for fellow human beings and empathize with human suffering.
</li><li><b>Rejecting  Indifference and Negativity</b>: Leo dismisses the notion of not caring about the world or individuals due to realizing the illusory nature of life as unfulfilled and indicative of a lack of consciousness. To become a sage, a higher level of awareness and compassion is required that culminates in unconditional love for reality.
</li><li><b>Contributing to the Elevation of Collective Awareness</b>: Encouraging people to raise their own awareness is seen as a possible life purpose for individuals pursuing sagehood. However, this doesn't necessitate becoming spiritual teachers; this guiding principle can be integrated into multiple fields like technology, medicine, arts, and science to increase overall human consciousness.
</li><li><b>Sagehood as a Non-Universal Path</b>: While Leo believes that the transformation into a sage would ultimately be beneficial for everyone, he acknowledges that this path isn't suitable for everyone. Individuals must have a personal drive to become a sage, and this desire should not be forced upon them.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Life Purpose and the Journey of Becoming a Sage</b>: Leo clarifies that the pursuit of becoming a sage and the discovery of one's life purpose are not mutually exclusive. While the former is a personal journey of self-mastery, the latter relates to one's career and creative ambitions.
</li><li><b>Reconciling the Dichotomy between the Illusion of Life and the Necessity for a Purpose</b>: Despite enlightenment revealing life's illusory nature, a life purpose remains crucial. It motivates individuals to strive for self-expression through meaningful work and guides them towards being enlightened in fields they are passionate about. Leo contends that realizing one's purpose enhances the process of self-realization and fills life with passion and purpose, similar to historical enlightened figures.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Course and the Illusion of Life</b>: The Life Purpose Course is designed to help individuals find their career and creative path, focusing on self-expression, enlightenment, and earning from meaningful work. Despite the fact life could be considered an illusion, it's possible to create a purpose. This purpose isn't inherently real but a construct that should be created if it brings enjoyment. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Vision and Purpose</b>: Despite understanding life as an illusion, having a sense of purpose is still significant. Very often, advanced stages of enlightenment require dedication and commitment; individuals should be serious about their journey towards self-mastery. Constructing temporary objectives aids in initial motivation and inspiration. Without this, it's likely that one would continue previously unfulfilling or unproductive habits.
</li><li><b>Potential Misdirection in Spirituality</b>: Advanced spiritual practice isn't just about realization and understanding that life is an illusion. It also involves setting goals for spiritual growth and being oriented towards them. Otherwise, spiritual seekers may become stagnant and continue to suffer from lack of wisdom and excessive materialism.
</li><li><b>Future Content for Actualized.org</b>: Promised content includes deeper, more abstract, and philosophical subjects with focus on understanding rather than success. Also, these topics will require more individual initiative and effort as they would be less practical and patterned, needing the seeker to create an action plan for enactment and embodiment in life. The approach will require a longer time horizon and consistent investment in terms of labor, time, and learning.
</li><li><b>Becoming a Sage</b>: Becoming a sage is regarded as having no worthy alternative. It's proposed that there's nothing more purposeful to dedicate life to. Hence, the content of Actualized.org plans to reflect this evolutionary journey. However, viewer feedback is important to ensure this path resonates with the audience.
</li><li><b>Audience Engagement for Feedback</b>: Encouragement is given for audience to share their thoughts about the proposed vision of becoming a sage. Audience feedback and interaction is important in determining the direction in which the content would progress.
</li><li><b>Invitation to Actualized.org</b>: The audience is invited to sign up for the newsletter at Actualized.org for more videos and insights on how to become a sage. The aim is to provide profound insights on life and reality. The strategic vision includes offering guidance on self-mastery for maximized life experience.
