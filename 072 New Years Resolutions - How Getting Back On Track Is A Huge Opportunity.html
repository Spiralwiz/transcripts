            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-PuRL9LCF4w' target='_blank'>New Years Resolutions - How Getting Back On Track Is A Huge Opportunity</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>New Year's Resolutions and Overcoming Setbacks</b>: Leo Gura discusses the importance and challenge of setting and sticking to New Year's resolutions. He emphasizes the importance of setting ambitious goals, even if they seem unrealistic. Gura shares his own ambitious resolution to shoot one video every day in 2014, acknowledging that it is not easy to maintain this level of output every day.
</li><li><b>Adjusting Plans and Tracking Progress</b>: Leo highlights the importance of flexibility and adaptability in achieving goals. He explains that it's okay to adjust plans as needed, like recording more than one video some days and none on others, aiming for the overall goal of 365 videos in the year. He emphasises that falling behind is not a failure, but part of the process.
</li><li><b>Importance of a Daily Ritual</b>: Despite acknowledging the necessity of flexibility, Gura emphasizes that maintaining a daily habit or ritual can still provide significant value, and encourages striving to maintain such habits even in the face of setbacks.
</li><li><b>Recovering from Setbacks</b>: He shares his personal experience of missing a day and emphasizes the importance of getting back on track after a setback. He discourages the idea of seeing a missed day as a failure or an excuse to give up, instead advocating for the mindset that it's normal to slip and important to recover.
</li><li><b>Adaptive Mindset vs Perfectionist Mindset</b>: The concept of having an 'optimistic' or 'optimalist' mindset is emphasized. Leo advises viewers to anticipate setbacks and have strategic countermeasures planned, illustrating this with the analogy of a golfer dealing with a bad stroke.
</li><li><b>Perfection is Not Attainable</b>: Leo stresses that perfection is not an attainable goal in life, business, or any other endeavor and encourages viewers to be content with making the best of what they have, even in challenging circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Continuous Improvement</b>: Leo advises focusing on incremental improvements rather than fixed, unrealistic goals, saying that even the most successful people experience setbacks and what sets them apart is their ability to recover and continue moving forward. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion</b>: Overall, Leo advises viewers to set ambitious goals, anticipate setbacks, remain flexible and adaptive in their approach, and always strive to make the best of their circumstances and continue making progress despite any setbacks.
</li><li><b>Setbacks and dealing with missed targets</b>: Leo Gura highlights that it's natural to feel disappointed when a target or resolution is missed, such as missing a day in his new year's resolution to shoot a video every day. However, he emphasizes that such setbacks are minor in the grand scheme of things and encourages viewers to get back on track without dwelling on the missed day.
</li><li><b>Risk of using missed targets as an excuse</b>: Gura warns that missing a day could be used as an excuse to miss more days, which can lead to a slippery slope of continual missed days and eventually quitting entirely. He states that maintaining motivation is key and reminds not to live in the past or dwell on missed opportunities.
</li><li><b>Moving away from a perfectionist mindset</b>: Gura suggests replacing a perfectionist mindset, which focuses on every action being perfect, with a more strategic and adaptive mindset. He shares his struggle with perfectionism and how changing his attitude has improved his performance in business and life in general.
</li><li><b>Ambitious goals and allowing for margin of error</b>: Gura argues for the necessity of setting ambitious goals and allowing a margin of error. He explains that achieving 90% of an ambitious goal such as creating a $5 million business or losing 50 pounds is a significant accomplishment. He compares this to setting easily attainable goals, stating that underachieving on a lofty goal can result in greater success than overachieving on a small one.
</li><li><b>Avoiding the trap of aiming for 100% perfection</b>: Gura mentions the danger of aiming for 100% perfection in every endeavor, which can lead to disappointment and discouragement. He suggests aiming for a realistic and attainable goal such as 90 or 95, and being content with that. This gradual improvement is better than setting unrealistic goals and constantly falling short.
</li><li><b>The danger of quitting</b>: Gura identifies quitting as the greatest danger in any project or endeavor. He advises that the quality of work will improve over time as efforts are maintained, but quitting brings an end to improvement. He encourages viewers to get back on track with their resolutions or projects, regardless of the setbacks experienced.
</li><li><b>Continued commitment to personal development</b>: Gura wraps up by encouraging viewers to stay on track with their resolutions and not get discouraged by missed targets. He points out that even if they have strayed from their path, they can still make significant progress by getting back on track immediately. Keep trying to make success is the overall message he conveys.
