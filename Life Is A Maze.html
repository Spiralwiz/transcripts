[Music] I want to elaborate on this metaphor that's very
helpful for orienting people in this work so if you're
new to personal development and self-actualization then this is for
you and that's the metaphor of the rat in the
maze and this is sort of gonna put everything together
in a big picture for you with what we're doing
with actualized org and of course what that means is
what you're doing in life you start life like a
rat dropped into a maze think about that don't just
don't just skip over it but really think about what
that means to be a rat dropped in a maze
you start life with zero understanding that means you have
no idea who you are in this life no idea
what reality is what this maze is why is here
no idea what anything means no idea the value of
anything no idea what's right or what's wrong no idea
what to fear or what to desire no idea what
traps and dangers exist no idea how your body works
no idea how your mind works no idea how your
emotions work or what they mean no idea how society
works no idea who to trust no idea what death
is no idea what to do no idea how to
distinguish the truth from falsehood no idea who the good
guys are are who the bad guys are no idea
what's possible or what's impossible and you don't even have
the idea that you are inside of a maze yet
that's where you begin life think about that that's that's
a sobering fact right there and that is your situation
you've been scrambling through this maze for your entire life
from the very beginning up to where you are right
now and this whole time you've basically just been flying
by the seat of your pants you've been winging it
and mostly you didn't even have an idea that you
were inside of a maze because very quickly you were
bombarded with all sorts of programming from your family from
your school from your friends from your culture from the
media and and elsewhere that started to make you believe
that the maze is more well understood than it really
is and everybody around you started telling you that oh
look it's this way here's how it is here's what
the goals are here's what the values are here's what
everything means here's what's right and wrong and all of
that such that very quickly probably within within 10 years
of your life you almost completely lost sight of the
fundamental predicament that you are in that you were born
into which is that you don't know and these deep
profound existential questions about the very nature of the maze
and why you're in it at all these were very
quickly replaced and crowded out of your mind by all
the programming that you received and then once you were
programmed with that then you went off to the races
and you started crawling through this maze like the rat
that you are chasing after cheese convinced that what you
want is cheese running from bit of cheese to bit
of cheese to bit of cheese but of course the
problem with every piece of cheese is that it only
lasts you for so long you nibble on it and
then before you know it it's gone and then your
star again you another piece of cheese and so you
keep running and so that's where you find yourself and
in this process you've lost sight of the big picture
and you've stopped asking the deep questions you've stopped caring
about them because you've been so convinced by everyone around
you by all the other rats running around you've been
convinced that they know what's up because all of them
are chasing cheese so you think that well hey this
must be a game of chasing cheese that's what this
thing must be and then that's what you start to
do and this is such a big problem that you
don't even know you don't even realize that there can
be an alternative to chasing cheese and you forget about
the big epistemic problems that you started life with namely
who do you trust what do you do what should
you be working towards in this life you've lost sight
of this you've stopped asking these questions you've stopped caring
about understanding but understanding is the key to unraveling this
whole maze don't you see understanding is your fundamental problem
whatever other problems you think you have in life they
all boil down to a lack of understanding a lack
of existential understanding and the tragic irony of that is
when I use that word existential or metaphysical or epistemic
people's eyes glaze over and they tune out and they
think I'm talking about something that has nothing to do
with their life the tragic irony here is that understanding
would solve all of your little petty problems but you're
so busy solving your petty little problems that you're too
busy to care about developing deep understanding of what the
hell is going on here that's the core problem and
that problem stems from the fact that you've lost touch
with your fundamental predicament with the situation that you're in
you know much less about the maze than you ever
thought you did and mankind as a whole and especially
our culture as a whole knows far less about the
maze than it likes to claim that it does because
it's really tempting especially these days in the 21st century
you know it was different 2,000 years ago because 2,000
years ago reality still seemed very mystical back then and
it seemed very mysterious and there were so many unanswered
questions that it's that it was it was obvious to
everybody that there's so much stuff we don't know we've
only seen the tip of the iceberg but today in
the 21st century it's the exact opposite the illusion is
almost total and society presents itself to you like it
knows and understands and it's figured out all of reality
except for a few minor details which the scientist will
figure out in the next hundred years and then by
then we'll wrap this whole thing up that's the idea
that's the story you're presented with and nothing can be
further from the truth so what do you do when
you're in this situation what do you do when you're
a rat dropped in the maze well you go back
to the fundamentals and the first thing you do is
you appreciate the depth of the problem which is something
that most people have never paused for a minute to
really ponder is the depth of this predicament most people
just start running off after the cheese to really sit
there and to ponder don't skip over this point ponder
this for days for weeks you ponder this the depth
of your predicament how little you really know to start
to question all your motives and ideas about what reality
is and what you should be doing within it and
your place within it and what's possible and what's impossible
to really start to understand that you don't know these
things you've maybe only been led to believe certain things
but you don't really know for yourself that's step number
one and only by completing stuff number one by really
comprehending the gravity of your situation then you can move
on to step number two which is making a commitment
to figuring this out and this is this is a
a lifelong commitment you make this is a kassir ease
coming and there's no frivolous commitment this is this is
a commitment more serious than marriage this is a commitment
Moore's more serious than having children it's the commitment to
figure out what this maze is at a fundamental level
not to get somebody's stories and opinions about it but
to really figure it out such that you understand how
the whole thing works and why it's here this is
the point of life the point of life is to
figure out the maze but you can't get to this
point unless you first really understand the depth of your
predicament which is why I'm stressing this point this maze
that you're in it's vast and it's profoundly misleading far
more misleading than you ever imagined or were ever led
to believe it's a maze within a maze within a
maze with animes and it's no ordinary dumb box of
a maze this is a non-physical maze this throws people
for a loop the maze is non-physical it's clever its
intelligent it's deeply intelligent it's no dumb box it's no
mechanical clockwork this maze is filled with incredible horrors and
delights this maze is filled with dead ends shiny distractions
and false exits just when you think you've solved the
maze is actually when you've gone deeper into the maze
it's counterintuitive it's paradoxical tends to work backwards it tends
to have backfiring mechanisms where you do one thing where
you think that's gonna get you to the end and
it actually ends up singing you deeper to a deeper
level of the maze and you don't know what the
maze will hold that's a key point that's a key
point it seems so obvious but that's precisely where people
go wrong is they don't appreciate the fact that to
admit and to really comprehend the fact that you don't
know what's in this maze what lies around the corner
and there are so many different corners in the maze
so many different alleyways you can go down and you
just don't know what's gonna be down one of these
alleyways it could be a terrible horror or it could
be the most miraculous magical thing that you could possibly
conceive and you don't know unless you explore that particular
alleyway but see people get trained by looking at all
the other rats they follow only those alleyways that all
the other rats are following that means that the majority
of the maze 99% of the maze never gets explored
by most rats most rats stick to the well-trodden thoroughfares
and that gets you a false sense of thinking like
well but leo I've kind of gone down various corridors
and I kind of know what the maze is no
you've only gone down those corridors which 99% of all
the other dumb rats have gone down chasing cheese you've
only gone down those corridors that have cheese and so
therefore that gives you a completely distorted notion of what
reality holds and what's possible and what's impossible this maze
isn't just vast and deep it's literally infinite you're inside
of an infinite maze with no beginning and no end
that's why I say it's non-physical just to think that
you are inside of a physical maze is already to
trap yourself within a maze inside the maze because this
notion of physicality and materiality this notion of a reality
and to hold reality as something objective and tangible and
real out there and that you know and that you
understand that already it already is to trap yourself that's
already to to limit your ability to explore this maze
because once you lock yourself into that paradigm then that's
the only part of the maze you can explore are
those parts that appear physical to you and you also
start to grossly underestimate how clever and intelligent and deceptive
this maze can be because when you think of the
maze is just being a dumb box with no cleverness
behind it then you never expect that it could really
deceive you and trick you why would you it's just
a dumb box but when you start to suspect that
the maze is alive its dynamic its evolving it's more
fake and shifting it's a trickster when you start to
suspect that when you start to suspect that the maze
is your own mind then you start to take seriously
the possibility of deceptions and illusions and self deceptions and
all forms of trickery and then it becomes much more
interesting then all sorts of new possibilities open up for
you then you even start to consider the possibility that
maybe physicality itself reality itself is just a little corner
of this much vaster system but even though this maze
is infinite it is possible to escape it it is
possible to understand it and it is possible to master
it so at this point you might be saying yourself
Willy okay fine so tell me how do I solve
this maze then you have all the answers and of
course if only we're that easy I can't tell you
how to solve your maze because the truth is is
that you created your own maze and every rats maze
is different so no one can tell you how to
solve your maze because your maze is unique every rat
has a unique maze every rat starts in a different
part of this infinite maze and because this maze is
non-physical because it's alive and dynamic and intelligent and involving
the maze is not the same as it is from
year to year and era to era the maze of
a hundred years ago is not the maze of today
it's not the maze of a thousand years ago is
not the maze that your children will be running through
the maze of someone born in India is not the
same as the maze of someone born in Africa or
America or China or Russia or Europe and anyways it's
not about me giving you the answer to escaping the
maze it's about the journey that's the beauty of this
maze is that you've been put inside it to figure
it out it's a puzzle I hope you like puzzles
because that's what you've been born into if you don't
like puzzles man you're gonna have you're gonna have some
difficulty with life because life's a puzzle so you better
start to develop a love for puzzles figuring [ __
] out that's your job here and of course even
though the maze is different for everybody there are still
many commonalities between all the rats rats can be different
but also rats all tend to be the same they
tend to fall into the same predictable traps rats tend
to be very very predictable creatures as you are and
that's what actually eyes that helps you with to the
extent that I can help you at all in navigate
this maze is I can help you with pointing out
the the various traps and pitfalls and all the ways
in which you are predictable and that's what actualize other
org is that's what all the videos are every single
video is basically pointing out various traps of the maze
that you're falling into and struggling with so I'm not
gonna go into all the detail here because I just
can't because that's what all the hundreds of other videos
I have do is they go in-depth into one particular
trap or another and there are hundreds of these traps
there's not just a dozen there's hundreds hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and much nuance and detail to every trap
you could spend years studying just one particular trap people
make entire careers out of helping people navigate just one
particular trap such as abusive relationships you know there are
rats who will waste ten twenty thirty years of their
life trapped in an abusive relationship that's one trap of
this mates some other rat will spend 20 years watching
television that's another trap in this maze some other rat
will go join some ideological group some political party and
spend 10 20 years doing that and that will be
a trap for them and so there's there's hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of these traps rats are dying every
single day thousands of rats are getting killed by all
these traps in this maze so your job is to
be more clever to be smarter than the average rat
otherwise you'll end up just like them and you know
what the the brutal statistics are that less than one
percent of rats ever solve this maze that means that
99% of rats die without understanding what the maze is
or how it works or why they were here look
around you double check this for yourself look at all
the people you know in your life your family your
friends your co-workers your teachers your mentors and all of
them what are they these are people who are stuck
inside the maze along with you and very few of
them are working to solve the maze mostly what they're
doing is they're just chasing fees because most of the
rats got program very early in life just to chase
cheese and that's all they know how to do and
then of course they tricked themselves thinking that well but
I Leah look how much cheese I've acquired in the
maze aha look at me that must mean I've solved
the maze cuz I got the most cheese no it
doesn't it just means you're the biggest rat amazed that's
all that means you become a big fat rat that
is not the same thing as escaping the maze what
does it mean to solve the maze you solve the
maze when you discover who you are what reality is
and what your place is within this reality what your
purpose in it is when you discover why the whole
thing exists and how and why people get lost in
this maze what does it take to solve the maze
there are some key principles these are the principles that
you need to really think about and to master and
a first month first and foremost is inquiry research an
independent exploration that's what nave knew that's what maze navigation
is all about it's about inquiry inquiry is about looking
in different directions and exploring different alleyways to see what
lies down that way and that's what research boils down
to that's what exploration is and of course there's risks
that come with every new alleyway that you go down
and this maze has some dangerous traps in it some
stuff some alleyways here in this maze they'll kill you
so research is tricky the problem is that most people
don't do any serious research in life they just stumble
and bumble around just from like hitting walls like like
a fly in a glass bottle just sort of bumping
into walls here and there and there and here and
you know there's there's no there's no sense of strategy
or like intelligence about how they go doing research in
life what research means is that you should be devouring
books teachers workshops videos courses Google philosophy contemplation asking questions
forums psychedelics all of these are different ways of doing
research but almost nobody does this and if they do
is just purely by accident they read some book accidentally
they take a psychedelic once accidentally on a whim because
their friend gave them something they don't even know what
it is they just take it or they they watch
a video accidentally randomly some random video about something and
then they forget about it the next day they Google
some search phrase and something comes up but then they
forget about that and then it's just and maybe they
ask a question if it's a week piddly little question
and that question doesn't really change their life and so
they they don't because they don't see the the fundamental
predicament of their lack of understanding they don't bother to
do any serious research or what they call research is
actually a lot of people call research is just following
all the other rats they think that's research they think
just reading books and blindly listening to videos is is
doing research that's not research what I mean by research
is independent for yourself school that doesn't count as research
everything you learn in school throw it out that ain't
research none of that counts towards your research everything you
learn in university if you have a PhD if you're
a professor none of that counts that ain't research that's
[ __ ] that's not solving the mace that's chasing
cheese that's you being programmed and indoctrinated that's what that
is that's the opposite of research by research I mean
independent you do it by yourself for yourself for the
purposes of escaping the maze that's the kind of research
that almost nobody in life has ever seriously undertaken and
that's it's a long-term effort that's not something you do
for a week or for a month or for a
year that's something you do for decades what I'm talking
about here sounds very simple but people overlook the obvious
that's how we stay trapped in the maze you might
think you've read books and you've you've listened to teachers
and you've watched the videos and you've taken a psychedelic
and and you've asked some questions and you've done some
contemplation no no not nearly deeply enough you've read the
wrong books you've written to the wrong teachers you haven't
independently verify the things that they've said you haven't found
the truth of it in your own direct experience you
haven't seriously asked any high-quality questions about life I'm I'm
constantly baffled because I open myself to answering people's questions
a lot I devote a significant chunk of my life's
time to answering people's questions I answer hundreds of questions
every single week I've answered thousands tens of thousands of
questions in my short career of running actualized over the
last five years I've answered literally tens of thousands maybe
a hundred thousand questions and I'm shocked by how low-quality
the questions I get are for every hundred questions I'll
get one high quality question and 99 ridiculous petty myopic
irrelevant questions there are teachers who will offer guidance to
you for free rats who have escaped the maze who
have all the answers who are just sitting around you
can email them you could talk to them you can
ask them comments and questions on forums and on YouTube
and other places you could even ask to meet with
them face-to-face and many of them will meet you because
the irony is is that those rats who have escaped
the maze they've done such a rare thing that the
majority of rats don't acknowledge the significance of what these
rats have accomplished the ones who escaped and so they
don't even bother asking the ones who've escaped what do
I need to know to escape what am I doing
wrong they don't even bother they don't even bother to
ask these questions just teaching yourself how to ask high-quality
questions that one thing if you can spend the next
year to train yourself how to ask high-quality questions that
right there will transform the whole trajectory of your life
contemplation I keep talking about contemplation but nobody listens to
me nobody seriously contemplates the things that I say for
every thousand people but people that watch one of my
videos and hear me tell them to contemplate something that
I say they don't actually do it Google you have
a tool at your disposal Google that you can go
into you can type stuff into and get answers to
almost any literally any question that you have ever imagined
in your entire life has already been asked and already
in the Google database all you need to go is
type into Google your question and you will get all
sorts of responses now of course I'm not saying that
the first response you get is going to be the
right one when you're doing deep research you have to
be able to go through many sources and know how
to sort the the wheat from the chaff that's very
important so part of the mistake that people make is
they go start to do research and they just start
to blindly believe whatever the first thing that they research
that ain't real research that's [ __ ] real research
and when you're using hundreds of sources studying hundreds of
diverse perspectives keeping your mind open to all the different
possibilities and then inter connecting all the dots over a
long period of time that's that's what serious research looks
like when you're asking powerful questions when you're googling away
when you're reading 100 of books when you're reading the
right books when you go out of your way to
research what are the right books not just any books
will do to escape the maze you need the right
books you need the right teachers the right videos the
right courses but the good news is is that if
you were serious about search you would start to see
everything aligned towards that end we live in a time
where it's easier than ever to do research you can
find cheap books free books get used books on Amazon
it's like it's so easy these days I try to
imagine how hard it would have been to to do
this 500 years ago even 50 years ago and yet
people just take it completely for granted what we're talking
about to escape this maze is really the hero's journey
go check out my video the greatest hero's journey that's
that's all about this and there I give you some
more details about that also my life purpose course is
all about how to get serious about the hero's journey
and understanding what that really means and how to get
going on it but the problem see the problems that
most people don't don't actually do a hero's journey in
their life what one in a hundred maybe one in
a thousand probably do a hero's journey in their life
the rest don't the rest are just following all the
other rats and that's a huge a huge point right
there is stop following other rats you cannot escape this
maze by following other rats you need to think for
yourself that's one of the biggest traps that people fall
into is they don't think for themselves they think they
can just get on to some sort of technique some
sort of cookie cutter solution that's going to solve this
maze for them and then it turns out not to
work and that's what legend basically is what is religion
fundamentally it is when some rat escapes the maze and
realizes how wonderful it is outside the maze that he
comes back to all do the rats it says hey
I can help you guys escape and so they all
start to listen to him and start to blindly follow
him and so whatever insights he had from his personal
journey of escaping them with the maze he delivers those
insights to the other rats and those rats just say
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and they just blindly follow that and
then a thousand years later they're still blindly following that
without realizing that in a thousand years the maze has
completely changed and morphed and evolved such that by following
those principles you'll actually end up shooting yourself in the
foot and getting yourself even deeper stuck in the maze
and also of course what's not recognized is that every
rat has a unique situation different geographic location different upbringing
different genetics different personality different psychology different physical abilities and
ailments different strengths and weaknesses different genders different proclivities different
kinds of fears different kinds of trauma that they received
as a baby rat growing up so all of these
are huge factors which make it impossible to have a
one-size-fits-all solution to get every rat to escape the maze
this means that the number one thing you need to
escape the maze is to think for yourself independently which
almost no rats like to do they like to just
get a already maze solution and by the way not
just religion but if this isn't I'm not just picking
on on theistic people same problem with any kind of
other ideologies secular ideologies also will get you lost in
the maze even psychotherapy even various kinds of self-help material
secular self-help material and advice and psychological advice that you
might get from some university professor for example how to
live your life which might be just secular and it
might sound like good advice but it'll it'll still not
really work for you unless you think for yourself another
important point for escaping the maze is going meta which
means that you need to study the maze itself rather
than how to get more cheese and it's where people
get really trapped is they think that well leo so
what you mean by research is you you want okay
well yeah let me go but get some books and
watch some videos and ask some questions and do some
googling for how to get more cheese and then that's
what's called research no that's not research that's you driving
yourself deeper into the maze you need to start to
ask the kind of questions which are not about the
cheese but about the maze itself like what is the
maze what's it doing here what's it made out of
is it a physical maze or a non-physical maze how
do I know who can I trust in the maze
what kinds of research is legitimate what kinds of research
will get me trapped deeper in the maze and what
kinds of research will actually help me escape the maze
you see so these are questions these are meta questions
questions about questions questions about the maze itself the structure
of the maze that's where Jean to study you just
study the structure of the maze and why it's there
and what it's doing in order to be able to
overcome all the various tricks and traps it's super important
that you study hundreds of diverse perspectives this is one
of your key safeguards against getting trapped and stuck in
some cul de sac in the maze which very many
rats do and the reason that happens is because they
didn't bother to study of diverse perspectives I study hundreds
of perspectives not just ten not a few dozen hundreds
hundreds of different books from hundreds of different disciplines hundreds
of different teachers from all sorts of cultures traditions eras
this is necessary because all of them will only provide
you with a partial perspective nobody has the full perspective
nobody will provide you with the full truth at best
you will get a partial truth at best and sometimes
you will get a complete delusion and deception and the
only way you will be able to know what's delusion
and deception is by cross-referencing all of these hundreds of
diverse sources against one another and stepping back and looking
and saying okay now I can see who's full of
[ __ ] they're all that's the only that's the
only way you're gonna prevent yourself from making catastrophic mistakes
running into dead ends and also because there are so
many different kinds of traps that exist that if you
only study a few perspectives you will only understand a
small handful of all the potential traps which will not
be enough for you to avoid all the traps that
exist and because every teacher who teaches you or every
book or teaching or whatever every philosophy whatever it is
they will only be able to present you with a
small section like less than 10% of all the traps
that exist and because you're a unique rat and the
teacher who's teaching you is it's his own unique rat
the traps that he worried about to escape the maze
were different than the traps that you need to worry
about and he can't anticipate all of your traps because
you're different than him and because there are so many
of them which is why you need to study all
these different perspectives this means literally reading hundreds of books
you need to read I would say to real succeed
in this project you need to read at least 300
books like that's probably a bare minimum read at least
300 books and by that I don't mean fiction books
and novels about vampires and Game of Thrones and [
__ ] no I mean like hardcore technical self-help psychology
philosophy physics metaphysics spirituality non-duality psychedelics that sort of stuff
the kind of books that you can't just skim through
or speed-read use the kind of books you got to
sit down read them cover to cover seriously slowly underlining
highlighting really contemplating what's being talked about connecting dots I
don't mean that the books you've read in school or
in college count towards these 300 these 300 they count
after college after you're done with college after you exit
that indoctrination system and you're thinking just for yourself now
independently you're doing independent research for the first time in
your life now your counter starts it starts at zero
so how many books have you read since then radical
open-mindedness is absolutely central to be able to do this
independent research you can you start to question the most
obvious things you need to investigate your own mind yourself
and your emotions you need solitude and free time to
do this investigation which of course most rats don't have
because they're so busy chasing after cheese you need to
have intention and focus to escape Benes this is critical
intention and focus intention is something I'll shoot a dedicated
episode on in the future but you need to have
a sense of what you're doing and why you're doing
it why it's important to you that's intention and you
to have focus that means you need to be clear
in your own mind about what you're doing it you
need to be decisive you also need to have a
strong work ethic and discipline if you ever want to
escape the maze you need to have some form of
note-taking a commonplace book go see my episode about keeping
a commonplace book because as you're doing all this research
and you're reading all these 300 books and so forth
and going to courses and watching videos and all this
how are you putting all this guy how do you
connecting all these dots just in your mind you're just
gonna connect these dots in your mind no it's gonna
escape your mind you can't keep all this information inside
your mind so you need some sort of note-taking system
some way to organize it all you also need vision
and patience because this project will take a long time
this is not a quick fix solution to anything this
will take years this will take decades this is your
entire life's work here is escaping this maze so yes
it takes some time some decades this is not a
problem you don't need to rush through it be patient
with it have the long term vision of this is
what you're doing this is what your life is about
and actually start to enjoy the process this is not
a chore this is exciting this is actually what life
is it's exciting to be navigating this mades there's new
stuff around the corner that's adventure excitement for you right
there that's fun but it's a serious sort of fun
you see it's not a it's not a sort of
immature fun that you get from playing a video game
where it's all very sugary you know in a video
game all the systems have been designed to just reward
you with pleasure at every turn such that you don't
need any strong work ethic you don't need to really
think about anything you don't need to sometimes grind through
some phase of the game although sometimes some some games
you do need to grind but um but generally games
are very sugary but in life it's a more mature
version of a game you see and you got to
build it up it takes time and momentum to build
it up to this point where you actually start to
engage in the game of life in the same way
that you get engaged in a video game see it's
very easy to get engaged with a video game because
that's how they're designed but life is designed for a
more mature sort of palette and so it takes a
few years of work maybe even a decade of work
for you to really ramp yourself up and build up
enough momentum to really start say oh yeah now you
know I'm working on this every single day and it's
exciting it's fun and there's new stuff happening in my
life and I'm really exploring this maze the reason that
many people never even really start to explore the maze
is because they already feel so stuck and they don't
have enough vision and patience to go through that initial
process of building the momentum it's much easier for them
to just plug into something quick like playing some online
game where they get a sort of a simulation of
escaping the maze but really it's happening inside of this
virtual box environment and then they get absolutely no reward
for it in fact when you beat a game it's
the exact opposite of escaping the maze you feel terrible
there's no there's no real reward at the end of
that tunnel unlike with real life another important component to
escaping the maze just practices that increase your awareness having
these practices and doing them de leus is super important
because you're not going to be able to escape the
maze purely at your current level of awareness raising your
awareness is central to escaping this maze but it's not
the only component and this where people go wrong is
they think that well since awareness is everything I'll just
I'll just work on my awareness and ignore all the
other stuff ignore all the research I'll just do my
one meditation practice and that's gonna solve my whole life
and of course it won't raising your awareness is a
very important opponent but it's still one component and lastly
what I'll tell you is you need heart and love
and intuition you need to bring love and heart into
your research into your life purpose into your work into
this whole process of figuring out life you're doing it
for love for the joy of it you love the
maze and you're using your intuition more than just your
logical brain to connect the dots because your intuition is
much more intelligent than your logical mind your intuition is
multi parallel and nonlinear whereas your logical mind is very
narrow and very sequential and it's way too linear to
figure this maze out because guess what you're inside of
a nonlinear maze it's a non-euclidean maze it's a non
Aristotelian maze it's a non Newtonian maze so you might
wonder leo well what lies for me outside this maze
and this is difficult to communicate this is part of
the whole problem of escaping the maze is that what
lies outside the maze is so remarkable so incredible so
how astounding that it's impossible to communicate to anyone inside
the maze and this makes it very difficult to explain
to the rat why is worth his while to do
all this work to escape the maze because the dumb
rat needs a simple gross material vision that he can
just latch on to like a piece of cheese see
the rat understands cheese he knows its smell he knows
its yellow color and so for him that's what has
motivated his whole life is chasing these the cheesy objects
but what lies outside the maze is something is something
of a different of a different kind altogether it's not
cheese and so it's difficult to explain what it really
is and why it's worth pursuing really what lies outside
the maze is unimaginable beauty the way life was meant
to be lived the true life you don't know what
true life really is so far as you're in the
maze and you're chasing cheese and the more that you
figure out of the maze the greater your life becomes
until you reach levels of life that are so extraordinary
and so remarkable that you have no words for it
and it becomes impossible to explain it to anybody around
you because any rat that you tell about it to
it just goes over their head because all they understand
is cheese they can't understand the value of anything but
cheese because that's what they've been chasing their whole life
so it's very much worth your a while to escape
the maze but I can't quite explain to you why
exactly that is that's why it takes a certain kind
of intuition and a certain kind of faith that it
will be worthwhile to escape the maze you don't know
for sure but you couldn't do it because you've been
dropped in this maze and you realize that hey I
know nothing about it that means that I also don't
know how amazing it could get I don't know how
amazing life can get so I don't want to assume
that it can only get so amazing when in fact
you can get a million times more amazing right so
I don't artificially limit myself so what I want to
do is I just want to leave the question open
as to how amazing it can be and I want
to Harbor the intuition or the faith if you want
to call it that that it can get really [
__ ] amazing I don't know for sure of course
you can't know until you do it that's part of
the beauty of the maze is that the more you
figure out of it that the more you the more
of the maze you figure out the more astounded you
become at how amazing it is and just how more
and more and more and more amazing it gets to
the point where you reach a certain point where you
say this is it's not possible anymore it's like it's
beyond human levels of a happiness or joy or anything
it's just it's it's beyond words and that's actually what
makes it so amazing what something am a is something
that's really amazing is it's it's literally beyond your ability
to express that's true amazement and that you can definitely
get by by solving this thing so I want you
to start to live every day of your life as
though you are figuring out this maze this is your
highest strategic intent if you remember my episode about being
a strategic [ __ ] I talked about strategic intent
and how you need that to be a good strategist
well here it is for your life is you ask
yourself everyday what am i doing today and the answer
is I'm figuring out life that's the overarching thing that
I'm trying to do I'm trying to figure out life
and how am I doing that by researching by studying
by taking notes by contemplating by by putting pieces together
by doing research by by going out there and taking
all the steps that then my research entails you see
research isn't just about sitting back and googling stuff and
watching videos and taking notes research is also like when
you research you will also come to these points where
you you realize like oh that means that if this
is true then I got to go out there and
do this and then you have to go out there
and do that take the action so this is also
the research also comes with action steps so you take
that action then that opens up a new domain of
research so you do some more research that's as well
if that's true then I got to do this and
so then you got do that and sometimes takes you
a year or two to figure that or two to
complete that step and so you keep doing that and
you kind of baby step your way further up and
up the maze until you're all the way out so
that's what you're doing every day you're not getting up
to go to your boring lame nine-to-five job that that's
not strategic intent it's a waste of life is what
that is you're not waking up to go to school
to to get an a on your test that's [
__ ] that's not figuring out life you're waking up
every morning and you're thinking as you're brushing your teeth
you're thinking okay what's the next thing I got to
figure out about this maze to escape it that's what
you're thinking and if you're going to work because you
got to go to work to pay your bills I
understand that there are realities within this maze you know
the rats do need some cheese you can't eliminate all
the cheese chasing because if you don't get enough cheese
you're gonna start to death in the maze before you
escape so you do need to nibble on some cheese
here and there that's what your job is and your
schooling and so forth so yeah you still need to
do that but as you're like for example going to
your job and maybe you have some sales job or
you're just standing around most of the day waiting for
customers to come to you so you can ring them
up or something you're thinking you're making plans you're you're
visualizing you're meditating you know whatever you're doing you're finding
ways to make use of your time whatever time you've
got to be figuring this [ __ ] out you're
philosophizing you're contemplating whatever you're doing maybe you even have
a book that you could pull out that you can
read a little bit here and there underline and highlight
while you're waiting for some customer to come by I
see it becomes strategic because as long as you have
the intent to solve the maze that becomes enough the
secret is is that you don't actually need to know
how to solve the maze this is a huge sticking
point for people they think they're all leo but but
I don't know how it seems like you have some
answers but Leo you're being so vague here you're not
telling me how to escape the maze so I don't
know it sounds like a good idea it sounds nice
but I don't know what next step to take you
don't need to know it doesn't matter that's the beauty
of it you don't need to know what you need
is you need the intent you need the desire you
need that that sense of purpose every day that's what
you really need if you have that the Hou will
fix itself that's what your research will reveal that's what
your contemplations will reveal you have all the answers within
you and and around you at your disposal you've got
Google you've got forums you've got questions you got teachers
you can talk to I mean you've got it all
you've got all the resources you've got millions of books
available on Amazon very cheaply so you've got it all
the problem is you don't care the problem is you
don't have a sense of seriousness and no sense of
real strategic intent that's your bigger problem that's what I'm
really worried about that's why we're talking about it this
whole episode escaping the maze has never been easier but
also in a certain sense it's never been harder because
we have so much proliferation of information how do you
sort the wheat from the chaff effectively that's tricky to
do a lot of the information out there will get
you stuck in a dead-end and you have to be
especially careful to watch out for ideological solutions a lot
of people a lot of rats sees wrasse get smart
a smart rat who wants a lot of cheese in
this maze what this rat will do is they'll say
ah you know it's really a lot of work for
me to be running around collecting all these individual bits
of cheese that's real hard stuff I got a better
idea let me come up with an ideological scheme that
I can infect other rats with which will get those
rats to run around for me collect the cheese and
then bring it back to my lair to my cheesy
rat lair where I would just swim in all this
cheese and that's what all these people who peddle ideological
solutions to you are whether they're religious ideological solutions or
political ones or libertarian ones you know we've discussed all
this stuff in my how ideology works episode and I
have various episodes about culture my rant against culture in
the future I'll be talking about cults and cult psychology
that will be very illuminating for you guys and and
so all of these are various kinds of ideological solutions
but really all they're doing is they're just acquiring cheese
for the big rats and you become their tool so
be very careful about that when you're deeply stuck in
the maze I want you to remember this because you'll
come across this point you know because life is long
and you'll have lots of ups and downs in this
life moments where you think that you're breaking through the
maze only to discover that oh man you're just inside
of a of a smaller maze inside of a larger
maze and just of all this work to do and
sometimes you go down some corridor and you hit a
dead end and that can be very demoralizing and you
might feel down you might feel depressed you might even
feel suicidal at certain points in your life you might
feel very lost you might feel like leo I don't
know what next step to take and that's where you
need to cultivate hope trust the process trust your strategic
intent trust your heart trust the overall mission that you're
on trust that as long as you have the desire
and the intent the solutions will present themselves to you
not necessarily today or tomorrow but they will almost inevitably
they will there are so many solutions floating around there
are literally millions of solutions floating around and you don't
need that many you only need a small handful of
them you don't need all of them so there are
way more solutions floating around than you'll ever need so
what you need to do is need to cultivate hope
in those times and fundamentally what your hope is grounded
in is in your own capacity because you realize altom
utley that this maze that you're in is really none
other than yourself you are lost inside of yourself inside
of your own mind you have architected this maze for
your own amusement really and you're in it it doesn't
always seem amusing to you but that is a more
mature form of amusement see an immature form amusement is
all sugar and positive positivity a mature form of amusement
is one that also includes pain and suffering and depression
and difficulty in and crisis and loneliness and and all
sorts of stuff like this calamities of all kinds that's
a more mature version of of entertainment so this is
what you've designed for yourself and you're in this maze
and since you've designed it for yourself you also have
the capacity to escape it so don't doubt yourself keep
the hope and remember that even during those darkest most
bleak times you got the next day you know the
next day you wake up and you just ask yourself
again ok I'm back at it again how do I
solve the maze and in fact last night when I
was depressed or when I was miserable and when I
was hopeless and I thought that I was lost forever
well that was that was actually the thing that's gonna
get me to take my whole quest even more seriously
the next day that's what motivates you the suffering is
there to motivate you to escape the maze it's not
there to torture you it's actually a very important um
mmm guidance system for you because otherwise without the suffering
you would just completely gorge yourself on cheese and you
wouldn't understand why there's something beyond the cheese right so
the suffering that is there to show you that even
if you get all the cheese that you want you're
still gonna suffer and it's still not the same as
having escaped the maze and for many rats what they
do need to do for many years is they need
to eat a bunch of cheese chase a bunch of
cheese for a long time huh it took just to
learn the lesson that hey chasing all this cheese still
doesn't fundamentally change anything about my life I'm still trapped
in this maze oh okay see and that comes usually
from suffering that doesn't just come from eating lots of
cheese that comes from gorging yourself on cheese to the
point where you're disgusted with it to the point where
you're crying from this glut of cheese that you've consumed
and then the next day you wake up you're like
okay that clearly doesn't work that's clearly a cul-de-sac in
this maze let me now take the look for the
light let me try to escape this for real so
uh remember to keep the keep the faith keep the
hope and keep working this maze don't give up all
right that's it I'm done here please click that like
button for me and come check out actualize that org
where there are various kinds of resources to help you
escape the maze like my blog the forum where you
can ask questions that I often answer I especially try
to answer the really good questions I'm often surprised that
so few people ask me high-quality questions on the forum
so mostly what I do on the forum is I
just kind of dig around and and have fun and
am sarcastic because the questions are ant I get asked
are pretty ridiculous most the time but when someone comes
with a really genuine question I actually like his spent
time trying to answer it what else the life purpose
course that's all about navigating the maze and I'm forgetting
my book list yeah a hoss of books for you
on the book list over 200 books of life-changing books
there for you to read that's like 10 years worth
of reading material right there for you so stick around
with actual eyes that work as you're watching the various
videos that I'm putting out there make sure you're putting
them into a larger context the overarching big picture because
sometimes I go into the weeds on some topic here
and there and we need to do that that's important
but also never lose sight of the big picture understand
what actualize that or it is it's a collections of
ideas to help you to solve this maze it's really
a collection of maps of the maze but each map
is partial because the maze is so vast it's so
infinite that there can't be one map for the whole
damn thing you've got little partial maps and different rats
at different points need different maps and so that's why
I'm putting out episodic content you know try to get
you a little map for a particular problem that you
might have and so you use that one or you
put it in your back pocket for when you might
need it next year or whatever and that's what this
whole enterprise boils down to so put it all into
the bigger picture context and stick around for more because
there are still many important maps that I need to
share with you in the future you
