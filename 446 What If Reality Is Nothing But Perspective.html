            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/_JmNzIN0c2c' target='_blank'>What If Reality Is Nothing But Perspective</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Reality is deeply perspectival</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that everyone, by default, views reality from a narrow perspective instilled by upbringing, culture, religion, social norms etc., which is then defended as absolute truth. It is integral for consciousness growth to realize that no one perspective can be correct. Each individual assumes that their perception is the ultimate truth, dismissing all others as deluded.
</li><li><b>The importance of a meta perspective</b>: Gura urges to adopt a meta perspective, viewing the situation from a higher elevation, to see the mind's game of defending its own perspective. He emphasizes the need to be flexible and view the world from different perspectives for a deeper understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Reality could be largely perspective</b>: Gura introduces the possibility that there may not be a reality underneath or behind our perspective, our perspectives may be the only thing making up reality. This may be hard to accept for many as the common assumption is that there is an objective layer of existence that is perceived through our perspective.
</li><li><b>Common human tendency to defend perspectives</b>: Gura indicates that a common human tendency is to defend one's perspective because it truly seems as the objective reality. It's difficult for most people to willingly consider the world from other viewpoints. This is visible in everyday life through debates seen on social media, news etc. 
</li><li><b>Necessity of questioning one's own perspective</b>: Gura underscores the importance of questioning one's own perspective for personal growth. This leads to a profoundly different and open exploration of reality, beyond the confinement of one's perspective defended as absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Emphasis on understanding over belief</b>: Gura emphasizes that understanding reality for its own sake, not to gain something out of it, is of utmost importance. Understanding and appreciation of the concept of relativity opens up new possibilities for exploration. 
</li><li><b>Imperative of abandoning attachment to own perspective</b>: Gura emphasises the need to release attachment to personal perspectives and beliefs to understand the true nature of reality. It could uncover deeper structures of the mind or psyche fueling the common phenomenon of people being stuck in their own perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Importance of self-reflection for enlightenment</b>: Crucial to enlightenment is the ability to step back from all perspectives, and realise that none are true and complete. The mind is instinctively biased towards defending its own perspective. Taking a step back from every point of view allows for a comprehensive picture of reality.
</li><li><b>Limited adherence to own perspectives</b>: Leo Gura discusses how minds are unwilling to question their own perspectives out of fear of losing them. These carefully built perspectives are often mistaken for reality, and a mind resists venturing out of its comfort zone. Due to this factors, people stick to their perspectives, viewing them as ultimate truth. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of limited perspectives</b>: Due to this stronghold of their own perspectives, people create coping mechanisms such as debating, arguing, getting angry, and judging. People often project their insecurities and defences on others, to avoid self-questioning or facing the uncomfortable truths about their perspectives.
</li><li><b>Surrendering perspectives</b>: Leo suggests a counterintuitive approach to life: instead of rigidly sticking to and guarding our ideological perspectives, we should commit to exploring other perspectives. Understanding that each perspective is limited and partial, we should strive to explore different perspectives merely as a learning exercise, without expecting to replace or find a better perspective.
</li><li><b>Examples of perspectives mistaken for reality</b>: Some examples of perspectives mistaken for reality include believing that one's birth is an unquestionable reality, or the belief that the universe existed before one's birth, and will exist after one's death.
</li><li><b>Biases and distortions in evaluating different perspectives</b>: Often, when people try to evaluate other perspectives, they do it from within their original perspective. This results in distortions and biases, and they fail to grasp the genuine essence of the other perspective. People fail to genuinely switch perspectives while evaluating a new one.
</li><li><b>Partial and self-biased nature of perspectives</b>: Every perspective is partial and tends to elevate itself, making it appear as the best and most authentic one to the beholder. This trick played by the mind is a reason why people, including great intellectuals, fail to see beyond their perspectives.
</li><li><b>Exploration over arguments</b>: Leo criticizes the narrow-mindedness of philosophers, who put forth arguments to safeguard their own perspective. Instead, he proposes a more open and explorative approach, considering each perspective as a fraction of the entire reality. 
</li><li><b>The trap of defending one's perspective</b>: This trap is not limited to uneducated or ordinary people. Even the most accomplished academics, scholars, and intellectuals fall into the trap of defending their perspectives, considering it the best. 
</li><li><b>Understanding reality through multiple perspectives</b>: Leo suggests understanding reality through multiple lenses, without prioritizing any particular perspective. By dividing reality into aspects rather than whole, and discussing the aspects separately, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Prompt to philosophers</b>: Leo challenges philosophers to disengage from the practice of favouritism for specific perspectives. He stresses the futility of trying to convince others about one's own perspective and urges philosophers to delve deeper into understanding the true nature of reality. 
</li><li><b>Perception and realities</b>: Leo highlights the fact that each person's perspective is their own reality, and hence every person lives in a different reality. The concept of "reality" is subjective and heavily influenced by personal perspectives and viewpoints.
</li><li><b>Exploring Radically Different Perspectives</b>: Leo Gura urges the viewers to imagine embodying drastically different perspectives. This includes stepping into the shoes of figures like dictators and prostitutes or understanding the reality of animals. He also prompts the viewer to consider the vastly different experiences within the same broad perspective, like the varying perspectives of Christians from different epochs or societies.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Shift in Perspective</b>: He notes that stepping outside of one's current perspective can be threatening and difficult due to the fear of loss of personal identity. He emphasizes that greater deviation from one's original perspective requires more open-mindedness and can elicit higher resistance.
</li><li><b>Perspective and Society Formation</b>: Discussing the formation of tribes or nations, Gura points out how shared perspectives can facilitate understanding and agreement among a community. He uses the examples of nations built on religious perspectives, like Christianity or Islam, where shared values and perspectives lead to a coherent collective society.
</li><li><b>Conflict Due to Diverse Perspectives</b>: Gura highlights the conflict that can brew due to varied perspectives, leading to violence and societal struggles. He points out that people with different perspectives often have difficulty understanding each other, leading to increased conflict and disagreements. He notes that this is not just a theoretical concept, but a harsh reality as people kill, conquer, and enslave each other due to differences in perspective.
</li><li><b>Importance and Impact of Perspectives</b>: Gura urges viewers to understand the fundamental role of perspectives in their life. He explains that perspective is a survival tool, essentially forming the operating system for an individual's interaction with the world. This perspective is deeply embedded and influenced by the individual's culture, society, parents, and education.
</li><li><b>Education and Perspective</b>: Gura criticizes the current education system for focusing on indoctrination into a particular perspective rather than teaching about perspective. He stresses the need for substantial changes, indicating that it requires diving into the deeper layers of one's perspective for significant shifts to occur.
</li><li><b>Influence of Community's Perspective</b>: Gura explains how individuals adopt the perspectives of their community for survival and acceptance. He suggests that the desire for approval and love during childhood leads individuals to absorb the perspectives of their community even if these may limit personal growth later.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Perspective Change</b>: Gura discusses the resistance to change perspectives due to fear of losing one's identity. He points out that shifting to a radically different perspective requires open-mindedness and could be threatening to self-perception.
</li><li><b>Impact of our upbringing on our perspectives</b>: Leo Gura explains that as young children, we are heavily influenced by our parents and friends during our first 10-20 years of development. We crave approval, love, and care. The absence of these essentials can result in a faulty 'Bios' or worldview. As children, we absorb our environment without understanding that we are being programmed with a particular perspective, which then shapes the way we perceive and interact with the world for the rest of our lives. 
</li><li><b>Inability to evaluate the quality of our 'Bios'</b>: We're unable to evaluate the usefulness or limitations of our 'Bios', as we see it only as our reality and not as a perspective shaped by our upbringing and environment. Most people don't realize they're working within a constructed framework unless they engage in self-reflection or philosophy.
</li><li><b>Difficulty in recognizing flaws in our worldview</b>: Gura highlights how people are poor at neutrally and impartially evaluating the shortcomings of their own perspectives. Infact, we tend to deny and defend the flaws in our 'Bios', projecting any weaknesses onto others. This is evident when we observe individuals with radically different worldviews failing to see the deficiencies in their own perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to change in perspective</b>: People often resist changing their 'Bios' due to the inherent defensive nature of our perspectives. Substantial life improvements require changes at the 'Bios' level, which is seldom addressed by traditional self-help methodologies.
</li><li><b>Nested Perspectives</b>: Our minds often create nested perspectives within the main perspective. When we try to evaluate our perspective, we end up questioning the constructed virtual perspective within it, rather than the actual original one. Going as far back as our original perspective would result in finding our true self, without a perspective, which is often a terrifying revelation, revealing the constructed and biased nature of our reality. 
</li><li><b>Perspective as a construct for survival</b>: Gura detailed that our perspectives are designs for the survival of its own self. Disassembling these constructions would mean finding one's self in the void, with no reality, experience or meaning as these are all merely relative concepts originating from our constructed perspective.
</li><li><b>Perspective Accretion</b>: Leo Gura discusses the process of perspective accretion, likening it to a snowball rolling down a hill, accreting more and more material as one grows older. This accretion of perspectives is then defended to prevent feelings of loss or a sense of dying. 
</li><li><b>Depth of Self-Reflection</b>: The necessity for depth in self-reflected understanding for this process to work is noted, with a focus on surrendering one's perspective and personal ideologies. Gura highlights that this quest must not be for personal gain but for understanding reality as it ultimately is.
</li><li><b>Exploration of Perspectives</b>: Gura emphasizes exploring other perspectives to understand reality, which he describes as a collection of infinite perspectives. To grasp reality, every possible perspective or viewing angle must be considered, similar to attempting to understand an elephant from every angle.
</li><li><b>Variation of Perspectives</b>: Gura acknowledges the variation of perspectives that can be obtained even from viewing a single object (an elephant, in this case). The camera, lens, settings, and distance represent the variables that can result in different perceptions. He also points out the potential for contrasting interpretations based on who is viewing the elephant, such as different artists.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Perspectives</b>: Each perspective, no matter how abstract or different it may be, is equally valid, provided one understands where the perspective is coming from. This necessitates stepping outside of one's perspective. Gura underscores that a perspective should not be dismissed because it does not align with our understanding or expectation.
</li><li><b>Infinity of Perspectives</b>: Gura states that when all possible perspectives are accumulated, what emerges is infinite possibilities, ways, and understandings, none of which is invalid. He reiterates that our perception of objects or subjects comes from our unique perspective, and to achieve rich understanding, all possible perspectives must be considered impartially.
</li><li><b>Separation for Understanding</b>: Gura conveys the need to separate oneself from the subject of consideration to view it from a particular perspective. This separation results in creating dualities and distinctions that facilitate the understanding of the subject in a material sense. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Neutrality</b>: Lastly, Gura emphasizes the importance of neutrality to stay unbiased and avoid being confined to one perspective. This enables us to appreciate the richness of reality and access a fuller understanding.
</li><li><b>Concept of Perspective</b>: Leo Gura advocates for the ability to appreciate the multitude of perspectives available rather than restricting oneself to a single, limited perspective. He warns that confining oneself to one perspective results in missing out on the infinite diversity of reality and breeds dissatisfaction, suffering, and conflicts with others.
</li><li><b>Attachment to One's Perspective</b>: Gura explains how individuals often stick to their own perspectives without trying to understand those of others, which leads to violence, racism, oppression, and slavery. This happens because people mistakenly think their perspective is the only correct one and fight against other perspectives.
</li><li><b>Exploring Different Perspectives</b>: Gura suggests making a commitment to be neutral to all perspectives and to start appreciating them. He argues that the universe moves through every possible perspective to understand itself from every possible angle and this process continues endlessly.
</li><li><b>Understanding Belief Systems</b>: Gura highlights that to fully understand a belief system different from our own, we need to live through that belief system, rather than just observing it. This goes beyond just theorizing, and involves actually living and embodying that perspective for a substantial amount of time.
</li><li><b>Endless Cycle of Self-Understanding</b>: He discusses the idea of consciousness living through every possible permutation of perspectives across different timelines, planets, universes, and even inanimate objects. This journey leads to a point of complete self-understanding, or infinite consciousness, which Gura equates to God. 
</li><li><b>Shifting from Fear to Love</b>: The continuous exploration and understanding of different perspectives helps consciousness transition from a state of fear and limitation to a state of love and appreciation for the diverse perspectives. This realization and integration of all perspectives into oneself is equated to absolute love or pure infinite consciousness, which is defined as God by Gura. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to the Process</b>: Gura mentions that the exploration and integration of all perspectives can either be done consciously, willingly, and with gratitude or through unconscious, unwilling resistance. The former leads to a better, less painful life, while the latter slows down the process and causes suffering. 
</li><li><b>Reality as a Love Simulator</b>: In the final part of the section, Gura refers to reality as a "love simulator," suggesting that the universe teaches individuals to love and appreciate the diversity of perspectives. He encourages individuals to engage in the process of understanding different perspectives consciously for their own growth and enrichment.
</li><li><b>Infinite Love</b>: Leo Gura proposes the idea of a universe that seeks to teach its inhabitants about love, despite their fears, attachments, and resistances. He emphasizes that the universe is an entity of infinite perspectives. Gura suggests using love as a tool to explore these perspectives, commit to appreciating all angles of reality and engaging in it from a place of exploration and appreciation rather than judgment or criticism. 
</li><li><b>Exploring Perspectives</b>: Gura recommends considering our own lives as a journey of understanding and self-love through an exploration of perspectives. He encourages embracing and understanding different political, cultural, or philosophic viewpoints and recognizing the limitations and particularities of each one. He suggests that each perspective is an infinitely small aspect of a much larger, constantly evolving reality.
</li><li><b>Avoid False Equivalence</b>: While encouraging a broad exploration of perspectives, Gura also warns against drawing false equivalences or minimizing the relative harm or dysfunction of certain perspectives, using climate change denial as an example. He states that it's crucial to recognize some perspectives are more harmful or dysfunctional with respect to the well-being of humanity.
</li><li><b>The Abundance of Love</b>: Gura encourages viewers to view all perspectives as an aspect of the self, and by judging or demonizing others, one is indirectly doing the same to themselves. This suggests that our capacity for love or bitterness is proportional to our understanding and appreciation (or lack thereof) of others' perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Slope of Love</b>: The ultimate goal in life, according to Gura, is to find ourselves on an infinite slope of love, which allows our understanding and appreciation to grow exponentially. Overcoming fear, selfishness, and attachment, we can tune into an overwhelming sense of love for everything around us. This love can be so intense and transformative that our psyches struggle to retain it, highlighting the vast potential for expansion and growth in our understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Experiencing Intense Love</b>: In this section, Leo Gura discusses the transformative power of intense love and how it can be used to heal individuals and eradicate their fears and selfishness. He suggests that experiencing intense love can lead to a process of spiritual purification that involves letting go of attachments. This can increase an individuals capacity to give and receive love. Gura encourages his listeners to live through moments of intense love as consciously and deeply as they can.
</li><li><b>Exploring Different Perspectives</b>: Gura explains the importance of examining different perspectives and stepping outside ones own viewpoint. This approach can make it possible to understand why different perspectives work the way they do, and discover the limitations of one's own standpoint. Gura warns against locking oneself into a perspective after a few exploratory attempts, and encourages open-minded, non-judgmental exploration of contrasting viewpoints to enhance the quality of life.
</li><li><b>Imagining the Experience of Others</b>: Gura suggests a powerful mental exercise in which individuals aim to experience the world from the perspective of others whose points of view differ significantly from their own. This psychological exercise requires visualization and imagination to achieve. He offers specific examples, describing how men could try to envision and feel what it is like for women to experience sexual pleasure. Though challenging, this exercise can change how one sees the world and can bring profound and rewarding insights.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Exploring Different Perspectives</b>: Gura asserts that the practice of challenging the mind to explore other perspectives has broad applications and can lead to more effective interactions with other people. This approach can be helpful in the workplace, politics, understanding religion, healing trauma and wounds from the past, and resolving conflicts. The inability or unwillingness to view a situation from another person's perspective often contributes to societal and interpersonal conflicts.
</li><li><b>Aligning with the Goal of Actualized.org</b>: Gura clarifies that the objective of his work and the Actualized.org platform aligns with the practice of exploring and understanding different perspectives. It encourages the exploration of other viewpoints in a non-judgmental and understanding manner, leading to personal growth and improved life quality. The website offers resources such as a blog, a book list, a course about life purpose, and a forum to facilitate individual growth.
