hey this is leo for actualized.org and i want to
talk about new year's resolutions a little bit ah yes
new year's resolution time what a wonderful and crazy time
it is right what i want to say about news
resolutions is this and i've already set one in fact
i've set a whole list and i hope that you're
setting more than one new year's resolution i hope you're
setting a list of many many many i probably have
oh at least 40 things that i'm working on this
year but the one that i really decided to make
my official new year's resolution was that i wanted to
shoot one video every day in 2014. that's 365 videos
quite a lot of videos quite a big commitment and
i knew that it was ridiculously ambitious when i said
it and i made that on purpose i actually said
that you know there's no way in hell that i'm
going to make that work but why don't i try
to pull it off so i just said something ridiculously
ambitious not even realistic and you know what it was
interesting because up until yesterday last night i stayed with
it and that's about two weeks i did about two
weeks of shooting a new video every day in fact
what i did is i had i had a notion
that i would not be able to shoot a video
literally every day because something would come up and one
day i would not be able to shoot a video
so then i kind of adjusted i was kind of
adjusting it in the middle of the process i'm saying
well if i just make one video per day so
total 365 but that doesn't mean i'll shoot one exactly
every day so maybe i'll shoot two today and then
i'll skip tomorrow and then shoot one the other the
next day so overall i would get that quantity of
videos and that seemed a lot more realistic because frankly
it's not very convenient to shoot a video every single
day just the setup of putting on the microphone and
getting the camera out getting the lighting doing the editing
doing all this stuff getting myself into the mental frame
that i need to be to shoot a good video
that all takes like prep work to do that and
it's much easier when i shoot one video and then
just shoot one back to back back to back back
to back sometimes i'll shoot four videos in a row
because i'm kind of on a roll and that's like
four days worth right but i said you know what
there's still something important about a daily ritual a daily
habit and so i said i will shoot a video
every day and then i actually missed out yesterday and
i didn't feel too bad about it because i knew
that it was really ambitious and i'm still in the
end many many views ahead i think i shot like
40 videos in 14 days so i've got like a
month worth of videos already and now i'm back on
track but what i really wanted to talk about is
here is the idea of getting back on track because
i'm sure that some of us create these new year's
resolutions where it's like i'm gonna go to the gym
uh five days a week for this year or i'm
gonna you know i'm gonna eat clean and i'm not
gonna eat any candy bars for uh for the next
month or whatever your goal is you know whatever your
resolution is you set something like that and then what
happens is that you know you're human you trip you
fail something comes up an emergency or you're just lazy
whatever the excuses you slip one day and so you
slip that one day and it's like well that's it
we're done it's over you know i failed again failed
my new year's resolution just like everyone said i would
so cliche why do i even set them but that's
the perfectionist mindset that you're coming from i want you
to be coming from a different mindset i want you
to be coming from the optimist and the really the
optimalist mindset which is make the best of what you've
got even if you screwed up just a few minutes
ago right so it's kind of like this idea that
like if you're in golf and you're playing 18 holes
and i'm not a good golfer i don't really go
golfing but i can still use analogy because it makes
a lot of sense to me when you shoot a
bad stroke right you make a bad stroke you get
the ball lost somewhere you're totally in the woods or
you're in a sand pit all of a sudden you
get very depressed because it's like you were you're on
a good streak but now the ball landed in a
sand pit and that means you're going to lose a
couple strokes for that what if you like get a
double bogey what if you lose 10 strokes trying to
get out of that sand pit you're going to be
embarrassed it's going to be embarrassing to be horrible it's
going to totally screw up these 18 holes and it's
going to screw up the nice streak you've got going
for the last few months right you get really kind
of down on yourself but what you don't realize is
the long-term perspective is that you're playing for the long
run right i hope you are you're not just playing
one round of golf you want to be a good
golfer and you're not just uh you know doing a
month of work you're going to be working on your
business for the rest of your life or you're not
just dieting for a month you're going to be keeping
up with that diet for the rest of your life
so when you're thinking long term it really doesn't matter
too much that you slip up once and in fact
what you got to do as a strategic thinker long-term
thinker is you got to anticipate that there will be
screw-ups poor strategy is creating a plan and then being
inflexible with it and saying well this is the plan
but you know what reality i'm not executing according to
the plan so i failed no the plan has to
be adaptive good strategy is adaptive strategy that means that
you anticipate problems you try to plan for them but
when they come up you have countermeasures and you have
a way to move forward you don't stall if you
stall and the mindsets that you have right now and
the way of thinking that you have about success in
any part of your life is causing you to stall
that it's not really empowering is it it's not very
good strategy the question is what do we put in
place instead of it to get you to keep forward
going forward and that's the idea basically that you're always
making the best of what you've got no matter what
happened even two seconds ago right you make the best
of what you've got and this is easier said than
done but still at least be aware of the fact
that this is a mindset that you could be bringing
to the table that probably most of you are not
right now so with the golf example you know there's
two ways it can go one is that you're playing
a nice round of golf and then you hit a
bad stroke and then you get all butt hurt about
the fact that you hit a bad stroke and you
start thinking about how it's messing up your record now
your game is ruined etc the other mindset is to
say okay i've played i've played some nice rounds here
and now i've had a bad shot but everyone has
bad shots even tiger woods has bad shots the trick
is not to eliminate having bad shots the trick is
to deal with the bad shots as best as humanly
possible that's where most people trip up there's no perfection
in life there's no perfection in creating your business there's
no perfection in creating a diet plan or anything else
that you're trying to do any kind of ritual that
you're putting into place you're going to falter on it
sometimes you should not try to on purpose but you
should recognize that when you do the very best thing
is to just get right back on get right back
on track because actually it's not that bad and that's
what happened with my new year's resolution yesterday is that
you know i got a little bit butt hurt about
the fact that yeah i missed a day sure i
still shot a lot of videos but it would have
been nice to just uh you know really been able
to do 365 days straight or at least get a
couple months in of just holding on to that resolution
so i was a little bit butthurt about it i
felt kind of depressed and then today i'm like well
so what in the grand scheme of things i missed
one day what if i just get back on track
right now how bad would the damage be it would
not be very bad at all missing one day of
anything is not going to damage your routine and your
results too much but i want to be very careful
about saying that because some people then say well it's
not one day is not that important and then you
can use that as an excuse and that's where it
gets a little dangerous that you can use this as
an excuse your lower self can use this as an
excuse to create a slippery slope kind of like oh
i'm just going to miss one day at the gym
you know it's not that bad not bad and then
oh you know the next day yeah well if i
missed one day i can miss two days two days
kind of similar similar to one day and all of
a sudden one day turns into two two days turn
into three three days turn into a week and then
you have a really hard time go to the gym
because you missed a whole week and then you stop
going totally you don't want to go down that slippery
slope so what you got to do is you still
got to keep your motivation you got you got to
understand why you're doing it it's just that sometimes you
will be able to just not be able to execute
on something and at that point if you miss a
day it's in the past right don't live in the
past you got to cut that cut it off it's
really tempting to want to say but if only i
like went today everything would have been perfect and i
wouldn't even have to deal with this and if only
i didn't make that one bad stroke my game would
have been a perfect game or if only i would
have made that one video i would have been on
track and i could be really proud of myself and
i could say yeah i did i did exactly what
i wanted to do and i'm this totally self-controlled person
but that's the perfectionist perfectionistic mindset and i'm really trying
to beat that out of myself because i realize that
i can't get good performance in my business or anything
else that i'm doing in life with that kind of
attitude i need to change that around so instead what
i decided to do is i said okay i broke
my resolution fine but it doesn't really matter right that's
not what's important what's important is that i got back
on track right now and i'm shooting a video right
now in fact i shot this my second video so
great i'm back on track now i'm going to do
the best i can right it's giving yourself that leeway
because you know what honestly if you set a very
ambitious goal for yourself like if you set a goal
to create a business that's going to earn you 5
million or if you set a goal to lose 50
pounds or if you set a goal to shoot 365
videos or whatever whatever else something ambitious like that for
yourself and you only execute to 90 percent you're still
going to be very good you're still going to come
out super super ahead you're still going to be thrilled
it's much better to set an ambitious goal and get
90 of it and set a wimpy goal and get
all hundred percent of it right because a lot of
people would never set a five million dollar goal for
their business they would say you know i only need
a hundred thousand i'll just do a hundred thousand if
i'm if my business could only do a hundred thousand
i'll be happy i promise i'll be happy i won't
ask for anything more let me just get a hundred
thousand going and then what they do is they under
deliver on that and let's say they get ninety percent
of a hundred thousand that's ninety thousand still not bad
but if they set a goal for 5 million and
they only did 80 of it just compare the difference
right compare the difference and sometimes what you do is
you have to set a really ambitious goal and realize
that it's just crazy ambitious and you're probably not gonna
do it but you still kind of just like play
a game with yourself and you say you know i
just wonder how close i can get i'm not i'm
not gonna get it but just how close can i
get and give yourself that that margin of error that
margin of error because in school when you're going to
school and you're taking a college exam or something 90
is still an a it's still awesome it's still a
good grade right you're not aiming at 100 on every
test it's really really hard to do and if you
were always expecting 100 on every single test you would
drive yourself nuts and in fact i would argue that
it's going to be counterproductive to you and that you're
probably better off shooting for something like 90 or 95
rather than 100 because at 100 you're always going to
be disappointed by never being able to get 100 but
a 90 you can actually get that and being cool
with a 90 is good and even being cool with
like an 85 is good because then you can improve
from that once you're solidly getting an 85 you can
ask yourself how do i get an 86 and then
you can crank it up to a 90 and then
maybe you can crank it up to 95. much better
to go gradually like that than just aiming for hundreds
straight away that's what a lot of people do when
they set goals is that they aim for those hundreds
and then well they come out short very short and
because they come out short their expectations are so out
of whack with with what they're actually accomplishing that they
get discouraged and they quit and when you quit that's
when you really failed you only really fail when you
quit things so be very cognitive of that and the
danger of quitting and that the greatest danger in any
project that you're undertaking any endeavor is quitting it's just
not going through with it it's not following through so
that's the biggest danger that you got to watch out
for not so much the quality but the quitting part
because the quality will handle itself as long as you
put in the time all right so that's all i
wanted to say about this make sure that you are
still on track with your new year's resolution so even
if right now you've already broken it it's never too
late to get back on track right you're still gonna
be better off if you get back on that diet
right now even though you missed five days you're still
gonna be better off if you hit the gym again
even though you missed five days you're gonna be better
off if you start working on that project even if
you've been procrastinating for five days better start now because
if you start now you still got a lot of
time to make a lot of success out of it
but if you're so discouraged because you missed five days
you're going to quit and then you've truly failed all
