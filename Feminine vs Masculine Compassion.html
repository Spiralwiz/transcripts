hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm going to be talking about feminine versus masculine
compassion compassion a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for
another who is stricken by misfortune accompanied by a strong
desire to alleviate the suffering in his book big heart
big mind Zen master Dennis Jen PO Myrtle has a
really beautiful story that explains the two sides of compassion
that I wanted to share with you it's the story
of the horses and here's how it goes basically there's
a mother horse who's giving birth to a baby horse
and horses live also they live in a group so
there's not just one horse there's a whole bunch of
other females and there's also the the lead male horse
of the troop well I don't know what they're called
anyways so they live in a group and the mother
is giving birth to this baby and the baby is
born and then four horses the baby is supposed to
stand up and start walking around on its feet really
fast after it's born so this baby though is struggling
and it can't quite get up on its feet now
the mother looks at the horse she's feeling bad for
the for the baby horse she wants to help it
along so she nudges the horse with her with her
head trying to help it up and the horse little
baby horse just can't get up keep struggling falling back
down so the mothers doing everything it can and it's
not working then some of the other female horses come
from the group and they try to help the baby
horse to to get up and they keep nurturing and
encouraging it and just nothing seems to be working and
then finally the main male horse he comes over and
he grabs that baby horse by the back of its
mane and he takes it over to the boulder over
there on the ground and he smashes its skull into
the boulder and that right there is a perfect illustration
of compassion as being both masculine and feminine it's got
those two flavors to it it's interesting though that when
we talk about compassion we typically assume the feminine version
of compassion not the masculine so that's what I want
to talk a little bit about more in this video
the lesson that I draw from this story and I
have some examples that I'll share with you and also
some vivid examples in my own life where I run
into this issue of trying to be compassionate but being
compassion in the wrong way so the lesson from this
little story is that there's different ways that you can
be compassionate that you can help other people sometimes you
take the soft hopeful approach which is the feminine approach
sometimes you take the harsh realistic pragmatic approach which is
more the masculine approach and I mean these are stereotypes
right these are stereotypes obviously men and women can both
use both approaches so I'm not saying here that the
woman always uses the feminine approach and the man always
uses the masculine approach they can vary so it doesn't
have to do anything with your physical gender but there's
leanings right it's gender gender stereotypes so there's there's leanings
and kind of probability clouds that we gravitate towards depending
on what gender we're in and whether we associate ourselves
with masculine or feminine tendencies but these are two valid
lenses through which to see the world and through which
to interact and try to ease the suffering in the
world right and you have to have enough judgment and
wisdom to recognize which approach is going to work better
for example personally for me one of the things that
I've been running into is I've been shooting a lot
of these videos with Ashley's I work for over a
year now and I have this option about how to
deliver this content to you guys I could either deliver
it sometimes in a more masculine harsh pragmatic way sometimes
I can deliver in a more soft hopeful feminine way
and initially when I shut it off shooting my videos
I kind of side it on the more masculine harsh
approach you know where I would kind of yell at
you and browbeat you and accuse you of things and
this kind of approach and that can be great because
sometimes the best way we learn is like we're up
in our lives or we're just kind of stuck in
a rut and then someone comes over and says hey
stop up get your together and go accomplish that thing
right there and sometimes that's enough to trigger and you
this oh yeah have been up I have been lazy
I should go do that and you just go do
it sometimes that's all you need but sometimes that doesn't
work sometimes you're just like in such a bad state
or whatever and instead what you need to be like
the more soft loving kind of approach where it's like
Oh tell me about your feelings let's take a look
oh it's going to be okay don't worry about it
yada yada yada yada right and so there's that more
feminine compassionate approach so it's been interesting for me to
kind of go between these two poles and trying to
kind of navigate that and I'm still trying to find
you know what the right balance is I think what
I've discovered is that it really is kind of on
a case-by-case basis it really helps to know what the
prop the person's problem is in order to help them
out one of the challenges with trying to help you
guys out through you know videos or through a comment
on on the Internet is that there's so little information
that I know about you as I'm trying to deliver
this material it's a lot easier with kind of like
one on one coaching client but anyway so that's one
example for my life another example that I found very
interesting is I had this relationship a while ago which
was causing me problems because I kind of knew early
on into the relationship that it wasn't the right relationship
for me this girl had emotional issues I just saw
that stuff wasn't going to be clicking for us long
term I saw that by kind of continuing to drag
this relationship on that it would be doing her a
disservice it would be doing me a disservice but on
the other hand I didn't have the balls to just
cut it off and why is that well because I
didn't want to like come off as the and I
didn't want to be the one that caused extra pain
for her and I mean of course for myself so
it wasn't just there's a selfish motives in there too
but even if you take it look at the more
selfless motives um the issue there was that like I
didn't want to take the harsh masculine approach in that
situation so I kind of waffle then I was a
little soft and I was kind of being understanding and
I was trying to kind of make it work I've
tried to be hopeful and then that relationship you know
dragged on there's a lot of needless misery and suffering
and all this both for me and for her and
so in that situation it would have been better if
I took the masculine compassionate approach and I just made
a clean cut yes it would have been painful for
both of us but in the end I think there
was more pain in dragging the whole process out because
a lot of suffering accumulated through that process which is
exactly by the way the reasoning of the male horse
in that horse story right because if the if the
baby horse couldn't walk then chances are would probably get
picked on and mauled by some wolves or some coyotes
or whatever right so is it really appropriate to late
let this baby horse endanger the group as a whole
and then also to allow to be you know mauled
by some vicious animal um so that would have been
probably even worse of a fate for this baby horse
than getting its skull smashed in on a boulder so
that's why that approach was a you know a valid
approach even though it seems kind of monstrous and cold-hearted
and harsh another example is how about something like hiring
a new employee let's say you want to hire some
person so you hire a person and for your business
and then you think like okay this is great you're
all excited but then a couple of weeks in you
start to see that this person isn't quite working out
there's some value conflicts maybe they're showing up late occasionally
or they're not doing stuff the way you thought they
would be doing it and basically you start to suspect
that this person might not be able to handle this
job that you've got for them well as the manager
or the boss you've got really two options one is
you can make a clean break and you can do
kind of the dickish cold-hearted thing which is just to
fire this person call them into your off and say
hey look it's not working out pack up your stuff
and leave so there's that the other approach is to
be more kind of caring and be more hopeful and
maybe offer this person some feedback and try to work
with them and kind of go through this whole process
okay so which one is better well you're not going
to know it all depends on the specific circumstances of
the situation but you can clearly see there that in
this situation there could be both a masculine approach that
might be valid there could also be a feminine approach
that might also be valid it might be the case
that this employee is just kind of struggling to understand
certain rules you said and that maybe if you work
with them for a month they'll become an amazing employee
so you have to develop that judgment in you that
wisdom to decide how about the example of disciplining a
child how should you discipline a child should you take
the harsh masculine approach or the feminine compassionate approach right
you've probably experienced both as a kid and you can
see that there's there's merit to both but it's also
possible to discipline the child in the wrong way with
both approaches like if the child is not doing their
homework sometimes you need to yell at them and maybe
that'll work or maybe yelling at them will even worsen
the problem so you have to use a little reverse
psychology on them or go talk about their emotions and
what's wrong and then be more kind of feminine compassionate
with them be more loving with them and maybe that
will get them to do their homework or whatever the
situation is right and again require good use of judgment
and how do you build judgment through experience so a
lot of times it's by being in these situations and
then miss calibrating making the right the wrong choice right
maybe you make the wrong choice and then through a
series of wrong choices you develop the wisdom and experience
to know what the right choice will be the next
time so this is like a skill that you need
to develop and what I found is that probably you're
more skilled and competent with one of these poles than
the other so maybe you're real good at using masculine
all the time but not so good at feminine or
vice-versa and then your default strategy is to use the
thing that you've always used to fix the problem even
though sometimes it's quite obvious that that method won't work
so it's kind of like trying to use you know
a hammer just because got a hammer to hit everything
that can be hammered even when it shouldn't be hammered
you don't a hammer in a screw you need a
screwdriver for that so you know different tools for different
contexts but we can become a little rigid sometimes that's
what I've been finding in like the way that I
do the personal development delivery right and so that's the
kind of switch up approaches so I'm going to give
you an exercise to do just at towards the end
of the video but just want to make a couple
of last points here one is just as a warning
this whole idea of masculine compassion should not be used
as an excuse to be an or to be unkind
or inconsiderate or other people and the way that you
know whether you're being an or not in using this
masculine compassion is you got to ask yourself are you
doing it for their good and don't try to rationalize
it how really you're doing for their good but actually
behind the scenes it's actually all for your good like
you got a you got to be very genuine about
it right is this decision you're going to make actually
the right decision in the situation both for them for
you so like if you're deciding whether to fire an
employee right you got to ask yourself well if if
this job is not going to work if they're not
going to be able to fit into this job and
that's going to be bad for them because in the
end they're going to lose months of their time and
having high hopes and then I'm gonna have to fire
them in the end anyways so it's better for them
if I fire them now but you have to be
genuine about it it's interesting also another point that I
want to make which has been on the top of
my mind lately because I've been to a lot of
study on enlightenment and about increasing one's consciousness as we
do personal development and one of the things that comes
out is that as your conscious awareness increases your compassion
increases very interesting and the reason that turns out to
be the case is that compassion comes naturally when you
identify yourself with more and more of the world so
if all you do is you edify yourself just with
you with this personal body this ego right here then
you're going to feel like it's you against the world
and that you have to take from others to feel
good about yourself and so in that low state of
consciousness you're very identified with just this very local phenomenon
happening right here and so your compassion is very limited
now as your awareness increases and you can get to
the point where your awareness increases completely and totally which
is what an enlightenment experience is then literally you have
compassion for everything now not because of some moral standards
but because you see everything as you in a very
literal and physical way so imagine for example that you
thought that I was no different than you and that
the chair you're sitting on was really no separate from
you as an as an identity imagine you identified yourself
with all of nature all of humanity all the animals
all the insects the cosmos the stars the air the
water the trees everything the entire world entire universe if
that was your identification that's what you identified with rather
than just this local body here imagine how much compassion
you would have for all those things even physical objects
you would treat them in a very different way and
one thing that really brought this home to me is
that I was at a retreat where we were doing
a lot of consciousness work it was an Enlightenment retreat
and one of the participants there at the end of
the retreat he shared a little experience with me that
he had I kind of was asking about hey so
you had some enlightening students who's had enlightening experience I
just got very curious asking people questions and this guy
started telling me a little bit about one of the
first experiences that he had and what he told me
was that he was sitting there they were doing exercises
it was like two people doing exercise he was sitting
there with the other person they were both looking at
each other the other person was talking and he was
sitting there and all of a sudden he had this
enlightenment experience and as he had it his field of
awareness expanded to the point where he became the other
person not in the sense that he could see through
his eyes but just that what he was looking at
he didn't perceive as separate from himself anymore so imagine
if you're looking at me right now and you get
this moment where you start to realize that this this
thing here is not separate from that thing over there
and it was um it was amazing what he told
me because he told me that that person that was
talking that he was listening to was describing some painful
divorce situation or whatever that happened in his past and
some suffering involved with that apparently and so that person
was feeling kind of sad about it and this guy
who was having the alignment experience he felt so identified
without a person that tears started rolling down his eyes
tears of compassion because he literally felt what the other
person was going through as though it happened to him
because he became that other person for that brief minute
or so and so that's where true compassion comes from
compassion comes from expanding your field of awareness very interesting
kind of eye-opening when you hear stories like that right
tells you like oh man there might be this whole
field of awareness and raising of consciousness two levels that
I had not previously thought possible that seem kind of
mystical or spooky or woowoo or supernatural they're not supernatural
they're very natural it's just that these are higher states
of consciousness that we very rarely get to experience unless
we deliberately go and pursue them which most of us
don't tend to do because we assume that they're not
there so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right low consciousness
assumes that low consciousness is all there is it assumes
that there is no high consciousness because well I'm already
as conscious as I could possibly be but when you
start to explore the possibility of higher consciousness that you
start to experiment with yourself then you start to see
that there's a whole vast ocean that you can expand
into and it's really amazing and inspiring so I just
want to share that for you as a little maybe
motivation for it lastly though what I want to do
is I want to give you an exercise so here's
the exercise identify which pole you side with more masculine
compassion or offender and compassion and what I want you
to do is I want you to make a commitment
the next time to be aware of which one you're
going to naturally want to use and use the opposite
one so maybe your spouse comes home from work and
he or she's angry because something bad happened there and
normally what you would do is you would use the
masculine approach or the feminine approach well now what you're
going to do is you're going to switch it up
and see how that works or whatever your situation is
right so that your building balance in both these faculties
that you're able to use both and you're able to
jump between them and then you're developing experience with both
and then you're going to be more flexible so that
in the future situations come up and you're going to
know which approach to use best all right so go
ahead practice that I'm signing off go ahead post me
