hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org and
in this quick self-help segment in about ten minutes I'm
going to talk about how to get more energy alright
energy can be a pretty deep topic so I'm going
to cover it more in depth in other videos on
actual ila that'll work but here I'm going to actually
take a kind of a focused approach on one aspect
of energy that I think is commonly missed and this
is more of a psychological aspect than a physical aspect
so of course there's ways to get more energy for
example to go and to do more workouts to get
yourself fit into shape to control your diet to experiment
with various supplementation's perhaps medicate medication getting certain blocks out
of the way like if you have sleep apnea that
can cause a low energy if you have insomnia that
can cause low energy if you are always anxious that
might be robbing you of energy if if you're hypothyroid
your thyroid is low make sure you get that checked
that's a very common medical symptom hormonal problem with your
thyroid hormone being too low which reduces your metabolism and
reduces your energy but those are all like kind of
more physical signs what I'm going to talk about is
more of a inner game side which commonly I think
goes under estimated and that is the importance of purpose
to your life which creates a lot of energy you'll
be surprised I actually have energy problems and being a
public speaker and being out here and try to be
charismatic and doing a lot of the stuff that I
do with socialization and shooting these videos this takes a
lot of energy for me and I work a lot
and I also go and socialize a lot this takes
a lot of my time a lot of my energy
and I tend to be an introvert so my battery
gets drained really fast when I'm doing social type of
things and I'm talking to people and I'm a charismatic
to deal with that I've been looking at a lot
of issues about energy and I've actually spent a lot
of time perfecting my supplementation I take over 50 different
supplements every day getting my thyroid check I actually have
a low thyroid so I take medication hormone to replace
a deficient thyroid and check in my sleep like trying
to pack all this stuff but then what actually if
I've noticed is that one of the things that made
the most profound changes for me and energy is getting
myself back on purpose with what I am really passionate
about so when I got back on purpose and this
happened for me just a few months ago recently where
I really got connected I got my site up started
shooting a lot of videos and doing a lot of
articles and I felt like man this is something that's
important to me in Sicily that I love to do
I finally feel like I'm onto something here that I
like I've been I've been after this for a couple
years trying to get to this point and now I
finally got it I feel like this is something that
is providing value to people it guess we fired up
it gets me out of bed in the morning gets
me energized I'm doing something that I actually love and
I feel like most people are not doing that in
their lives not nearly enough and so if you don't
have that in place it's going to be hard for
you to be energetic because if you have nothing important
in your life to fight for and to expend energy
on your body's not going to manufacture that energy the
fact is that your body kind of does the bare
minimum that it needs to get through the day and
if you don't challenge it at all it'll have enough
energy to get through a non-challenging day if you challenge
it a lot it'll eventually build up the reserves to
get to that point where you could handle that stress
certainly there are medical conditions you need to take care
of those but I found that life purpose can like
even slice through medical conditions sometimes I'm feeling bad I
might have a cold or whatever might be feeling tired
or sleepy but because I feel like this is something
that's important like I'll go out there shoot an extra
video all right next article I'll do something I wouldn't
otherwise do because I feel like it's important to me
and I'm connected with that and that's one of the
reasons that I preach having a life purpose so much
is because I think it does it gives you superhuman
strengths it gives you energy it gives you motivation and
that is something that you want to make sure that
you've got besides all the physical components of energy I'll
give you an example I mean right now I'm shooting
this video and this is like the seventh video in
a series in a string of videos that I just
shot seven videos in a row this has takes a
lot of my juices out my creative juices my energy
goes into these videos I'm shooting seven in a row
and I'm six o'clock in the morning I have gone
to bed I've been working through the night from I
didn't go to sleep at all I woke up today
at around noon time and now it's 6:00 in the
morning I've been working through the whole night shooting these
videos and I'm having a blast I'm like addicted to
it I love it and even though I'm feeling a
little bit a little bit groggy right now I'm starting
to lose my energy I'm starting to feel tired because
I see these videos and I'm like yes this is
cool I like what I'm sharing here I think this
will help people this is promoting my life purpose this
is contributing to my ultimate long-term vision I have the
drive I have the energy to shoot an extra one
and an extra one maybe I'll even shoot an eighth
one I don't know it's getting kind of late I
think I need to go to bed because I have
some stuff to do in the morning but that just
gives you an example right an example I want that
for you you have that in place you have a
firm life purpose if you don't then you're definitely missing
out on that pillar of potential energy gain so even
if you get all the other stuff handled all the
physical stuff you're going to want to tap into this
one this is where most of your energy is coming
from all the people that are super passionate and are
super charismatic energetic why do you think they do that
they have a purpose there's something there that they want
they're wanting to contribute they want to be excellent whatever
it is there are they're very clear on what it
is that they want out of their lives and that
supercharges them right and of course they still look out
for all the other factors they have to take care
of their health and their fitness and check to get
their blood checked go get their their medical exams do
all that stuff so get that handled but then get
that inner psychology right get the psychology of energy because
energy has a lot to do with your thought process
how you think what you believe and what you want
out of life will determine your energy level all right
so keep it short sweet on this one that's all
I have to say here about energy I'll cover actually
some of the physical components of energy in other videos
including supplementation exercise nutrition I'm really passionate about all those
especially because energy is something that I'm currently working on
myself so go and look for those on actualised org
and check the you might find some more value there
