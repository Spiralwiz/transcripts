hey this is leo for actualize.org and in this video
we're going to talk about healthy relationships all right let's
talk about how to create healthy relationships what does it
really take to be in a healthy relationship now i
don't know how much experience you have with healthy relationships
or relationships in general but if you have any relationship
experience then you probably know that it's very easy for
a relationship to go sour why is this it's very
fascinating to me why this happens and at a very
young age even though i didn't have a lot of
relationships i've actually not been in that many relationships in
my life but what i recognized is that it just
made sense to me inherently that to have a relationship
and to really have it work and to have it
last for a long time or even even a reasonable
even a year-long relationship i'm not even talking about longer
but just even to last a year something has to
happen something has to happen and it won't happen spontaneously
it won't happen spontaneously because what you're doing is you've
got one person who's doing his thing right in life
and doing this and then you got this other person
who's doing her own thing here in life her doing
her thing and then what you're doing if you're creating
a healthy relationship is that you're bringing those two together
and almost think of it as a ballet as a
choreographed ballet and you've got one dancer doing this spinning
this way got another dancing spinning the opposite way you
bring them close together and you want them to to
perform as some sort of duo right do something interesting
together so that it uh it it's it's collaborative it's
it's like the greater than some of its parts you
got to bring them together and now they have to
interact and they have to stay in sync and now
the longer the longer that ballet dance lasts what do
you think the more opportunity there is for them to
get out of sync right and to get them to
even get into sync in the first place and start
moving and mirroring each other in the right ways already
requires that they understand each other at a certain level
understand they have to have a certain level of development
they just have to have a certain level of training
so i think that most people this is what i
i see people doing with relationships is that they kind
of take the whole issue of relationships for granted both
men and women and they feel like well a relationship
is just something that happens naturally i don't need to
really work out i don't really need to study it
it'll just happen it'll come together i'm a guy she's
a girl or whatever the situation may be and you
know it's just going to happen nothing could be further
from the truth if you think that that is how
you're going to build a sustainable relationship something that's going
to lead to something very long lasting like potentially a
marriage no way in hell no way in hell that's
why that's why more than half the world is divorced
marriages don't work for this reason it's not that they
can't work inherently it's because people don't study how to
do it they don't understand the psychology of relationships they
don't understand the psychology of attraction of love of sex
of masculinity and femininity they don't understand any of that
so they go in there they try to cobble something
together and it fails it's kind of like if i
was trying to fly to the moon do you think
if i wanted to fly to the moon i would
just go and cobble something together in my garage or
would i spend some years learning aerospace engineering and i
learning physics and learning the the way the planets move
it orbits and all this stuff right yeah i would
have to spend some time studying it because it's a
complex thing that we're proposing here this is not something
simple and i would say it's almost easier to fly
to the moon than it is to hold some of
your marriages together because because of the incompatibilities you have
but basically because of the lack of understanding you guys
have alright so let's talk about relationships what is a
healthy relationship let's define that stephen covey in his amazing
amazing classic seven habits of highly effective people he classifies
three types of relationship he talks about the co-dependent relationship
the independent relationship and the interdependent relationship so let's start
with the codependent relationship this is the really unhealthy one
and this is what most relationships are and i want
you to be very careful here because you're very gonna
likely say no that's not me no that doesn't apply
to me no it probably applies to you codependency is
not just abusive relationships and relationships that involve drugs and
other you know criminal activities that's the worst of a
co-dependent relationship a co-dependent relationship is what most marriages are
it's what most girl guy relationships are so this is
the key point here is that if you have an
unhealthy relationship it's the codependent relationship type and it's probably
what you've got what is a codependent relationship it's when
the two parties lack something in each other and they
come together because each one of them is lacking something
and they see as the other one being their other
half and completing each other you might say well that's
how love is supposed to be no that's how love
is portrayed in movies and in fairy tales and in
other popular culture and it's the surest way to ensure
that you have an unstable relationship a dysfunctional relationship a
very emotionally painful relationship and a relationship that will ultimately
fail so the problem here is that each person is
needy in some way and they need the other person
so badly that they come together and as soon as
that other person starts to pull away or to take
something away or they don't they do something the other
person doesn't like then what you do is you get
angry you get angry you get hurt you get upset
you get fearful you get anxious and it creates a
lot of emotional tension because ultimately you're looking for the
other person to fulfill you and that's an impossibility a
psychological impossibility nobody can fulfill you but yourself so if
you go into a relationship thinking that the other person
is a solution all your problems what you're doing is
you're actually putting a band-aid over a deeper wound and
ultimately that wound is gonna start to fester and it's
gonna all that pus is gonna start to come out
of that wound and it's gonna seep onto the other
person and it's gonna taint everything it's going to destroy
everything it's going to make you feel miserable it's going
to make the other person feel miserable it's going to
be bad for both parties that's codependent when the two
need each other the second type of relationship is independent
you've got one person who's doing his own thing you've
got another person who's doing her own thing and they're
totally independent and you could bring them together but they're
doing their own things so they're so into each other
or into themselves i should say rather that they're they're
like they're not cooperating and they're not choreographing and so
what happens is they just kind of like split apart
and they're too independent they're thinking too much about themselves
they're too selfish independence ultimately is good because the next
step we're going to talk about is interdependence and interdependence
is actually a form of independence it's where the two
people are independent but then they start to do a
little bit of collaboration right but the independent relationship is
nice it's still much much better than the co-dependent one
so if you have an independent relationship still better you
can improve it though by moving it into an interdependent
relationship this is where you really want to be at
for something long term like a marriage interdependency this means
you are independent the other person is totally independent you're
happy by yourselves but you do enjoy each other's company
and you appreciate certain things about each other and you
can develop a love for each other but it's a
non-needy love it's not attachment you're not using the other
person as a an emotional crutch as a psychological crutch
to fulfill you so what you do is you make
some conscious choices that this is working and then you
say okay we're going to start to actually like work
with each other and we're gonna try to synergize and
we're gonna try to improve each other we're gonna try
to grow together and this is where that ballet choreography
really starts to happen right really think about think about
that that metaphor because if you got two ballet dancers
ideally they're independent right they can both dance well together
if you've got two dancers that can't dance for and
you bring them together do you think that they're going
to be able to dance well together no you got
to have two dancers that can dance well by themselves
and dancing well means living life well being happy by
yourself when you bring them together then you got two
master dancers together they practice together they train together they
can come up with a routine now they can with
the help of a choreographer they can you know make
some moves they practice they fumble but eventually they get
something that's that's nice that's seamless that's cohesive it's synergistic
that's interdependence and that's ultimately what you want that's what
a really really healthy relationship looks like so how do
you actually get there that's the trick well i think
the biggest thing you got to take away is that
you got to work on yourself this isn't happening naturally
right you don't you don't get born knowing how to
ballet dance you don't get born knowing perfect choreography that's
something you have to practice diligently for many hours you
have to study the theory you have to practice it
you have to fail a bunch of times and then
you get it right so the same thing here so
some of the practical things i'll give you guys some
of the points you should be considering one is that
you must come from a place of abundance that means
abundance sexually if you have no options whether you're a
girl you have no options or a guy and you
have no options then you are not going to have
a healthy relationship because you are so concerned you're so
fearful of losing the other person because he or she
is the only option and the only chance you'll have
for love and happiness that you you're gonna be too
clingy you're going to be too needy and when you're
so clingy and so needy that's going to repel the
other person away and it's going to cause many many
problems and ultimately you're always going to be fearful because
you're always going to see that if that other person
leaves you're screwed and that's because you haven't taken care
of the the scarcity problem that you have you have
to come from a place of abundance that means make
yourself attractive have a social circle be going out to
bars and clubs so that if you lose the person
that you're with you can be confident that you'll find
somebody new within you know a reasonable amount of time
this person that leaves you that should not mean that
the rest of your life is going to be a
lonely miserable hell if it is you got to fix
that that person is not the solution the solution is
that you fix your life so that you can attract
other people and that that's something that can be done
everyone can do that you can you know uh tweak
some variables to to that and i'll i talk about
in other videos too much to talk about it here
so make sure you have abundance sexual abundance in your
life if you're a girl have guys that you have
that could be options if you're a guy have girls
that you have that could be options all right the
next point is that you must be happy by yourself
so can you sit alone in a room for 30
minutes and not cry your eyes out and not be
anxious and miserable and fearful and feeling lonely and desperate
well if you can't then you're not happy by yourself
you have to be happy by yourself start constructing an
awesome life i mean that's why i shoot these videos
for you guys as i tell you how to construct
an awesome life i help you figure out the strategies
that you need and then you have to go out
there and actually do it so spend some time working
on your own life have a good job have a
good family situation have good friends have good health have
good nutrition all the stuff that's making you happy so
do that all right then the next point is that
you got to work on yourself work on your own
psychology not just an awesome life in here work on
your own quirks on your own fears on your on
your limiting beliefs on your neuroses because here's the fundamental
law of relationships is that you will attract exactly who
you are psychologically so you're going to attract the person
that's on the same psychological level as you so that
means if you have a lot of neuroses and fears
and limiting beliefs and anxieties and you're angry all the
time you're depressed guess who you're attracting yep you're going
to attract a similar minded person or you're gonna attract
a complimentary person right so maybe a depressive person will
attract an angry person or vice versa or some some
combination like that but either way it's gonna be a
dysfunctional codependent relationship that's not what you want what you
want to do is you want to say okay i
want an awesome relationship that means i need to make
myself as awesome as possible so that when i find
somebody else that person will be on my level and
then we're both going to be awesome right is that
the answer analogy if you want to be starring in
an awesome ballet recital you want to make yourself as
awesome as possible because when you're as awesome as possible
that means you're going to be allowed to dance with
the best answers you don't want to be dancing with
the worst answers you want to be dancing with the
best so work on yourself that doesn't mean you're wrong
that doesn't mean you're unlovable that doesn't mean that you
can't be loved as you are right now but you
should be working on yourself improve improve improve yourself all
the time improve yourself every day personal development you should
be doing personal development especially on your inner issues especially
stuff that's really triggering you stuff that's making you very
emotional you can't have a good choreography going if you're
extremely emotional and you get very angry or you get
very depressed or you get very fearful not going to
happen it's going to lead to too many uh instabilities
so many instabilities that you're not going to be able
to choreograph all right the next point i'm going to
make is don't spend too much time together this is
one of the problems and i think one of the
indicators of a co-dependent relationship a co-dependent relationship couple will
spend all their time together because they're so needing each
other they they feel the uh they kind of they
solve each other's problems temporarily they're both each other's psychological
crutches and so they lean on each other and they're
always together every day every night too much and then
what happens is just simply because they're together so much
you know you get sick of anything and you get
too much of anything even too much of the best
thing you're gonna get sick of it i guarantee you
whatever you love in life if i gave it to
you every single minute of every single day you would
get sick of it and bored of it and you
would hate it you would develop resistance to it so
that's the same thing with your relationship so you got
to have other stuff that's your life is about right
if you're a man especially you should be out there
working having a life purpose your purpose should be your
your main thing in life it shouldn't be your relationship
if you're a woman even there a case can be
made that you should also have a purpose i think
you should have a purpose but for women they're more
relation their purpose is more relationship oriented so more family
oriented so there's there's more leeway for you there but
still you want to have stuff you want to have
friends you want to have hobbies don't just be all
about being with your man that is going to lead
to problems so you know don't be with each other
every single day it's too much it's going to get
nauseating you're going to get on each other's nerves it's
not going to happen not going to be good even
the people you love the most like your parents or
your siblings if you spend a lot of time with
them you're going to be at each other's throats it's
healthy to take breaks apart it's healthy to have vacations
apart and you know do other stuff and not see
each other for a week here a week there and
only see each other once a week it's that's healthy
in fact that's gonna that's gonna keep some spark and
some excitement in your life because if you have a
long-term relationship i mean you're gonna get enough of each
other anyways if you're gonna be together for the rest
of your life or even like let's say just five
or ten years you're gonna know everything about each other
you're gonna get on each other's nerves so there's no
rush to be with each other too much otherwise you're
gonna you're gonna exhaust everything and then it's gonna end
it's going to peter out the next thing i'm going
to say is honesty and truthfulness you can't have a
healthy relationship that's built on dishonesty and lies and what
i encourage is if you've got any skeletons in the
closet about your past stuff that's happened stuff that you've
done things that you're ashamed of you got to just
like throw it all out there because the real risk
is not that someone's going to discover your skeleton the
real risk is that they're going to discover that you've
been lying about your skeleton so if you come out
there right at the beginning of the relationship and you
lay your skeletons out and you say you know what
i've done some stupid things in my life that i'm
not proud of and i've got these problems in my
life i've still got some things that i'm working through
here's where i'm really at i'm not going to be
fake with you here's where i'm really at and you
are honest about that you disclose it then you've got
a foundation that something can be built on now there
is a real risk that the person might see those
skeletons and say well i don't like that and then
run away and you know that's a risk that you
run and then the relationship splits apart because you guys
were not meant to be together but if what you
try to do is you try to lie about yourself
and project some sort of fake image make yourself out
better than you are what's going to happen is that
yes you might actually preserve the relationship in the short
run but in the long run it's going to cause
so much tension and distrust that you're going to ruin
any possible chance of of success and you're probably going
to create a lot of turmoil and distrust between each
other animosity just like resentment it's not going to be
pretty and in the end all those skeletons are going
to come out you're not going to be able to
hold your skeletons back i don't care maybe it'll take
a year maybe two but eventually everything is going to
come out it's all going to be seen you're not
going to be able to hide it you're not that
good you're not that clever the other person will see
it so ask yourself do you really want to to
lie so that you can keep it together for just
a little bit or do you want to be really
honest and have a chance to set up something and
i find that in a relationship you know you have
to you have to develop that sense of ability to
be trust uh both to trust the other person and
to be honest yourself and that's tough because a lot
of times it's very easy to not tell the truth
because a lot of times you tell the truth there's
emotional problems you have to deal with the situation it's
easier just to tell a white little lie kind of
gloss it over and then it never comes up and
then you say to yourself well i'll just deal with
it if it ever comes up in the future the
problem is that if that does happen and it does
come up the other person's going to know that you
didn't tell them and that you weren't honest that's going
to break trust and that's going to that's gonna rot
the foundation of everything you guys have so for me
personally um when i wanna create a good relationship i
i work on myself because i say that i need
to be strong enough as a man to be honest
even when it hurts to be honest i need to
be strong enough to be honest even when i don't
really don't want to even when it risks the whole
relationship i still have to be honest because to me
the honesty is the most important part so i try
to never lie in a relationship because i know that
if i do then i pretty much i have to
say to myself okay i'm lying in this relationship but
that pretty much means that this relationship has no real
long-term potential i can lie right now but if i
do like who am i kidding it's not going to
work so if i really value a relationship i'll really
push myself to be honest even when it's really really
hard and i've done that and yeah it's hard i
mean that's why people don't have successful relationships because they
do the easy stuff and the easy stuff doesn't work
and then the last point i'm gonna make is a
relationship should be about giving and not receiving don't go
into relationship trying to receive and this is another sign
of codependency in a codependent relationship you want the other
person you want something from them you want love you
want companionship you want sex you want like you you
need stuff really a nice interdependent relationship is you getting
pleasure from giving you like to give you know you
like to do nice things for the other person you
like to make them happy you are there to share
your knowledge your gift your your sex your sexuality like
whatever you're you're there to share all that share your
love give to the other person don't be about receiving
you will receive naturally as you give and it'll fuel
the relationship it'll create a lot of trust and it'll
create something really awesome and synergistic if you do that
