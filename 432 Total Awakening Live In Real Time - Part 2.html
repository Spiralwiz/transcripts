            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/NnpRkE4L_io' target='_blank'>Total Awakening Live In Real Time - Part 2</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Finite limitations of humans and other species</b>: Leo Gura talks about the limited nature of all forms of life and their specific abilities. He uses the example of birds not being capable of swimming and fish unable to crawl, indicating that each species comes with its own inherent limitations, including human beings. 
</li><li><b>Finite nature of spiritual teachers</b>: Spiritual teachers, regardless of their caliber, are viewed as finite. Worshiping these teachers, such as Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, or Abraham, is seen as a deviant from the path of achieving the infinite, as worshiping a finite form will never lead to the infinite. 
</li><li><b>Subjective vs divine perspective on individuals</b>: From a subjective perspective, individuals may be perceived differently based on their actions and nature. However, from a divine viewpoint, Leo Gura states there is no difference between individuals such as Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and Hitler.
</li><li><b>Levels of consciousness and selfishness in humans</b>: Different stages of consciousness in humans are discussed, ranging from individuals with no consideration for others to those with an expanded sense of self that includes their family, community, and eventually the entire world. 
</li><li><b>Evolution from local to global consciousness</b>: Leo Gura explains the progression from a small town identity to a national and eventually global identity. This expansion of consciousness leads to the realization that all nations are part of something larger, i.e., the planet, leading to growth in self-consciousness.
</li><li><b>The realisation of 'self' as illusory</b>: Surpassing finite limitations, individuals can reach a state of unlimited self, realizing that the 'self' as they know it was just an imaginary construct all along. At this point, there is no self, indicating a state of enlightenment or God consciousness.
</li><li><b>Spectrum of consciousness</b>: Leo Gura also elaborates on a spectrum of consciousness  ranging from those who are very limited and selfish at one end to those who have expanded their understanding and perception at the other. 
</li><li><b>Breaking societal conditioning for truth</b>: The importance of cutting through societal conditioning, giving up limited perspectives and biases, and facing the fear of the unknown to discover the absolute truth is emphasized.
</li><li><b>The 'truth' as something that resonates beyond belief</b>: Contrary to standard belief systems, truth is not about believing in a specific deity or ideology. Instead, "truth" resonates through direct experience, encouraging individuals to realize that they are part of the universal consciousness thereby having the ability to awaken.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of absolute relativity</b>: Leo Gura explains that every individual's understanding of God can be different, and this relativity of viewpoints can often lead to misinterpretation. The ultimate spiritual goal is to understand the absolute relativity of everything and aim for higher states of consciousness and selflessness.
</li><li><b>Praying and Self-forgetting</b>: Whether you pray to Jesus, Allah or follow Jewish traditions, if you keep questioning why you feel forsaken, it implies that you have forgotten yourself and are not conscious enough. There's nothing evil or incorrect about this, only a lack of higher consciousness.  
</li><li><b>Understanding God's impartiality</b>: God does not judge or punish anyone because God is fully conscious that people's level of consciousness varies. For example, Hitler's consciousness was very low, filled with fear and hatred, and his salvation came with his death. This might sound twisted from our perspective but it's just because of our incomplete understanding.
</li><li><b>Hitler phenomenon and selfishness</b>: Hitler's behaviour is an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon of selfishness present in everyone. He prioritized his needs and wants over others, just like when we prioritize ours over other people's. This self-centeredness manifests in negative activities such as nationalism, white supremacism, slavery, rape, murder, war, genocide, theft, lying, corruption, manipulation etc.
</li><li><b>Consequences of absolute selflessness</b>: If one was absolutely selfless and indifferent to pain, pleasure, materialistic achievements and environment status, they would find that there would be no room for any wrong. This tranquility might be hard to imagine, but it is possible when we view ourselves as infinite, shedding the distorted self-perception. 
</li><li><b>Fear and its effects</b>: People fear the message of absolute love and joy because it threatens the ego's need for love and the simultaneous fear of it. This constant tug and pull between love and fear underlies much of our experiences and prevents us from reaching a state of selflessness.
</li><li><b>Perception of reality</b>: Our perception of reality is bounded by our love for certain things and our fear of potential negative outcomes accompanying them. This however is a limited perspective, and from an infinite perspective everything that occurs is intrinsically good. 
</li><li><b>The importance of expanding consciousness</b>: To recognize the inherent goodness of every situation, we need to broaden our consciousness and cease being selfish. A narrow perspective hinders our ability to see the good in everything and results in a feeling of entrapment where small issues seem painful or offensive.
</li><li><b>Understanding God as Infinite Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura asserts that God is the polar opposite of fear, encompassing infinite love, being formless and conscious, and able to remain unharmed. This fearlessness allows one to expand their consciousness and move towards realization and awakening.
</li><li><b>Inherent Biases and Fears</b>: Gura explains that when consciousness lapses into self-bias, fear arises. He uses the analogy of consciousness as an infinite field that gets distorted, creating 'selves' or individual perspectives. Awakening is the unraveling of these twisted versions of consciousness, decreasing self-involvement, fear, and increasing love.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretations of the Message</b>: Leo points out that many individuals may misunderstand or even demonize his message due to their own attachments, biases, and fears. However, he insists what he expounds is the highest form of love.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Everything</b>: Gura emphasizes the relativity of everything, including spiritual paths and practices. He challenges the viewer not to limit their understanding and perception of God to any single belief system, deity, or spiritual practice, stating that these are all finite.
</li><li><b>Prayer and Divinity</b>: Leo explains that praying to spiritual figures such as Jesus, Buddha, or Muhammad isn't wrong or ineffectiveprayer works precisely because it is powered by the believer's own consciousness. However, it's essential to understand that focusing solely on any specific deity will not result in absolute awakening.
</li><li><b>Absolute Awakening and Self-realization</b>: Leo argues that absolute awakening comes by continuously striving and expanding consciousness and selflessness. The ultimate goal is to realize the absolute relativity of everything, breaking free from all attachments and overcoming all delusions.
</li><li><b>Attaining Infinite Love</b>: Leo concludes by expressing his wish for viewers to realize 'infinite love', which he proposes is the true essence of an individuals highest form. He encourages everyone to keep advancing in their spiritual journey towards enlightenment.
