            <ul>
    <li><b>Vegetable Soup as a Path to Self Actualization</b>: Leo of actualized.org shares a recipe and methodology for creating a healthy vegetable soup designed to replace around one-third of your meals, ultimately contributing to self-actualization and consciousness work. 
</li><li><b>Ingredients and Initial Preparation</b>: The super healthy vegetable soup notably consists of organic vegetables such as baby carrots, red bell peppers, celery, broccoli, and frozen green beans. Other key ingredients include a vegetable stock, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and assorted spices (like pink Himalayan sea salt, white pepper, garlic powder, coriander powder, and bay leaves). All these are added to a large pot, aimed at providing a week's worth of meals.
</li><li><b>Soup Creation Process</b>: The initial process involves adding the pre-washed and diced vegetables into the pot and also adding the vegetable stock. The olive oil and lemon juice are mixed in for added calories, taste, and a tangy kick in flavor respectively. The assorted spices are added to enhance the soup's taste further. 
</li><li><b>Boiling and Final Preparations</b>: The vegetable soup is then boiled, with a timer set for one hour, and the heat lowered to let it simmer. During this simmering session, subsequent edits and checks are made regularly to ensure the vegetables are appropriately cooked within the one-hour timeframe.
</li><li><b>The Soup's Relevance</b>: This soup can serve as a healthy and straightforward meal replacement, providing optimal health and mental clarity for its consumers. It can be regularly prepared using a variety of available fresh vegetables and ingredients. The ease of preparation and the benefits it provides make it suitable for those interested in self-actualization and consciousness work. 
</li><li><b>Future Challenge</b>: Leo encourages viewers to take on a 30-day challenge of making this soup, replacing a third of their diet with this healthy, easily preparable option, and share their results and feedback.
</li><li><b>Adding green beans and broccoli to the soup</b>: Avoid overfilling the pot. Use quality spring water to cover all the vegetables. Broccoli should be added last to prevent overflow when boiling. 
</li><li><b>Cooking method for the soup</b>: Crank up the heat to get the soup to boil. Once it starts boiling, start a timer for 60 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
</li><li><b>Notes on progress during cooking time</b>: At the halfway point of cooking (30 minutes), the vegetables will not be fully softened. It's necessary to wait for the full cooking time until all the vegetables are cooked through. 
</li><li><b>Post-cooking instructions and possible modifications</b>: Allow the soup to cool before refrigerating. Avoid using heavily starchy vegetables (like potatoes) in the soup. Experiment with different vegetables and flavors for variety. The soup can last for a week in the fridge. 
</li><li><b>30-day challenge with the soup</b>: Leo suggests replacing a third of your diet with the soup for 30 days. The soup promotes energy, mental clarity, and weight loss. Portion size doesn't have restrictions but the soup is quite filling. It doesn't require extra carbs like bread or pasta.  Leo encourages viewers to share their results and opinions by commenting.
