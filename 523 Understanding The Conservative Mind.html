            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/L2i4hUPjUO4' target='_blank'>Understanding The Conservative Mind</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding The Conservative Mind</b>: This video by Leo Gura of Actualized.org is the first in a two-part series aimed at giving a deep, non-partisan understanding of the conservative mind. Leo emphasizes that political ideologies are emotionally held and not just logical. He highlights the need for genuine understanding of other political ideologies, noting that many people do not truly understand why others find different political ideologies appealing.
</li><li><b>Different forms of Conservatism</b>: Gura describes conservatism broadly, including anyone right of center, which can range from Republicans and Libertarians to neocons, nationalists, and fascists. However, he acknowledges the fluid nature of political ideologies and parties, evolving relative to time and context.
</li><li><b>Understanding political ideologies</b>: Leo asserts that one must look beyond a country-specific or era-specific perspective to truly understand the nature of political ideologies. By understanding the broader, deeper foundations of the conservative mindset, it is possible to transcend beyond narrow, superficial characterizations that have evolved over recent years.
</li><li><b>Modern American Conservatism</b>: The recent developments in American conservative politics, particularly around the MAGA movement, have resulted in a distortion of traditional conservative values. Gura criticizes this movement as unintelligent, stating that it presents only a fragmented, distorted representation of what conservatism truly is, which only generates misunderstanding and undermines genuine conservatives.
</li><li><b>Aim of the Discussion</b>: Gura explains his ultimate goal - to generate a genuine understanding of the emotional appeal behind both the conservative and liberal mindsets, thereby facilitating healthier political discourse and understanding between differing ideologies. The key is to accept and explore these emotional ideologies, rather than dismissing opposing views as illogical or unintelligent.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Genuine Inquiry</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of a genuine desire to understand why people find conservatism appealing. He criticizes the common tendency to reduce these ideologies to stereotypical assumptions and argues for the need to transcend partisan perspectives for genuine comprehension of political ideologues. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Misconceptions</b>: He suggests that people must confront and reassess their preconceived notions about both liberal and conservative ideologies. He argues that many progressive individuals still hold a lot of ideological biases that prevent them from understanding the perspectives of half the world's population when it comes to politics. He encourages viewers to strive for understanding beyond personal biases and assumptions.
</li><li><b>Understanding of the Conservative Mind</b>: Leo Gura outlines the characteristics of the conservative mindset, emphasizing its depth and complexity. 
</li><li>- <b>Sensitivity to Fear and Threat</b>: The conservative mind, according to Gura, is more sensitive to fear and threat than the liberal mind, reacting more strongly to risk and danger. Neuroscience research supports this, showing differences in brain structures between conservatives and liberals. 
</li><li>- <b>Preference for Status Quo</b>: Those who benefit from the status quo are more likely to justify and defend its continuation. 
</li><li>- <b>Conscientiousness and Closeness</b>: These two characteristics are found in higher degrees in the conservative mind, according to the Big Five personality traits model. Conscientiousness is associated with following rules, while closeness is associated with less open-mindedness, as measured by openness to new ideas. 
</li><li>- <b>Seriousness about Life</b>: The conservative mindset generally regards life as a serious matter, guided by strict principles and rules for survival. 
</li><li>- <b>Understanding Different Worldviews</b>: Gura stresses the importance of genuinely understanding and acknowledging the complexity of opposing worldviews, noting that any generalizations made about political ideologies will not apply to every individual within that ideology. 
</li><li>- <b>Demographics and Environment</b>: Generally, conservative individuals often grow up in harsher, stricter environments, and their political ideologies can serve to reduce fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. The conservative view is largely shaped by survival conditions and continues to be more realistic and pessimistic. 
</li><li>- <b>Conservatism across Domains</b>: Gura touches on how conservatism extends beyond politics, impacting areas of life such as religion, attitudes towards change, and even adherence to scientific rigor. 
</li><li>- <b>Fear Sensitivity and Behavior</b>: The conservative minds heightened sensitivity to fear can influence its reactions to various elements of life, such as loud noises or societal change, leading to motivations to maintain order and avoid chaos. 
</li><li>- <b>Impact of Upbringing and Resources Availability</b>: The conservative mindset is shaped largely by upbringing, with many growing up in harsh or resource-limited environments. Individuals who grow up in wealthier families, despite harsh conditions, are more likely to support the status quo as it benefits them. 
</li><li>- <b>In-Group Preference and Paranoia</b>: The conservative mind leans more towards tribalism, having a strong attachment to in-group versus out-group dynamics, leading to more preemptive actions against perceived threats.  
</li><li>- <b>Cautious of Change</b>: The conservative mind values stability over change, believing change can lead to chaotic situations. It prefers order, structure, and certainty over uncertainty and ambiguity.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Mind</b>: According to Leo Gura, the conservative mind thrives on structure, order, and consistency. This could range from rules established by family, teachers, government, mentors, or spiritual leaders. Liberal-minded individuals might view a lifestyle without rules and obligations as ideal. However, despite an initial appeal, an unstructured, ruleless life can lead to psychological problems, including depression and suicidal thoughts if sustained for extended periods. Gura underlines that infinite freedom is not necessarily the highest good; there needs to be a balance between freedom and some structured order. 
</li><li><b>Case Study of Tsar Nicholas I</b>: Gura cites an example from Russian history, Tsar Nicholas I, who found peace in meticulously managing routines, like designing military uniforms and organizing the military. The conservative mind, exemplified by Tsar Nicholas I, finds solace in regimentation, micromanagement, and order. Although structure may not appeal to progressors and liberals, more conservative-minded individuals enjoy regimentation due to the peace and stability it can bring. 
</li><li><b>The Appeal of the Military</b>: Gura discusses the appeal of the military to conservative-minded individuals due to its regimentation and order. This love for order serves as an antidote to chaos, offering peace and stability. Linking this to the more significant picture of conservatism, Gura says that the start of an orderly life could be as simple as cleaning ones room, culminating in having an organized, successful life a few decades down the line.
</li><li><b>Exploring Personal Tolerance for Chaos versus Order</b>: Gura encourages viewers to reflect on their personal tolerance for chaos versus order, suggesting that an organized environment positively affects an individual's perceptions and feelings. He stresses the importance of order and structure for the conservative mind in maintaining a balanced, healthy life. Gura also emphasizes that cleaning spaces can serve as small but constructive steps towards organizing other aspects of life, eventually leading to success.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Mind (Conservative Mindset)</b>: The conservative mind is more safety-oriented and values stability and order over adventurous experiences. It shows lower tolerance for exploration and change, preferring the familiar and routine. The conservative mindset is deeply tied to family, heritage, tradition, and fitting into pre-existing societal structures. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Values</b>: Conservative individuals value confidence, certainty, convention, and firm beliefs. They're more disciplined and consistent and often derive satisfaction from sticking to plans and completing projects. They place importance on fitting into cultural and societal norms and demonstrate a deep connection to their roots, seeking permanence over change. 
</li><li><b>Role of Fear and Security in Conservatism</b>: The conservative mindset is significantly influenced by fear and the desire for security. It tends to be more sensitive to threats and potential dangers, adopting a defensive and protective stance. This sensitivity can manifest as anxiety and discomfort in situations of uncertainty and ambiguity, leading to a preference for clear and unambiguous circumstances.
</li><li><b>Limited Empathy and Sphere of Compassion in Conservative Mind</b>: The conservative mind typically exhibits a smaller sphere of empathy and compassion, with more focus on in-groups (their tribe, nation, etc.) over out-groups (other tribes, nations, etc.). This is not negative per se but reflects a characteristic survival strategy that prioritizes protection of the ingroup. They usually experience difficulty extending their empathy to diverse or differing groups. 
</li><li><b>Conservative views on Societal and Cultural Aspects</b>: Conservatives might have lesser openness to new experiences and demonstrate resistance to shifts in traditional ideas and norms. They often derive joy from fitting into larger, pre-existing societal structures. The conservative mind views society from a pragmatic viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of preserving traditional norms and systems. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Conservatism Through Personal Examples</b>: The video incorporates personal anecdotes to explain various aspects of the conservative mindset. An example includes rejecting an adventurous trip to Colombia, symbolizing the conservative inclination towards safety over exploration. Another focuses on the writer's rigorous approach to work, suggesting the discipline and consistency associated with conservatism.
</li><li><b>Conservative worldview on handouts and empathy</b>: This perspective suggests that people should primarily depend on self-discipline, hard work and overcoming life challenges, rather than relying on handouts or the sympathy of others. The conservative outlook deems developing one's character and resilience through hardship as crucial to success, overreliance on aid can potentially lead to a lack of self-discipline and personal growth.
</li><li><b>The role of survival conditions in shaping the conservative worldview</b>: Life's trials and hardships can lead to personal growth, resilience and character development, and this is a deeply ingrained aspect of the survival-oriented conservative perspective. This explains why conservatives may be less inclined towards unconditional love and acceptance, as they prioritize survival.
</li><li><b>The conservative mind's moral priorities</b>: Conservatives have a firm sense of absolute good and evil, and adhere strictly to a moral code. Violations of this code by others can incite judgment, and conservatives often view themselves as morally superior to those who breach their moral standards.
</li><li><b>Fear and self-righteousness in conservative thinking</b>: Conservatives often adhere to strict moral codes and judge those who do not comply. This leads to a certain self-righteousness and positions them as morally superior. Their worldview is often more black-and-white, preferring clear rules and boundaries over moral gray areas, promoting a simpler, less ambiguous way of living.
</li><li><b>Conservative perspective on social issues</b>: Conservatism leans towards clear delineations - a behavior or act is either right or wrong, permissible or not. It values clarity, simplicity and ease of decision-making, preferring pre-drawn lines to subjective judgments. This perspective is particularly influential when navigating moral and social issues. 
</li><li><b>Value of structure and order in conservative ideology</b>: Its proclivity for survival prioritizes the importance of order, clarity, and simplicity, hence, making life easier. Conservatives prefer well-defined boundaries, reducing moral ambiguities and debates. Sympathizing with a conservative perspective for individuals able to draw moral and ethical boundaries can be more challenging due to their subjective and variable nature.
</li><li><b>Conservatism and discipline in spiritual growth</b>: Seriousness and discipline are crucial in exploring spiritual teachings and pursuing awakenings, marking another area where conservatism applies. The focus here is on the truth of the spiritual journey rather than illusions of simplicity or self-deception.
</li><li><b>Inadequacy of empathy in conservative minds</b>: The conservative worldview may lack empathy for those who are seen as not adhering to norms or trying to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. This lack of empathy can lead conservatives to primarily understand experiences that they have personally encountered. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of fear in conservative thinking</b>: Fear can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Conservatives' fear of change can cause them to resist it, ultimately causing the situations they fear. Similarly, fear can lead to a begrudging conformity to societal norms and unquestioning obedience to authoritative leaders. 
</li><li><b>Struggles of the conservative mind</b>: The conservative perspective often struggles with tackling complex concepts such as relativity, subjectivity, emotionality, surrender, self-control, empathy, and openness to new ideas. Reflecting on these struggles can help avoid potential detrimental consequences. 
</li><li><b>Conservative viewpoint on gender roles in the military</b>: The conservative standpoint typically posits that men should play primary roles in the military, with women in auxiliary positions. This view stems from the belief that civilization could decline if women were in combat roles. 
</li><li><b>Conservative perspective on transgenderism</b>: The conservative mindset views the blurring of the traditional male-female boundaries, as seen in transgenderism, as disturbing, causing uncertainty especially among young people in search of firm identity. 
</li><li><b>Conservative perspective on atheism</b>: Atheism, from the conservative standpoint, leads to secularism promoting materialism and nihilism. Without a higher purpose or moral code, conservatives believe society becomes degraded and focussed on superficial pleasures.
</li><li><b>Conservative perspective on economy, socialism and Marxism</b>: Conservatives view individuals as inherently self-interested; hence, economies should function based on self-interest. They deem concepts like socialism and Marxism as unrealistic, arguing that human nature is hierarchical, and those who generate more value deserve more rewards.
</li><li><b>Conservative viewpoint on immigration</b>: The conservative perspective posits that unrestricted immigration to developed countries is not feasible or fair. They believe maintaining cultural identity and social systems would become difficult if everyone could freely immigrate. 
</li><li><b>Conservative approach to tackling crime and environmental concerns</b>: The conservative perspective asserts that harsh punishment for criminals is necessary for maintaining order and preventing societal chaos. They prioritize economic stability over strict environmental regulations, believing that improving material conditions is vital for human well-being.
</li><li><b>Conservative metaphysics, epistemology, and morality</b>: The conservative mind views reality, knowledge, and morality as fixed and absolute. It holds that reality can be known through a set, unchanging method, and morality is based on distinct right and wrong. 
</li><li><b>Belief in moral order and authority</b>: Conservatives tend to believe in an inherent moral hierarchy, with individuals having authority over others based on their moral character and conduct. 
</li><li><b>Preference for clear distinctions and dichotomies</b>: Conservatives prefer clearly demarcated boundaries and distinctions (such as between man and God, or male and female) and resist their fluidity or ambiguity. This mindset shapes conservatives' viewpoints on issues like the transgender debate. 
</li><li><b>Strict views about norm boundaries</b>: The conservative mind views blurring norm boundaries, even if possible, as potentially dangerous, leading to societal confusion and harm. Conservative caution contrasts with the liberal mindset, which tends to be more open to such boundary exploration.
</li><li><b>Conservative metaphysics and worldview</b>: The conservative worldview involves fixed, static perspectives on reality, viewing human nature as inelastic and preferring the preservation of the established order. This guides their apprehension towards new developments like genetic engineering and man-machine interfaces.
</li><li><b>Highest good in conservatism</b>: For the conservative mind, the highest good is fulfilling duty in alignment with established societal ideals. This perspective fuels adherence to fixed moral principles or codes.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Mindset</b>: The conservative mindset believes in a predefined set of virtues and principles which are considered the "right" way to live. A well-functioning society, according to this view, can only be achieved if everyone adheres to this list and enforces the same values around them.
</li><li><b>Ideological and Faith-based Belief System</b>: The conservative mind tends to be more faith-based, ideological, religious, and orthodox in nature. They believe in a specific moral code which they perceive as the objective truth, and they sympathize with the mixing of church and state given that they see their religious moral codes as the guiding principles of a "good society."
</li><li><b>Association between Personal Beliefs and Law</b>: Conservatives tend to seek the codification of personal religious values, beliefs, and ideals into law. Their worldview is often less flexible and open to outside perspectives, often being less worldly, less educated, and less open to science and rationality due to their firm adherence to religious or ideological principles.
</li><li><b>National Identity and Patriotism</b>: Conservatives place significant value on national identity, symbolism, and patriotism. They are inclined to defend the status quo and see questioning or challenging societal norms and values as a form of betrayal.
</li><li><b>Fear of Social Decadence</b>: Conservatism is characterized by a fear of the deterioration of moral fabric in society. The mindset is threatened by social decadence and changes in societal norms, hence it defends culture staunchly. New habits, lifestyles, art forms, attire, music, different types of sexual relationships, drugs, and pornography are often seen as threatening and uncivilized.
</li><li><b>Views on Progressives and Liberal Mindsets</b>: Conservatives and liberals have fundamentally different perspectives on societal transformation. While conservatives view critics of the status quo as betraying stable societal values, liberals view their criticism as a means of improving society by highlighting flaws. Hence, ideological conflicts arise when these two views collide.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Perspective on Rules and Law</b>: In this section, Gura explores the conservative belief in the necessity of strong external structures, laws and tradition to ensure societal order and good behavior among humans. The conservative perspective views most people as followers of societal norms and envisions the potential for moral degeneration without strict rules. This viewpoint values norms and traditions, believing that they have evolved over thousands of years to cultivate moral behavior in society, such as condemning rape.
</li><li><b>The Conservative Take on Consequences of Societal Progress</b>: Conservatives fear that the breakdown of traditional norms (such as increased acceptance of homosexuality) and adoption of new technology might disrupt social order and result in unfavorable outcomes.
</li><li><b>Individual's Relation to Authority and Group</b>: The conservative mind is more concerned with pleasing others and fitting in with their in-group, frequently in a conformist manner. They respect authority, often displaying obedience and allegiance to it, with a preference for paternalistic leadership.
</li><li><b>Conservative Perception of Foreign Culture</b>: The conservative perspective typically holds a deep love for its own culture, often believing it to be morally superior. There is a general fear and discomfort with alien cultures coupled with the desire to safeguard ethnic identity and national culture.
</li><li><b>Approach to Expressing Love</b>: Love from a conservative point of view is often expressed as tough love, with an emphasis on masculine compassion (tough-minded) instead of feminine, tender-minded compassion. They believe in raising children strictly to prevent them from making poor life choices, as guided by clear do's and don'ts of right and wrong behavior.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Supposed Modern Dangers</b>: The conservative mind tends to resist modern dangers such as promoting unrestricted freedom of sexuality or drug use. They believe caution should be exercised for children against moral relativism and ambiguity, thereby proposing strict upbringing over permissive one. 
</li><li><b>Future Fears Stemming From Societal Changes</b>: Conservatives are concerned with perceived threats to the traditional order, such as advances in technology, the breakdown of heterosexual norms, unrestricted immigration and potential loss of cultural identity. They often express a preemptive approach, preferring to address potential problems beforehand rather than solving them when they occur. 
</li><li><b>Struggle with Change and Evolution</b>: Conservatives generally struggle with societal change and evolution given they possess a high regard for historical norms and traditions. They often express discomfort with societal progressions like increasing acceptance of differing sexual orientations and the proliferation of new technology, believing that such changes could potentially disrupt social order and norms. 
</li><li><b>Valuing Cultural Heritage and Identity</b>: The conservative mindset places a high value on cultural heritage and personal identity. There is a deep-rooted love for their own culture, often deeming it morally superior to others, and a sense of fear or discomfort in encountering foreign cultures. Patriotism and ethnocentrism are typical characteristics of the conservative mind.
</li><li><b>Attitude Towards Authority</b>: The conservative mind values obedience to authority, often leaning towards a more authoritarian, patriarchal and hierarchical behavior. They express allegiance to their group or party and appreciate clear, traditionally established norms and rules.
</li><li><b>Parenting Style and Moral Teaching</b>: On the topic of child upbringing, conservatives lean towards strict parenting styles, favoring discipline and clearly defined dos and don'ts to teach morality and prevent supposed poor life decisions of the child. The "tough love" approach to parenting aligns with the conservative belief in tough-minded, masculine compassion.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Mindset</b>: The conservative mindset is resulted from a survival-oriented, more fearful perception of the world. This mindset values tradition that stood the test of time, distrusts radical changes due to possible unintended consequences, and prefers gradual reforms. This preference for stability often results in strict adherence to established rules and harsher forms of justice.
</li><li><b>Conservative Views on Strength and Weakness</b>: Conservatives view strength as imperative for survival and society's stability. They often hold disdain for perceived weakness, choosing to emphasize toughness rather than nurturing perceived weakness. Breaking rules is seen as a serious violation that can lead to the societal chaos; hence, rule-breakers are met with less empathy.
</li><li><b>Conservative Views on Violence and War</b>: The conservative mind is more prone to resort to violence as a way to resolve disputes, particularly in threatening situations. War is considered necessary at times to maintain order and suppress chaos. The conservative mind distinguishes between moral violence and immoral violence or violence which is justified and that which is not.
</li><li><b>Conservative Worldview</b>: The conservative worldview sees the world as a dangerous place requiring discipline, obedience, and self-reliance for survival. Sticking to one's group is valued, as outsiders pose potential threats. The conservative mind is less about exploration and more about maintaining the status quo for fear of negative consequences.
</li><li><b>Distrust towards Utopian Schemes</b>: Conservatives tend to distrust utopian schemes due to their mostly negative views on human nature and skepticism towards the possibility of humans engineering perfect societies. They prioritize the security of identity, survival, and community over idealistic reforms.
</li><li><b>Reluctance to Embrace Change</b>: Bias against innovation and change is a conservative trait. These changes are seen as potentially harmful due to their possible unintended consequences. Tradition represents wisdom to conservatives and societal harmony is seen as more important than reforms.
</li><li><b>Conservative Views on Society and Governance</b>: The conservative mind values laws, force, and police as key to successful societal functioning. It believes in hard boundaries and clear definitions for order and harmony. There is a definitive distinction between in-group members (deserving of protection and loyalty) and out-group members (seen as potential threats).
</li><li><b>Lesser Emphasis on Empathy in Conservatism</b>: The conservative mindset does not place a high emphasis on empathy. Instead, it chooses to emphasize adherence to societal rules and norms, and punishment in the event of violation. This approach is driven by the perspective that human nature is fundamentally flawed and that allowing subjective human judgement might lead to societal chaos. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Stance on Restrictions</b>: Conservatism historically supports restrictions in various forms, including free speech and expression. While circumstances may differ, traditionally, conservatives have often argued that unrestricted freedom and liberties can lead to social unrest. This traditional conservative belief has exceptions and variances across different societies and times.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Mindset Regarding Freedom and Control</b>: The conservative mind values safety and stability over freedom. It supports restrictions on free speech, dress, freedom of religion, and sexuality based on survival conditions where too much freedom threatens the survival of the state, tribe, people, culture, or religion. Conservatives fear freedom due to its potential to question power and cause chaos, such as in the case of a civil war following the deposing of an authoritarian leader. 
</li><li><b>Conservative belief in Self-Interest and Hierarchy in Economy</b>: The conservative viewpoint holds that the economy should be arranged around self-interest due to humans' fundamentally selfish nature. They are skeptical of workplace democracy, considering average workers as needing authoritarian direction. 
</li><li><b>Conservatives' Views on Risk and Caution</b>: Conservatives advocate for caution and a conservative approach in high-stakes situations, such as brain surgery or child protection. However, they are more flexible with low-risk situations like trying new food. The conservative mind favors strength, discipline, order, and respects traditional gender roles. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Perspective on Sexual Repression and Self-Control</b>: The conservative mind views sexual repression as a necessity since uncontrolled sexual desires can bring harm to oneself or others. It's typical for the conservative mind to experience feelings of guilt, shame, anger, and disgust and to fear displeasing God or sinning. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Fear of Radical New Thoughts and Deep Introspection</b>: The conservative mindset is fearful of not just the dangerous external world, but also the dangerous inner world, leading to an avoidance of deep introspection. Conservatives also fear radical new ideas leading to cognitive dissonance and self-realization of being wrong or misguided, creating a certain fear of self-discovery. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Views on Strength-Based Approach to Survival</b>: Conservatives err on the side of caution, often choosing to invade their neighbor first rather than risk being invaded. They are less likely to be too empathetic or too nice, knowing that it often doesn't aid survival in harsh conditions such as prison. 
</li><li><b>Context-Sensitive Nature of Conservative and Liberal Approaches</b>: Being either conservative or liberal is context sensitive and depends on the situation and risks involved. Given the potential dangers, conservatives argue for maintaining economic stability over strict environmental regulations. Liberals are generally more open to risks associated with freedom and exploration.
</li><li><b>Depth of consciousness exploration</b>: Leo Gura highlights that exploring consciousness can involve facing radical, intimidating thoughts. This experience may be particularly challenging for conservative-minded individuals, whose thinking patterns are often more ordered, rigid, and less intuitive. This exploration can lead to ambiguous, uncertain, and paradoxical thoughts, which transitional conservatism struggles with due to a fear of uncertainty and a need for closure. This also results in a less understanding attitude towards other points of view.
</li><li><b>Conservative mind's preference for tangible values</b>: Gura points out that the conservative mindset often disregards subjective, imaginative or abstract things and leans towards tangible, unambiguous values. It fears losing control of one's mind and sense of reality, which is why certain substances and behaviors seen as loosening self-discipline are viewed as dangerous.
</li><li><b>Gratitude towards status quo and belief in human inequality</b>: According to Gura, the conservative mind is generally grateful for the status quo and justifies existing social hierarchies and systems. There is a belief in innate inequalities among humans and that some are naturally superior, which often leads to defending existing power structures and classes.
</li><li><b>Sensitivity towards threats from outside the tribe</b>: The conservative mindset tends to focus on threats and potential dangers from outside ones tribe or group. It is inherently tribalistic and more oriented towards preserving resources for the in-group due to the belief in the scarcity of resources.
</li><li><b>Struggle with diversity and a general anti-multiculturalism</b>: Conservatives generally struggle with diversity and are uncomfortable with multicultural environments. They see diversity as a source of potential chaos and societal disintegration, leading to a fear and discomfort towards foreigners, immigrants, and other minority groups that deviate from traditional values. They also tend to enforce control over others' behaviors through punishment, laws, and authority figures.
</li><li><b>Clear rewards and punishments for behavior</b>: The conservative mind values a strong adherence to law and order, believing that any transgressions should be met with appropriate punishment rather than leniency or forgiveness. This viewpoint aims to maintain societal structure and prevent chaos.
</li><li><b>Strong attachment to home, tribe, country, culture, traditional norms, and values</b>: Conservatives feel a deep connection to their community, cultural traditions, and country. They have a strong sense of nostalgia and an aspiration to return to what they perceive as the "good old days" when society was morally strong and uncorrupted.
</li><li><b>Focus on fiscal conservatism</b>: A key principle of conservatism is financial prudence, believing the government should not run up large debts that will burden future generations.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of the conservative worldview and personality</b>: Conservative individuals are typically seen as persistent, tenacious, stable, hard-working, reliable, and loyal, among other traits. They value duty, order, and clear rules of right and wrong and prioritize serving their community and nation.
</li><li><b>Conservative ideology shaped by survival and harsh conditions</b>: The fear of danger and threats breed a hyperrealistic and pessimistic worldview in conservatives. These challenges force conservatives to prioritize their own survival, and that of their immediate community, above all else.
</li><li><b>Certain situations may warrant different reactions for liberals and conservatives</b>: Depending on the context, both diplomatic (liberal) and tough (conservative) approaches can have their merits. This dichotomy vividly comes into play in scenarios of conflict or potential threats, where the priority for liberals and conservatives might be different.
</li><li><b>Conservative approach to potential threats</b>: Conservatives see preemption as a viable strategy against possible threats. Their emphasis is often on acting tough as a deterrent to future bullying or attacks.
</li><li><b>Conservatives' glorification of authoritative figures</b>: They often admire violence, guns, sports, manliness, strength, police, and other authority figures as these elements can contribute to survival, protection, and maintenance of order.
</li><li><b>Conservative solution to an arms race</b>: Rather than pursuing open-dialogue or disarmament, conservatives believe in defeating the opponent by out-muscling them, building better and more weaponry to demoralize the opponent into submission. They view this as a realistic and effective approach in a hostile world.
</li><li><b>Scientific Conservatism</b>: Most scientists exhibit conservatism in the method they follow for research, prioritising the preservation of methods and accuracy over exploration that could lead to breakthrough discoveries. While conservative science adds reliability and rigorous detail, it limits the potential for novel and groundbreaking research insights. Conversely, adopting a more liberal and exploratory approach in science can lead to innovative breakthroughs, albeit with higher risks of inaccuracies.
</li><li><b>Conservative Fears</b>: The conservative mindset is primarily directed by fears of disorder, change, sin, loss of power, loss of control, foreign elements, relativism, ambiguity, and uncertainty. Fear often manifests as a self-fulfilling prophecy as extreme worry about a potential scenario can contribute to its actualization. 
</li><li><b>Conservative Blind Spots</b>: Notably, conservative ideology often overemphasizes the dangers of change while underestimating the hazards of maintaining the status quo. This perspective extends to limited empathy for those oppressed by the existing system unless conservatives themselves share the same experiences. Historical instances show that conservatives may blindly conform to man-made social norms and constructions and may unquestioningly follow authoritarian leaders, often to detrimental outcomes. Conservatives tend to misunderstand core concepts such as evil, God, love, religion, and freedom.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Conservative Perspective</b>: Embodying conservatism requires an overemphasis on order, strict adherence to norms, conformity, obedience to authority, and a notable intolerance for abstract, relative, or paradoxical concepts. This perspective is exemplified in sectors such as the military, interpretations of religious texts or traditions, and views on social issues like transgenderism, atheism, and immigration. It struggles with emotional openness, spontaneity, subjectivity, and the acceptance of new ideas.
</li><li><b>Understanding of the conservative worldview</b>: The conservative worldview is primarily grounded in the preservation of tradition, order, and societal structures that have been around for centuries. Change is met with caution, as it is often associated with instability and the potential for societal degradation.
