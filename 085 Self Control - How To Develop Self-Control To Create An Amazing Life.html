            <ul>
    <li><b>Self-Control Definition</b>: Leo Gura defines self-control as the ability to master one's own psychology, and states that it plays a crucial role in enhancing happiness and success in one's life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Control</b>: According to Gura, self-control can lead to stronger relationships, better health, financial success, and a profound impact on the world. He suggests that one's life work should be dedicated to self-control and self-mastery.
</li><li><b>Outer and Inner World Concept</b>: Gura explains that humans live in two simultaneous worlds Â— the outer physical world and the inner world filled with thoughts and emotions. While the outer world is usually the center of concern, true satisfaction comes from influencing the outer world through inner self-control.
</li><li><b>The Traps of Outer World Focus</b>: Gura warns about the danger of being consumed by the outer world, which could lead to a victim-mindset. He emphasizes the significance of reversing the process by prioritizing the inner world, thinking like a creator, and imposing the inner reality onto the outer world.
</li><li><b>Mastering Psychology</b>: Gura believes that mastering one's psychology is essential to influence the outer world effectively. He argues that most people get trapped into a victim mindset due to the inability to master their inner world.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Self-Control</b>: Self-control is difficult to develop due to the emotional labor and struggle involved. Gura points out the complex biological structure of the human body and the brain's essential role in maintaining equilibrium as reasons for this difficulty.
</li><li><b>Brain as a Complex Thermostat</b>: Gura describes the brain as a complex thermostat responsible for maintaining numerous factors in equilibrium, such as survival, reproduction, social status, and hunger. To build self-control, one must reconcile and balance these factors.
</li><li><b>Developing Self-Control</b>: Gura insists on taking the necessary steps to develop self-control, despite the emotional labor involved. This involves working through the complexities of the human brain's regulation system and achieving mastery over emotional responses.
</li><li><b>Complexity of Brain Function</b>: The human brain acts as a complex thermostat that balances various elements of survival including reproduction, inhaling air, success, approval, social status, and hunger. It drives our physical movements, thoughts, and actions. Maintaining balance is challenging and often leaves individuals feeling out of control.
</li><li><b>Developing Self-Control</b>: Self-control can be developed through consistent work, emotional intelligence, introspection, and expanding consciousness. This process includes engaging opposing neural networks in the brain, similar to decision-making conflicts. Personal development and increased awareness help manage these clashes.
</li><li><b>Increasing Prefrontal Cortex Strength</b>: By actively engaging in personal development, learning, experimenting, and accepting feedback, individuals can increase their prefrontal cortex's strength. This region of the brain controls impulses, behaviors, and emotions, leading to improved self-control, courage, persistence, introspection, and self-awareness.
</li><li><b>Negative Impact of Neglecting Self-Development</b>: Lack of discipline and neglecting self-development weaken the prefrontal cortex, causing a loss of control and feelings of guilt and emptiness. This feeling results from the 'lower self' taking over control while the 'higher self' still yearns for full potential to be reached.
</li><li><b>Building Self-Control with Discipline</b>: Self-control can be improved through disciplined habits, including rising at a specific time, maintaining dental hygiene, meditating, journaling, punctuality, eating healthily, and regular exercise. Consistency in such practices trains the brain and strengthens the prefrontal cortex.
</li><li><b>Reducing Overstimulation for Enhanced Self-Control</b>: To build self-control, it is important to disconnect from overstimulating media and spend time alone contemplating and introspecting. This independence aids in developing self-control and increases consciousness.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Mastery Commitment</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of committing to self-mastery, taking action, and focusing on self-control for improved life. He sees self-control as the foundation of personal growth, influencing both personal and family life. 
</li><li><b>Use of Actualized.org</b>: Leo promotes his free coaching services and newsletter on Actualized.org. His belief in the transformative potential of the ideas he shares underscores his commitment to helping others develop their self-mastery. Self-control, to Leo, forms the crux of personal success and satisfaction.
