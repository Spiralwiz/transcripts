            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/vJG8swAQYwc' target='_blank'>How Psychedelics Work - Making Sense Of Psychedelics</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Psychedelics</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that to truly understand how psychedelics work, one must have direct experience with various psychedelic substances over a significant period of time. He suggests it takes at least 50 trips to genuinely comprehend their potential, stressing that psychedelics are potent tools for personal development and spiritual growth. He contends that they offer levels of insight into reality's nature unattainable via conventional methods. 
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and Perception of Reality</b>: Psychedelics challenge our mainstream perception of an objective, external reality. Instead, everything we perceive as physical is a product of our mind or consciousness. Psychedelics reveal that our experience of life is hallucination, and there is no distinction between psychedelic trips and ordinary life. We are not altering our brain chemistry when taking psychedelics  we are changing our consciousness, thus transforming our perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Realizing Life as a Hallucination</b>: Leo elaborates that realizing life itself is a hallucination is a significant breakthrough in a psychedelic trip. He notes that it's not that we take a hallucinogenic substance, hallucinate, and then come back to ordinary reality. Instead, there is no difference between a psychedelic trip and our usual perception of reality. Both are states of consciousness, forming the singular context of our existence.
</li><li><b>The Radical Shift of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics provoke a radical shift in our consciousness and perception of reality, compelling us to reevaluate our beliefs. They could elicit fear and resistance as they threaten our sense of self and perceived reality. They offer a transformative experience that recontextualizes our reality. The stigma surrounding psychedelics emanates from the ego's defense mechanism against such transformative experiences.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Psychedelics</b>: Consciousness is our ability to tap into different dimensions of existence. Psychedelics can enormously amplify this consciousness, making us aware of the entire universe and offering us a sense of omniscience. They affect not only our recognition of our surrounding environment but also intensify the perception of minor details like colors, sounds, and feelings. 
</li><li><b>The Value of Psychedelics</b>: The true value of psychedelics lies in their ability to propel the mind to observe and compare varying states of consciousness, thus revealing the fluidity of consciousness itself. This experiential shift can be transformative, providing insights often inaccessible to most people. Psychedelics facilitate a more profound shift in our consciousness compared to traditional meditation practices.
</li><li><b>Scientific Limitations and Broader Consciousness</b>: Leo criticizes science's limitation to a single state of consciousness, suggesting there are countless other states to discover. Psychedelics, like adjustable knobs, allow our perception of reality to undergo drastic changes. These substances provide the potential to expand our understanding of the world, creating space for new possibilities and perspectives.
</li><li><b>Contemplation and Integration of the Psychedelic Experience</b>: The psychedelic experience requires thoughtful contemplation and integration fueled by an open mind and a willingness to challenge existing paradigms. With time, repeated trips can make a significant and positive impact on a person's life, expanding their perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Accepting the Mind-Created Reality</b>: In order to understand reality, an individual must give up their limited perspective and embrace the power of imagination and consciousness. This understanding reveals that our perception of reality, though stable and consistent, is still a hallucination.
</li><li><b>Effects and GIFs of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can disrupt our normal reality by altering our perception and focusing our attention on minor details. They also give the mind the ability to observe and compare different states of consciousness, providing invaluable insights and a meta-understanding of how the mind generates reality.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics Accelerate Personal Growth</b>: Psychedelics can significantly influence personal growth and accelerate someone's movement through different stages of development. With continued and responsible use, the process of self-improvement could be sped up.
</li><li><b>Open-Mindedness towards Psychedelics</b>: Leo ends the segment by emphasizing the importance of approaching psychedelics with open-mindedness and a serious, methodical mindset. Irresponsible or immature use of these substances can be harmful. A willing individual should practice careful, intentional exploration, gradually increasing doses for meaningful experiences.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic Experiences Feel Like Hallucinations</b>: Leo emphasizes that our perception of reality is a hallucination created by our consciousness. We aren't taking any chemicals to alter the brain. Rather, we are different states of consciousness interacting to create different perceptions.  
</li><li><b>Our Consciousness Sustains Specific Patterns for Survival</b>: Our consciousness produces regular patterns that we've grown comfortable and familiar with. For instance, our daily routines or the unchanged hues of the sky. These normal patterns are necessary for our survival and sanity. 
</li><li><b>Psychedelics Can Distort Familiar Patterns</b>: Psychedelics change the ordinary and rigid flow of consciousness, leading to one's everyday reality melting around them. What is considered insane are changes that are out of the norm.  
</li><li><b>Our Perception of the 3D Physical Reality Could Be A Hallucination</b>: The impact of powerful psychedelic experiences leads to a breakthrough, causing a complete recontextualization of our prior experience of life. Suddenly, your past life appears to be just another hallucination while you plunge into radically new perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming Fear is Essential for True Understanding of Psychedelics</b>: Most people do not reach the point of psychedelic-induced breakthroughs because of fear. Understanding such experiences requires an extremely open mind and a willingness to change your entire paradigm of reality. 
</li><li><b>Negative Stigma Around Psychedelics May Be a Defense Mechanism</b>: People often react negatively to discussions on psychedelics. This could be attributed to the ego mind's defense mechanism against the threat of shattering long-held views on reality.  
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Infinite Display That Can Render Anything</b>: Imagine consciousness as a screen with infinite dimensions and properties capable of rendering anything. The adjustments made through psychedelic use can be compared to turning different knobs on a sound mixing board, changing the display of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Psychedelics</b>: Leo discusses how taking psychedelics changes several aspects of consciousness including intensifying emotion and altering physical perception. Comparing consciousness to a control board with numerous knobs controlling different aspects of our experience (such as visuals, sounds, and emotions), he suggests there is a master knob, dubbed pure consciousness awareness, which controls the level of consciousness without altering its content. Twisting this knob increases consciousness, making an individual more aware of their surroundings. 
</li><li><b>Effects of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics vastly increase consciousness, potentially leading to a state of omniscience or what he terms "God consciousness." However, psychedelics also twist other minor knobs which complicate perception by changing colors, sounds, feelings and more. This leads to a disruption of the ordinary flow of consciousness, much like throwing a log into a river interrupts the rivers natural course. Leo emphasizes that the psychedelic experience depends on the dose, method of intake, and type of psychedelic ingested. 
</li><li><b>Problem with Psychedelic Experience</b>: Most people are not trained to handle a high level of pure consciousness, this leads to attention being given to the minor knobs that psychedelics twist. Thus, the individual gets distracted by the changing content of their consciousness, such as colors, sounds, and patterns, and fails to focus on the significant increase in their level of consciousness achieved by twisting the master knob. 
</li><li><b>Criticism of Psychedelic Experience</b>: Leo addresses the criticism that psychedelic experiences are merely temporary state changes. He argues that everything experienced is essentially a state of consciousness and psychedelic experiences are invaluable because they allow one to observe changes in states of consciousness, revealing the fluidity of consciousness itself.
</li><li><b>Understanding Consciousness</b>: He emphasizes that the main value of psychedelic experiences lies not merely in the altered state but in the opportunity to observe and understand how consciousness can transition between states. By experiencing and understanding these transitional mechanisms, one can gain profound insights into the nature of consciousness itself.
</li><li><b>Understanding Psychedelic Experiences</b>: Psychedelics aid in shifting states of consciousness and provide a novel experience of this change. They amplify the consciousness to the point that it becomes fluid, this change in state is an eye-opening, transformative experience. Psychedelics can achieve a variety of unexplored consciousness states beyond the capability of traditional meditation.
</li><li><b>Significance of Varied States of Consciousness</b>: Experiencing different states of consciousness through psychedelics can have a lasting impact, incite alteration in perception, and provide an enriched understanding of existence. This is compared to being transported from a familiar environment to a dramatically contrasting one.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Scientific Understanding</b>: Current scientific understanding neglects the scope of consciousness possible by focusing on a single state. Just like scientific observations made within a particular state (like a dream) would not hold true in others, mainstream science, based on a constant state, overlooks a vast number of other states. Accepting this is seen as a significant challenge to the scientific community.
</li><li><b>The Profound Impact of Psychotropic Experiences</b>: Exploring the fluidity of consciousness and experiencing different states can alter one's perception of reality and self. Experiencing even temporary shifts like morphing into a different entity (e.g., from human to a beer bottle) can offer valuable insights and alter one's outlook towards life significantly.
</li><li><b>Comparing the Transformative Effect</b>: The transformative impact of experiencing contrast and change in states of consciousness can be as profound as transporting a person from a peaceful neighborhood to a war-torn area and then bringing them back. This change in perspective has the potential to deeply transform a person's life. 
</li><li><b>Expansiveness of States of Consciousness</b>: Psychedelics demonstrate the infinite possibilities of states of consciousness and challenge established norms. Each transformation broadens understanding and acceptance of various states of consciousness, inviting a correspondingly infinite range of experiences. This way, psychedelics contribute to an enriched comprehension of life, humanity, and reality.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics stimulate profound transformations</b>: Psychedelics allow individuals to experience new possibilities, which can bring about profound transformations. The experience can be compared to uprooting someone from a familiar environment and exposing them to a radically different one, which results in an expanded sense of what reality can be like. This experience, however, is hardly like switching between physical surroundings  it is more akin to moving from one dimension of reality to another. 
</li><li><b>Limited time and maximum learning</b>: The psychedelic experience, though typically lasting about six hours, is marked by such extraordinary revelations that time seems to fly by. Upon returning from the trip, making sense of the experience and applying new insights into day-to-day life become the chief challenges. Yet even though an individual may only bring back a small fraction of what they learnt, the profound nature of the experience means that even a small percentage translates into significant changes or improvements in their ordinary life.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Expansion</b>: Psychedelics enable individuals to raise their consciousness, thereby enhancing their understanding of various realms of life such as science, relationships, spirituality and emotions. As this central "consciousness knob" is tuned up, the enhancements gained from it extend beyond simply exploring other dimensions. Most of the value from the psychedelic experience derives from this increase in consciousness, which greatly helps in introspection and enlightenment regarding existential questions about self, life, love, emotions, mind, and realities, among others.
</li><li><b>Risk of Self-delusion</b>: It is possible to delude oneself with these psychedelic experiences. Individuals who lack maturity, carry psychic baggage or are generally not advanced in their consciousness are more likely to misconstrue their experiences. Yet this possibility also exists in the individual's ordinary hallucinations or experiences. It is equally possible to misinterpret the experience in default hallucination as it is in a psychedelic-induced one. 
</li><li><b>Developing New Paradigms and Models</b>: To comprehend reality at its highest levels, individuals need to discard their existing paradigms and belief systems and be open to understanding new models of reality. This involves not only a shift in intellectual comprehension but also emotional labor, as the entire emotional system and web of beliefs must undergo changes. Given that these beliefs often influence various aspects of the individuals life, this transformation process can be challenging. However, only through such foundational changes can one hope to achieve a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Perception as a Hallucination</b>: Leo argues that reality is consciousness, an infinite mind that can imagine anything. Our perception of reality is stable and consistent and as such, appears real and unchangeable. This emphasizes the power of the "hallucination" as it is stable and persistent, creating a solid, tangible reality. Psychedelics can disrupt this pattern, leading to shifts in perception and new experiences of reality.
</li><li><b>Limits of Human Experience</b>: Leo relates human experiences and perception to that of an ant with a limited domain, arguing that most people never venture beyond what they know for certain. Venturing into the unknown involves risk, and this is part of exploration. Emphasis is placed on the need for courage and radical open-mindedness to explore beyond the familiar and limited domain of experience. 
</li><li><b>Reevaluation of Materialistic Paradigm</b>: Leo suggests abandoning the materialistic paradigm, which posits an objective external reality. Instead, it is suggested that there is no objective material reality outside of perception and subjective appearance, positioning consciousness as the basis for all reality. 
</li><li><b>Reality as Infinite Possibilities</b>: Leo argues that reality consists of an infinite number of states of consciousness that are possible within the infinite mind. As such, material reality is considered a special case within this infinite number of possible states, emphasizing that what we call reality is largely based on familiarity. 
</li><li><b>Potential Risks of Psychedelics</b>: Leo acknowledges that high doses of psychedelics can be dangerous, both physically and mentally, due to their ability to severely warp reality. It's stressed that gradual and responsible exploration of psychedelics is important to avoid negative consequences, suggesting that users need to build experience before attempting high doses. 
</li><li><b>Interference with God's Dream</b>: Leo describes the universe as God's dream and emphasizes that we are all aspects of Universal Mind (or God) experiencing this dream. Taking psychedelics is seen as an interruption of this "pre-planned dream," causing a shift into new territories and perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Fluidity of Psychedelics</b>: Leo highlights that one of the major effects of taking psychedelics is the experience of the inherent fluidity of consciousness. These substances cause everything to start melting around the user, signifying a dramatic shift from stable consciousness to a more fluid state.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality through Psychedelics</b>: Leo describes how psychedelics can allow the user to experience God's mind. This connects to his understanding that reality is purely a product of imagination, and that using psychedelics can allow one to tap directly into the infinite capacity of imagination, responsible for the creation of all material reality. He also asserts that the effectiveness of the psychedelic experience relies majorly on the individual's internal purity, and that immature or underdeveloped users may have more negative experiences.
</li><li><b>Perception and Hallucinations</b>: Leo discusses that what we perceive, including the material reality around us, is entirely imagined and thus not dissimilar to a hallucination. Our mental and emotional states, governed by neurotransmitters, dictate these perceptions. Further, he highlights that even these neurotransmitters are hallucinatory in nature, reinforcing his viewpoint that all reality is consciousness.
</li><li><b>Insights from Psychedelics</b>: He addresses the question of the authenticity of insights gained through psychedelic use, stating that although open to misinterpretation, these insights can be more potent and real than those accessed in sober states of consciousness. He invites listeners to question why they place such importance on the "ordinary" conscious state, suggesting it is no less a state of hallucination than a drug-induced one.
</li><li><b>Criticism and Mockitoic Perception</b>: He talks about critics of psychedelic use, arguing that they are flawed in their belief that the current configuration of consciousness (governed by neurotransmitters) is the single truth and that they ignore the delusional nature of their criticism. He emphasizes that the truth is a meta-understanding, identifying that all states of consciousness are just that - different states and appearances of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Interference of Psychedelics with Consciousness</b>: Leo goes on to add that psychedelics interfere with neurotransmitters and therefore have the ability to affect these conscious states dramatically. This then allows the user to reach higher levels of awareness of this fluidity of consciousness, further demolishing the concept of a single, objectively true reality.
</li><li><b>Misconception of Psychedelics</b>: He also tackles the misconception of psychedelic experiences being false or delusional, asserting that they are as real as any sober state of mind. However, he advises against holding onto any particular experience or insight as "the truth," but rather to acknowledge the infinite possibilities of reality.
</li><li><b>Different states of consciousness and insight</b>: Different states of consciousness provide different levels of access to insights and truths about our reality. The current state most people exist in may be one of the least suited for accessing truth. To truly understand and evaluate this, one must venture into other states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Limited perspective and the use of psychedelics</b>: Our current state of consciousness is as limited as living on earth compared to exploring the vast universe. Psychedelics are not about reaching a blissful state, but about gaining insight into the intricacies of how the entire system of consciousness and reality operates.
</li><li><b>Meditation and its effects</b>: Meditation done properly causes a change in our state of consciousness. This requires intense focus for long periods. The changes induced by meditation are similar to those experienced when using psychedelics, however, achieving this state through meditation can take much longer.
</li><li><b>Using both psychedelics and other spiritual practices</b>: Psychedelics are a powerful tool for exploring consciousness and reality but should not be used as the only method of self-improvement. They can speed up the awakening process, provide wisdom and guidance, and help with issues such as fear of death, trauma, and relationships. However, their efficacy depends on individual commitment, curiosity, and open-mindedness.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and personal growth</b>: Psychedelics can significantly accelerate personal growth and progression through different stages of development. With consistent use, individuals may experience rapid evolution in their consciousness levels.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics' impact on scientific thinking</b>: Psychedelics can bring about a transformative change in how scientists perceive and conduct their explorations. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining an open-minded and innovative approach to scientific investigation.
</li><li><b>Galileo Galilei analogy</b>: An analogy with Galileo Galilei highlights the potential resistance to change that can occur in the scientific community. Much like how Galileo's groundbreaking findings via his telescope were initially rejected as they challenged the established paradigm, psychedelics may face similar rejection due to their radical nature. However, acceptance and exploration of these new tools could lead to significant advancements in our understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Galileo Galilei and Paradigm Lock</b>: Leo Gura compares the resistance of scientists and theologians towards Galileo Galilei and his discoveries with the contemporary skepticism surrounding the use of psychedelics. He reasons that just like the church leaders refused the use of the telescope as a valid scientific tool, modern science is reluctant to accept psychedelics as a tool for understanding reality.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and Cultural Phenomenon of Science</b>: Leo discusses how the acceptance of psychedelics as scientific tools would revolutionize the current understanding of science, comparable to the paradigm shifts caused by Galileo, Newton, and Einstein. He mentions the stigma and demonization faced by scientists currently researching psychedelics and suggests that these difficulties arise from the limiting perception of conventional science.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as Tools for Exploration</b>: Leo emphasizes the responsible, methodical, and mature exploration of psychedelics for meaningful experiences. He warns against using these substances irresponsibly and suggests that being open-minded, challenging existing paradigms, and investing effort and dedication are essential to utilizing these tools effectively. 
</li><li><b>Challenges Faced by Scientists Studying Psychedelics</b>: Leo identifies academic repercussions such as losing jobs and credibility as challenges faced by scientists who openly discuss their psychedelic experiences for scientific advancement. He asserts that the recognition of psychedelics as a valid scientific method can impel significant changes in understanding science.
</li><li><b>Reluctance to Explore New Modes of Reality</b>: He underscores closed-mindedness and paradigm lock as two hindrances to accepting psychedelics as a legitimate scientific tool. Leo criticizes individuals who are so deeply entrenched in their existing paradigms that they refuse to open up to new ways of perceiving reality, limiting their understanding and progress.
</li><li><b>Importance of Mature and Responsible Use of Psychedelics</b>: Leo concludes by underlining the significance of responsibly exploring psychedelics with maturity, respect for the substance, and appropriate measures for safety. He suggests that the methodical use of psychedelics, akin to looking through Galileo's telescope, can reveal profound insights about reality and consciousness.
</li><li><b>The potential transformative power of psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics, when used responsibly and in combination with practices like contemplation, can lead to transformative experiences that change one's understanding of reality and consciousness. The use of psychedelics should not be trivialized but framed within the intent to better perceive and comprehend reality. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's website, Actualized.org</b>: On his website, Leo Gura provides various resources like a blog, courses, and a forum to foster discussions about the exploration of reality and consciousness. Forum members often post insightful trip reports that can enhance understanding by providing personal experiences. 
</li><li><b>Holistic approach to existential understanding</b>: Leo Guras teachings extend beyond psychedelics and aim to create a holistic understanding of life, death, society, consciousness, and more. These insights do not stem from armchair philosophy, but from real-life experiences and practices, and can lead to deeper understanding than conventional academics and scientists provide. 
</li><li><b>The importance of radical open-mindedness</b>: Being radically open-minded is crucial to comprehending the depth of what Leo Gura is offering. People can fall prey to judgement, arrogance, and inflexible belief systems, which can hinder the growth of understanding. Radical open-mindedness, curiosity, fearlessness, and a desire to explore are prerequisites for following Leo Gura's teachings. 
</li><li><b>The implications of closed-mindedness</b>: Lack of open-mindedness struggles to accommodate new knowledge and experiences, and fails to recognize the bigger picture. Majority of people who dont commit to the journey metaphorically get left in the dust, unable to grasp the realities Leo speaks of. Their skepticism or refusal to accept it tends to take form in negative comments or denial. 
</li><li><b>Importance of taking action and doing the work</b>: Understanding reality at this level necessitates personal commitment for growth. Individuals need to go beyond merely consuming content and actively do the work required, including meditation, visualization techniques, and potentially responsible psychedelic use. Its through putting in the work that individuals can validate these teachings for themselves and witness personal transformative experiences. 
</li><li><b>The transformational experiences of committed followers</b>: Some followers have followed along with the journey and witnessed significant transformations in their lives. These messages from transformed individuals validate the potential impact of the work and serve as encouragement for future explorers. Anyone can attain these insights and transformation; it comes down to rolling up our sleeves and doing the work. 
</li><li><b>Future foundational topics to be discussed</b>: Leo Gura aims to continue discussing foundation topics in the future, offering an opportunity for individuals to stick with him, engage in the work and eventually participate in these powerful, transformative experiences.
