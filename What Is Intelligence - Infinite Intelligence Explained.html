[Music] you due to overwhelming popular demand the beard and
the shirt are making a comeback so in this episode
we're gonna be talking about what is intelligence and intelligence
this is one hell of a mysterious thing if you
really think about it I want you to start to
think about intelligence at a much deeper level than most
people conventionally do we're not going to be talking about
your standard cut and dry notion of intelligence here in
this episode we're going to talk about some deep and
very advanced stuff here think about it you you as
an individual you have intelligence whatever your level is doesn't
matter whether you have a lot of it or a
little of it you have it but what is it
and the question I'm interested in here is I'm not
interested in what is human intelligence I'm not interested in
how to quantify intelligence the way the scientists are for
example I'm interested in what is intelligence at the existential
level because if you look inside yourself you'll notice that
you've got it and you could notice when you're using
it and you can feel it functioning within you but
then what is that I mean obviously it's there and
it seems to be a function and a feature of
the universe because hey you are the universe you're a
piece of the universe so whatever you have the universe
must have by extension but I'm getting a little bit
ahead of myself but what I want you to notice
by going inside of yourself and noticing your own intelligence
at work is that intelligence is actually contrary to what
many rationalists believe which is that intelligence is just some
sort of cut-and-dry mechanical process of using logic that that's
not really what intelligence is at all it's a much
more intangible abstract mysterious sort of thing how is it
possible that you can behave intelligently how is it possible
you can have these intelligent thoughts that's not a dumb
brute force mechanical process that's not just some algorithm running
in your head it's not just some computer crunching away
at some numbers you can look at some situation in
life with intelligence what does that really mean what is
it what is it really made out of it's hard
to pin down just what it is and science gives
us a lot of definitions that I could cite to
you here there are many scientists from AI research to
neuroscience to social psychologists and clinical psychologists and developmental psychologists
who've been studying this stuff for for last hundred years
and all of their definitions you can go read them
on Wikipedia they're really unsatisfying because Sciences approach to this
question is very reductionistic they sort of think that if
we can just break down intelligence to just some sort
of behaviors is a very behaviorist sort of approach to
intelligence in fact many definitions that I was reading on
Wikipedia that scientists come up with is something like the
capacity of a system to basically navigate some sort of
puzzle or complex maze that's what they sort of reduce
it down to but there's something a little deeper deeper
going on than just that but before we get to
that I want to take a little tangent a little
sad an interesting story that I encountered just for shits
and giggles one day I decided to go to 4chan
4chan is a have sort of a toxic online forum
or a lot of conspiracy theories and and meet online
memes start off and I'm not one to visit these
sorts of places regularly and I haven't actually been there
maybe only a couple of times in my whole life
but I decided to go there because I just wanted
to see what kind of crazy nonsense are people talking
about unfortunate so I go there I'm looking around just
you know it's just sort of like looking at a
bad car accident just for curiosity but what interested me
is there was a there's a sub forum there called
science and mathematics is the /sy forum so I go
on that thinking that oh maybe there's some interesting stuff
about science here so I started looking at what are
they talking about science and one of the that blew
my mind is that they're all talking about intelligence almost
every post there is about intelligence in one form or
another because the people that are there I get the
sense that they're sort of like high school kids or
early college university kids mostly males by that by the
sound of it and they are interested in becoming good
scientists and mathematicians so it seems like they got this
idea in their head that to be a great scientist
or mathematician you need to have very high IQ and
so everybody is talking about IQ and is your IQ
high enough to become a good scientist and they put
graphs and studies and things like that have all this
kind of evidence and data to suggest that if your
IQ is below 150 you shouldn't even bother going into
technical science fields or hard science fields like physical science
mathematics computer science engineering these STEM fields they say don't
even bother going into it because you're not gonna be
able to become a great scientist or an engineer and
you're basically not gonna be able to succeed in life
because your IQ is too low and then people are
writing there and they're asking like oh is my IQ
high enough to become a physicist or mathematician or a
computer program or something like this and it's hilarious because
some of the members are like no your IQ is
not high enough and they actually invented this jargony word
called brain let brain lent which they use in a
sort of demeaning way to say someone who doesn't have
a high enough IQ i think i think the way
they define it is if your IQ is below 150
then you have no chance and you're a brain late--
and this to me is just very amusing it's both
sad and the music at the same time because it
just shows you that these otherwise intelligent people and I'm
sure there are people there who have IQs above 150
that are posting their responses but these otherwise intelligent people
how they have such a narrow-minded perspective on what intelligence
is and just how toxic this is from a personal
development standpoint they really believe that they're that their ability
to succeed in life hinges upon their IQ and they
really believe that their ability to make breakthroughs within science
is about their ability to pass some sort of silly
IQ test it's it's it's really really short sighted and
very very limiting and the sad part about it is
is that they really don't understand where the creative achievements
of the greatest scientists come from they don't come from
being able to solve some standardized IQ test they come
from true innovation true creativity being able to think outside
the box being able to jump between different paradigms this
sort of flexibility that's really what you need if you
want to be a breakthrough scientist which is something other
than IQ people get stuck on this notion of IQ
as if IQ is just some sort of feature of
the universe no IQ is a is a very limited
narrow quantification of this larger thing called intelligence and by
the way there are many different ways to measure intelligence
and IQ is very much a culturally biased sort of
westernized rationalist version of how to measure intelligence you see
it's precisely because intelligence is so abstract and mysterious and
difficult to pin down that there's no good way to
measure it but of course science mechanistic science again here
we go with materialism is all about quantifying something and
if you can't quantify it well then it's not real
but of course the scientist has a problem because the
scientist is using his intelligence to actually do his science
but at the same time the scientist doesn't have a
clue what intelligence really is so of course that's quite
embarrassing so we want to do is we want to
create some tests and we want to create some simple
stupid formulas to reduce doubt what intelligence is into a
couple of you know simple numerical scores something like that
and then we can use that to judge other people
and and yada-yada-yada it it starts to veer off into
some mum into some bad and unproductive territories the smartest
thing you can do with an IQ test is not
to take one you see and there's different kinds of
intelligence that you can measure intelligence for example your ability
to solve logical puzzles you use intelligence to to test
like your creative intelligence your artistic intelligence your can aesthetic
intelligence like how intelligent are you with your body which
for example might be manifested when you're doing karate or
Taekwondo or physical sorts of activities you know a lot
of people are good McCann who are good mechanics they
are good with their hands that's another kind of intelligence
and then of course you have emotional intelligence which is
EQ and I'm only scratching the surface of all the
different types of intelligences that there really are so you
can see intelligence a much broader spectrum of stuff and
even if you took all of those into account and
you quantified all of those different types that would still
not be enough to account for what I'm talking about
here as intelligence and what's the common factor between all
of those and how come intelligence takes these all these
different forms and yet still there's intelligence like how come
there's a certain intelligence for solving puzzles like you have
to be pretty intelligence to solve a Rubik's Cube that's
one kind of intelligence and that's mostly like the kind
of stuff that IQ measures and then you have to
have a different kind of intelligence like a musical intelligence
to be able to compose a good a good song
or a good melody or something like that and then
you have to have another type of intelligence interpersonal intelligence
to be able to be good at politics in large
groups to be a good leader that takes another kind
of intelligence right so what's the common thread there because
we call all these intelligences but they're different kinds is
their commonality very interestingly you know they've done studies and
you know what they've measured is the greatest predictor of
your success in life overall and even in business not
IQ EQ your emotional intelligence far far far more important
not to mention which also not just that but also
if we're talking about your happiness and your well-being in
life IQ is it's not what you should be worried
about you should be worried about EQ and other things
like consciousness awareness and all their topics that I talk
about on actualised org and even if you're the type
of person says leo I don't even care about my
happiness I don't care about intelligence I don't care about
relating to people I'm just one of those nerdy scientists
and all I care about is just being good at
my math or my size or my the artificial intelligences
that I'm engineering or something like that that's all I
care about and for that I need IQ you're still
narrowing it down way too much and ultimately you're not
gonna have a good successful life even if you do
manage to become a great mathematician or something because you
know what it's still very very narrow I have I
known mathematicians professional mathematicians and universities who are deeply intelligent
as far as mathematics goes but then they're clueless about
the larger picture of how mathematics fits into the larger
reality being a great scientist means not just being good
at your little narrow technical field it means having a
very big picture curiosity about the world which is why
the most genius scientists they were holistic thinkers people like
David Bohm and Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr these were
not your typical technical scientists these were true geniuses and
if you want to be a genius what you need
is you need to understand and you need to be
able to tap into true intelligence at the existential level
not some stupid human metrics that society and culture has
created which will all be just it will all turn
into pseudoscience 100 200 years from now and even today
you can realize that it's so narrow and that you
can go so much further you can become such an
incredible scientist or mathematician or engineer if you actually get
to the root bottom of what intelligence is and you're
really able to tap into true intelligence but enough of
that tangent let's talk about what intelligence is not so
obviously intelligence is not IQ also intelligence is not logical
reason which might be shocking to the rationalists also intelligence
is not knowledge of course intelligence is not emergent phenomenon
intelligence is not a feature of the brain intelligence is
not a human quality and intelligence is not even biological
or something that is exclusive to life so then what
is intelligence well to really answer this I want to
talk to you about how I discovered for myself the
essence of intelligence but what I'm going to tell you
here is you got to realize this is a very
advanced topic this is a topic that I'm going to
talk about here that probably may be like one in
a hundred thousand human beings on the entire planet maybe
one in a million will be able to understand what
I'm talking about here and it doesn't matter how high
your IQ is because some of this stuff on me
talking about is gonna just plain sound crazy so I
encourage you to listen for it with a very open
mind I'm gonna be talking about intelligence from the non-dual
enlightened perspective and even if you studied enlightenment and you've
read books about enlightenment and non-duality chances are you haven't
heard anybody talking yet about intelligence what intelligence really is
I've read dozens of books and I've heard dozens of
videos and I haven't really heard anybody talking about intelligence
rather surprising to me and that's because man this stuff's
it's really really deep to understand the stuff you got
to go really deep and to talk about it then
makes you sound very crazy so please keep an open
mind so here's what happened with me a couple of
months ago maybe three months ago four months ago I
don't know during one of my psychedelic trips I experienced
absolute infinity the ultimate nature of reality that reality is
an infinite singularity I've talked to you about that so
I'm not gonna go into that too too deeply here
I'm not gonna bore you with that we've covered that
ground before but what I realized during one of these
strips and I had only vaguely remembered now is I
realized that this infinite singularity is also intelligent and that
was interesting to me I didn't understand what that meant
it was just a very vague hunch like why would
it be intelligent because when I thought about absolute infinity
to me just seems sort of like a brute-force dumb
mechanical process like reality just sort of everything gets spawned
into being because it's completely unlimited and there's nothing to
limit it from the outside so therefore everything has to
basically manifest itself in all the ways that it does
and that's where you find yourself today right now standing
in the middle of absolute infinity okay but why is
it intelligent is that like why would that be fundamental
and I didn't know it's just sort of a hunch
but one of the things that I just sort of
made a mental note of for the future is I
said I need to ask the next time I'm really
tripping deep I need to ask why are you intelligent
and I framed it in those words why are you
intelligent because I was sort of it's sort of like
asking the universe why are you intelligent that's what I
wanted to ask now of course the universe or the
you here is actually me because I am the universe
apps when you're absolutely infinite there's nothing other than you
it's completely one's completely non dual so it's not like
you're really asking the question to somebody else you're asking
the question to yourself of course it's not your little
normal ego self it's the universal self you're really asking
the question of the universe you are the universe asking
the universe why am i intelligent now that's a hell
of a question to ask and you might wonder Leo
come on I mean is that really a legitimate question
how do you know that's even a legitimate question to
ask how do you know you can trust the answer
if you even get one back and what would it
even look like to get an answer back isn't this
now bordering on some sort of mystical woowoo spiritual sort
of stuff well the truth is I didn't know if
this was a legitimate question or not I didn't know
where it would take me it was just something that
you know I just hadn't kind of a hunch about
it so I went with it and then I you
know months pass and I forgot about this whole situation
I forgot about this question it was just you know
deep in the back of my mind and then during
my retreat which I recently did the first half of
the retreat I did some deep tripping and during one
of these trips I stumbled upon infinite intelligence which I
hadn't stumbled upon before even though I had had all
sorts of different realizations and insides very deep insights about
reality but but not infinite intelligence and it took me
completely by surprise I didn't go into this trip expecting
to ask this question or expecting to get some kind
of answer it just sort of blindsided me and this
was one of the most shocking mind-fucking realizations that I've
ever had in my entire life so I do this
trip on five Meo and I'm just blindsided by this
profound if fit epiphany that infinite intelligence I sort of
go inside of myself I get to the very root
of what I am like what am i and why
why is it there and how did it get there
and I become conscious that I literally designed myself into
being using infinite intelligence this infinite intelligence has no form
in no shape and yet at the same time it's
all powerful and it can literally manifest things into being
and so what I remember very vividly and this just
completely blew my mind is I was I was sitting
there on the floor and I was cognizant this pure
formless intellect that of course I realized I was because
this was complete non-duality and I looked I looked I
I still have I have goosebumps right now on my
hand just from thinking about this I looked at my
arm this one right here and I saw every single
hair on my arm and I became conscious that I
literally designed like engineered every single hair that's on my
arm every molecule in every hair every little nook and
cranny every curve all of them just utterly perfect designed
by a master who has infinite knowledge of every thing
and infinite power and put them all into place and
then the sort of the crown jewel of this of
this trip was that of course then I sort of
asked the question even further well where did this infinite
intelligence come from why is it here and the response
was that is it created it's it's so infinitely intelligent
that it figured out a way to actually sort of
like go back in time and create itself in the
perfect most delicious strange loop ever and that that is
how everything is here the way that it is and
then when you look around the room or you look
out the window and you see whatever you see even
the most ordinary mundane stuff you become conscious that it's
designed with absolute infinite intelligence perfectly it's the most perfect
configuration of reality that could possibly be and you are
inside of it not only are you inside of it
but you yourself did it that's the ultimate mind [
__ ] you did it and then you forgot that
you did it and that it was just amazing after
that I sat on the floor and in fact this
insight this insight was so shocking and jolting that I
just kind of sat there awestruck silently just like traumatized
honestly traumatized by this insight because you see if I
designed myself I'm the only thing in existence there's no
one I can turn to for help for assistance if
I was I was completely alone it was like I
was in the sort of infinite intelligence solipsistic Yuman being
that exists so even if I ask somebody hey am
I going crazy now is this actually true what what
I'm saying here I couldn't really rely on their answer
because I designed that person as well it's all just
a dream that I engineered and it's absolutely crazy right
it's crazy doesn't make any sense from the conventional materialist
dualistic paradigm how is it possible that this could be
the case sounds like fantasy sounds like just fiction sounds
like just a bad trip or some some wonky trip
gone wrong right well maybe not I'll let you figure
that out for yourself but I'll tell you what I
know is that human intelligence is just the tip of
the iceberg of cosmic universal intelligence the entire universe is
intelligent this intelligence is pure intelligence which means that it's
formless it's infinite its omnipresent meaning it's non localized its
present in every square millimeter of the entire universe and
if there are multiple universes than every universe that could
ever be the multiverse everything this intelligence is disembodied and
that's what intelligence really is it's not some neurons in
your brain it's not some algorithm that's running away it's
not some behavioral stuff that you can do some puzzle
you can solve it's just pure intelligence but that is
why it's so challenging is because it's so abstract that
you you don't know how to get a handle on
it notice that right now you are intelligent I want
you to go inside of yourself do this exercise go
inside of yourself and feel your own intelligence on the
inside your intelligence is that faculty within you that's allowing
you to understand think about what that really is that
is not some mechanical process how is it posture so
how is it possible that you can actually make sense
of these concepts that I'm talking about how is it
possible you're actually able to look at reality and make
sense of it this is not a simple thing this
is extraordinary this is utterly mysterious and miraculous we just
take it for granted because hey we sort of bored
with it and everybody around us can kind of do
it but think about it this is this is an
unbelievable gift like it's a miracle that you can do
this at all how is it possible how is it
possible that some bouncing balls if you are a materialist
and you believe that reality just atoms atoms and quarks
bouncing around just energy random energy nothing nothing special about
it how is it possible that random balls bouncing around
inside of a box can lead to you then understanding
having a deep understanding of some facet of reality even
for you to be thinking of reality and holding it
as a as a box with bouncing balls in it
that's a that's already an active intelligence for you to
come up with that now of course the materialists they
have all their excuses and justifications and stories for how
this works you know yeah ad leo to random mutations
over time evolution bla bla bla millions and billions of
years and then the other stuff it's not so mysterious
that you can have intelligence but what is intelligence how
do you get intelligence from from just balls bouncing around
in a box how does that produce intelligence consider that
your paradigm is wrong consider that intelligence is fundamental to
reality and is not an emergent property that comes about
billions of years later after much evolution notice that intelligence
working inside you whatever you're noticing there that's a little
tiny tiny tiny tiny sliver of cosmic intelligence you're looking
at just the tip of the iceberg and that intelligence
really it's not yours and if you look closely within
yourself your intelligence is not yours you're not doing intelligence
intelligence is doing you if you are an intelligent person
you have a high IQ you love to take credit
for your intelligence as though you're doing it you're this
genius who can solve this puzzle but really no it's
a gift that you've been given and of course you
can also cultivate this gift it's not static you can
definitely be much more intelligent than you used to be
and one of those ways to be hyper intelligent is
to be able to tap into infinite intelligence because if
you think that intelligence is just the thing that's inside
of a human brain the little tip of the iceberg
then that's all you'll ever have in life is just
that that's what most people have most scientists use only
that little tip whereas if you develop methods for tapping
into infinite intelligence like what I'm talking about here you
see that it's this much much much larger thing and
then you're able to tap into it and from it
you're able to pull ideas creative ideas which are so
brilliant that you could never dare to take credit for
them yourself because you see that it's not your little
ego who's doing it even these words that I'm telling
you right now are being deciphered by your by your
mind instantly for you you're not doing it your ego
is not responsible for it but of course intelligent people
tend to be very arrogant because they didn't assume that
intelligence is something that they have and that only they
have and that only human beings have and that nobody
else in the universe has it and certainly it could
never be a feature of the universe as a whole
maybe some aliens on some other planet have it if
they're also as evolved as as we are but but
otherwise no Leo no intelligence can't just be floating around
in the universe that sounds like nonsense well it might
sound like nonsense but that is the case and you
can become conscious of that what do I mean precisely
by infinite intelligence that's difficult to to pin down it's
infinite and it's all powerful and what I mean by
all-powerful is that actually it is the source and cause
of all of creation existence now you might wonder how
is that possible because power you would think that's like
a physical thing but intelligence that's like sort of a
soft fuzzy intellectual mental thing so how can the intellect
actually be powerful after all Leo it's not like I
can I can move a rock with my intellect I
need a bulldozer to move a big rock or to
bulldoze down a big mountain or something I need a
bulldozer I can't do with my intellect well consider that
maybe you can't do it with your intellect because you
only have this little bit of intellect that you have
access to as a human being and that actually if
you had access to infinite intelligence you could be so
intelligent that you can actually create anything you want out
of scratch because you're so intelligent just think about that
for a moment imagine that you're so intelligent I'm not
talking about incidents he'll just metaphorically I'm talking about literally
you're literally you have an infinite degree of intelligence so
your intelligence times infinity that's what I'm talking about you
are so intelligent that you can actually figure out a
way to manifest things out of pure emptiness without any
physical mechanical means and that you could even figure out
a way to go back in time and create yourself
to break all physical laws and all logical laws because
in fact you invented all the physical and logical laws
they're not really physical you've thought them up using infinite
intelligence and then of course you put yourself in the
simulation so that now you're limited by them or at
least it appears as though you are when you're a
human being I want you to really comprehend the significance
of what I mean by infinite intelligence I want you
to imagine that you you designed and engineered architected every
single hair on your head and you architected all the
lengths of every hair all the orientations the rotations the
positions the coordinates everything all the molecules and proteins that
go into it you personally individually assembled every single protein
you've folded every protein perfectly out of all the subatomic
particles that make it up all the molecules all the
amino acids you fold it all perfectly you thought up
of how all the proteins need to be so that
the hair is protruding in that particular way has a
particularly orientation so there's a particular function on your head
to protect you from wind but water the the Sun
whatever else because your hair has a purpose there's nothing
on your body that doesn't have a purpose you designed
all your nails you designed the skin every cell of
your skin you actually in fact are designing right now
every single cell all the trillions of cells every single
cell is intelligently designed every process in the cell all
the molecules moving through the DNA replicating doing all that
stuff all of that you engineered every single piece of
that so that it perfectly fits with the environment that
you're in so that you can survive in this environment
so you can hunt and you can have sex and
you can you can be social and political so that
you you can lie to people when you need to
so you can be sneaky because that is necessary for
your survival and so that you can do all the
stuff that human beings can do and you put yourself
in this particular time on this particular plan of course
you design the entire planet all the ecosystems all the
millions of different species that exist you is design them
all so they fit together perfectly in harmony so the
planet can coexist the way that it does all of
it fits together of course you have to design the
rest of the solar system and the universe all the
physical laws and a logical law so that all fits
together you designed all the neurons every single neuron inside
your head so that it fires perfectly so that each
one of those produces some particular effect that makes you
move your arm grab something or speak something or have
some original idea all of that and you're doing it
right now but you're not aware of it that's what
I mean by infinite intelligence imagine that you designed Albert
Einstein you designed his whole body all the cells in
it all the hair everything you designed his entire life
you designed it Albert Einstein his life perfectly so he
would be born at precisely the right time so that
he would have the discoveries that he had you you
designed all the neurons and everything there so that he
can go he can learn the stuff he needs to
learn in that particular air that he was in so
that he can come up with his theories so that
his theories could contribute to the larger scientific knowledge of
mankind and those could be used to build technology knowledge
so you you perfectly engineered all this but you didn't
just engineer it there locally for Albert Einstein you and
you you engineered this from the very beginning before the
Big Bang you see you you had such infinite intelligence
that you could see like imagine the perfect chess playing
ai you know a chess playing AI needs to be
able to see thousands hundreds of thousands millions of moves
into the future in order to play a good game
of chess so imagine if you had an AI that
was actually Intel in finit in its intelligence it could
see an infinite number of moves ahead so that's what
you did you plan every single facet of everything together
so that it would work in this harmonious intelligent manner
and so here you are and you find yourself right
now inside of this intelligence and of course the the
kicker at all that is of course that you would
also be intelligent enough to know that you don't let
the human being have access to all this the human
being is not God the human being is just a
little a little creation a little version of God and
that's what you are here that's why you can think
and that's why your thoughts have creative abilities as a
human being now of course your your thoughts as a
human being they have very limited creative abilities so can
you just spawn a new planet into into existence no
because you don't know how because you're not even close
to infinite intelligence as a human being very very limited
is your intelligence but I want you to imagine that
even intelligence can literally spawn a planet into existence if
it wants to in fact you can spawn the entire
universe into existence and that's what it did and it
no limits to it whatsoever so what I'm saying that
it's all powerful the power and the intelligence they're both
infinite and they go hand-in-hand it's precisely all-powerful because it's
so intelligent that there are no limits to its intelligence
and no limits to its power it's so powerful that
I can it can even go back in time and
design itself so I want you to picture an image
of an engineer who is actually engineering his own body
in this sort of assure style where the hand is
drawing itself tada that's how you got here that's what
all of this is why do you think it works
so beautifully have you ever wondered by the way why
reality works so beautifully a lot of rational and scientific
people overlook this and they just dismiss it and say
oh well it's just kind of random through evolution it
would have happened this way but also there's another category
of a thinker philosopher even scientist who actually does appreciate
the design of this whole thing like it's incredibly well
designed it works how does it work on so many
levels it works from the subatomic particle level all the
way up to the molecular level to the cellular level
to the basic biological level then to the ecological level
to the social level to the political level like every
single level to the cosmic level the whole thing works
and it works without a single flaw you know reality
doesn't have a bug in it doesn't have any glitches
how is this possible you've ever thought about this I
mean it's it's remarkable when you really think about it
the problem is that most people take it totally for
granted and they just sort of assume that well I
mean how else could it be it's amazing I want
you to start to to really appreciate what we're talking
about here now the objection is but leo how can
intelligence have power powers physical not intellectual well first of
all notice that in our world power is shifting more
and more towards the intellectual as we become more advanced
have you noticed this people who are good at manual
labour they are some of the worst paid people on
the planet who are the highest paid people it's actually
the people who sit at the very top who utilize
their intellect in order to arrange an architect and engineer
structures blueprints hierarchies organizations it's the CEOs it's the the
brilliant people like Nikola Tesla the innovators the inventors people
like Albert Einstein the theoreticians notice that our society is
giving more and more value to these people because they
can generate more value because what's more valuable than just
being able to push a rock with a bulldozer is
actually the organization of stuff that's going on if you
really want to create something the creation of it is
really in the organization of it not the physical building
blocks which are not nearly as important and of course
you gotta understand that those physical building blocks which are
taking for granted they also need to be perfectly organized
so that they can become good and effective building blocks
imagine if I just gave you a piece of paper
and I said hey here design a universe from scratch
beginning from let's say quantum particles designed from scratch that
it works perfectly could you do it could the best
quantum scientists are quantum physicists that currently exist do it
no no not even close like not even remotely close
there wouldn't even be a theory of how to go
about doing this you see humans are mostly what we're
doing is we're just imitating mother nature we're just sort
of like copying little pieces here and there we're trying
to decipher and we it takes us hundreds of years
just two or thousands even of years just to decipher
some some of nature like we look at an insect
wing and we spend hundreds of years studying how it
works just to just to imitate it and even then
all our imitations are very poor imitations have you noticed
this scientists still with all our modern technology they still
can't create a mosquito a mechanical mosquito can't do it
not even close yet now of course in the future
we'll definitely be able to do it but what is
it that's gonna enable us to do that knowledge understanding
or actually really it's the source of the knowledge its
intelligence so in a sense if you're really interested in
technology and science really what you should be interested in
is intelligence at large not narrow versions of intelligence not
knowledge but this existential infinite intelligence is what I'm telling
you about because that's the source of all this stuff
so how is it that intelligence can be powerful well
if you stop thinking of the universe as a mechanical
clockwork or just a dumb box with dumb particles bouncing
around and you start to think of the universe as
a giant mind which I've talked about in the past
then you see that if all there is is a
giant mind which is consciousness and it's manifesting everything then
intelligence can be a feature of that mind and in
fact it's the one of the most important features that's
how creation gets made in this marvellous order and beautiful
intelligent way that it is intelligence really is reality's capacity
to manifest itself intelligently now of course you'll say Leo
that's a circular definition you just defined intelligence using the
word intelligence that's precisely right that's not a mistake because
intelligence is irreducible and so you're not going to get
a satisfactory definition through words words here are gonna start
to lose traction as we keep talking I'm gonna be
using words but don't take my words too literally they're
really pointers to actual infinite intelligence actual into intelligence it's
formless there's nothing really you can say about it it's
just [ __ ] intelligent as [ __ ] you
can think of intelligence as creativity the capacity for novelty
and you can think of intelligence rather than give it
as something that the brain does think of it as
the order that creation exhibits being everything you see is
being being gets created in an intelligent manner and that's
really what intelligence is and then if you think about
well what are thoughts how come my mind and brain
are intelligent well your thoughts are also being everything is
being your thoughts are being your thoughts are being manifested
right now every single thought you're not creating your thoughts
the universe is creating your thoughts you don't know what
your next thought is going to be I don't even
know what my next thought is gonna be and I'm
sitting here and I'm talking about some rather intelligent sounding
stuff if you want to give me the benefit of
the doubt if you don't want to if you're not
gonna say I'm crazy so my thoughts right now are
getting manifested by infinite intelligence so being is getting manifested
in an intelligent manner and that's what gives rise to
intelligent human heads to put it crudely because being is
all there is being orders itself intelligently intelligence really isn't
separate from being it's an aspect of being and you
can see that by really becoming attuned to just the
intelligence you see on a leaf you can take a
leaf off a tree and look at just how intelligently
designed that leaf is now I know you have a
lot of objections as a materialist about evolution I'm gonna
talk about evolution in a minute don't go get your
panties in a twist we will address the evolution question
so what I'm saying here is that even inanimate objects
are intelligent a rock a mountain a river a Sun
it's all intelligent not in the sense that a river
can think or a rock can think that's not what
I mean that's the old paradigm thrown out of your
mind intelligence is not something that object possesses intelligence is
a field like the field of gravity look you have
no problem accepting that the field of gravity is invisible
right it's invisible it's abstract and yet here it is
it acts obviously it acts and it does what it
does but scientists still haven't really determined what what gravity
is or how it really works nobody really knows but
we just know it's there and it's a field and
we know it's non localized it's everywhere so now start
to think of intelligence exactly in that same way now
the mistake would be to think that oh that means
that rocks can think no rocks can't think in that
in that way that you're thinking now of course you
might have an objection you might say Oh Leo what
about the all the dumb stuff that happens in the
world how do you account for that well that's the
kicker is you see that even the so-called dumb stuff
the stupidity that you see on YouTube let's say human
stupidity and you might say oh man but if if
if the universe has infinite algae's how come humans are
so stupid most of them at least well you have
to understand that even the universe is designed with such
infinite intelligence that even the dumbness that exists is intelligent
those people are behaving in dumb ways precisely because that's
what Nessa is necessary to sustain the harmony of the
entire universe you see those are consequences of the design
the problem is is that you with a little human
being your mind is so limited your intellect is so
limited that you can't see a trillion moves ahead the
way that infinite intelligence can you are sort of like
a bad chess a I program who can only see
five moves ahead and so to you it seems like
oh my opponent made a really dumb move he's sacrificing
his queen and I'm just gonna steal his queen oh
he's such a dumbass but what you can't see is
that your opponent is actually infinitely intelligent it can see
50 moves into the future that you can't see so
it knows that it's gonna sacrifice its Queen here but
in the end it's gonna checkmate you that's the problem
the problem with rational people is that they're intelligent but
their intelligence is is is it's high enough that they
become arrogant they think that they figured out all of
reality but it's not intelligent enough to see a hundred
of thousand moves ahead to see how all the other
stuff fits in perfectly into this holistic harmonious picture because
if you really saw that man that would utterly blow
your mind that would be the realization of a lifetime
to really understand how ingeniously infinitely intelligent existence is so
in a sense what I'm saying here is that consciousness
can think matter into being but you have to take
this word think rather loosely because consciousness doesn't think in
the sort of manner that you're used to and this
word matter of course you'll take it very loosely words
are starting to break down here now let's address this
evolution question because you're probably thinking Leo so are you
a creationist now is that what you are you become
a creationist as that's where all this all these psychedelics
and all this enlightenment stuff and all this wound stuff
has taken you now you're into intelligent design because that's
what you're talking about right what about evolution we have
all this evidence for evolution are you contradicting all that
I'm not contradicting it first you have to make a
distinction between intelligent design versus creationism the sort of creationism
that you see very popular among many fundamentalist Christians and
there's no doubt that there are many sneaky found Christians
who will use science to sort of attack itself they
will cherry-pick evidence from within the scientific community and use
it against the scientific community and try to undermine evolution
in order to advance ideas of intelligent design and to
advance their their biblical notions and they quote from the
Bible so that's not what I'm talking about here I
would call that creationism so distinguish that from intelligent design
so is the universe intelligently designed absolutely beyond shadowed out
and you can prove that to yourself by becoming conscious
of the intelligence directly and that's possible that's not a
belief that's not something you have to take on faith
but now the question of and by the way before
I go on to evolution I should mention that the
creationists are wrong all right the creationists are self-deluded so
the creationists are doing is they're reacting against some of
the developments within science which they feel is encroaching upon
their territory the biblical theological territory it's encroaching upon their
notions of God that justifiably scares them because they don't
want to lose notions of God and and all this
and they also have intuitions about intelligent design because they
can they can see and they can Intuit the intelligence
but they don't really know how to explain it very
well and they don't have any direct experience of it
they haven't become definitely conscious of it they take it
on as a dogma so they're defending that dogma they're
wrong they're making many epistemic mistakes so you as the
rationalist and scientifically minded person that you are of course
you're right to criticize them when they do that sort
of stuff but make a distinction that's not what I'm
doing here that's not the place that I'm arguing from
in fact I sort of have an an axe to
grind against against Christians because you know quite frankly most
Christians are very very diluted in their understanding of reality
and they're very dogmatic so that's not what I'm talking
about I'm not a Christian I don't believe in Christianity
and I don't subscribe to Christianity I don't really read
much Christianity although there's some valuable stuff and certain Christian
writings but only if it's interpreted at a very high
level very metaphorically very very abstractly which most people do
not know how to do because Christianity is extremely corrupt
Christianity has basically been seized by the devil and been
turned into an egoic falsehood perpetuation machine the same way
that Islam has for the most part so that's that
now about evolution so what about evolution well evolution of
course exists at least from our limited human perspective because
you see what science is all about science is about
causal explanations and of course every object and the entire
universe every object in the entire universe and the entire
universe has itself is infinitely caused so this is a
problem for science because science is trying to understand cause
and effect but every object has an infinite number of
causes and effects you understand this most scientists don't understand
this take any object take a take a little stone
that you find lying on like a pebble lying on
the sidewalk that pebble become conscious that that pebble has
an infinite number of causes there's an infinite chain of
causation that led to that pebble laying there on the
on the on the sidewalk stretching back all the way
to the Big Bang and everything before the Big Bang
there's an infinite chain and there's an infinite chain that
comes after the pebble which the pebble is a part
of and also this chain is not linear in one
dimensional but it's actually infinitely dimensional so that pebble its
causes are not just coming from one direction like somebody
placed you might think well the pebble is there because
some some guy was walking around with a with a
leaf blower and he blew the pebble and now it's
laying there on the on the sidewalk yes that might
be true but that's just one factor out of an
infinite number of other factors that are there at the
same time all acting upon it because see yes the
guy with the leaf blower was blowing on it blew
the pebble but at the same time there was also
wind there was the Sun there was gravity from the
from another planet from Jupiter all of it was acting
to place that pebble exactly where it's lying there's an
infinite number of causes in every instance in every microsecond
there's an infinite number of causes every every atom in
the known universe is acting upon that pebble right this
second to cause it to sit precisely where it's sitting
so that's an infant number of causes just in this
in this moment of time but then there's an infant
number of causes of course stretching all the way back
so you see we have this not a one-dimensional line
of causation but it's just like a volume an infinite
dimensional volume of causation just for that one little pebble
so yeah it's complicated you see that's the problem is
that science is trying to just unravel something that's so
much bigger than itself that it's always it's always it's
always losing side at the bigger picture so so evolution
of course in that sense in a linear sort of
sense yes it exists in that of course dinosaurs evolved
into birds and stuff and then mammals evolved into monkeys
and monkeys to humans yeah we have evidence for it's
all good it works we've proven evolution within well even
within dog species within cat species selective breeding that's that's
evidence of evolution right there very obviously also is very
easy to demonstrate evolution within fruit flies and within viruses
and bacteria quite easy to do they've done it lots
of times so the evidence revolution is indisputable but we
have to understand is that evolution what drives evolution evolution
is a process that itself is intelligently designed and I'm
actually going to have a whole episode a very important
episode called probably what is evolution where we're going to
talk about evolution and what it really is it's not
what they teach you it is it is not happening
through random mutation the mutations are highly intelligent highly intelligent
if evolution was truly happening to random mutation you would
have you have nothing you'd have crap it would just
be noise you actually cannot create something significant and marvelous
and highly functional without intelligent but that's a topic for
another time I have a lot to say about that
topic but this episode is already running long and I
don't have I wish I could go into it I
want to go into it believe me I know you're
interested in in understanding what the true nature revolution is
but for now you just have to trust me that
evolution is happening through intelligence and actually if you go
to science the latest science on evolution is starting to
show you like science with an epigenetics and so forth
it's starting to show that it's not random there's a
deep intelligence at work and as more evidence is collected
over the next hundred years this notion of random mutation
is gonna be completely blown out of the water and
it's gonna go alongside some of the other silly ideas
that are confined to the dustbin of science history so
what I'm saying here is that infinite intelligence it doesn't
contradict evolution in fact really all that evolution is evolution
is not confined to DNA by the way everything is
evolving all the time evolution is simply the infinite causal
chain that is all of reality so really what infinite
intelligence does so if you think about what evolution is
it's or like if we're playing a chess game every
move on the chest game every piece that's moved one
step or one move that is like sort of one
increment of evolution let's say hey let's say it's equivalent
to one second in the whole evolutionary timespan of the
last four billion years on this planet it's just one
move that another move another move another movement right each
one is a second one time increment and what infinite
intelligence is is it is that played through from the
beginning to end all instantaneously at once because this infinite
intelligence not bound by time it has no limits on
it whatsoever so it can think through every possible move
so imagine a chess game with an infinite number of
chess pieces and an infinite number of squares in an
infinite number of dimensions and this infinite intelligence is playing
all the moves simultaneously at once in fact it knows
every single game that could be played ever on this
chess board and so it just instantly knows everything and
also it is the the source of all the chess
pieces the board every single move it's all happening virtually
inside of this mind it's mind blowing stuff but then
when you as a human look at it because you
are so time bound you're only living this little corner
of the universe on this little rock floating around in
space orbiting around the Sun and you only live for
like what a hundred years so all you can see
is you can see a few of the moves on
this chess board and to you it looks linear because
it's like well the night moved here the Queen moved
here the King moved here the Bishop of here the
pawn move here all you can see is just a
few moves and maybe all you see is a hundred
moves in your lifetime well you don't realize is that
it's an infinite it's an infinite game played in infinite
dimensions with independent pieces so we'll talk about that later
about evolution and I'm excited about that episode as well
and I'll have some some actual evidence and some some
really really all present some technical arguments for for my
claims about evolution I'm not just gonna tell you that
I experienced it on some psychedelic trip I'm actually gonna
cite some scientific evidence for you and I'm gonna present
some some more tangible arguments for those of you who
are sort of hard-nosed like that and like that kind
of stuff yeah so continuing on I want to introduce
a new vocab word for you and ask the Greek
word ancient Greek word called Mouse n Oh us it
rhymes with Mouse it's a little difficult to pronounce now
what does this word mean from Wikipedia here's this definition
quote sometimes it's equated to intellect or intelligence it's a
term for the Faculty of the human mind which is
necessary for understanding what is true or real and quote
so that's a concept that goes back to the early
early Greek philosophers very early Aristotle Plato Socrates and even
before Socrates in fact as I was doing research for
this episode here I wanted to go back and I'm
thinking of myself man somebody in the past some great
sage or philosopher must have stumbled upon this infinite intelligence
idea that I stumbled upon independently for myself here I
didn't read this in any book when I'm talking about
this this really like I'm saying it really blindsided me
I wasn't expecting it at all and the second thing
that that I wasn't expecting that I wasn't expecting to
find a perfect explanation of what I'm explaining here from
a Greek philosopher over two and a half thousand years
ago but that's exactly what I found in Wikipedia so
here we go I'm gonna present to quote to you
from anaxagoras whose dates are 510 to 428 BC two
and a half thousand years ago basically he was a
pre-socratic philosopher that means before Socrates so he was one
of the earliest earliest Western thinkers now listen to what
he says about nouse and about intelligence cuz this guy
had it figured out look at this quote all other
things partake in a portion of everything while nouse is
infinite and self ruled and is mixed with nothing but
is alone itself by itself for if it were not
by itself but were mixed with anything else it would
partake in all things if it were mixed with any
four it is the fittest of all things and the
purest and it has all knowledge about everything and the
greatest strength and nouse has power over all things both
greater and smaller that have soul and quote so that's
everything I've been telling you in a nutshell and this
guy got it he wasn't just doing idle philosophy he
in order to write what he wrote here he had
to actually experience the true essence of pure intelligence or
nouse and as he says here it's infinite it's self
ruled it's formless because at the same time it's not
mixed with anything which means it's separate from everything but
also it's infusing everything so it's a field in the
same way that gravity is a field gravity you might
say is similar to what he's describing because in a
sense it's not mixed with any gravity is separate from
everything but at the other on the other hand gravity
is acting upon everything and notice what he says about
how strong it is it has the greatest strength it's
the thinnest and the purest of all things which is
what I'm describing so you can't really articulate it very
well and it's all powerful another gem that I found
on Wikipedia is I was researching this is the following
one quote the more strictly Aristotelian Muslims in particularly Aven
pace that's a difficult one to pronounce av eros avi
eros I'm not sure how to pronounce it per se
they were both by the way just as an aside
they were both Islamic Muslim philosophers in the sort of
Golden Age of Islam probably a thousand years ago or
so and so anyways they wrote about how one could
conjoin oneself with the active intellect thus attaining philosophical nirvana
end quote that word active intellect is very important because
that's an a word from Aristotle because Aristotle also wrote
about the nouse and he made various distinctions between the
active intellect and other kinds of intellect and the psyche
and so forth it gets rather technical and complicated but
but what they're saying here is that it's possible to
conjoin oneself with the active intellect which is what I'm
calling infant intelligence thus attaining philosophical nirvana that's exactly what
it is that's exactly what I experienced philosophical Nirvana meta
physical orgasm because you become the infant intelligence and using
this internet intelligence of course you that's what you use
to understand everything so people sometimes wonder well Leo but
what about enlightenment maybe enlighten is just an illusion how
do you know maybe it's just a belief system maybe
you're just hallucinating after all how is it possible to
know these things a human being can't know these things
that's right a human being cannot know these things but
what you're assuming is that you're a human being drop
that assumption and and then become conscious of infant intelligence
realize you are infant intelligence and then use that infant
intelligence to understand the structure of the entire universe sounds
impossible sounds crazy right sounds crazy sounds like some some
wishful thinking but then again people have done it anaxagoras
did it I did it I can even tell you
which tools you can use to do it use some
5mu no DMT it'll it'll help you get there maybe
not in the first time on the first try maybe
I'll need a few tries but yeah it's accessible and
you don't need to do psychedelics to get there you
can get there through yoga meditation other stuff of course
this sits very deep so you might need to do
1020 years of yoga to get there I don't know
depends depends on how talented you are depends on how
how dedicated you are help it minded you are there
many factors here but I think very few people have
accessed this sort of stuff so which is why it's
not written about very often so I've talked about you
might wonder why isn't everybody talking about this well how
the [ __ ] are you supposed to explain this
to people you really expected that someone's gonna go on
CNN or on on on ABC or some some YouTube
channel that shoots five-minute videos about stupid stuff and they're
gonna explain this to you in a convincing way no
not even close not even close we're talking about extremely
advanced stuff hell I myself wouldn't have believed this just
a few years ago maybe even a few ago I
wouldn't have believed so we're talking about cosmic mouse cosmic
intelligence here now you might wonder Leah what's the difference
being intelligence and consciousness because I shot an episode recently
just last week about what is consciousness and there it
seemed it might seem like I've been talking about similar
stuff there as I am here well there's differences so
yes intelligence is formless and omnipresent just the way that
consciousness is and really they're the same thing they're not
separate what I'm talking about here is a facet an
aspect maybe that would be through an aspect of consciousness
so of course everything is still consciousness I'm not saying
there's two substances now I'm not saying there's consciousness and
then there's intelligence no consciousness one of the aspects of
consciousness is that it's intelligent it's infinitely intelligent but see
it's important to make this distinction because it's possible to
become conscious of consciousness but not become conscious yet of
the intelligence the infinite intelligence of consciousness that's an additional
wrinkle that you may or may not cognize or realize
when you grasp what consciousness is see so it's tricky
that's why I say there's sort of different levels of
it different degrees of realization because and the reason I
say that is very practical 'end to me is that
I was I did realize what consciousness was before I
realized what infant intelligence is so for me the first
was consciousness I realized that and I realized that in
various ways many times and there were many deaths to
it and then when I got deep enough there then
this sort of other dimension of conscious up enough this
other facet opened up to me and I was able
to explore that and man there's a huge difference from
a personal perspective I mean ultimately they're one but there's
a huge difference because this is like one huge mindfuck
here and then like a second huge mine [ __
] there and they're both radical deepmind [ __ ]
alright let's answer some fa Q's and objections so first
question Billy o rocks are not intelligent the way that
I am isn't this silly you're claiming that rocks are
intelligent look again be careful here just like with the
what is consciousness episode you have to be careful not
to get your paradigm backwards a rock I'm not saying
a rock has a mind and it can think stop
thinking of intelligence as one's ability to think or even
brain power that's not what it tells us is if
you think intelligence is brain power or IQ or your
ability to think obviously a rock doesn't have that ability
but when I say it's intelligent what I'm saying is
that the being of the rock is imbued and permeated
with intelligence in the same way we say that gravity
is acting upon the rock even if the rock is
just laying there and doing nothing gravity is still acting
upon it again this is hard for the materialists to
understand because his paradigm is backwards he has a faulty
definition of what intelligence is and so he's he's running
that definition he's getting the wrong results when he applies
that definition to rocks it makes it look absurd so
of course he has to deny what I'm saying here
what I'm saying it's not absurd if you change your
paradigm and you look at reality as a giant mind
and this giant mind can create dumb objects they only
appear dumb to us as human beings because we care
about thinking and you know a rock is not gonna
come up with a with Einstein's theory or general activity
for you can't think it can't solve a rubik's cube
a rock can't do that but then again that's you
imposing your standards on the rock the intelligence of the
rock is that it's supposed to lay there and be
a rock it's not supposed to get up and sing
and do a dance for you a jig to amuse
you that's not the function of arak the rock was
designed with input intelligence to be a rock and to
behave like a rock and so in a sense the
rock was too designed to be humble not arrogant like
yourself and that's exactly what the rock needed to be
because ultimately in the big big big big big big
big big big big picture you need dumb objects in
order for smart human beings to be able to clothe
and shelter themselves and survive and live and have a
solid earth to stand upon you need rocks so in
a sense your human intelligence is dependent upon the rock
intelligence it's the order of the whole system is what
we're calling intelligence you know I once heard Sadhguru you
know Sadhguru this YouTube yogi I once heard Sadhguru talking
about how there's there's some more he said something along
lines like there's more intelligence in a flower than there
is and in your head or something like that I'm
just paraphrasing I don't know if that's exactly what he
said along those lines and I remember I was listening
to this a few years ago and I'm like dude
what the [ __ ] are you talking about there's
no intelligence in a flower now I understand what he
meant it made no sense to me because my definition
of intelligence was that intelligence is something that happens inside
the head but then I realized no that's wrong where
did that definition come from I just assumed I took
that definition for granted the only reason I think that
intelligence happens in the head is because I'm very [
__ ] selfish and I'm looking at the whole world
from my little personal point of view so to me
all that exists is myself and my little ego and
so from that point of view I'm the most intelligent
thing that there is and of course that's utter arrogance
and other stupidity - in retrospect but but nonetheless that's
how a rationalist think it's a deep arrogance they can't
see outside themselves they can't see the larger thing that
they're a part of because they're they're not holistic thinkers
they're left brain thinkers left brain thinking is by definition
not holistic its linear its analytical it's fragmentary it fragments
and breaks reality part to pieces and really it's it's
a tool of the ego and if you want you
have suddenly you need to tap into your right intuitive
holistic brain so Sadhguru is exactly right there is there
there is in a sense more intelligence in a flower
then there isn't inside your test your IQ test scores
if you have a 200 IQ or whatever you think
you have that's impressive while the flower is way more
impressive when you really look at a flower how much
intelligence there isn't a single flower a single leaf in
a single rocket in anything like that Bollea what about
if ants aren't intelligent like me look at an ant
spend a few hours on a Sunday afternoon looking at
an ants running around doing its thing look at how
much intelligence there is in a single [ __ ]
ant it will austrack you if you really do it
if you really look at an ant see what's there
our most fancy supercomputers all the computing power of Google
and Microsoft and Facebook combined and all the human intelligence
that goes with it could not create an ant that
functions like an ant couldn't do it I don't just
mean mechanically I mean the whole shebang from the very
beginning from the ground up all the way to the
top like designing the ant designing the ants psychology designing
the ants sociology designing the system such that all of
the molecules are moving perfectly you design the molecules from
very beginning so that all that can build up to
create this ant all the cells all the DNA all
that is happening of course all the biological functions of
the ant of course we can't do any of that
but even if you could that would still be only
scratching the tip of the iceberg because you also need
to think about the psychology of the ant how the
ant relates to all the other ants how the ant
moves the software that's governing the ant the intelligence that's
inside the ant it's not mechanical software it's intelligent how
the ant is building its ant colony underground and architecting
the ant is using intelligence to build structures underground to
reproduce I mean it's it's it's it's it's just utterly
astounding the intelligence that goes into an ant but then
of course not just that you also need to have
the intelligence to think of how this ant colony is
gonna fit in with the environment that it's in with
the ecosystem with the rain with the Sun with the
radiation coming from this from the Sun with tornadoes and
hurricanes and the vegetation all that is growing and with
animals that are moving around and eaters who are gonna
come and attack these ants and eat them if if
they're not smart they don't have defenses against that other
ant colonies they have to fight with spiders and insects
and all this and all up the up the chain
the entire ecological thing the entire earth which can sustain
these ants all of that has to be thought through
it doesn't happen by accident hello it's extraordinary intelligence it's
just not the kind of intelligence that you're used to
it's not the human form of intelligence so it's really
a proper to think of intelligence it's like ants are
dumber than birds birds are smarter than than than cockroaches
and and and then and then dogs are smarter than
birds and then chimps are smarter than dogs and humans
are smarter than everybody else that's the wrong way to
think about it intelligence is everywhere and there's no like
gradations to it nobody is really smarter than anybody else
it's just different different all of it is is the
perfect cog that fits into the cosmic mind machine that
needs to function it's a holistic thing another objection might
be below how can dumb matter an empty space be
intelligent that sounds stupid of course it sounds stupid because
you're just assuming that matter and space are dumb why
are you assuming that they're dumb was that proven has
science proved the stupidity of of matter and space no
in fact you couldn't prove that if you wanted to
doesn't make sense to prove it again intelligence is the
order with which this stuff is arranging itself spontaneously and
by the way don't get it wrong I'm not I'm
not saying that there's a bearded man in the clouds
who is the engineer behind this all the bearded man
in the clouds is actually formless it's there's nothing there
in fact what you see inside of yourself if you
turn your gaze in words you find emptiness there that
is the infinite intelligence we're talking about it's right here
it's right before your eyes it's not some fantastical land
that you fly away to during a trip to experience
intelligence it's right here right now it's speaking to you
I'm speaking to you using infinite intelligence hello you're using
infant intelligence to understand me hello do you get it
next question leo how can intelligence exist without a body
it needs a body only if you assume it does
why do you assume intelligence needs a body did science
prove that to you no that was just a metaphysical
assumption you started off with so what I'm suggesting you
drop that assumption and you consider the possibility that maybe
intelligence doesn't need a body why would it after all
if the universe is an infinite mind it has no
body body is something that sinks into existence reality is
something that sinks into existence and intelligence is a property
of omnipresent consciousness another question but Leo if I have
infinite intelligence why can't I just materialize a million dollars
for myself of course that's exactly the ego wants as
it wants to it wants to harness the infinite intelligence
in order to wage wars build better nuclear weapons and
materialize millions of dollars well maybe there's more to the
world than all that all that materialistic nonsense here's what
you got to understand is that first of all you're
deeply unconscious and probably unawakened so your connection to infant
intelligence is miniscule you have infinite intelligence running through you
but it's very like channeled very very constricted which is
why you make mistakes you do dumb stuff all that
and still even with all that there's infinite intelligence and
all the dumb stuff that you do it's there for
a reason it's not an accident all the dumb stuff
you do and all the mistakes you make but the
reason you can't just materialize a million dollars is because
well look actually there's two ways think about this first
of all in a sense you can you can actually
use your intellect to come up with an invention Pat
that invention and then sell that patent which might be
very used maybe you invent some new medicine or something
or some new power generation machine and you can do
that and you can earn millions of dollars through the
use of your intelligence you can do that people have
been doing that for for centuries and people are doing
it right now there are many intelligent people who are
using their intellect their connection to intelligence to manifest millions
of dollars in their life and they're enjoying it and
you can become a part of that Club and in
fact the more you tap into infant intelligence the more
that will be possible but of course that's not the
question you really ask what you really want is you
want pure magic you want to be able to just
like think a million dollars into existing right here right
now why can't you do that well because you're come
you're bound you see you're bound by physical laws logical
laws and in all this sort of stuff because you're
inside this matrix like simulation so you're part of the
simulation right now and your intelligence eat if you do
become very very awoken your intelligence you're still going to
be human human intelligence still limited it's not even 1%
of infinite intelligence so whereas infant intelligence could materialize things
because it's that [ __ ] intelligent you are not
that intelligent you do not have the intelligence to circumvent
the physical laws if you did you could but you
don't maybe one day maybe in a million years humans
will get to that point maybe some super advanced artificial
intelligence system that we construct will at some point be
able to do that stuff and that could be freaky
you think artificial intelligence is is dangerous now under the
materialist paradigm because it can it can somehow hack a
nuclear Network and launch nuclear weapons think about what can
happen if the artificial intelligence is so intelligent it's so
tapped into infant intelligence that it can actually materialize nuclear
weapons out of thin air think about that now you
see how dangerous it can really be but also you
have to understand that with infinite intelligence when you access
it if intelligence you're all you're also accessing infinite consciousness
and infinite consciousness also comes with flavors and infinite love
and so when you're becoming very conscious you are becoming
less and less selfish you're not going to access infant
intelligence if you're very very selfish so miself protecting mechanism
because because if you could if you could be very
selfish and evil and access infant intelligence you could do
a lot of damage and the reason you you can't
is because you actually have to be selfless to access
it and once you're selfless then you're probably not going
to want to destroy billions of people with nuclear weapons
although who knows you know maybe actually at a higher
level of intelligence you will see that mankind is a
cancer upon the entire planet and if we're not gonna
get our [ __ ] together then maybe what what
needs to happen is that we need an8 we're gonna
accidentally create this AI which is gonna then destroy us
clean up and create a blank slate and then the
AIS will rule the world and maybe that's exactly what
infant intelligence you yourself have designed from the very very
beginning you don't know because you don't have access to
all that because your intelligence is very far from infinite
so I want you to start to notice very practically
that every part of reality exhibits extraordinary intelligence this is
like an exercise for you I want you to walk
around for the next week and notice the intelligence and
everything notice the intelligence in your shower it when you're
brushing your teeth the design of your toothbrush the computer
you're using the stuff you see on the sidewalk when
you're walking down even the bad stuff the evil stuff
you see stupid people on television you see Donald Trump
whatever doing stupid stuff like they do every week notice
the intelligence behind it the deeper larger bigger picture intelligence
start to see that that requires you start to develop
a certain kind of eye for the universe's infant intelligence
you might say Oh believe but my toothbrush that was
designed by a human being see the bigger picture yes
a human being designed your toothbrush but who designed the
human being where the human being come from where'd evolution
come from where the logical laws come from where the
universal laws come from weren't the quarks in the atoms
where did all that come from it's all part of
the whole design don't be so narrow-minded stop fragmenting little
pieces that human being who designed your toothbrush how did
he come about there needed to be a mother and
a father to need to fall in love what's the
logic and the infant intelligence that goes into human romance
all the complexity their human romance who designed that look
how it works it works well enough that we're able
to create billions of human beings who are able to
make toothbrushes and computers and Facebook and Google and all
the sorts of stuff that you take completely for granted
and how did that person design in your toothbrush come
up with the idea for this great toothbrush design it
wasn't because of his little ego he tapped into infinite
intelligence some human being at some point had to invent
a [ __ ] toothbrush that was a gigantic deal
that was like Einstein coming up with the general theory
of relativity it's not obvious at all that you can
brush your [ __ ] teeth with a brush matter
of plastic and rubber and this and that and all
these little bristles at these for angles someone had to
come up with all that [ __ ] doesn't happen
by itself that's deeply intelligent stuff that's the universe doing
it it's not humans doing it it's the universe Wow
human doing something is the universe doing something but of
course the universe is much more than just humans anything
that a human can do is by definition something that
the universe can do understand this because humans are the
you part of the universe you're not separate from the
universe every thought you think is the universe doing that
stuff when you get horny that's the universe getting horny
when you get thirsty that's the universe getting thirsty when
you have a brilliant idea that's the universe getting a
brilliant idea using you as the substrate see cuz infinite
intelligence doesn't have any physical form so if it wants
to become tain't tangible if it wants to actualize if
it wants to take all of its sort of brilliant
ideas they're not even ideas because ideas still have form
if they want but if it wants to manifest itself
it needs to do so what we would call physically
through some sort of form otherwise it's just infinitely intelligent
sort of all to itself and then you don't know
about it so I want you to to look around
for the next week and start to notice the artistry
it's like looking at beautiful painting you know if you
take a stupid person speaking English if you take a
dumb person and you show him some beautiful painter by
painting by a by a master by Picasso or something
like that he's not gonna be able to see the
beauty in it to him it's you know he's just
gonna say oh I could do that myself of course
no you can't - see the artistry the beauty of
it you need to develop an eye you can actually
take art history classes and develop this I it's very
fascinating how it develops you start off with no eye
but then you develop an eye you make fine distinctions
you can start to see the beauty and the genius
of of painting and art and of course not just
in art you can do this sculpture you can do
this with architecture you can do this with music you
can do this with literature movies anything but I want
you to do it with physical reality start to see
it the prob is if you look to logically at
the world if you're always analyzing it breaking it down
like a left brained autistic person which many scientists sort
of are then you miss the bigger picture you miss
the artistry the intelligence is not in the the fragmentation
but it's in the hole its how the whole tell
all the fragments fit together so perfectly that you see
the artistry of it I want you to start to
notice that I want you to walk down the street
and start to notice even the ugly stuff you see
a empty coke cans some garbage lying on the side
of the street and you might say oh look at
that some animal he drew that down there how dare
he not care for the environment Nadia yada yada but
think about the infinite intelligence of that coke can lying
there on the sidewalk think about the intelligence that went
into producing that can all the economic systems that led
to it getting created and purchased and and and all
the gravity that's holding that can down and how that
can fits into the larger ecosystem how somebody some human
being is gonna actually collect that can like some homeless
person's gonna walk by pick up that can that can
to that homeless person's worth five cents for recycling is
gonna take it to a recycling center he's gonna recycle
it get his five cents he's gonna use that five
cents to feed himself that night and not not starve
and then and then that that recycled cans gonna go
to some recycling center so others human being invented the
recycling center it's gonna recycle this can use that can
the metal in that can to produce some some you
know some recycled aluminum thing maybe for an airplane or
for a car some aluminum part and think of how
that is like the circle of life at work so
this thing that you think is beautiful that personally your
little ego doesn't like because it's ugly Oh toucan but
think about how it all fits [ __ ] together
where did the can come from the materials from the
can came from the cosmos from early stars that exploded
think the intelligence have to go into creating those stars
so that then they would explode at the right time
all those dust particles of atoms they would all have
to congeal together into some other star that would have
to explode heavier elements from carbon to to oxygen to
to this to aluminum illumise pretty heavy element that then
comes to earth all congeals together billions of years of
evolution then humankind has to develop machinery and metal forging
and aluminum and and then construct these cans some guy
had to come up with a with a recipe for
coca-cola which people love to drink such that there are
billions of people on the whole planet drinking this stuff
such that this guy purchased this can so you can
throw it on the sidewalk see the intelligence of that
that's not an accident you guys like to play video
games I assume because most you're pretty young so maybe
you can resonate with this seeing intelligence in the world
at large in the universe is like admiring the design
of a great video game you know the games these
games that come out once every couple of years maybe
once every 10 years once a decade some brilliant masterpiece
game comes out it's a 10 out of 10 it's
perfect it's got it's so brilliantly designed it all works
so smoothly it's fun it's amazing it's got amazing graphics
right you know this you just like you get that
game from the game store you pop it into your
PlayStation or your xbox or something and you're playing it
and for that first hour you're just blown away at
all cuz you've played so many games so you know
all the shitty games but this game is like it's
a work of genius it's it's the intelligence what you're
admiring is the intelligence the intelligence of the art of
the design of the program all of it coming together
seamlessly perfectly to make the whole so as you become
a connoisseur of gaming or of movies or of writing
or of art or anything else you start to think
like a game designer for example you're walking through this
space in this world and you're seeing it for the
first time but as you develop the sort of game
designers eyes you sort of said oh yeah look that
do I know that designer put this thing there this
tree this tree prevents me from turning left when I
should have turned right or vice-versa and then oh look
they placed that treasure right over there so I can
see it and they clearly marked it so it's obvious
to me so I don't get confused I don't get
lost you see how all of it connects and if
the interface and the graphics and this and it's all
been telegraphed and somebody invented that some team of dozens
of designers and hundreds of artists and programmers invented that
that's a little microcosm of how the entire universe works
these people because I was a game designer for a
short while and in early in my career and so
I'm speaking from experience here and this is this how
game designers think they start to analyze these games and
that they see and they're drawn to this why do
people become game designers actually it's because being a game
designer allows you to play God that's a huge appeal
you get to create your own universes think them into
existence and then materialize them that's a very rewarding process
you're acting like a god and actually you are you're
participating in God's work now you might say only oh
but these are just designers these are just designers human
of course human being skin has no not of course
don't take this for granted in full it's actually happening
is that infinite intelligence is working through these designers inspiring
these artists designers programmers to come together to work really
hard they crunch for hundreds of hours hundreds of man
years they work on these games to put them all
together test them make sure it all works perfectly how
are they doing that not through their little egos if
it's a great game it's not done through ego egos
produce shitty games the best games are produced by tapping
into infant intelligence and of course not just games all
works of art that's what you are fundamentally as an
artist is you are playing God that's why it's so
rewarding because you are God playing God but of course
you don't realize that most artists own and of course
you're limited as an artist and that's why it's so
difficult because for artists those genius artists that can tap
into infinite intelligence they have so much creative potential that
they can see and they can envision these are visionaries
but the challenge is how do you materialize it that's
the real challenge for the artist the ideal would be
to be able to not even have to pick up
a paintbrush and just think of painting into existence without
even clicking a mouse that's still too indirect that would
be the essence the epitome the ultimate level that an
artist can aspire to and of course that's exactly what
God does that's exactly what absolute infinity can do because
it's infinitely intelligent but you are not you're limited so
see what's happening is that see God God is a
bit of a lazy lazy guy so what he does
is he doesn't create everything himself he he delegates he
delegates a lot of his work to human beings so
God to experience what it's like to actually play God
what God will do cuz God is formless is it
will it will incarnate itself into a human form then
that human form will get inspired to what it sees
around it because see it's hard forgot to get inspired
because God knows everything so you you have limited knowledge
you get inspired by stuff and then you want to
imitate you want to imitate nature you're inspired by it
and then you go and you dedicate your whole life
building these technical skills to do it and then you
become good and you get you get the satisfaction of
creation but what that's actually happening is that God is
using infinite intelligence channeling it through you such that you
are now God's paintbrush the human body is literally God's
paintbrush to create this [ __ ] whether it's games
music societies inventions engineering computer programming or self-actualization videos that's
all this is this is a puppet I'm a puppet
here you see I'm a puppet doing this work start
to see that start to see that the design of
a videogame is not accidental and the design of the
reality within which the video game is happening is also
not accidental and this does not contradict evolution because notice
videogames are designed but they also evolve notice how video
games have evolved over the last 30 years it's incredible
it's incredible the evolution that video games have undergone think
about par think about pac-man think about the first mario
world think about the 10 of 64 think about the
PlayStation 3 the PlayStation 4 thinking about virtual reality about
all the graphics all the design evolutions the evolution of
the user interfaces all of that had to evolve it
built upon itself and it was also designed both are
happening simultaneously not just in video games everywhere there is
no distinctions and limitations it's happening everywhere evolution is happening
everywhere it's not happening within DNA it's happening everywhere everything
is evolving so in conclusion uh I don't want you
to just believe me yes it sounds all good and
nice and fun and interesting and philosophical and maybe even
I have convinced you of some stuff here but that's
all beside the point this is not something to believe
this is not something to take on as a Dogma
I'm just presenting you with a possibility the possibility that
you can discover some amazing stuff about the nature of
reality which you never imagined was possible to discover and
then you can run with it if you're a scientist
if you're a mathematician you can use what I'm talking
about you can leverage it you can find techniques for
tapping into infant intelligence such that then you can create
you can become a better God a better mini God
to create whatever mathematical theorems you want whatever engineering inventions
all this you can get such a huge practical competitive
advantage over all of your colleagues in your field that
these IQ tests and all this nonsense is just gonna
be ridiculous while all your colleagues are talking about IQ
tests and bitching and moaning about how their IQs and
high enough you can develop a connection with infinite intelligence
such that you can become the next Einstein the next
Picasso the next Steven Spielberg or George Lucas or whatever
artist you admire whatever engineer whatever human being you admire
so what I'm talking about is not just philosophy or
interesting abstract metaphysics that you can become conscious of but
it's also very practical we're talking about the essence the
existential essence of creativity in case you haven't realized so
in conclusion you can become directly conscious of infinite intelligence
and you can also develop ways to tap into it
practically more then you've ever imagined possible and you can
have such incredible creative ideas that it'll completely blow your
mind you'll have more creative ideas then you will have
the capacity to actualize how to do that I'll talk
about in in future episodes how to develop a connection
with infant intelligence but for now I want you to
just to focus on becoming conscious of infinite intelligence first
you got to start with that then we'll talk about
how to cultivate a connection so first I want you
to start to contemplate what is intelligence think about that
question I want you to become very curious and open-minded
about it drop your dogmas and your scientific models and
paradigms whatever you thought forget about that and just be
curious notice inside yourself like yeah look I'm thinking in
and I'm being intelligent myself how is that happening it's
very mysterious I can't put my finger on it so
that's where it starts that's where the questioning starts then
start to question the materialist paradigm to death which I've
helped you do through many episodes already then start to
take seriously the possibility that intelligence is fundamental and not
just an emergent high-level phenomena fundamental at the very base
before molecules existed there was infinite intelligence before time and
space existed there was infinite intelligence before the Big Bang
there was infinite intelligence start to take that possibility seriously
whatever obstacles you have or judgments against that drop them
and then of course you can use meditation you can
use yoga but for this one I highly recommend psychedelics
do some deep trips and when you're tripping before you
trip set the intention set the intention ask the question
what is intelligence and you can even frame it as
you asking the universe why are you intelligent tell me
why you're intelligent and see what comes up you might
be in for a rude awakening and I really that
you you get to the bottom of it one day
so that you can experience the joy and horror that
I experienced and stumbling upon if an intelligence all right
that's it I'm done here this was a long one
whoo-ahh please click the like button for me come check
out my website actualized org right there I've got the
blog where I'm posting stuff all the time the forum
the book lists life purpose scores those can help you
out the life purpose course is gonna be very important
if you want to really connect with infinite intelligence because
you know to make an effective connection with infant intelligence
yes you have to develop yourself metaphysically and spiritually but
also you need to develop technical skills and you need
to develop a mastery and something you need to have
a sense of direction of what you're going to accomplish
in life and for that you need a sense of
purpose you need to identify your values so that's what
the course is about and also I updated the book
list just recently last week so go check out all
the new books that I've added I've added about 17
new books a lot of them about consciousness metaphysics epistemology
yoga I've added some books about yoga yeah check them
out the books that I keep adding to my list
now are the more advanced sort of metaphysically type of
books they're deeper than your normal self help books I
try not to add the kind of self-help books that
everybody knows about I try to find the really interesting
rare type of stuff where ultimately the stuff I want
to add to my book list in the future is
like I want to add books like you read this
book and this is the [ __ ] life-changing book
this whole book will change your whole life if you
read it and then you read it again and again
and again and you keep following up on it now
not all the books on my book list are like
that I have over 200 books there but uh but
a lot of them are there's at least 50 or
a hundred I would say five star rated books that
I put up there which are which are like life-changing
like this stuff will completely change all your paradigms and
all everything thought was possible and so I recommend you
go check that out and stick with me with actualizado
worried because hey we still got a lot of deep
topics to talk about the evolution topic is gonna be
very interesting I'm really excited to work on that one
but it's going to take some work to to put
the information together to organize it and then we're gonna
have we're gonna have other topics like that one talk
about what is language we're gonna talk about what is
science and man I feel like just now I'm starting
to get comfortable enough in my body and my ability
to speak that we can really address some of these
very very deep topics in a you know in a
way that's going to make sense to you in a
way that's going to be fun and relatable so stick
around for all that you
