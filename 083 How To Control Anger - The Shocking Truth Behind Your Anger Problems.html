            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4Eo6zIcEYhk' target='_blank'>How To Control Anger - The Shocking Truth Behind Your Anger Problems</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Anger</b>: 
</li><li>- Anger arises when an individual perceives a violation of personal standards or ideas about reality. Everyone has their own values and when others don't live up to these values, anger can be triggered. 
</li><li>- Expressing anger can cause more harm to oneself rather than the person one is angry at. This self-harm impedes a fulfilling and successful life.
</li><li>- Rather than seeking quick techniques to control anger, it's crucial to undertake a journey to discover its source.
</li><li><b>Controlling Anger</b>: 
</li><li>- Anger should be observed from a third-person perspective, it allows for more consciousness of one's actions and less likely to escalate the anger.
</li><li>- Daily meditation for at least 20 minutes is beneficial. It calms the mind, brings focus on the present moment, and expands conscious awareness. This practice can reduce the frequency and severity of angry episodes.
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility</b>: 
</li><li>- It's essential to note that each person has distinct standards. When someone doesn't meet these standards, one must try to understand their perspective and values.
</li><li>- The impulse to anger when encountering behaviors that don't align with personal ideals should be shifted towards curiosity about the reasons behind these behaviors. This helps increase consciousness and serves as a practical technique for controlling anger.
</li><li><b>The Negative Impact of Anger</b>: 
</li><li>- Constant or unmanaged anger is a personal issue, not a problem with external environment or circumstances. Getting angry easily, especially over everyday situations, is a sign of low consciousness and self-control.
</li><li>- Anger often arises from ingrained beliefs or self-image inconsistencies, and addressing these aspects is crucial for effective anger management. Regular introspection, meditation, and various techniques can greatly aid in anger control.
</li><li><b>Anger as Rooted in Violation of Personal Standards</b>: According to Leo Gura, anger usually arises when one's personal standards or ideals are violated. Therefore, to manage anger, one must understand and accept that each individual has a unique set of beliefs or standards. Rather than reacting with anger when these standards are violated, it might be more beneficial to develop a sense of curiosity about why others behave in ways that contradict these standards.
</li><li><b>Application of "Third-Person Observer" Technique to Manage Anger</b>: Gura recommends adopting a third-person perspective when angry, essentially observing oneself experiencing anger without judgement. He suggests that by maintaining this perspective during an episode of anger, the observer could experience a reduction in the intensity of their anger and potentially even cease being angry since the observer perspective elevates consciousness beyond the petty motivations for the anger.
</li><li><b>Meditation as a Tool for Reducing the Frequency and Intensity of Anger Attacks</b>: Gura highlights the importance of incorporating a regular meditation practice into one's routine to help reduce both the occurrences and intensity of anger attacks. This is based on the principle that meditation calms the mind, grounds one in the present moment, and elevates conscious awareness, all of which contribute to anger management.
</li><li><b>Root of Anger Lies in Repressed Parts Within You</b>: According to Gura, continuous anger usually signifies suppression or denial of certain aspects within oneself. These repressed parts often stem from traumatic experiences either in childhood or adulthood that have shaped one's personality and ego. When someone else breaks the moral standards the angry person strive to uphold, anger is projected onto them as a protective mechanism against acknowledging one's own imperfections.
</li><li><b>Denying Self-Integrity Leading to Projection of Anger onto Others</b>: Gura explains that a conflict in one's self-integrity  such as the struggle to maintain honesty at all times  can lead to projecting anger onto others. This projection acts as a distraction from one's internal struggles. Thus, confronting these of denial and integrating these disowned parts of oneself is a crucial step toward managing and controlling anger.
</li><li><b>Insight on Personal Development & Emotional Intelligence</b>: Leo Gura concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding one's emotions and developing self-mastery as keys to success. He encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter that deals with topics on self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and controlling emotions such as anger. His argument is anchored on the idea that understanding the psychology behind emotions and personal reactions is an important factor in creating a fulfilling life.
