            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/YE1yPCeF1Cc' target='_blank'>What Is God - Part 1 - A No Bullshit Explanation For Smart People</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Discussion of Different Worldviews</b>: Leo Gura identifies three different worldviews regarding the concept of God: the Fundamentalist Theists who strongly believe in God and religious teachings, Atheists who reject the existence of God based on empirical evidence and rational thinking, and Agnostics who are unsure and believe that it is impossible to accurately know the existence and nature of God. Despite their differences, all three worldviews have valid points but are often misunderstood and even confused due to cultural, personal, and societal factors.
</li><li><b>Introduction of Pre Trans Fallacy</b>: The concept of the pre-trans fallacy is introduced, which stands for the common mistake of dismissing the trans-rational stage of human consciousness development. The trans-rational stage is considered beyond the rational thinking capabilities of the human mind, acknowledging the limitations of rationality and opens up the possibility to experience and comprehend the unknown and inexplicable aspects of existence.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Personal Experience with God</b>: Leo Gura shares that he was an atheist for the most part of his life and only had a personal experience with God a few years ago, which drastically changed his perspective. Now he confidently claims that God exists but not in a conventional sense that is commonly understood. He stresses that God is an experience and should not be regarded as a mere belief or theoretical construct. 
</li><li><b>Explanation on Proof and Truth</b>: Leo Gura deliberates on the tricky concept of proof and truth, particularly pertaining to the discussion on the existence of God. He suggests that proof is a secondary phenomenon that requires the existence of truth or being, and conversely, the existence of truth or being does not necessarily require proof. Certain truths can exist without empirical or rational proof. 
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Rationality</b>: He points out that human rationality has its limitations and operates effectively only within certain state of consciousness. Therefore, to truly understand and experience God, one needs to elevate their state of consciousness significantly. This becomes challenging when trying to communicate or explain experiences of higher levels of consciousness as it is likened to explaining colors to a blind person. 
</li><li><b>The diversity of perceptions due to limited understanding</b>: He explains the limitations of our understanding by comparing our consciousness to an ant's consciousness. Our understanding of the universe is as limited as an ant's understanding of the world due to our limited consciousness and current stage of cognitive development. He further challenges the materialistic paradigm which views reality as purely physical systems and argues that consciousness is not solely a product of the brain. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about God</b>: Many people have misconceptions about God, like considering it as a theoretical concept or a psychological defense mechanism against facing death. He suggests being honest about our own beliefs or disbelief in God and encourages the removal of any preconceived notions to truly understand the concept and reality of God. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of Present Consciousness of God</b>: Emphasis is given to the importance of being consciously aware of God in the present moment, instead of simply having beliefs about God based on theoretical knowledge, teachings or scriptures. True understanding of God is gained by personal experiences of God and directly experiencing the divine essence in the present consciousness.
</li><li><b>True definition of God</b>: Leo describes God as not a separate entity or being but it is us. He defines God as the supreme being, the first cause, and the source of all creation, which is infinite, all-knowing, powerful, and omnipresent. These facets of God can be validated through conscious realization. He explains that God is not some mythical character outside us, but it is a radical state of consciousness and the absence of our limited egoic self and identity. The concept of God transcends the barriers of conventional religion and can be personally experienced and verified.
</li><li><b>God as Consciousness</b>: The foundational essence of God is described as consciousness, asserting it is the only real thing that exists. Understanding and experiencing this consciousness involves shedding our interpretations, perceptions and beliefs about reality.
</li><li><b>Oneness of Reality</b>: To understand the presence and existence of God, one needs to become conscious of the oneness of reality, as God is believed to be part of everything that exists. The reason it becomes difficult to point out the presence of God in everything is that everything that we consider as a pointer is itself God. This realization is often hindered by the constant projections and interpretations that our mind makes, tying them unknowingly to our survival instincts.
</li><li><b>Understanding God's Dual Nature</b>: Expounding on the dual nature of God, God is described as both everything and nothing which transcends human understanding and needs to be experienced directly. Leo explains that God is the answer to all metaphysical and epistemic questions about our existence, but it does not provide answers to relative or scientific queries pertaining to the material world.
</li><li><b>Truth, God and Human Existence</b>: Leo emphasizes that truth cannot be proven or justified, it needs to be accepted. Describing God as a universal mind, he suggests the mysterious and often unexplainable phenomenon of life as figments of imagination within this conscious being.
</li><li><b>Addressing Fear of Death and the Awakening to God</b>: He discusses that God is often associated with death and the dissolution of physical reality and identity. The awakening process to realizing this divine consciousness is described as mind-blowing, fascinating yet terrifying. Leo compares this awakening to an exit from the matrix, with the realization that there's nothing outside the existence.
</li><li><b>Belief in Single All-Encompassing God</b>: Leo shares his belief in a single, all-encompassing God who is infinite and alone. He elaborates on the concept of non-duality that goes beyond solipsism and assumes the absence of a separate self. He explains that God feels like emptiness and nothingness but in a different way than typically understood.
</li><li><b>Core Essence of God</b>: Describing the core essence of God as an emptiness that is full of infinite possibilities, God is characterized by intelligence, power, creativity, beauty and purposeful design. The divine essence of God is described as pure consciousness, beyond the limitations of the physical self, radiant, magical, and divine. This understanding of God transcends conventional religious beliefs and can be personally experienced and verified.  
</li><li><b>Life as a Miracle</b>: The notion of life as a miracle is discussed, asserting the entire universe is alive and conscious, extending beyond just biological life forms. Science cannot explain existential questions about consciousness. Existence is distinguished here as something that doesn't require scientific proof and shouldn't be confused for scientific queries.
</li><li><b>Confusion Surrounding the Concept of God</b>: Understanding God is compared to the fiction of Matrix, where any scientific understanding becomes irrelevant once the matrix is left. Science cannot comprehend or explain dreams or consciousness. Realization of God requires an open mindset, threatening conventional beliefs and needing surrendering the ego and control. 
</li><li><b>Influence of Cultural, Society and Education</b>:  Misconceptions due to cultural, society and education system are pointed out which hinder the exploration of metaphysics and epistemology leading to lack of understanding. Leo criticizes the misuse of skepticism which demands overwhelming proof without seeking the truth themselves.
</li><li><b>Importance of skepticism</b>: Skepticism should be questioned as well. Our understanding of God is confusing as it reveals everything to be an illusion and potentially threatening the existing systems and structures of power hierarchy. 
</li><li><b>Different Techniques to Experience God</b>: Different techniques are mentioned to experience God, such as self-inquiry, deep meditation practices, yoga, psychedelics administration, retreats etc. Techniques can help individuals reach higher states of consciousness and have a direct experience of God. 
</li><li><b>Method to Access God</b>: To access God, one has to realize that the experience will be subjective. It can't be obtained through skepticism, academic study or through traditional prayers, rituals, ceremonies, and religious practices. Instead, the way to access God requires a non-dual form of perception called Samadhi which goes beyond ordinary experience, perceptions, and traditional knowledge.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Personal Experience and Research</b>: Emphasis on personal experience and research when it comes to understanding the mystical experience and discovering God. He warns viewers to not rely solely on his words and instead delve into scientific research and explore the psychedelic experience themselves.  
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Resource</b>: He highlights the value of his website, Actualized.org, which is built on extensive research and offers resources like a book list and a forum for deeper exploration into the understanding of God.
</li><li><b>Different Worldviews and the Pre-Trans Fallacy</b>: Leo Gura explains three different types of worldview: beliefs of fundamentalist theists, empirical evidence behind atheism, and agnostic doubt about the existence of God. Gura introduces the concept of the pre-trans fallacy, which mistakes the trans-rational stage of development, going beyond rationality while acknowledging its limitations, for the pre-rational stage. Gura clarifies that his communication is trans-rational and also acknowledges criticisms of religious delusion.
</li><li><b>God as an Experience, not a Belief or Theory</b>: Gura states that God is a real phenomenon and not an invention of human minds, and more importantly, God is an actual experience many, including Gura, have had. However, having an image or idea of God is not the same as experiencing God directly.
</li><li><b>Challenges to Proof of God's Existence</b>: Gura addresses the objection that personal experience of God is unreliable and cannot be considered proof. He argues that proof requires existence and is a second-order phenomenon, whereas truth or being is primary or foundational. Accordingly, proof should be understood as a weaker notion than truth. He also introduces the concept that different states of consciousness exist and affect our ability to comprehend God.
</li><li><b>Complex Notion of Proof and Different States of Consciousness</b>: Gura states that proof is a complex concept that relies on several elements, such as common base of experiences or a consensus among individuals. He also mentions that there are things in life that are true but cannot be proven. Further, he argues that rationality, science, and proof are only valid within certain states of consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of understanding that there are different states of consciousness, which significantly influence our understanding of God.
</li><li><b>Understanding God through various states of consciousness</b>: Leo Gura underlines that consciousness comes in different levels or states, each with its individual possibilities and limitations. It's likened to the experience of a person who is drunk or dreaming. He suggests that to fully grasp the concept of God, one needs to immensely elevate their state of consciousness, comparing this process to explaining colors to a blind person. He directly relates this ability to understand God with our development stages, encouraging listeners to stay open for change and evolution, rather than denying the potential for further cognitive and conscious growth.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Science and Rationality</b>: Gura argues that science and rationality are products of consciousness, and therefore, only possible within certain states of consciousness. Using the example of an ant's limited conscious perception compared to our human understanding, he seeks to showcase our still existing limitations. He warns that seeing this current human state of consciousness as the highest level is a critical mistake, advocating for the exploration of higher stages to unlock a more comprehensive understanding of God. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality</b>: Gura criticizes the view of reality as merely a physical system, arguing reality constitutes a colossally imaginative mind producing sub-realities, including physical reality. Accentuating that a materialist perspective is fundamentally flawed, he proposes that the true exploration of God mandates questioning our cognitive and epistemological assumptions.
</li><li><b>Emotional Intensity associated with God</b>: The concept of God triggers strong emotional responses since it reaches to the core of a person's belief system, impacting their interpretation of reality, their morality, and their life orientation. The focus is on the practical implications of God on people's everyday lives, and people's deeply held attitudes about God are accentuated as posing significant obstacles to understanding the true nature of God.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience versus Belief</b>: Gura encourages listeners to evaluate whether their understanding of God stems from direct personal experience or learned beliefs. He underscores that the willingness to question and potentially relinquish closely held attitudes, whether positive, negative, or neutral, is crucial to gaining deeper insights into what God really is. He emphasizes the importance of differentiating between having an attitude towards God and actually experiencing God firsthand.
</li><li><b>Concept of God</b>: Leo emphasizes distinguishing between beliefs and experiences when discussing the concept of God. Asserting that one's lack of experience with God doesn't discredit its existence, and reminding that a strong belief in God isn't a direct experience of God. Leo encourages directly experiencing and being conscious of God in the present moment, rather than relying on past experiences or memories. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about God</b>: Leo discusses numerous misconceptions about God, including the perception of God as a belief, a superstitious religious notion, or a defense mechanism against facing hard realities such as death. He argues that God is not a gendered being, a creature, or a judgemental entity with rules to follow. God is not incompatible with science, technology, society, or evolution. He reiterates that no religion has a monopoly on God and different representations across various religions are mere interpretations and symbolizations of the same entity. The most significant misconception raised is that God is separate from oneself, when in fact God is perceived to be a part of oneself, though acknowledgement requires a change in self-perception.
</li><li><b>Philosophical definition of God</b>: In this section, Leo highlights the introduction of God in a typical philosophical context. As per Western philosophy, God is defined as the supreme being, the first cause, and the source of all creation (denoted by 'creation' with a capital C, signifying the entirety of existence). Leo plans to examine these facets of God for their validity in later discussions.
</li><li><b>Types of Worldviews and Concept of Pre Trans Fallacy</b>: In this video, Leo Gura discusses three types of worldviews: Fundamentalist Theists, Atheists, and Agnostics. Fundamentalist Theists strongly believe in God and religious teachings, while Atheists reject the existence of God based on empirical evidence. Agnostics are unsure and believe it is impossible to know the truth. Each worldview holds some truth, but they also have confusion and misunderstandings. Leo Gura introduces the concept of the pre trans fallacy, the mistake of dismissing the trans rational stage of development which goes beyond rationality and recognizes its limitations. He believes spirituality should be seen as a trans-rational communication.
</li><li><b>God Concept and Personal Experiences</b>: Leo Gura shares his personal experience transitioning from being an Atheist to experiencing God. He emphasizes that God is not just a belief or theory, but an actual experience. He also addresses objections to personal experience as proof by explaining that proof is a second-order phenomenon that requires the existence of truth or being. 
</li><li><b>Understanding God through States of Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura discusses the necessity of raising one's state of consciousness to understand God. He illustrates this by comparing humans' understanding of the universe to that of ants. Just as an ant's understanding of the world is limited to a small area, our understanding of the universe is also limited. To understand God requires us to raise our state of consciousness significantly. 
</li><li><b>Definition of God and Validation through Consciousness Work</b>: Leo Gura defines God as the supreme being, the first cause, and the source of all creation. He also explains that God is infinite, all-knowing, all-powerful, and present everywhere. He personally validates these aspects of God through his consciousness work. He points out that God is also a radical state of consciousness and the absence of our limited egoic identity. 
</li><li><b>God and the Nature of Existence</b>: Leo Gura equates God with the true essence of reality, existence, and truth. He dispels the notion that atheists and rationalists do not believe in God, stating that they may subscribe to God, but define it as reality or existence. He argues that consciousness is not just a product of the brain or a mechanical system, but it is the only thing that exists. 
</li><li><b>Obstacles in Realizing God</b>: Leo Gura articulates that the constant interpretations and projections we make in our minds, most of which are tied to our survival drive, are the major obstacles in realizing God. He remarks that God is found in the present moment, but is mysterious and can't be pointed to because everything that points to God is itself God. He outlines that God is non-duality, the elimination of all distinctions, and to become conscious of the oneness of reality is to become conscious of God. 
</li><li><b>God as a Strange Loop</b>: Leo Gura refers to God as a "strange loop," a concept in which God created itself and exists for eternity. He relays that this understanding reconciles the duality between everything and nothing and addresses metaphysical and epistemic questions by providing a satisfying and complete explanation for our existence. 
</li><li><b>Trickery and Deception in Understanding God</b>: Leo Gura discusses the trickery and deception that can occur in our pursuit to understand God. He acknowledges that understanding God can threaten power hierarchies and existing systems. He also shares various names for God from different religions, emphasizing that all these names ultimately point to the same essence. 
</li><li><b>Using Personal Experience to Discover God</b>: Leo Gura discusses various methods for experiencing God. Practices mentioned include self-inquiry, meditation, and concentration. He emphasizes that these techniques should be used to reach higher states of consciousness and that God cannot be experienced through the mind but instead through direct personal experience. 
</li><li><b>Personal Experience and Biases in Understanding God</b>: In this section, Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of personal investigation in understanding God. He encourages listeners to delve into scientific research, explore the psychedelic experience, and consult multiple sources to avoid biases and self-deception.
</li><li><b>Explanation of God's Minutia and the Present Moment</b>: God is tied to the present moment of 'now', which is the only thing that is truly real, not the past or future. This understanding of 'now' is difficult to fully grasp because God cannot be pointed to as it is happening all the time and is beyond interpretation or language. 
</li><li><b>God and Non-Duality</b>: God can be seen as non-duality, the elimination of boundaries or the distinction between everything in reality. This means that everything, including ourselves, is one unified thing, and becoming conscious of this oneness allows us to become conscious of God.
</li><li><b>God as a Strange Loop</b>: God is addressed as a strange loop - that it created itself, existing for eternity. This means God has always existed and never needed creation, creating a resolution to the question of where did existence and God come from.
</li><li><b>Attributes of God</b>: Leo defines God as absolute infinity, meaning that it is all-encompassing and infinite. God is also seen as both everything and nothing. The reconciliation of this paradox lies in understanding that to be everything is to be nothing and vice versa. God, therefore, is a reconciliation of the ultimate duality.
</li><li><b>God as The Answer</b>: The concept that God is the answer to all metaphysical and epistemic questions is explored, providing a satisfying and complete explanation to existential queries. However, this doesn't apply to relative or scientific questions.
</li><li><b>The Vacuum analogy</b>: An analogy is drawn where the vacuum of space is used to explain the omnipresence of God. The vacuum is always present, irrespective of whether there are objects in it or not, similar to how God exists, regardless of human interpretations, objects, or language.
</li><li><b>Three types of worldviews</b>: Speaker discusses three types of worldviews - Fundamentalist Theists who strongly believe in God based on religious teachings, Atheists who reject the existence of God based on empirical evidence, and Agnostics who are unsure if it is possible to know the truth.
</li><li><b>Pre-Trans Fallacy</b>: Speaker introduces the concept of the pre-trans fallacy, asserting a mistake often made by conflating the trans-rational stage of development - which is beyond rationality and recognizes its limitations - with pre-rational or mythic thinking.
</li><li><b>Empiricism of God</b>: Speaker emphasizes that God is not merely a belief or theory, but an actual experience. He explains the difficulty in obtaining proof when discussing existence, using the analogy of building blocks to iterate that proof requires the pre-existence of a form of truth or being. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Rationality and Existential States</b>: Speaker discusses the limitations of rationality, proof, and the varied conscious states in understanding God. He emphasizes existence as being more fundamental than proof and compares the understanding of reality to different levels of consciousness (using an ant's limited understanding as an example).
</li><li><b>Challenges of Limited Understanding and Materialistic Paradigm</b>: Speaker underlines the consequences of our limited understanding of reality and the importance of being open to new stages of cognitive development for a deeper understanding of God. Leo criticises a materialistic paradigm by asserting consciousness cannot be explained simply as the functioning of the human brain.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about God and Personal Experience</b>: Speaker highlights the importance of not confusing beliefs with personal experiences of God, and the necessity of being directly conscious of God in the present moment for true understanding.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as God</b>: Speaker outlines the concept of an individual being a part of God by explaining consciousness as the true essence of God. Removing all interpretations and beliefs about reality allows for a direct experience of pure being.
</li><li><b>Projecting Interpretations and Non-Duality</b>: Speaker explains the main obstacle in realizing God to be the constant interpretations and projections our minds make, which prevents us from experiencing pure being. He also talks about the concept of non-duality and the realization that everything that points to God is itself God.
</li><li><b>Realization of God and the notion of a strange loop</b>: Speaker explains that God can be understood in two senses. In one, God is viewed as a higher power or creator, and in another, as everything that exists, including ourselves. This concept of reality being a "strange loop" where God created itself is difficult to comprehend but needs to be experienced directly.
</li><li><b>The Nature of Truth</b>: Speaker explains that truth cannot be proven or justified and can just be accepted as it exists. Everything in reality is imagined within consciousness and can only be understood when one becomes conscious of it. 
</li><li><b>Associations of God with Death</b>: Speaker discusses the association of God with death, and the societal fear of death which is considered the worst possible thing. However, when you understand God, death is understood as the end of the idea of physical reality and one's identity as a biological self, leading to the realization of God. 
</li><li><b>God as Total Surrender</b>: Speaker describes the realization of God as a total surrender, relinquishing all control of one's life to the universe. This results in the dissolution of boundaries and the realization of non-dual awareness. 
</li><li><b>God as an Epiphany</b>: Speaker explains the realization of God as the biggest mind-blowing experience, which is simultaneously awesome and terrifying due to its infinity and beauty, and the threat it poses to an individual's ego and personal identity. It is like exiting the Matrix, however, in comparison to the movie, once you leave the Matrix of reality, there is nothing outside, pointing to the emptiness of reality (nothingness). 
</li><li><b>God as a Universal Mind</b>: Speaker describes God as a universal mind, where everything happening right now, including one's life from birth, is imagined within this consciousness. God's mind is explained to be the imagination of this very moment. This realization can be felt like awakening from a dream and is also associated with death, as the idea of physical reality and biological self dies during this realization. 
</li><li><b>Skepticism and Assumptions</b>: Speaker discusses skepticism, questioning its validity as a tool in experiencing God or reaching higher states of consciousness and suggesting it limits individuals in their pursuit. He also elaborates on how God is perceived as an illusion by many and how this can harm existing power hierarchies and systems.
</li><li><b>Experiencing God</b>: Speaker lists various techniques to experience God, including self-inquiry, meditation, concentration, and visualization, among others. He emphasizes that this cannot be achieved through the mind or traditional means of knowledge acquisition. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness, God, and the Role of Skepticism</b>: Speaker explains the role of skepticism in realizing God, and the importance of directly becoming conscious of God. He identifies the need to question existing biases and strength of current scientific methods in truly understanding God.
</li><li><b>Section Summary</b>:
</li><li>- <b>The Matrix Analogy</b>: The Matrix is used as a metaphor for the limited awareness most people have of reality. Gura states that, much like Neo in The Matrix, he has "exited" this limited perspective, which he acknowledges may seem insane to those still "trapped." He contends that those trapped can only understand their limited view once they've experienced the broader reality for themselves. 
</li><li>- <b>Metaphysical Orgasm and Cosmic Holographic Fractal</b>: Gura describes the realisation of God as a "metaphysical orgasm", more powerful than any physical pleasure. He further illustrates it as a "cosmic holographic fractal," stating that consciousness and the universe are interconnected with no separation, akin to a hologram where each point contains the entirety within it.
</li><li>- <b>Universe as Universal Mind</b>: He discusses philosophical concepts of idealism and solipsism, stating that reality is made of "mind-stuff" and argues there are no separate sentient entitiesthere is only one mind, the universal one. 
</li><li>- <b>God as a Single, All-Encompassing Entity</b>: Gura posits that there can only be one ultimate God, as God is infinite and encompasses everything. Lesser gods or beings exist only within this one, infinite entity. He further stresses that the realization goes beyond solipsism with the concept of non-duality, which eliminates the concept of a separate self.
</li><li>- <b>God as Emptiness and Infinite Potential</b>: Gura refers to God as emptiness or nothingness, but not in the customary sense. Instead, it's depicted as radiant, full, and pregnant with infinite potentialcapable of becoming anything. 
</li><li>- <b>Consciousness as Infinite Intelligence</b>: Gura experiences God as infinite intelligencean intelligence so profound it can create itself. He proposes that the universe is deliberately designed with this intelligent consciousness, which can be directly verified.
</li><li>- <b>God as Infinitely Beautiful and Profoundly Peaceful</b>: Gura speaks of experiencing God as infinite beauty and profound peace, where time seems to stop and feels eternal. 
</li><li>- <b>God as Immortal</b>: Gura concludes by redefining the popular understanding of mortality. He posits that if we disassociate our existence from our physical form and identify ourselves with the entirety of existence (God), we become immortal, as existence cannot die.
</li><li><b>Understanding the universe</b>: The universe is referred to as "universe with a capital U," which encompasses all possibilities and exists infinitely. This can be contrasted with the scientific definition of the universe, which is limited to our known physical reality.
</li><li><b>Personal experience of God</b>: According to Leo, God is a pure consciousness that exists beyond the physical, biological, emotional, and psychological layers of individual perception. This consciousness, or "I am-ness," is filled with experiences and content from life.
</li><li><b>God as supreme love and joy</b>: God is described as a state of infinite joy and love. The realization of this love is considered greater than any other emotion or experience in life.
</li><li><b>God as a miracle of existence</b>: The divine essence of God is described as miraculous and magical. This direct perception of God is compared to the observation and awareness of a living universe where everything is sentient and conscious.
</li><li><b>God as mystery and unknowing</b>: God is portrayed as a profound mystery that cannot fully be known or understood. Rather than offering a clear-cut explanation, God is experienced more accurately in the state of not knowing.
</li><li><b>God transcends different levels of consciousness</b>: God is said to be a level of consciousness that is beyond what most people can access. As a result, many find it challenging to understand and experience.
</li><li><b>God as formless</b>: The formlessness of God, being all form and beyond form, can be a source of confusion. People often expect God to take on a fixed or recognizable form that is much more limited when compared to the infinite formlessness of God.
</li><li><b>The challenges of discussing God</b>: Understanding and discussing God can be daunting due to its paradoxical nature and the profound mind-shifts it requires. The concept of God can be perceived as extremely radical and threatening to established belief systems, making it a challenging topic for many.
</li><li><b>Techniques to experience God</b>: Techniques such as self-inquiry, meditation, and existential investigation are advocated. These are said to offer direct experiences of God, which are subjective rather than objective. This personal, experiential approach is emphasized above intellectual understanding or belief.
</li><li><b>Science and understanding God</b>: Science is criticized for its inability to fully explain or comprehend God. The limitations of science are discussed in the context of the Matrix movie, where science conducted by characters within the Matrix is only valid within that context. The idea is suggested that the same applies to our own scientific understanding within our limited reality.
</li><li><b>God as a strange loop</b>: The concept of God is presented as a deep paradox and a strange loop that is challenging for people who are not prepared to embrace such complexities. God's existence transcends simple linear, cause-and-effect explanations.
</li><li><b>Necessity for open-mindedness</b>: Understanding and experiencing God requires radical open-mindedness. People often hesitate to open their minds to radical ideas about existence, death, and the nature of reality, which can hinder their understanding of God.
</li><li><b>Different attitudes towards God</b>: Individuals display various attitudes towards God, with some attempting to assert their beliefs onto others without having invested time into existential investigation. Leo Gura emphasizes that both devout theists and firm atheists can be guilty of this, questioning whether these individuals have truly explored the foundations of their beliefs thoroughly.
</li><li><b>God and society</b>: The concept of God conflicts with societal norms and individual goals such as ego, control, and survival. Pursuing understanding of God requires relinquishing these pursuits, which is often challenging as people prioritize their own survival needs. 
</li><li><b>Understanding God's nature</b>: Leo underscores that God cannot be symbolized or truly communicated as it transcends human depiction or characterization. Moreover, the infinite nature of God makes it impossible to capture its essence through confined means like equations.
</li><li><b>Cultural limitations on understanding God</b>: Leo points out that the understanding of God is hindered by cultures, societies, and education systems that are fundamentally materialistic and lack serious consideration of metaphysics and epistemology. The success of science has created a false sense of understanding, leading to misconceptions about God.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of reality</b>: Reality is subjective and relative, making it challenging to deal with from a rational perspective. A shift towards appreciating this subjectivity is necessary to understand that the objective reality science seeks to study is itself a concept within subjective experiences. 
</li><li><b>Misuse of skepticism</b>: Skepticism is being misused in the pursuit of truth. People demand overwhelming proof without making personal efforts to verify truths, shifting responsibility away from themselves. Leo urges individuals to interrogate their own skepticism and embrace the possibility of truths beyond what can be empirically validated.
</li><li><b>God's revelation reveals illusions</b>: The understanding of God reveals everything as illusions, threatening power hierarchies built on illusions and false justifications. This poses a significant existential challenge that most people are unwilling or unprepared to face. 
</li><li><b>God and power hierarchies</b>: The concept of God poses a threat to power hierarchies rooted in society, government, religion, and businesses. The implications of knowing God challenge these established structures and demand a reevaluation of these power dynamics.
</li><li><b>Exploring the complexity of understanding God</b>: Leo Gura signifies the complexity and challenging nature of understanding the concept of God; once understood, communication about it to others who have not had a similar realization is almost impossible. 
</li><li><b>Various names of God</b>: Leo puts forward a list of names or phrases for God derived from various religious and philosophical perspectives, indicating the multifaceted nature of God. These include but are not limited to: God, enlightenment, awakening, oneness, the all, Godhead, nothingness, truth, non-duality, the absolute, ego death, infinity, self-transcendence, self-realization and consciousness. He reiterates these are all fundamentally pointing to the same thing, albeit from different angles or aspects.
</li><li><b>Techniques to experience God</b>: Leo provides an array of techniques that can facilitate an experience of God, including: metaphysical questioning, deconstruction of belief systems, self-inquiry, meditation, concentration and visualization, yoga, psychedelic use, deep suffering and deprivation, meditation retreats, and dark room retreats. Nevertheless, he clarifies that the experience of God cannot be achieved purely by mind, belief, or rational enquiry, hence the necessity of direct experience.
</li><li><b>Ways not to experience God</b>: Leo cautions viewers that God cannot be experienced through the mind, beliefs, thinking processes, rational inquiry, scientific methods or studies. Direct, subjective experience is essential for the understanding of God, and thus cannot be entirely objective or acquired through proof. 
</li><li><b>Specific Expectations regarding the realization of God</b>: Leo suggests that scriptures and sacred texts can contribute to understanding God, but stresses that these should not be the sole source of one's practice. He acknowledges that reading scriptures or spiritual texts can sometimes trigger powerful epiphanies and spiritual insights, but emphasizes they should be seen as an adjunct to one's own experiential practices.
</li><li><b>Different Techniques to Experience God</b>: There are various techniques to experience God, including self-inquiry, meditation, concentration and visualization, yoga, psychedelics, deep suffering and deprivation, meditation retreats and solo retreats, and dark room retreats. These techniques can help individuals reach higher states of consciousness and have a direct experience of God.
</li><li><b>Exploring Samadhi to Experience God</b>: To truly access God, one must open their mind to the possibility of Samadhi. Samadhi is a higher state of consciousness, beyond ordinary knowledge, experience, and perception. It is a non-dual form of perception and goes beyond the subject-object duality associated with ordinary perceiving and knowing. 
</li><li><b>Problems with Traditional Perception</b>: Traditional perceptions, grounded in materialist metaphysics, hinder the experience of Samadhi. They involve a process of light bouncing off objects, going into the eye, and creating perception in the brain. Yet, accessing God requires going beyond such indirect methods. 
</li><li><b>Psychedelic Experiences on the Spiritual Journey</b>: Psychedelics can offer a quick glimpse of God and serve as an initial verification of the truths discussed in the lecture. However, they should not be seen as the only technique as they can turn into a trap. The psychedelic experience can introduce individuals to advanced spiritual truths without necessitating years spent on study and other forms of practice. 
</li><li><b>Need for Personal Research and Experience</b>: To truly grasp the ideas shared in this lecture, listeners need to carry out their own research and perform the suggested spiritual practices. Validating the information through firsthand experience and other resources is crucial to avoid misguided beliefs or dogma. 
</li><li><b>Resources at Actualized.Org</b>: The Actualized.org website, founded by Leo Gura, provides a platform for a deeper exploration of the discussed concepts through a blog, a forum, a book list, and a life purpose course. The content here is grounded in extensive research carried out over years and can prove to be a valuable resource in the spiritual journey. 
</li><li><b>Potential Risks of Misinterpretation</b>: The spiritual journey comes with risks of self-deception, and careful study is encouraged to avoid falling into traps or holding onto half-baked ideas. Misinterpretation of mystical experiences is a common concern, and continuous learning from various resources can help develop a comprehensive and accurate understanding.
