hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about how comprehension has many degrees
and the importance of deriving truth for yourself [Music] you
things can be grasped at many different levels of depth
it's important to understand that to really understand that and
what I mean by things is truths principles insights lessons
teachings advice and even facts it's one thing to hear
one of these things being spoken to you or deliver
to you or taught to you or to read it
in a book and it's a totally different thing to
really really really comprehend it in its full significance and
that's what this whole episode is about it might seem
like it's a basic point but actually it's a critical
point it's foundational to you being able to get the
results that are possible from this work and I see
that a lot of people are not getting this point
so be very careful here not to overlook the obvious
this point right here affects everything that you will ever
learn in your life you say you understand but the
question is to what degree do you understand it's not
enough to understand what is being told to you you
have to understand much deeper than that there are many
levels to this stuff any piece of sufficiently deep wisdom
will have many many many levels to it even though
it might seem simple on the surface but looks can
be deceiving and you might hear the exact same teaching
spoken over and over again by different people by different
masters by different Yogi's by different teachers and the problem
with that is that hearing it isn't enough and it's
not an issue of memorization some people try to desperately
take notes as though that is what really counts that's
not what really counts what counts is have you grasped
all the layers and facets and interconnections and ramifications of
this insight or this truth or this principle or this
this piece of advice that you're being given how deeply
has it affected your life have you bothered to actually
use your mind to trace through all the ramifications of
it all the corollaries have you bothered to actually grasp
the significance of what is being told to you that's
what's really important and what is required to do that
is contemplation you have to contemplate these ideas for yourself
you have to chew them for a good long time
sometimes for for days for weeks for years to really
understand how profound they are and not just to understand
how profound the are but to have this insight do
work for you in your life for it to transform
you a lot of people they're not getting traction with
these ideas that's the problem and you can spend years
just kind of like reading self-help books but your mind
is not getting traction and that's what I want to
help you with here today so let's go through some
examples that's the best way to illustrate this lesson for
example you've probably heard that people's opinions of you are
irrelevant haven't you heard that by now if you are
into self-help and you probably agree with that and you
probably believe that and if I told you that right
now you'd say yes of course leo so let's move
on to the next thing and yet in reality what's
going on in your life maybe your entire life is
shaped by people's opinions of you so in point of
fact it's not irrelevant in your life and yet when
you're told this simple truth that people's opinions of you
are irrelevant you don't get it you see you think
you get it but you don't get it because you've
never seriously contemplated it you've never really thought about it
and because you're not thinking about it because you're not
taking this idea seriously you're not getting traction with it
you're not letting it transform your life because if you
sit there and you think about it over and over
again for months just this one simple idea that people's
opinions of you are irrelevant and you you trace all
the consequences all the ramifications and you see the significance
of this and just how much you are at the
effect of other people's opinions that's gonna transform you and
you might say well leo yeah I know that I've
heard that before but I'm still I still have social
anxiety and I'm still worried what people think about I
still care I don't know how to stop that's because
you're too preoccupied with getting a solution rather than with
actually investigating the lesson you don't really want to investigate
the lesson because your mind is lazy and I don't
blame you my mind is lazy too all our minds
are lazy but you have to push past that and
really chew these ideas because if you really chew this
idea you're becoming conscious of something which is different from
hearing a thing to become conscious of something is well
it's like almost like deriving a mathematical proof you're seeing
the inner workings of the inner mechanics the logic of
it and as you see that something changes in you
that otherwise wouldn't change just by being told the ultimate
conclusion here's another example is you've probably heard that language
creates your reality and if I told you if I
told you that in passing in one of my episodes
you would say oh yeah leo that that's interesting that
kind of makes sense to me but how deeply do
you grasp that because that's a significant statement you have
to take these statements seriously so when you hear a
statement like this you should say wow that that's a
pretty big claim language creates reality in what way is
that true is that really true and if it's true
what does that really mean I mean just how much
of my reality is created by language let me investigate
this let me actually see how this thing works that's
what you got to do and you got to dig
into it you got a content and see where that
takes you but most people when they hear that they
just say oh yeah of course and then just go
on they missed it it just goes in one ear
and out the other you see no traction happen there
because if you really got the the significance of just
what this means that language creates reality Wow that's a
that's a huge thing that's not an insignificant thing so
the first thing you should realize is if this is
true it's really significant maybe it's not true which is
why it's worth thinking about just to double-check you don't
want to take it on blind faith that what you're
being told is what it is you don't know so
first you gotta just verify it that's why you contemplate
is to verify these things for yourself does it make
sense does it pass muster does it hold water how
does it actually work is the next step and then
tracing out all the cons what does this mean what
does that mean for my relationships what does that mean
for my career what does it mean for my notions
of what reality is and what does that mean for
physics what does that mean for science what does that
mean for philosophy what does that mean for thinking there's
a lot to ponder there here's another example you've probably
heard this one before I've talked about it before the
map is not the territory now that's a really profound
statement and most people they hear it and they think
it's kind of cute and interesting and then they put
into their back pocket and they forget about it but
to really understand that the map is not the territory
is just so ridiculously significant and the consequences of it
they they permeate throughout all human culture everything that human
beings put their hands on is is corrupted by this
problem of not understanding that the map is not the
territory but that requires contemplation on your part to see
that and then for you that statement will become a
very important piece of wisdom now you will keep with
you and you will use for the rest of your
life and it'll make a very big difference in the
quality of your life from now and then it's gonna
snowball for years and decades until the end and it's
gonna have huge ramifications for you but not if you
don't contemplate it not if you don't take it seriously
not if you don't trace through those consequences as you
would with the mathematical proof here's another example for you
the Buddha devoted over 40 years of his life teaching
basically two things what is suffering and how to extinguish
it and he said very simply that all suffering comes
from clinging to impermanent objects sounds simple enough right but
do you grasp the significance of what he said all
suffering that should already ring alarm bells in your mind
when you hear something like that all suffering is caused
by blank that sounds like it's pretty important doesn't it
after all isn't that why you're here is because you
don't want to suffer isn't that the the ultimate scenario
that you could invent envision in your life is that
you will have a life with no more suffering isn't
that what you really want so that's pretty goddamn important
right if someone is giving you a solution to every
single problem that you have in life in one statement
that sounds like that's worthy of some contemplation on your
part and not just to say oh yeah of course
of course of course and then just move on move
on to the next thing no no no it's not
move on to the next thing it's like spend 10
years contemplating this chew it to get all the juice
out of it because this thing contains a lot of
juice here's another example all fear is a concept about
the future how's that for a powerful insight and that's
actually one that I learned from Peter Ralston and what
this means is that you literally cannot experience fear unless
you have an image of the future in your mind
that's what fear is sounds pretty significant doesn't it that's
not just an idea that you put in the back
of your pocket or something that you just believe that's
something to be deeply contemplated and investigated is that really
true and if it is what does that really mean
for your life and what would it mean if you
actually mastered this one and sigh just this one insight
if you actually mastered this what would this mean for
your life is it possible that you can eliminate all
fear by understanding this one insight deeply enough and then
what would you need to contemplate how much would you
need to contemplate to really to get the to the
bottom of it to really see the inner workings of
how your fear works how its generated here's another example
for you I've said in the past in certain episodes
that I consider meditation to be the number one personal
development habit the most important that you can put into
place in your life is leverage so when you hear
someone like me saying something like that that's worthy of
contemplation that's worthy not just of going and doing it
like a monkey because I told you to no that's
not what I'm saying I'm saying before you even go
and do it just contemplate the significance of this why
is it true is it actually true what does this
really mean how come it's true what will it mean
for me if I actually put this habit into place
in my life you see the reason you struggle with
putting a meditation habit into place in your life is
not because you're busy or because it's hard or because
you're lazy or whatever it's because your mind hasn't actually
penetrated the truth of of this statement you don't see
the significance of it and you never will so long
as you just listen to people talking about it without
tracing through the steps yourself contemplating it yourself here's another
example for you know self and non-duality this is a
really deep can of worms to grasp the significance of
no self and non-duality is really a feat and I'm
not even talking about to actually become enlightened I'm just
saying to conceptually grasp the significance of it and its
ramifications and what it really means people don't get it
I mean I I keep talking about these concepts and
ideas for years now but people still don't get it
they think they get it they think they know what
enlightenment is but they don't they don't grasp the significance
of what no self what does it really mean that
there is no self that's a very significant statement not
said lightly that's a ridiculously significant statement this has ramifications
for everything for science for philosophy like for physics for
everything every single aspect of your life is affected by
this statement if it's true and non-duality what does it
mean to say that that reality is not dual to
grasp the significance of that is just just just conceptually
just let's begin with just conceptually is very important because
you start off just understanding is come so then you
got to move on to direct experience we'll get to
that but let's just start conceptually a lot of people
don't even get the conceptual part right non-duality that means
that every single duality that you know like cause and
effect good and bad self and other existence and non-existence
life and death and any other duality you can think
of that is non dual that there actually is no
duality that they are one that all these distinctions are
one think that through think what that man that really
means if that's true see just the contemplation of this
one thing right here can transform your whole life but
you have to actually contemplate it it won't change your
life just to go read it about it in a
book I mean that's helpful too but I'm trying to
point you towards deepening your comprehension of these ideas how
about the example of success not being equivalent to growth
that's a very significant statement something that I've shot episodes
about in the past and people here that like I
could be coaching someone and I have coached people on
the phone and stuff on skype and we would talk
about this sort of concept and people who are very
business oriented career oriented success oriented people and I would
talk to them about this but then you know they
hear it but it just goes in one ear and
out the other they're like oh yeah leo of course
I get that but I still have this problem I
should have this problem I'm still I'm still frustrated I'm
still not happy I'm still doing it up because you're
pursuing success and success is not growth you see but
these people they don't contemplate they don't really think about
it they don't draw that because the connections together which
is what the problem was with the first example the
example about your opinions others people's opinions of you being
irrelevant people know that intellectually but it's not working in
their life because they haven't actually made the connections that
requires work and they don't do that work because they
assume that oh well if I just know it shouldn't
that be enough and then they say well Leo either
your advice and whatever you're saying these these principles they
don't really work what good does it do me just
to believe that people's opinions of me don't matter when
in fact I get anxiety and fear and all this
other sort of stuff what good does it do me
because you haven't really contemplated it that's the problem if
you did you would stop being at the effect of
it but you have it so you just think you
have and therefore you're still the effect of it here's
another example good and bad do not exist it's a
very simple statement and many people would agree with that
on the surface I mean a lot of people would
disagree with me so that's one step down I'm not
even gonna get into that here but even those people
who do agree with me they'll say oh well yeah
of course Lia yeah that makes that makes sense but
do you realize how significant it is to say this
that there is no good and bad if there is
no good and bad then what the are you complaining
about in your life why are you suffering why do
you have opinions about things why do you criticize people
why do you get angry what are you angry about
if nothing is good and bad what are you angry
about oh well see now when it really gets to
the nitty-gritty of your life all the sudden you don't
really believe that nothing is good and bad that's a
philosophical belief that you hold because in reality when something
happens to you someone pisses in your soup then all
of a sudden you start to believe in good and
bad really quickly all your ideals fly out the window
when someone scratches your car when someone calls you a
bad name when someone insults you online when someone trolls
you when someone cheats on you all of a sudden
now you get all hot and bothered by these things
why is that because deep down you actually believe that
there is good and bad and that's because you haven't
really chewed this idea deeply enough yet to really realize
that there is no good and bad and that's one
of the whole tricks to this work is that it's
really easy just to believe things and to think you've
got it just because you believe it or just because
you agree with it and that's not nearly gonna be
good enough to get the results that you want to
get so you have to be careful that what I'm
speaking I speak about a lot of topics I say
a lot of things I give you a lot of
insights and it's very easy to agree with them I
mean a lot of people disagree with them so they
don't even get to the point of agreement okay that's
a problem in itself but I'm saying that even the
people that do agree watch out that's a trap right
there and you start to believe it and then that's
another trap and I say something like you have no
free will then people start to believe that and that
becomes a huge trap because see you still actually act
like you have free will you've never actually experienced no
free will you don't really know what that truth is
pointing to to you is an idea and you buy
into that idea and you start to believe it and
then you've actually set yourself backwards because see now there's
now there's this weird thing going on in your mind
where deep down in reality when you're behaving in your
everyday life you actually behave as though you have free
will that's why you're frustrated with yourself because you want
to control reality and you're frustrated with the fact that
you don't have control over reality and that frustrates you
because you believe you should have control of a reality
see if you actually understood that you have zero control
over reality and you really got that you directly experience
that there would be no problem because you don't have
control you don't need control and there's no problem with
that you're not fighting for control the problem happens is
when you have a belief that there is no free
will but then deep down and really you have an
even deeper subconscious sort of belief which actually says yeah
but I should be controlling life something's wrong here see
because you haven't really contemplated no freewill you don't really
know what that means you don't know the full consequences
of it here's another example manipulation corrupts relationships that's a
very in statement and people could hear that like I
could be coaching someone over the phone about how they're
manipulating people and how they're manipulating their relationship and in
general how they're manipulating all of life the whole problem
of manipulation and they'll hear Don say oh yeah Leo
of course but but how do I get what I
want yeah Leo that's all well and good but then
how do I become happy no you don't send you're
manipulating that's the problem yeah but Leo how do I
become happy you're manipulating that's the problem contemplate this contemplate
what manipulation means and look inside your relationship and look
at how you're manipulating inside your relationship and how that's
corrupting every relationship that you're in and here's the final
example you can tap into infinite intelligence with your mind
you know that you can do that that's possible that's
a very significant thing you're being told that you can
tap into infinite intelligence infinite creativity and you can use
this to create your life to create art to create
inventions to create businesses to to do so many things
you can tap into this intelligence you can tap into
this intelligence to to tell you everything you need to
live a ridiculously powerful and joyful life you can tap
into that intelligence but then if I say that to
you and you just hear it in some episode it's
like yeah leo ok good but then like so what
do I do with that how's that gonna help me
how's it gonna help me get laid or how is
that gonna help me when I'm suffering and I'm lonely
and I'm depressed how's that gonna help me right see
because what you need to do is he to sit
down and spend months contemplating the significant of the fact
that you have a mind that's able to tap into
infinite intelligence and that this is a resource that you
have barely ever used in your life but that you
can learn to use but that requires contemplation how do
you contemplate I have entire episodes about that so I
won't go into it here just very simply the way
you contemplate is you take a topic or a question
or a statement and you sit there and you think
about it and you just ask yourself questions contemplation is
nothing more than asking questions of a topic so for
example you could say non-duality what does that really mean
and you could sit there for an hour at four
hours every day for hours just contemplating what does non-duality
really mean and what are the consequences of that and
you see you're just asking questions it's like okay that's
the consequence what's other consequence and what's other consequence and
what would it mean if I if I was fully
living a lined with Nandu out what would that mean
for my life what does that mean for my relationships
and yadda yadda yadda so you just continue like that
and so on for all the other statements that I
said and it's just a tip of the iceberg almost
every video I I talk about there's some kind of
juicy insight at least one probably a dozen or more
that you could spend months years contemplating like this so
this opens up the field and this this work is
about going deep it's not about new it's not about
getting new ideas it's not about amassing a giant collection
of new fancy ideas it's not about quantity it's not
about more more and more be careful with those traps
it's not about more and more advanced and complex mental
masturbatory sort of theories and models about the word it's
not about that it's about going deep with the simple
stuff it's about really grasping the fundamentals of of your
psyche of reality of how human beings were things like
that let me talk to you now about the levels
of understanding there are different levels of comprehension that are
possible and these levels they sort of go through stages
there's a progression it's a rather linear progression this is
just something I sort of identified for myself thinking about
this topic so the first stage is that you just
hear about an idea and now because you've heard about
it now you know it's a thing like okay I've
heard about enlightenment I know it's a thing before I
heard about it I didn't even know as a thing
or it's like I've heard about psychedelics now I know
it's a thing before I really didn't then from there
you move on to step number two which is properly
understanding the concept so you hear about the idea that
there's no free will okay then you move on to
step number two is that you you actually properly understand
the concept as it's being communicated to you being very
careful not to misinterpret it and this is where a
lot of people go wrong on step number two most
people don't even get to the point of properly understanding
the concept never mind having a direct experience or some
profound enlightenment experience or anything like that just start by
understanding the concept without misinterpreting it that's that's a challenge
it could take you a couple of years with a
deep concept like non-duality it could take you well it
took me a good three or four years of of
research reading tons of dozens of books going to seminars
going to workshops going to retreats doing all sorts of
crazy and then after and the thinking about it for
many many hours practicing self inquiry for hundreds maybe even
a thousand hours after all of that only then did
I start to actually fully wrap my mind around the
concept without misunderstanding it that's um is actually a big
achievement for a topic like non-duality where that particular topic
is is it extra hard to properly understand consensus there's
so many traps and it's such an antique conceptual sort
of topic but there are other smaller topics where you
don't need to spend that much time now much effort
just understand it conceptually but still you know very easy
to misunderstand something like no free will or it's very
mean is easy to misunderstand like a concept like happiness
for example then you move on to step number three
which is actually not just conceptually understanding a thing but
tracing all of its ramifications and seeing the significance of
it still conceptually so you don't just know what non-duality
is but then you start to start to fathom like
oh oh oh well if this is true this is
a huge thing this is a really big thing if
this is true I got a really start to take
it seriously if it's true maybe I don't know yet
if it's true but if it is oh boy cuz
that would mean this and this and this and that
and this this would change and that will change all
of society would change and oh ok see then you
start to get it still conceptually but you start to
see the significance then you move on to step number
four which is you actually start to get your initial
glimpses of this truth happening in your direct experience and
that's a big big leap that most people never even
get to most people never get to Stage four and
when you do it's a real eye-opener because you're like
oh oh that's what they were talking oh yeah that's
what they were talking about oh it's different than I
thought it was what are they talking about it's not
like they were saying it's different it's so different it's
like it's oh it's like it's actual it's actual it's
not an i Oh see it works like that and
usually what you discover is that a lot of the
stuff that they told you about this thing that now
you discovered because you've directly experience it's like wait a
minute what were those guys smoked and this is not
how it really is it's different and then other times
you discover no it's actually exactly as they told you
and then from that you move on to step five
which is starting to see these glimpses intermittently on a
regular basis occasionally they're still kind of rare but you
you get multiple glimpses and I'm not just talking about
non-duality or in Lyman here by the way I'm talking
about any insight so an insight for example that like
manipulation corrupts relationships that would be a more basic insight
right so what you would see there and Step five
is you would see that oh I'm manipulating here and
I'm manipulating there and here and there and there and
here oh okay I'm manipulating and then you see the
consequences of your manipulations like oh yeah this manipulation has
led to this argument that led to this fight that
led to this breakup that led to this that led
to that oh and then at least am i suffering
and then I'm suffering because I'm manipulate and I see
as I'm actually texting oh I'm manipulating as I'm texting
oh I see it's not just an idea and then
that happens to you occasionally you don't see it all
the time just occasionally cuz you're still mostly asleep mostly
unconscious and then finally you move on to step six
which is where you start to see this stuff constantly
you become constantly conscious of it to the point where
it's difficult to not see anymore and that's the ultimate
stage and at this stage you also start seeing the
full ramifications not just in theory but in practice so
there's a sort of flowering effect that takes place where
you really grasp this nugget but then this nugget is
not just an isolated nugget it is interwoven with everything
else in your life and everything to shift in subtle
ways at this stage you also become very aware of
all the traps in this process you become aware of
all the the mechanisms that exist which caused you to
go fall back asleep to become unconscious and to to
stop recognizing it and you're able to bring yourself out
of these traps maybe you fall into a trap once
in a while but still you're able to recognize are
you falling into a trap you've become unconscious you were
able to wake yourself up a little bit and also
you're you're getting better and better at avoiding the traps
entirely so you can sort of foresee the trap about
to happen like you're about to manipulate someone and you're
like oh I'm gonna manipulate okay let me just drop
it that's a trap you see or maybe you're about
to manipulate or maybe even you did manipulate you're starting
to manipulate and and then you notice your justifications about
how oh it's okay if I manipulate this in this
in this situation it's actually better if I let myself
in a bit see you start to see that justification
come up and you're like oh that's also a trap
see that's a justification that is pushing me to continue
to manipulate even though I know I'm not supposed to
manipulate because it causes me suffering oh okay I see
that that's that's one trap and usually with traps there's
like two sides to a trap you can swing your
pendulum too much in this direction or in this direction
so it's like oh yeah I'm like I'm supposed to
be honest like let's say maybe you're working on honesty
it's like okay I should be honest so one trap
is lying but then the opposite trap of that is
being too honest brutally honest or honest in a sort
of inconsiderate manner see those are like two ends of
the spectrum there and so you're gonna swing your pendulum
sort of back and forth and back and forth and
then as you get to this this the six stage
you're gonna you're gonna see that the dangers of both
ends of that trap and finally still in this sixth
stage which you're ultimately get gonna get to is you're
gonna get to an understanding of why the mechanism that
you're exploring is inevitable why it's absolutely necessary why reality
couldn't really be any other way than the way that
it is so at first in the first stage is
gonna be very judgmental about all this stuff like manipulating
maybe you're gonna you're gonna be working on your manipulation
let's say then you're gonna get to a stage where
you get a little bit better about not manipulating but
then what's gonna happen you're gonna judge other people from
manipulating and you like oh how dare they manipulate and
then you're gonna get this whole thing about like oh
we should end all the manipulation in the world because
manipulation is bad and evil and all this so you'll
fall into that trap but eventually you'll work through that
and then eventually you get to the very end you
understand the whole thing you will also understand why it
exists if I may use this verbiage you will understand
why God created it and why it couldn't be any
other way and why it's perfect exactly the way it
is you will see that not only will you see
that in ordinary situations but you would also see it
with evil stuff that normally people would never ever admit
is inevitable or is necessary or is is perfect like
you will look at rape you will look at war
you will look at genocide you will look at theft
you will look at line you will look at politicians
you will look at at corruption in Washington you will
look at all this stuff and eventually go to a
point well where you will understand why it's necessary and
that gives you peace so you can't be at peace
so long as you're fighting the world and you're gonna
be fighting the world so long as you believe that
things are well that they could be otherwise and again
be careful not to misinterpret what I'm saying here I'm
not saying that rape couldn't be otherwise in the sense
that you couldn't stop doing it it's not what I'm
saying nor am i saying that it shouldn't be punished
I'm not saying any of those things if be very
careful here I'm saying you will understand why it exists
and you will come to peace with it I think
that's that's one of the deepest levels of understanding you
can get to and that's the level of understanding that
most people when they're at the early stages they don't
even want to hear it that this is a possibility
even the possibility of such a thing on certain topics
for certain people is such an outrageous statement that it
sounds like heresy it sounds like insanity it sounds like
criminality that's what it sounds like so usually people who
get to this stage they they keep it to themselves
they cook they don't go around talking about it very
much on TV and stuff like that you don't see
people coming around and saying oh rape is inevitable and
therefore everything is perfect and reality is fine and we
don't even do anything you know you don't hear them
talking like that but deep down they're at peace with
the evils of the world and all the other that
usually disturbs them and disturbs other people so those are
levels now these levels I mean they're not clearly delineated
in reality I just made up these levels I gave
them numberings I just made this whole thing up right
so this is just my way of categorizing every categorization
scheme is just a human invention so don't get the
mistake that these levels are somehow itched into stone by
God they're not let's talk about some of the obstacles
to understanding so throughout this process of moving up these
stages or down these stages however you want to think
of it you're gonna have the following obstacles closed-mindedness that's
huge and is especially huge at the early stages judgments
that's also huge you're gonna be judging yourself and other
people in situations and and ideas you're gonna be extremely
judgmental and opinionated and that's gonna be a huge obstacle
for you to deepening your understanding arrogance is gonna become
an obstacle as well you're gonna feel like you already
know this stuff or that you're a more advanced than
this you're already beyond this and and you know better
than the GNAT teacher and you know better than this
person you know better than that advice given there you
know you know everything and you will have to be
deeply humbled and that's gonna be a painful process for
you to to realize how arrogant you were and how
how just how stupid your arrogance is that's gonna be
a painful process if you choose to push through it
further and further but many people stop there because it's
it's too painful they don't want to go through the
emotional labor that complacency will be a big obstacle you
will just think oh yeah I got it I got
it leo non-duality yeah I got it I got it
what's next this sort of complacency or even like yeah
Leo I've traced through the consequence of so what this
sort of complacency laziness will become a big obstacle especially
in the in in that critical transition between understanding of
thing conceptually and then moving on to stage four where
you actually start to get glimpses of the direct experiences
because the difference between between this the conceptual stage and
the direct experience stage is that you need to put
in work and most people are so lazy that they're
not gonna put in the work and by work I
mean a lot of times just mental work the work
of contemplation why don't you contemplate more because you're lazy
you don't want to you just want to believe you
just want to be given the answer you just want
the conclusions of other people's contemplations you don't want to
contemplate anything for yourself you don't want to actually go
through a mathematical proof you just want a trick to
get the answer that's laziness and believing will be a
huge obstacle there will be a strong tendency just to
say okay Leo I got it I gotta believe you
I'm just gonna trust you I got it I know
you're right I just know you're right okay I got
it that's good enough but it's not good enough that
does nothing for you believing me not believing me agreeing
with me not agree it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
not when we're talking about going and using these ideas
to transform your life that's the biggest mistake that happens
with all religious traditions the biggest mistake is that people
mistake having a direct experience of something like God with
a belief and they think that well I believe that
it's good enough I mean the direct experience yeah I
know I could have one I know it's gonna take
a long time so I'll just I'll just believe it
it's not good enough Lee I mean I'm gonna die
anyways and I'm gonna I'll get there eventually anyways so
I'll just believe it as if that's gonna help you
or like with morality this is a big problem with
morality people start to believe in morality and they say
well well I mean Leo the greatest sages and mystics
they have all come down and they told us that
we need to not lie and not cheat and not
kill and not in animals and all this sort of
stuff so I'm just gonna I believe them it sounds
like what they're saying sounds good and it sounds right
so I'm just gonna believe them I'm just gonna do
what they what they say what's wrong with that after
all I mean why do I need to go and
do all the stuff the Buddha did to get to
the same answers that he already gave me in a
book I'll just read the book and I'll just get
those answers I'll just believe them good enough right and
the answer of course is not even close not even
close believing a thing doesn't doesn't show you why it's
true and it often has the exact opposite effect because
what happens is that you put a thin veneer of
fake belief on top but underneath is your actual all
your behavior patterns that are hardwired into your subconscious mind
and those are usually the exact opposite of your noble
flimsy little veneer of of ideals and beliefs so while
you might believe as an ideal that lying and cheating
and stealing and killing is bad and all this sort
of stuff but then in practice your entire psyche is
functioning completely the opposite and now you've created this this
rift inside of you or psyche you have these ideals
and beliefs here that are very noble but then in
your life you behave like a animal and then you
have to go through these mental gymnastics to justify all
this stuff and make sense of it and it's just
it's a big mess and it really holds you back
and then you feel guilty about it you thought you
start to hide it from yourself and from other people
you start to lie about it so that just that
just doubles your sin right there in these videos I
talk a lot about my conclusions a lot of the
stuff that I share is conclusions from my own investigations
and of course a lot of stuff that I've read
from other people and learned from other teachers so by
no means am i originating all these ideas myself but
if I'm not originating them still I'm doing some work
to piece them together in my mind so you don't
need to originate every single idea that's not what I'm
saying but you do need to to work at it
to put the pieces together and to try to work
towards directly experiencing the thing that's being pointed at by
the teachings by the words you need to follow the
words and the concepts to the thing being pointed to
and that is an active process that's the difference between
hearing a truth and deriving a truth for yourself and
this is a ridiculously important point that you take on
is the attitude in life and especially with this work
and everything that I teach the attitude should be that
you are gonna take ownership of deriving these things for
yourself in exactly the same way that you would if
you want it to be a good math student you're
not gonna get A's in math class well actually maybe
you can you actually could you could get a's in
math class just by shuffling symbols around and getting good
at shuffling symbols but my point is is that you're
not gonna have an actual deep understanding of mathematics without
going through the process of going through the proofs and
seeing the mechanics and the logic of it for yourself
it's not going to be enough just to to hear
a teacher talking about it you have to go through
it and see why it's true in the same way
that the original inventors of those mathematical concepts derived those
math how did they invent it they didn't pull it
out of their ass they they had to go through
the process they had to trace the truth with their
mind and that's what you have to do here and
if you just go and you look up the answers
in the back of the book or you take the
answers that I told you which is the equivalent of
that you are doing yourself a great disservice because the
transformation the thing you want from listening to this is
gotten not from listening to me but from listening to
me and then going and deriving it for yourself and
tracing the truth with your own mind for yourself which
is why if you ever wonder why or Zen teachers
such and they speak in riddles and they don't tell
me the answers that I want to hear this is
why because of this problem and this problem becomes especially
problematic when it comes to consciousness work and enlightenment work
because to be given the answer is almost the greatest
disservice because as soon as they give you the answer
you think you've got the answer you think you understand
when really you don't understand and then you these answers
fill your mind and then that actually is like a
step backwards even though to you it seems like it's
a step forwards the problem is that people are lazy
and that nobody wants to derive anything for themselves and
that's why religion is so prevalent and that's why morality
is so prevalent because they just don't want to derive
it for themselves they don't understand the significance of this
entire topic that I have spent an hour here now
almost now we're talking about so the reason I'm belaboring
this point talking about it in such great length is
because it's a very very big trap and don't think
that you have to be a religious nutcase to fall
into this trap you will fall into this trap regardless
you might be the most intelligent person in the world
the most well-meaning person in the world you start to
get into a little bit deeper consciousness work and you
will fall into this trap many many many times which
is why I'm stressing it so much here imagine being
a lion who never hunts imagine a line who just
sits ad at a cafe under the table and just
begs for scraps from people what kind of line would
you be if you took on that kind of attitude
towards life you would be a lion because you wouldn't
learn how to hunt and that's exactly the situation here
for a human being our power is not with our
with our claws and our teeth it's not with our
animal-like hunting abilities it's with your mind we are conceptual
creatures and we live or die by the concepts in
our mind and how we learn to use our mind
and all the ways in which the mind can be
easily misused and the biggest problem is that people get
lazy about it they don't realize this they start to
take this stuff for granted society these days makes it
very easy to take to take concepts like these for
granted because they aren't strictly necessary you can survive without
them you'll just survive and you'll have a very ordinary
mediocre existence and you'll suffer a lot you won't even
know why but but if you really want to thrive
and you want to get to your full potential in
life then you need to learn how to hunt not
with your claws but with your mind and the way
you hunt with your mind is by contemplating by deriving
these truths for yourself so how do you increase your
degree of comprehension remember there's really two lessons that I
want you to take away from this two high level
lessons from this episode one is that there are many
degrees of comprehension to every single insight which makes it
very worthwhile to dig deeper into every single one and
the second point that you got to derive some of
these truths and insights for yourself and that that's also
very worthwhile and that's in fact where most the growth
lies so how do you increase the depth of comprehension
as follows start taking ideas more seriously don't take them
as mere philosophy or mere ideas ideas can be very
powerful things start to seek out true understanding rather than
results don't focus on results don't focus on fixing a
particular problem you have seek to understand the situation to
really understand it means that you you know how the
mechanics of it come together and how they work and
why they work so that's a that's a change in
your attitude that's a change in your intentions to all
of your problems in life most people they don't go
into their problems with a desire for true understanding it's
like why am i depressed well I don't care about
that just fix my depression or just like why can't
I get laid well I don't care about that let
just help me get laid no no let's have you
understand the situation the problem and also the solution from
that you'll get everything else that you want and the
next step is of course contemplation go watch my video
about contemplation it teaches you how to contemplate and start
contemplating on a regular basis and like I said contemplation
is just ask yourself questions about a topic make sure
that you're working the ramifications and the you're thinking about
what a topic really means what are the consequences of
it if it's true be careful about assuming that you've
got it that you've figured it out usually with these
sorts of topics if you think you've got it that's
the first sign that you don't got it always assume
that there is a deeper level a deeper degree of
comprehension this becomes a huge trap for people especially people
doing non-duality work they get a glimpse here or there
and they think they got it no you don't got
you don't got this thing goes a million miles deeper
you've barely scratched the surface also start to interconnect everything
start to look at things from the big-picture perspective from
a holistic perspective start to see everything interconnected and start
to separate out the trivial from the cosmically significant so
when you're hearing somebody talk are teaching you something you're
reading something in a book you should get very good
at developing this skill of like wait a minute is
this a cosmically a significant point or is this a
trivial point and make sure you make that distinction and
the cosmically significant points those are the ones you really
want to put a lot of your energy and attention
on so that's how you increase your degrees of comprehension
remember that in this work derivation and contemplation are not
optional things they are mandatory that's what the work involves
that's why we call it work if you try to
shortcut that then you're just not gonna see the kind
of results that you hear people talking about that you
hear me talking about that you see some other people
talking about the deepest wisdom comes in tight simple packages
which makes it deceptively simple which makes it very easy
to be arrogant to say oh I got this I
figured it out what you got to do is you
got to you got to learn how to spot the
wisdom how to spot these tight little packages and and
then you got to get good unpacking them not as
a chore but that this is actually this is actually
this can be an enjoyable process this doesn't have to
be a chore derivation doesn't have to be a chore
that's the end if you liked this episode make sure
you click that like button for me and come check
out actualize that org this is my website check out
my blog check out the forum come talk with people
there get ideas get inspired get help get advice I'm
on there a lot I answer lots of people's questions
come look at my book list read the books on
my book list check out the life purpose core she'll
change your life and a final thing that I'll say
is that I hope you understand how these videos are
supposed to work they're supposed to work as follows these
videos are desert which means that you spend your whole
week doing your homework doing exercises working on yourself meditating
contemplating reading books da da da da da doing all
that stuff and then at the end of the week
on Sunday you get your dessert you get some high-level
just gushin commentary dissecting in some analysis that's what I
do you get that for me and then that's cool
that inspires you they get to some ideas gives you
some new directions to go on and then next week
you go and you follow up on that and you
keep doing the stuff you've been doing before and then
you build on that like that in the next week
you get another piece of dessert which is the next
episode so you see um be careful not to glut
yourself with desert desert desert desert desert but no work
no homework no follow-through that's going to be a problem
if you do that you're gonna turn this work into
a tool of the devil and that's very easy to
do very easy to do religion is all about that
is turning this work into a tool of the devil
and how does that happen by just starting to believe
stuff getting lazy and not deriving anything for yourself not
tracing anything with your mind not actually transforming yourself just
believing a bunch of and then you're still a devil
on the inside just now with a little glossy coding
veneer on the outside and now you think you're not
the devil but actually this now this little veneer gives
you just enough justification to be an even bigger devil
than you were without it so watch out and stay
with me for more in the future you
