hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the lower versus the
higher self you are like a light switch meaning that
you have basically two modes on which you can run
on and off or in other words the lower self
and the higher self what is the lower self the
lower self is who you are when you're fearful when
you're mean when you're petty when you're untruthful when you're
selfish the higher self is when you're calm when you're
kind noble generous truthful and selfless and in the human
organism if we think of the human organism as a
machine it's like you have this switch and the switch
can be flipped at any time and can send you
from the regular place that you're at which is usually
the higher self it can send you down into the
lower self and this is really the difference between the
animal inside you and the human inside you the lower
self is like the animal the Beast although in a
sense it's kind of a slight and a slander on
animals to say that because it's interesting you know with
the human organism the human is capable of being like
hyper human and embodying everything that's the most noble about
humanity when you're in your highest self but when you're
in your lowest self it's like the flip opposite of
that 180 degrees and in fact you're much worse than
an animal and the things that a human being does
from the lower self are really damaging both to the
individual who does it but also to the people around
that person and also to society at large right and
most of the issues and problems that we have in
in society any like really serious problems we have in
our own personal lives often come from the fact that
this switch gets flipped and we're not conscious to the
fact that the switch is getting flipped so I want
to talk a little bit about that here right now
and I'm going to give you two key insights here
in this episode and the first key insight is the
following there is a boundary between the lower and the
higher self and this boundary is something that you probably
have never thought about and you're totally unconscious of but
here's the insight this boundary is being threatened when you
are threatened you go into your lower self and the
crazy thing is that this happens for most people unconsciously
they're not aware that this is going on and that
creates a lot of problems I want to give a
credit to eben pagan for introducing me to this insight
here it's a very very powerful and rare insight that
most people do not make in their lives and this
creates all sorts of problems which is why it's so
important so think about this if you're making a decision
from your lower self chances are it's going to be
a disastrous decision also if you're trying to take some
action in your life from the lower self it's probably
going to be a disastrous action or behavior and if
you're making some sort of plans for your life or
setting goals for your life from a position of the
lower self and that's going to be a disastrous plan
that you're making so why is this issue important well
for these reasons because we don't want you making bad
decisions bad behaviors and bad plans right and um you
know people who really screw their is up um one
of the most common ways is this issue right here
something happens they get pissed off or they get really
afraid they get threatened in some way they get sent
down from their usual high self which is you know
nice and then they get sent down to this mean
petty brutal person and then they do something or say
something that they really regret and can never take back
and then this destroys their life and really you know
that could happen once or twice but it's really bad
when it keeps happening repeatedly and you don't understand that
it's going on with you and the crazy thing is
that you can be a very intelligent person and still
not be conscious and aware of the fact that this
is happening to you so there's a distinction to be
made here between intelligence which is one thing which is
not really that important but on the other hand like
emotional intelligence and awareness which is completely crucial to the
results that you get in your life so when we
say that the the threat that you experience sends you
from a higher solvent to the lower self what are
we talking about well clearly we're obviously talking about physical
danger if you get into a situation where you are
in physical danger for example maybe you're driving your car
and then all of a sudden something happens and you
you realize that oh [ __ ] you're you're really
in trouble here in the next couple of seconds right
you had one of those moments while driving even if
something bad happens to you ultimately still you sense that
physical danger and all of a sudden it sends you
into that flight-or-fight response right it's a physical threat so
that's obvious stuff or if you know if there's someone
stalking you in a dark parking lot then you're going
to sense that you're in physical danger and you're going
to get flipped into your lower self but what's interesting
is that there's a there's also triggers that are more
subtle and these are the ones you really got to
watch out for because the physical danger stuff you know
most of us aren't really always like in physical danger
that's a rare situation that happens to us and actually
a lot of times you know we respond fine to
that the problem is when you start responding or just
reacting from your lower self to some of these other
threats so here's some categories for you so for example
money a whole category of threats can be subsumed under
that so money threats there's triggers there that could trigger
you right so what do you do if you're going
broke you feel like someone's going to steal some money
from you or you feel like you're not going to
be able to make more money in the future something
like that how about family triggers the family category huge
how many of us are triggered by stuff relating to
our family that we don't like you know what we're
going to see that person we're going to have to
talk to this person I'm going to have to negotiate
something there and those triggers send us into the lower
self also intimate relationships is a huge category career is
a huge category reputation is a huge category think about
situations where your reputation is on the line and that's
a trigger for sending you into your lower self or
also think about belief systems think about if you hold
a religion or you have religious dogmas or if you
have some sort of scientific background or you have scientific
dogmas and beliefs and you have to defend all that
and whenever those come under threat then you feel like
you have to defend and when you're doing that defending
you're dropping into your lower self so the question is
are you aware of what triggers you to cross this
boundary the the idea of this entire episode is very
simple right it's just that there's this boundary and you're
crossing it and this boundary is just a threat but
you need to actually get mindfulness and awareness around this
in your own life and you need to see what
are the individual idiosyncratic triggers that you personally have because
each of us has a unique constellation of triggers that
send us into this kind of fear mode the question
is what is that for you you need to start
identifying that and getting more and more clear about it
and one of the best ways is just maybe to
keep a journal or a diary and any time that
you actually do get sent down into your lower self
and you later notice it you write down the situation
so maybe you come home after work and you're you're
in a conversation with your spouse and you you two
are talking about something and all of a sudden some
issue comes up and it's like that's the issue that
triggers you to go from higher self to lower self
what of that is maybe it's money maybe it's the
in-laws maybe it's you know the discussion about having a
children or maybe it's about you know some religious view
usually what would happen is that you would just get
sucked in to the lower self and not even realize
that that's what happened you just how you to just
have a big argument and you'd kind of know why
it happened but on the other hand you didn't really
understand why it happened right and from that lower self
maybe you did something nasty or stupid or mean that
then ruined your relationship so that's just one example right
I'm sure you can fill in the blanks and come
up with your own examples of how this works so
you need to start to do this work of actually
identifying this stuff not just taking it as a theory
because as a theory you know this is nice but
when you identify it that's when it really hits home
to you when you actually see it in action and
here's the second key insight that I want to give
you here what's the actual mechanism by which this lower
self gets activated sure there's this boundary you get threatened
but how is it actually happening what happens when you're
in your lower self this key insight came from my
meditation retreat what I wish I just done came back
from and what I noticed there was something very interesting
first of all I heard the facilitator talking about the
emotional body and he said a very curious thing which
really piqued my interest he said that one of the
most important ways in which mindfulness can help us as
human beings in everyday life is to make us more
aware how our emotional body revs up and that may
be very curious and in fact he said that the
way he designed his whole system and the way that
he uses the language to explain mindfulness to make certain
distinctions in your mind his whole model for mindfulness was
basically kind of you know one facet of it was
designed in such a way that it would help you
to be able to identify this within yourself while it's
happening and I didn't quite you know I kind of
intellectually understood what he meant but I didn't get like
an experiential sense of what he meant until I was
meditating and I was meditating outside for most of the
retreat next to this little nice beautiful wooden chapel just
like this small little private chapel and there was a
bench and I was sitting outside and it was this
place kind of near the woods so there's a lot
of insects flying around and I was sitting there meditating
for the whole week and what I noticed is that
there's a man there's a lot of wasps flying around
me and at first it just kind of see like
I'll just you know random wasps here and there that's
normal but then I looked around as I was you
know setting up my bench one morning and I discovered
that oh [ __ ] there's a there's a wasp
nest right behind me as I'm sitting on my bench
and it's kind of near the ground and I'm sitting
on this balcony and no wonder all these wasps are
flying around me when I'm meditating it's because I'm sitting
in their flight path it's like they're flying to and
from their home and I'm like right in the middle
of it sitting there trying to meditate but you know
it was a beautiful spot so I wanted to keep
the spot didn't want to move and what I did
is I just said okay I'm just going to kind
of deal with it I'm gonna sit through it but
the very interesting thing that happened to me is that
see the problem is that the emotional body revs up
inside of you probably many times a day in your
life but you don't actually notice it you're not mindful
enough you don't have enough awareness this is a muscle
that needs to be developed so when I was sitting
there I got a really interesting kind of science experiment
just fall on my lap because I was sitting there
and I was meditating and I was good getting into
a place record I could really totally calm myself down
and if you ever get into that kind of meditative
place where you calm yourself completely and you get a
real clear sense of what's going on in your body
emotionally like you get in touch with all the different
sensations in your body what you're going to notice is
that there's a very clear and palpable sense like oh
I'm relaxed and everything is normal and cool and I
can just be calm and you notice that there's like
a lack of any kind of churning emotions or any
kind of like churning sensations in the stomach or in
the chest or any kind of like tingling sensations in
in your limbs stuff like that but then when a
threat presents itself and this is actually the interesting thing
here because usually when you're meditating you don't get threatened
very often but this was interesting because the wasp as
I meditated with my eyes open the wasp flies by
my face and I can't help but go into an
emotional reaction even though like I'm not doing it consciously
it just happens to me right because in humans were
hard-wired to have phobias of spiders and snakes and and
various insects so this was very curious because I was
sitting there and I was totally peaceful and calm but
then this wasp just flies and hovers near me and
all of a sudden I can see like holy [
__ ] my emotional body just lit up like a
Christmas tree right I could see it it's like it's
like it's getting going and getting going and getting going
right and it starts as like a sensation in your
lower abdomen and then maybe it moves up into your
chest and maybe your your hands and feet get involved
and your limbs get involved and then your mind gets
triggered and your mind starts flashing pictures to you of
a wasp like biting you in the eye or you
know biting your eyeball out or landing on the back
your neck when you're meditating and and stinging you multiple
times in a row or something like that right you
start getting these like fantasies of a killer wasp out
hunting for you or maybe the whole family of wasp
is going to come join this one wasp and they're
all going to sting you to death that's literally what
your mind starts coming up with once the emotional body
revs up more and more and more and what's fascinating
is if you ever get the chance to just sit
there and watch how your emotional body revs up and
then also revs back down and then revs back up
and then revs back down then you start to really
get this sense like oh man this is a really
important skill to develop is this ability to to sense
when this emotional body is doing what now I was
sitting there this was like a perfect science experiment because
I was sitting there and almost like this lab setting
where I could isolate the variables the problem is that
most people in their lives they don't get this kind
of opportunity and in fact just the other day I
was sitting and doing some work right and only because
I've been meditating a lot over the last couple of
weeks after I finished the work and I just took
a little break sat down on the couch I realized
lies holy [ __ ] I was just working for
50 minutes and my entire emotional body was like lit
up like a Christmas tree but I wasn't really aware
of it until I just came out of that work
session and into my break and now I've my prime
sitting here trying to practice a little bit of mindfulness
and now I can actually see like oh man there's
all this like emotional weird emotional sensation happening in my
in my lower abdomen and I can really feel it
and it's there and it's not that easy to just
let it all go I actually have to sit there
and practice meditation for maybe two or three minutes just
to start to get it to rev down and rev
down and rub down and kind of just put me
into a really nice calm even grounded place now that's
something that you get when you do meditation practice and
mindfulness practice which is what most people are missing out
on right they think that meditation is just going to
give them you know something or some calming of the
mind but they don't understand that they're going to get
these critical distinctions that now you can apply to places
in your life right and it's like a muscle you
have to build up this mindfulness muscle so what I'm
talking about here this this inside of the emotional body
revving up I don't mean that just as soon as
it revs up that instantly you're in your lower self
usually what happens that it revs up and you're still
cool but then it revs up a little bit more
and a little bit more a little bit more and
after a certain point you know it revs up enough
that it it just kind of like becomes this some
this snowball that's rolling down the hill and it's totally
lost control it's turn into an avalanche which is now
this powerful thing is unstoppable and that's when you're in
your lower self when that avalanche you know when that
snowball turns into an avalanche and so why mindfulness is
so powerful in meditation is such a powerful practice is
that you can start to see when the snowball starts
rolling when it's still a little baby snowball before it
turns into an avalanche and you can prevent it from
becoming an avalanche not even by trying to control it
necessarily by just simply by observing it it's crazy that
just simply observing what's happening in your emotional body is
enough to make it dissipate and go away whereas when
you're not observing it and you don't even know that
this is happening inside you what happens there tends to
be this just runaway effect and you just get blindsided
by this thing so one thing I recommend is that
if you do have a hornet's nest near your house
then go try this out this is a really cool
experiment go try meditating outside and make sure you're sitting
there with your eyes wide open so you can see
all the wasps flying around you maybe you want to
even put some some food for them that they can
come near you right and just see how your emotional
body revs up it's a really cool exercise to do
but also you know not everyone has a hornet's nest
near them so a little hard to engineer that all
right so that's the two key insights now you might
ask okay I get the theory now what do I
do with this Leo well here are some action steps
for you number one is make sure that you make
a commitment right now and for the rest of your
life - never make decisions when you're in your lower
self now of course this implies that you have the
ability to be aware of when you're actually in your
lower self so what that means in practice if you
want to actually honor this commitment is that you have
to build your awareness muscles so that you can see
when that line is actually crossed and when you do
step down into your lower self there's a couple of
ways you can do this one way is to just
let it happen to you and you're only going to
be able to tell after the fact right so maybe
your spouse says something nasty to you and that sends
you into your lower self and you don't realize it
for a day and you have this huge blowout argument
with your spouse but then you know the next day
in the morning you realize like oh [ __ ]
I got sent into my lower self and I didn't
even realize it but at least I realize it now
okay so that's how it happened and you kind of
retrace your steps so there's that way that's kind of
like the trial and error approach you know not the
best way but that one works for four people in
a pinch so you can use that you got to
remember though to do that right otherwise you're going to
forget maybe keep a journal or a log of all
these incidents that happen to you of crossing the line
so that's one way another way is just practicing more
meditation another way might be doing this wasp this wasp
experiment that I told you right so there's there's multiple
little techniques you can you can employ to do this
the other thing you should do as an action step
is make a commitment to disengage from people when you're
in your lower self we don't want you making decisions
when you're in your lower self we also don't want
you engaging with people why not because probably you're not
going to have something nice to say when you're in
your lower self probably going to be a dick probably
you're going to be a [ __ ] probably you're
going to say something nasty probably you're not going to
really be generous or magnanimous or very truthful or very
honest right probably gonna be quite selfish so all these
things we'd like to avoid in our lives because there's
a lot of bad fallout that comes from behaving that
way so one simple solution is just to disengage from
people and actually you can tell them Hey I'm in
my lower self right now so I don't want to
engage you so maybe you know your spouse is talking
to you you guys are in the middle of a
conversation and you're sensing that it's getting heated and you
sense that oh I just crossed the line and if
you have enough of awareness of that then you can
just tell your spouse hey you know let's just cut
this conversation off right now um I'm going to go
you know watch some TV for an hour because I
sense that I just got triggered into my lower self
and I don't want to say or do something that
I'm going to regret and just actually say that to
your spouse and just see what happens you'll probably get
a much better reaction than you normally would right or
if you're engaging with your boss at work with your
employees same kind of deal right as soon as you
sense yourself getting triggered into your lower self find a
way just to distract yourself to not have to deal
with that situation right there so that you can just
take a little bit of time off your emotional body
can rev down and then you can come back clear-headed
and deal with the situation in a more empowering way
so make that commitment to also practice mindfulness of the
emotional body revving up this is a more subtle thing
than actually crossing the line and this is something you
can do on a daily basis just after you know
go go work for a couple of hours and then
get off of work and then just come come sit
on your couch or sit in a chair at your
office and just meditate for five minutes and just see
calm yourself down and just see where were you ad
before and where are you at now what you're probably
going to notice that you're so stressed during the day
and you don't even notice that you're stressed because it
just becomes like you know like you're a fish and
water you don't notice the water it's only when you
calm yourself down and actually put yourself into a meditative
state you can actually finally realize by way of contrast
like oh damn I was stressed for two hours and
only now I can realize why I was stressing the
fact that it's happening somewhere in my body and you're
going to get more and more experience with that and
then you're going to get better and better mindful this
muscles so that's a that's a good way to to
practice that another thing you should do is change the
structure of your life if you need to to remove
the triggers that send you into a threat mode so
if you're living in a part of town where there's
gangs and violence then you probably not don't understand it
there and get accustomed to that you probably actually want
to go and change your neighborhood or you know if
you're living in some third-world country where there is some
some safety issues and you feel like you're in physical
harm you probably want to change your location or maybe
change where your house is positioned something like that maybe
get some stronger locks on your door I mean it's
okay to actually go out and take some action to
fix this stuff right it's not just all mental but
also you know beyond the physical danger stuff you need
to get more awareness around the triggers that you have
so money family relationships you know all that stuff we
talked about career your reputation and once you know those
triggers then you got to actually change the structure of
your life to remove the worst triggers because if you're
living your life in this way where you're constantly triggered
by these things all the time and that's just a
function of the environment that you've created for yourself then
you know what you know all the personal development in
the world is not going to really help you because
you do need to work on these triggers so maybe
you have a boss that's always yelling at you and
berating you at work and maybe that's always sending you
into your lower self because you always feel threatened when
he's yelling at you okay well you probably want to
consider changing jobs or moving to another department at work
right that's what I would call a structural change to
your life but before you can do that first you
need to recognize what are the triggers so the last
action that I want you to take is go get
some coaching or some therapy or if you can't afford
that then sit down and really do some serious journaling
yourself and ask yourself this question what are the most
common triggers for me that send me into my lower
self that's the key question for you and this might
be something you can sit down and think about right
now and come up with some examples but also it
might be something you gotta actually do over the weeks
and months because you're probably not going to be aware
of these triggers until they actually start happening to you
and now you know these ideas that I've talked to
you about right now you have these distinctions which you
didn't have before so sit down and slowly progressively make
this list of triggers so you know what they are
and you know you can get coaching on those and
get therapy on those you can go buy some self-help
books that will help you to deal with those you
basically have to unwire them which you're going to discover
that a lot of those triggers they probably go back
far into your past the roots of that trigger stem
all the way back you know to your childhood somewhere
maybe to your earliest memories or maybe to the dysfunctional
relationship you had with your mother or with your father
or with your sister or your brother or something like
that that's usually what it is and you know those
can involve some work to unwire that's why therapy is
so popular because therapy does that that's why coaching is
popular because coaching helps you to do that and it
can be difficult to unwire or trigger like that all
by yourself because usually what happens is that you're so
sucked into the trigger that again you're like a fish
and water you don't notice that this trigger is actually
not a part of you is kind of like an
artificial dysfunctional part of you so a lot of times
it helps a third person to look at your situation
to kind of give you some guidance which is why
therapy or coaching can be so effective but you can
do it yourself if you're very determined all right so
that's it those are action steps go ahead and do
this and I will see you soon this is Leo
