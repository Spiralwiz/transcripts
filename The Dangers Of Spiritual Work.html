[Music] in this episode I want to talk a bit
more off-the-cuff than usual about some of the dangers of
actualised org and just the general dangers of doing this
work that we're doing I'm talking about the dangers of
taking personal development to the existential level to the metaphysical
level to the spiritual level so many of you are
following along you're listening to me talking about enlightenment awakening
you're listening to me talk about the Buddha or meditation
or yoga some of this sort of stuff and I
get the sense that you're not really aware of what
you're getting yourself into and so it can be good
to talk about this and that's what we're gonna cover
today so what are the dangers of actualized org sometimes
I get criticized for my teachings being dangerous that's right
but you have to understand that the very nature of
these teachings is like what are we really doing here
with these teachings we're not merely talking about how to
make money or how to attract a a partner or
how to improve some aspect of your life like your
health and so forth this is ordinary sort of boilerplate
self-improvement of course I've covered those topics a lot in
the past and this is kind of a sort of
a self-improvement which isn't very threatening to people you know
this is sort of a Tony Robbins style self-improvement it's
great you know I started off I cut my teeth
on Tony Robbins nothing against them it's it's useful it's
very useful but there's a deeper level there is the
existential level that we're talking about and then you get
into spirituality then you start to learn about non-duality and
Awakening and enlightenment and all this and that's when it
gets a little bit more tricky because there the teachings
actually do have certain dangers I've talked about this to
some extent in the past I have an episode about
ego backlash go check that out understanding the ego backlash
I believe it's it's titled and I have another another
episode called the dark side of meditation where I also
cover some of this stuff but there's more that needs
he said so on this path if you're pursuing awakening
you have to understand that awakening is not for most
people you have to really question why you're pursuing awakening
and the more I pursue awakening myself the more I
study it as well the more I interact with other
people and read their stories of how they've awoken or
failed to awaken and the problems that have come from
that and the ordeals and difficulties and obstacles that they
encountered one of the things that I realize that Awakening
is extremely unique the spiritual path is totally unique to
you because it has to deal with your own fears
limiting beliefs neuroses traumas that you suffer through and I
think even beyond that of course it also have to
deal with your own it has it take into account
your own personality has taken into account even your genetics
and your physiology has to take all of that into
account I like for example with the spiritual process might
be different for an introvert than for an extrovert that
doesn't mean that an extrovert can't become awakened I'm not
saying that I'm just saying it's different different techniques might
resonate with different types of personalities but it goes even
deeper than that ultimately what needs to happen is you
need to be able to fully surrender yourself when we're
talking to the deepest levels of awakening and then you
need to be able to embody that and to really
let go of all of your personal [ __ ]
whatever that is all that personal [ __ ] that
you've accumulated throughout your entire history in this lifetime a
lot of it goes back to your childhood traumas and
how you were raised you know what kind of ideologies
were fed into your mind was it Christianity was it
Islam was it some materialistic atheism was it skepticism was
the cynicism you know all that stuff now you're you're
having to question all those ideologies it's gonna be different
for for everybody depending on where you were born what
time you were born culture you were born in what
kind of parents you had did they abused you how
did they punish you how did they reward you they
withhold love from you that did you get enough love
when you were a child or not and did you
get bullied in school and all of this right so
all this makes this journey very personal first of all
but second of all there's an even deeper layer and
that is the one that I think honestly I think
most people that are alive right now are not ready
for awakening they just they won't their psyche or we
might even say their soul is not ready to surrender
materialistic existence that's most people on this planet there seems
to be and I'm sort of speculating here but there
seems to be a sort of a logic to how
living beings evolved through life by which I mean that
literally there's a sort of a a series of incarnations
that consciousness goes through from lower life-forms to higher life-forms
and then beyond and it really seems to me that
most human beings who are alive right now it's not
the case that all human beings are on the same
level and that they're all equally capable of awakening and
that they're all equally developed and they're all equally willing
to discover the truth or to even care about the
truth no it's just that doesn't explain it the majority
of mankind are in such a low state of consciousness
that even if you show them the truth even if
you show them God even if you show them some
of the stuff that I've talked about they won't be
able to handle it because it's not right for them
yet it's not their time yet maybe they need to
live through ten more lifetimes before they finally realize they
become conscious enough to see that really the highest way
to live life is not materially and I'm saying this
not as somebody who's completely above material existence but actually
the opposite I'm saying it because I still feel within
myself various materialistic attachments that I have sometimes to money
sometimes to sex sometimes to whatever right and I see
that I have a very clear vision of like what
it would mean to be fully fully awake and to
be able to embody that to live from God consciousness
all the time but it's it's a beautiful incredible vision
of what I could become and of course what anybody
could become nothing special about me in this regard but
but then in trying to actualize that I also see
all of the Buddhists called call them defilements that I
have and all of the spiritual purification work that needs
to happen a lot of disciplining of myself and purifying
myself in various ways purifying my mind purifying my body
and and all this purifying my diet purifying the the
new sources that I watched the way I entertain myself
you know what do i what do i do for
entertainment and relaxation like all of this stuff and so
really they have some good models and theories about this
in buddhism and also in the yogic systems you know
like for example in the yogic systems they talked about
if you consider seven chakras you've got your base chakras
which is you know starting from the very bottom of
your spine going upwards you know your your first chakra
chakra one corresponds to your most basic needs like your
knees to defecate and your needs to just be physically
safe and just like very earthy type of needs you
know basic basic survival needs without which you couldn't even
be an organism and then you know you move up
to second chakra second chakra would be your sort of
genital area it's responsible for that of course controlling your
sex drive so if you're for example a person who's
addicted to sex all the time and you just you
can't get sex out of your mind and it's just
this constant thing that's always like your whole life is
dominated by and the need for sex in the pursue
love sex and you you invest thousands of hours into
this you know planning how to get more sex and
you know all this sort of stuff if that's what
your life is about then you're kind of like living
at that shock or two level and that's kind of
like where you are in this life time and then
you can evolve beyond that to chakra 3 which is
more of your your navel area and then you know
that corresponds to certain things as well and then so
you kind of move up and you move on to
the heart chakra or the throat chakra and then you
know the third eye and then ultimately the crown which
corresponds jilt and liberation and I guess you could say
to total Buddha nature total God realization so that's an
interesting model it's it's it's pretty useful as far as
talking about this see so a lot of people are
stuck people who get into the self-help they're stuck at
those let's say those first three chakras so teachings which
are talking about the higher chakras they fall on deaf
ears it's like in one ear and out the other
or even if they resonate with you to some degree
you're so stuck on your lower chakras that you can't
really actualize the higher ones maybe you can you know
take a psychedelic and it'll show you a peak experience
of a shock or six or chakra seven you know
some visionary mystical state or full non-dual God consciousness you
get that on a powerful psychedelic that's great but then
you fall right back down into chakra - and you're
addicted to sex and you're addicted to junk food and
you're addicted to porn and you're addicted to TV and
whatever else you youtube these days I get us I
guess it is with you guys but hey you know
I'm guilty of that too I don't I don't actually
have a TV but uh but I so watch my
little bit of YouTube so anyways the point of all
this is that you know some of you I get
the sense that when you hear me talking about awakening
so much then you get interested in awakening simply because
I'm talking about it and then it's like you get
this sense that well the point of my life is
to awaken everybody needs to awaken and that's not quite
right that's a mistake first of all there's no there's
there's zero normativity behind awakening so never have I said
nor will I ever say that you must awaken and
that awakening is the one right path for everybody and
that there's a good reason for you to awaken there's
absolutely no reason whatsoever for you to awaken other than
that you want to you want to discover the truth
you care to experience God or you care to understand
reality if these things are interesting to you then pursue
awakening if you're tired of material existence and you feel
dissatisfied with it and you're looking for some way out
of the rat maze pursue awakening but if you just
entered the rat maze if you just started your material
existence and you're still not fed up with it and
maybe you're not really interested in truth like if you're
honest like do I care about the truth no I
mean Leo talks about it but I don't care about
it I would just care about like having a nice
career and having a nice family and having a nice
spouse and you know hanging out with the family and
just doing fun stuff and whatever like if that's honestly
what you are driven towards pursue that rather than lofty
metaphysical topics that I talk about see I talk about
these topics because I'm passionate about them because I care
about them because to me really my highest drive in
life is just understanding for its own sake I don't
really care about success I don't really care about money
I mean I do to some extent but all this
is secondary I don't really even care about living per
se I don't care about doing social stuff I don't
care about having a family I don't care about socializing
with people small talking with people you know going to
parties having cars and doing this and going on with
fancy vacations around the right I mean of course I
can enjoy these things and sometimes I do get a
little bit sidetracked by one or two of those things
you know I'm still interested in sex and so forth
but generally what I care about is understanding for its
own sake in the abstract right so that's my bias
you might not have that bias and the reason I
might have that bias like you don't know like you
don't know like if we take the sort of past
lives model seriously and I'm not saying that that it's
literally the case but you know it's an interesting theory
sort of like you have past lives and then you
live through these lives and in each life you experience
enough of it that some some wisdom some kernel of
wisdom is developed in that that kernel actually survives your
life until you know you then you incarnate into the
next life form and then from that one you're still
tapped into some of that old there's some of that
old residual wisdom that's left it's not a it's not
/ it's not like in some verbal form it's not
like you retain some some teaching that I told you
through this video in your next iPhone now so what
I mean I mean that overall once you've lived your
entire life you've you've sort of what happens is what
I notice is that you exhaust certain motivations and needs
have you noticed this in your own life for example
that like when you were younger maybe when you were
a teen or when you were in your twenties there
was something that you were super passionate about that was
so important to you whatever it was might have been
family might have been relationships might have been religion might
have been science might have been scepticism might have been
rationality might have been success might have been money might
have been health might have been working out whatever but
then you do that thing for five or ten years
and then you kind of just like get over it
and then one day it's almost like it's almost like
you've become a new person or a new being in
the sense that you've transcended that like you've gotten it
out of your system and you don't feel motivated by
that thing anymore like you as a certain point you've
earned enough money where it's like okay I've done that
I've done enough business to the point where starting a
new business doesn't excite me anymore it would just be
the same old thing I need something new to satisfy
my soul yeah maybe you've experienced this in some capacity
I think all of us do I think for some
people you can take them entire lifetime or it can
take them decades to get something out of their system
in some cases you might be so stuck on a
thing that you never get it out of your system
in this one lifetime like maybe you're so stuck on
sex that that's all you're concerned about and your whole
life will be devoted to that to the pursuit of
it and you're never going to get it out of
your system no matter how much sex you have in
this lifetime but from that process what I'm hypothesizing here
is that you could learn some sort of deeper Metta
lesson a lesson that goes beyond just this one lifetime
which will stick with you with your spirit let's say
if you want to say call it that such that
in your next incarnation you're not going to be so
driven by the six you're going to just quickly get
over it's not like you know you'll still have some
sex but it's like your life's not gonna be about
that it's gonna be a little side dish you know
a little garnish on the side whereas your main thing
in the next lifetime will be something more something deep
or something higher something more consciousness and then maybe from
that position you can then pursue awakening more seriously so
I want you to just to double check yourself are
you pursuing awakening because maybe you're just like a monkey
monkey see monkey do and you hear me talking about
it so much that you've just internalized this as some
goal that you need to have when in fact you
don't need to have it here you have to be
very honest with yourself this can be painful to admit
because maybe you've already invested a few years into meditating
and yoga and all this stuff and you've been pursuing
awakening but now I'm telling you like wait a minute
maybe that's not the thing you should be doing and
now of course that's kind of throwing a wrench into
your works and this could this could be this could
be feel threatening to you because you know you don't
to be robbed you know you you feel like you've
already been on this path and now you want to
go but it feels like now I'm taking that motivation
away from you making you doubt yourself well that's part
of this work a huge part of this work in
life is figuring out what you want from life what
are you really motivated to do sometimes a lot of
times actually because of the media we watch or because
the ideas we hear from our teachers professors our parents
our rabbis and our religious leaders and so forth we
get certain ideals into our minds like well I should
be a good person I should be like Christ I
should be like a Buddha I should become a monk
I should follow what Leo says I should awaken and
I should do all this stuff when really if you
were honest you would admit that I just want sex
I just want money I just want pleasure I just
want a big house with a fast car and I
want to go fly around the world and party and
do this sort of stuff see that can be hard
to admit in this sense ideals can be dangerous because
they can be inauthentic often our ideals where do we
get them from we just absorb them from our culture
and then we think that they're our own goals and
desires and motivations but actually they're not and it can
be difficult to admit to ourselves that wait a minute
this ideal that I've been chasing it's just been sort
of a fantasy that I picked up because you know
I went to ten years of Sunday School and you
know they drilled it into my mind that I need
to be christ-like and that sex is wrong see but
that's an inauthentic conditioning that you've been programmed with see
and you can spend your whole life kind of stuck
it like trying to be christ-like but it's like really
you're shooting above you're above your paygrade I guess you
might say we're mixing metaphors now but you're kind of
you're you're punching out of your weight class see because
if your level of development of consciousness and maturity is
like down here but you're trying to act all christ-like
it's actually gonna create huge problems because you're gonna in
your mind you can have this idea of trying to
be christ-like but you're always gonna fail to live up
to the idea that's gonna create a lot of suffering
for you and you're not gonna be confused cuz you
don't know like well what's wrong with me on something
I'm defective I'm broken I'm wrong you know why can't
I be christ-like and then maybe you look to some
monks who have done it and you say well why
can't I do what they are able to do and
the reason might be that you know they spent 30
lifetimes pursuing that whereas you are just you've been pursuing
it for two lifetimes but you're just not conscious that
right now and so it's actually totally normal that you're
struggling through this stuff because you don't know what those
monks suffered through and struggle through you know what the
Buddha went through what Christ went through how many how
many lifetimes did Christ lived through like you don't know
this stuff if we're gonna take this kind of past
Lies model seriously you don't know or if you wanna
if you don't like the past lives model and you
want to you know instead think of it in terms
of genetics you couldn't think of it in terms of
genetics it really doesn't matter like the details of it
like you can just make this all very scientific if
you like and you can just say well some people
are genetically inclined and predisposed to you know to have
a sort of personality type that makes them interested in
truth and metaphysical topics and spirituality and other people are
not you could couch it that way it doesn't really
matter what matters is for you to kind of discover
authentically what it is they that you want and then
to pursue that because otherwise what will happen is here's
where we kind of get to the the original topic
we kind of went on a tangent never coming back
of the dangers of this work when if I mean
if you're serious about awakening what you're talking about here
understand this is the most radical and hardcore thing you
can do okay so if my teachings seem dangerous yeah
because we're talking about life-and-death issues here we're talking about
the the software that is running your entire life and
not just that but beyond that we're literally talking about
the software that crew that that creates a sense of
physical reality for you so when I'm talking about awakening
we're talking about becoming conscious of all of that and
transcending all of that see this is very threatening for
most people this might mean the loss of friendships and
family connections this might mean you have to abandon your
family this might mean you have to abandon your business
this might mean you have to abandon your house this
might mean you have to abandon your country this might
mean you have to abandon your religion this might mean
you have to give up your your national identity and
this is still just the tip of the iceberg of
of what might be required here in the end you're
gonna have to give up your whole life basically for
this and if you're thinking well Leo then why would
I do it why would anybody do it well then
you're not ready you see if you're asking that question
you're not ready you don't have enough innate wisdom and
consciousness to realize why somebody would want to pursue the
truth despite all of those costs see if you were
really at a certain level of development and spiritual purity
you would want the truth no matter what see you
wouldn't be held back by these things you wouldn't be
so interested in these things you wouldn't be so attached
to these things you would want to know what the
truth is you'd want to know what God is you'd
want to know what life is you don't want to
know what reality is just for its own sake and
if you're not there then you're not there and it
would be good to admit it rather than to fake
it because if you're gonna fake it the problem is
is that look sometimes this path will get dark it
can get very dark if you're meditating a lot stuff
will come up issues will come up you'll have phases
where you're depressed you might have phases when you're suicidal
you might feel like life has lost all meaning you
might doubt yourself you might doubt whether this was the
right path to go down you might have mystical experiences
or you might take psychedelics and you might misinterpret what
is shown to you because you still have so much
ego and you're still working from the lower chakras let's
say and so maybe God is revealed to you but
because you have so much ego and you're working from
the lower chakras you will corrupt and misunderstand or misinterpret
remember because you're always sort of filtering any psychedelic experience
or any mystical experience you're having you're always interpreting it
the mind is still there and it's still interpreting through
your past experiences your personality you know through the filter
of who you are as a human you're interpreting all
that and then corruption can happen there have been cases
and in fact I have I have some books on
my book list in in one particular book the reason
I put on my book list in the spirituality subcategory
is because this entire book just explains the sort of
gut-wrenching experience of one woman who accidentally basically awoke without
even knowing what awakening is in her youth she did
some when she was like in her early 20s and
in her college days she did some some yoga practice
and she did some meditation so forth but when she
was doing it nobody really explained to her what awakening
is what non-duality is she did know anything that she
didn't really understand what God is there anything she didn't
have the enough theoretical foundation you know the kind of
stuff that we've built here with actualize that org if
you've been watching for a while she had none of
that she was just taught some meditation techniques and she
basically did that and then one day even after you
know she stopped doing them but then one day just
something clicked in her while she was walking down the
street and she awoke but this completely terrified her and
she thought that something had gone terribly wrong she thought
that she was broken and dysfunctional she thought she had
some sort of mental illness she spent the next 10
years going to therapists and doctors trying to fix herself
because you know she would go to a therapist or
a doctor and she would tell the doctor like I
don't have a sense of self there's no me it's
like I wasn't even born and the doctor would look
at her like she's crazy now of course she was
totally right the problem is though she didn't have the
right context she didn't have enough theory achill foundation and
she didn't have the kind of environment that could support
her in that because all the people she hung around
with including her doctors and therapists they were all clueless
about non-duality and Awakening and so you know it's probably
a little easier now because you can go online and
just google it this was probably before the age of
the internet where you could google this stuff easily but
eventually what happened was it it took her many years
and it was gut-wrenching you know she couldn't sleep she
had bad nightmares she was stressed she was anxious she
was like she couldn't lead a normal life for for
many years and it almost drove her nuts until eventually
by accident she she found some people you know some
meditators and some folks who knew about non-duality who actually
helped her out and gave her some guidance and helped
her to to recontextualize that sense of no self and
to make more sense of it and to realize that
there there's even deeper you can even go deeper into
that awakening and to realize not only is it no
self but it is the self the god self she
wasn't understanding that there's the god self in addition to
the no self really it's just another additional facet but
she was missing that facet she was missing other important
facets like the facet of love and so forth so
the reason I'm telling you this story is just because
so like this kind of stuff could happen that's one
example of the dangers here other dangers might include that
you get depressed and suicidal and then you actually act
that out and you know I've had some dark phases
in my journey and it's difficult sometimes you're all alone
and you've got nobody to talk to nobody who can
understand what you're going through nobody who can help you
that's all part of this path see like I said
at the beginning this is a hardcore path this is
the kind of path that you have to be sort
of up you have to be able to lead yourself
you have to you have to be able to figure
stuff out you have to be able to troubleshoot your
own problems you have to be able to think independently
you can't ultimately when you're trying to totally awaken you
can't rely on anybody to help you not even your
guru can help you you're gonna be totally alone at
the very end of it now don't worry once you
get past all the all the humps and so forth
it'll be it's wonderful so I'm not trying to discourage
you by telling you that Awakening is all negative and
bad it's not the problems that your ego is in
the way you see you have defilements you're operating from
lower chakras you're not spiritually purified and who knows how
much of that work you've got to do that's a
gut wrenching process this spiritual purification business and a lot
of it gets kind of not advertised by spiritual teachers
they make it seem like oh yeah you just sit
down you just meditate for a few weekends or you
do a few retreats and then BAM enlightened that's not
really how it works even when the so called spontaneous
instant total awakening happens who do you want to cite
Eckhart Tolle or Robin to Maharshi or something like this
you want to say Oh leo is spontaneous instead awakening
no work no effort no thousands of hours of meditation
nothing just BAM it happened no this is this is
a pipe dream it didn't just happen Eckhart Tolle was
at the brink of suicide he was gonna kill himself
by some fluke luck he awoke rather than killing himself
see so that's hardcore that's serious think about how many
people in our society rather than awakening they they do
kill themselves more than those who awaken I'll tell you
that that much see so that's not that's not a
very good path to take now I'm not saying this
to say that it has to be this way for
you I'm just saying that you know there's there's a
whole range a vast giant range of possibilities because you're
gonna have to conquer your own ego and what does
what does that entail for you for everybody it's different
you know for some people their ego is addicted to
alcohol and that's their biggest demon and they're gonna spend
the next 20 years conquering that struggling with it and
then you know for others like me for me alcohol
has absolutely zero appeal zero appeal like I just not
I don't care about alcohol I'm not attracted to it
whatsoever so for me it's so easy to stay away
from it but for some people is very difficult or
with sex or with money or with whatever you know
so what is that for you the problem is not
actually having an awakening experience per se that's almost the
easy part although it's still hard for most people the
problem is actually accepting the truth accepting it and then
not just intellectually accepting it although of course that is
still a problem for most people you know most people
for example they don't want to admit just something as
simple as the fact that your birth was imaginary with
that science is imaginary or that reality is imaginary most
people don't even want to admit this on an intellectual
level but even if you do it's not enough to
just admit that intellectually then you have to you have
to go to the next level you have to say
okay well now how do I need to change the
way that I live how do I need to change
my habits my thoughts and my emotions to align with
that truth you see because right now your habits actions
and emotions and your whole life is aligned with the
opposite truth it's aligned with the truth that reality is
real not imaginary and so that that's that's challenging see
you got to be you got to be able to
kind of guide yourself through this process now of course
you can rely on other people there are great teachers
out there and you know you can rely on certain
things that I say to help to guide you but
not too much you can't totally rely on the things
that I say or other teachers say because in the
end you gotta sort of figure this puzzle out for
yourself that's the that's the magic of life is that
nobody can really solve your puzzle for you we all
have our unique maze that we're running through like I
talked about in my life is a maze s ode
so you're gonna have to solve your own maze you
can't look at what I'm doing and then cheat the
way you know used to doing in first grade or
something you would cheat at your friends test you know
look at the answers then just copy them that doesn't
work because we're not all working on the same test
questions it's not so simple so yeah if you're gonna
go all the way be prepared for all sorts of
stuff that comes up inner demons definitely depression there will
be moments of that for sure for sure because you're
gonna have to come face to face with meaninglessness if
you're gonna awaken you can't avoid that because meaning is
what your ego projects in order to survive and to
do it's ego stuff meaning is imaginary and at some
point in your awakening process you're gonna have to accept
that all meaning is imaginary and created now to the
ego that's gonna feel very negative and bad it's not
actually negative it's not actually bad it just feels that
way and it's interpreted that way by the ego there
are a lot of pathologies in the awakening process and
I'll have an entire separate episode in the future where
I talk about the pathologies of awakening their pathologies pre
awakening and there are pathologies post awakening this is ways
in which see it's almost like the ego is one
of those horror film creatures where you like you've got
to kill it all the way to kill it because
if you just kill it half way it's still half
alive and you know it'll come in and it'll grab
you and it'll get you so that's the thing is
you know you have these awakenings but then usually there's
a closing down and there's a sort of a returning
a regression back to the lower chakras it's usually hard
for people to just kind of like go all the
way up to the top chakra and just just stay
there forever and never regress down usually it's a sort
of oscillating process of up and down up and down
and up and down it's gonna be very trying it
can be painful it can be uncomfortable for example you
can not only is this happening at the psychological level
physically things can happen to you you could have for
example Kundalini awakening energetic awakenings in your spine in your
body where like you can't sleep you're having nightmares you're
restless all the time you have too much energy or
you have too little energy or you know the opposite
you're too sleepy you're sleepy all the time you might
have some psychosomatic issues that come up for you you
might have nervousness and panic attacks I know on the
forum one one fellow on the forum took some five
mio DMT and and you know had a pretty big
revelation of God consciousness but it seems like he wasn't
really ready for it so it scared the [ __
] out of him and then you know like for
the next month he had difficulty sleeping uh because you
just have anxiety going to sleep because of the sort
of the nothingness I don't know exactly what he was
afraid of but you know something along the lines of
like afraid of the void or afraid of losing your
mind that's another one that comes up and you know
some of these fears and concerns and dangers they're legit
I'm so what I'm saying here in this episode is
it's not just all illusion you do have to take
some of these dangers seriously and you have to be
able to figure out what you can tolerate and what
you can't sometimes for example we get it in our
minds you know we read some book about some advanced
meditator who went off into the Himalayan caves and sat
there for six months straight and barely ate anything and
start himself half to death and you know became awakened
by meditating twenty hours a day for six months straight
and it sounds so cool and it sounds so macho
and it sounds so like oh wow that's that's the
ultimate ideal and then like I'm gonna try to go
do that and then you go do that and you
can't do it that's right you know doing something like
that very very few people can do something like that
to actually pull that off they have to be it's
not just a matter of a certain physical conditioning or
certain mental conditioning it's like they have to be at
the right place in their life they have to be
they have to have a certain proper set of motivations
they have to be a certain level of development and
maturity to pull something like that off so you just
aping them it's probably not gonna work you have to
figure out what your path is gonna be and what's
gonna work for you because you know you might try
to go do that and you might actually kill yourself
sitting there in some Himalayan cave in the ice cold
in the middle of winter and then you know a
blizzard comes and then and then you freeze to death
and then we hear about you in the news you
know frozen like an ice cube sitting in a cave
tried to be a Buddha you know yeah that is
a danger or you know if you're getting involved with
psychedelics of course there's a whole set of dangers that
come with psychedelics and I've been honest about the dangers
of psychedelics from the very beginning since I started talking
about though of course they're there you have to be
extremely careful about psychedelics the way that I see most
of you doing psychedelics I think is completely reckless and
dangerous and irresponsible gives it a terrible name to psychedelics
and is gonna harm you and it actually [ __
] your path the way many of you do psychedelics
is not how I do psychedelics I'm very very careful
about psychedelics precisely because I appreciate the dangers so we're
having this conversation because I just want to make you
aware of these dangers so that you're more cautious and
you try to figure out what you can tolerate here
and you know if you're finding yourself where you're on
this path you're meditating your ass off and so forth
and you're just like you're you're in a deep depression
some deep dark night of the soul type of deal
and you know what do you do in this case
well some people will say [ __ ] it just
push through it and everything will be right in the
end well you have to be careful that might have
worked for them given where they are at you know
what their past lives were if you want to say
that what their genetics are and a ton of other
things what their physical health is like you know all
of these factors play into it you might not be
able to do that so you have to be you
have to be willing to let go and take a
step back you know there's some there's there's one of
my favorite Bond movies I've watched all the bottom movies
I'm pretty big fan especially the old ones you know
the new ones I'm not so interested in anymore it
seems like they've kind of degraded but but some of
the really old classic ones the Sean Connery ones and
so forth I loved to watch those when I was
younger and there's there's one that um they used to
run on HBO like all the time never say never
again it was actually one of the last Sean Connery
Bond movies he came back to do it I think
it's one of one of the best ones and the
the villain in that movie is great I don't know
who the actors name is but there's just one scene
in that in that Bond movie somewhere towards like the
the third the first third of the movie where of
course this was all set like in the seventies er
yes probably in the 70s or 80s and so Bond
is facing off against this Bond villain and this Bond
villain the students this was a time of arcade machines
and video games were just coming online so this Bond
movie actually featured some like an arcade and there was
just like classy like Hotel you know in Europe somewhere
where this Bond villain you know he was he made
his own like arcade game and it was this game
of world domination and so he challenges James Bond to
sit down to play this game of world domination with
him and it's this kind of interesting it's almost like
a ping pong table but it's got this like digital
screen instead of a net and they're both sitting on
two ends of this ping pong table sort of arcade
machine and they're they have these two controls it's almost
like airplane joysticks but they have two of them each
you know the Bond villain over here holding him and
the blonde character over here holding him and now you
know they're playing this this game and we're looking at
it from you know from the audience's perspective and so
but but there's a twist because you know of course
he's a Bond villain so it just can't be this
simple it can't just be a video game so what
he did to make this this you know the stakes
high in this game is that there's an electrical shock
that comes through the joystick handles and the way the
game works is that if if you're holding the handles
and you're playing this game but you know as you
do worse in the game the shock gets worse and
worse and worse to the point where it'll kill you
if you if you lose the game uh you know
it can happen to both sides depending on how good
you play but you always have the option to let
go of the controls and if you let go of
the controls you basically lose the game you forfeit the
game but you save your life so now now the
stakes are high now it's interesting right so now bond
is sitting there playing and the the villain is sitting
there playing they're both playing and you know the villain
is scoring points on bond and now it's shocking him
and you can tell like this is hard to take
you know this is getting to dangerous levels and then
your bonds starts to win the game and then you
know now the villain is getting the shock and you
know he understands how this whole thing works and there's
this brilliant moment at the very end of this scene
which which I always I always found had like a
deep wisdom to it which is that the Bond villain
is getting to the point where you know he's gonna
lose because James Bond has figured out how to beat
him in this game at his own game and like
he's getting the point where like everybody's watching and they
think he's you know the Bond villain is is gonna
get electrocuted to death and at the very very end
he just he just lets go he just lets go
and you can tell that like right there if he
did if he held one second longer I would have
killed him but you know the Bond villain he was
smart right that's that's what wisdom is and in life
you gotta you gotta understand your own self so well
that you know when to let go sometimes you just
gotta let go and what I mean here specifically is
like you might be shooting for Awakening and you might
be doing some meditation retreat and now you might be
in such deep depression and misery and you got to
know like okay now I'm at the point where I
just gotta let it go stop this let me just
go back to my old life let me stop the
meditation for a while let me take six months off
or a month off or whatever let me quit this
retreat because I'm I'm just not ready I thought I
was ready I put in my best effort but I'm
not ready see and rather than taking it to some
dangerous level where I actually hurt myself physically or psychologically
or traumatize myself I'll just let it go knowing that
I can come back to it you know there's no
there's no immediate need for you to get awakened right
now you can do it in a week you can
do it in a month you can do it in
a year you know you've got quite a long life
to live and what you might discover from one of
these retreats is you might discover that there's more basic
stuff you got to handle before you're ready to fully
surrender your material existence see and that's okay sometimes people
email me or send me private messages through my forum
and that you know they share some dark moments they're
going through they feel all alone or they feel depressed
or they feel like life is meaningless or they're having
some Kundalini symptom you know they can't sleep they're having
anxiety whatever what's the solution to this stuff well there's
no there's no way I can give you a concrete
answer it all depends on your specific situation and really
the solution is for you to to better know your
own self not to ask me or some guru but
to dig inside of your own self into to be
honest with yourself about where are you at what can
you tolerate is this healthy is it unhealthy there are
healthy ways of pursuing awakening and doing meditation and there
are unhealthy ways of doing it if your meditation practice
is making you more neurotic if it's making you more
of an [ __ ] and less compassionate if it's
if it's destabilizing your life or you feel like you're
not able to go to work and just do the
normal stuff you got to do then you might be
doing in a dysfunctional neurotic unhealthy way in which case
the lesson there is what would be a functional and
a healthy way of doing it see and only you
can figure that out for yourself of course you can
glean ideas for me and from other sources and people
have come before you but ultimately you got to figure
that out for yourself and you got to know when
to quit sometimes not permanently but just you know sometimes
you get defeated sometimes you lose a few battles that
doesn't mean you lose the war it just means you've
lost a few battles sometimes you need to make a
strategic tactical retreat because sometimes what can happen is actually
you know you push yourself too far you overextend yourself
and then you kind of you could make the path
even longer for yourself like you might go do a
retreat the retreat will be so brutal to your ego
that after you are done with that retreat for example
you'll you'll have such a huge backslide that you'll stop
meditating for a year and you won't go to another
retreat for another five years because you were just so
traumatized by this you know you've been off more than
you could chew or maybe psychedelics do you take too
much psychedelics this can definitely happen to you and then
what happens is that see people think that all well
psychedelics Leo I'm just going to keep upping the dose
and upping the dose and taking a large dose look
I did four tabs five tabs of LSD I did
10 grams of mushrooms you know I did 30 milligrams
of 5 Meo but then what happens is that you
get freaked out one of these high doses on one
of these high dose trips and then and then you
swear off psychedelics forever and you're like oh well psychedelics
are terrible and evil no they're not terrible and evil
you misuse them and rather than being wise about and
going slowly you try to do it all in one
shot and of course you failed miserably and then you
tucked your tail between your legs and ran away and
then and now you're terrified to go back and try
it again yeah of course this is this is the
mark of an amateur an amateur gets way in over
his head into something to the point where he can't
handle it and then he has to back out run
away and never face it again this is how you
fail if you want to succeed you got to take
the slow tortoise approach you know the tortoise wins the
race slow and steady in this work if you're starting
a business this is the right approach you don't just
go and invest all of your life savings into some
outlandish idea that you have for a business just to
see it all fail because it probably will fail your
first business will probably fail but rather you take a
slow methodical long-term approach where you're thinking five ten years
down the road and you're thinking like I'm not just
gonna start one business I'm gonna become good at business
in general I'm gonna I have many business ideas I'm
gonna try this thing I'm gonna try that thing if
this doesn't work I'll keep try and I'll keep trying
and then maybe by your fifth or tenth business idea
something will work well same thing with relationships same thing
with you know starting a family if you get to
in over your head it's gonna fail or any kind
of project some art project I know I had this
problem when I was doing video game design when I
was younger you know I I trained myself to be
a video game designer and developer and the way I
did that is just through projects I would basically come
up with some idea for a game and then I
would start it and try to program it and do
the art and design for and so forth but of
course one of the problems with video game design is
that it's so easy to get way over your head
and bite off so much more than you can chew
you you underestimate how much work is involved to implement
some idea so one of the keys to creating a
video game or a movie or any kind of big
project is to just know your own limits and to
be very careful about the scope of your project if
you're the scope gets way out of hand you have
too much stuff you need to do you're never gonna
be able to do it and then you're gonna get
demoralized of course you're gonna quit so I've had plenty
of projects like that and then those projects were I
succeeded those were projects would very limited scope where I
was very careful and I was clear about my own
limitations and I said you know I can only work
so many hours a day and this project can only
take so much you know I have to complete this
within the next six months or 12 months because I
don't have forever I can't spend five years on this
so I need a project I need to scale down
my project to make sure that I can do it
in this amount of time and and all that and
even then still it's hard still you can fail so
the same kind of logic needs to apply to your
spiritual pursuits as well to avoid the dangers of this
work now there's other dangers I've only begun to really
to scratch the the surface of all the different dangers
there are with this work one enormous danger is turning
this work into a dog mount or into an ideology
I think I've talked about this plenty in the past
but it's such a big trap that people still you
know don't get it as much as I talk against
ideology and the dangers of it it's it's it's really
really hard to avoid turning this work into an ideology
and into a religion and into a dogma into a
moral system into a set of rules and Commandments something
that you do mechanistically this isn't just a natural tendency
of all spiritual work I present a lot of wisdom
and insights and models and I make grandiose statements about
truth and reality here and it's very easy to misconstrue
that as me being an ideologue as me sitting here
and preaching my ideology of God or truth or consciousness
to you that's not what's really going on it's very
easy to confuse genuine teachings with ideology or to turn
genuine teachings into ideology see because your mind wants nothing
more than a set of like bullet points that he
can just memorize and then execute but that's that's not
spirituality that's the opposite everything that I teach you and
anything you learn from anybody about spirituality you have to
hold very loosely it isn't the truth it's just talk
about the truth talk about God isn't God well it
also is but but it isn't what's being pointed at
see don't confuse the pointers with the thing that we're
pointing at for example I present spiral dynamics and you
know once you learn spiral dynamics and it becomes a
good model that you you know you're like oh well
this is a cool model it look it explains what's
happening on the evening news look it explains what happens
in religion look it explains what happens in history it
explains what happens in my family and in how it
explains what happens in business yeah it does explain a
lot of those things but like I said before the
Metta the better the model the bigger the problem see
it can become such a good model that you then
use it exclusively and you can't think outside of it
and you can't consider other models and everything now is
judged through the lens of Spile dynamics and that becomes
a danger or like you get into spirituality other you
know common danger is that you get into spirituality through
one school one path one teacher and then you think
that that is the whole of spirituality is that whether
it's at car tolay or Buddhism or some branch of
yoga some guru that you have seen on YouTube somewhere
or something like Jed McKenna and his sort of nihilistic
approach to to non-duality you know you get into one
of these usually when someone learns about non duality that
or spirituality they learn about it through one source that
kind of resonates with them but then they get to
attach that source they think that that sources is somehow
the pinnacle and then they you know they limit their
spirituality to that one source and of course that becomes
a big problem it's very easy to misinterpret various high
insights about God about truth about reality about consciousness it's
very easy for the ego you know cuz it's not
fully purified and dead yet it's very easy for it
to kind of like use try to use awakening or
non duality to to further its own agenda in a
sort of a sneaky deceptive way where you know and
I've seen this you know where people like people talking
about spirituality but yeah at the same time they go
they go to the club and do pickup and then
they they justify their pickup through their spiritual practice for
example or the reason that they meditate is because it
helps them to do pickup of course a very twisted
reason for meditation so yeah I mean you can you
can use spirituality that you know other travel spirituality is
that you develop a whole ideology or a whole a
whole mental scheme in your mind of how spiritual you
are because you're doing all this spiritual stuff you're going
through the motions of meditation and you're going to retreats
and you're listening to videos and reading books and just
doing this sort of stuff but but really you're just
doing it outwardly inwardly none of the work that needs
to be done has really been done really you're avoiding
the actual emotional labor of spiritual purification see that's that's
the heart of this work is the spiritual purification of
your body and your mind that is that feeling you
feel this is the emotional labor it's the feeling you
feel when you're sitting there on your meditation cushion and
you're meditating even though your ego wants to go eat
some ice cream or watch some TV or jerk off
to support your you're still you're sitting there and you're
meditating anyways and you're feeling you're feeling like the pain
the suffering of your ego kind of shriveling and contracting
as you're sitting there kind of forcing it to be
conscious and not to give in to temptation and in
that moment that's suffering your fear your feeling that is
literally like the devil leaving your body that's the feeling
of the devil leaving your body the problem is that
there's a lot of devil in you and it this
is not something you have to do once this is
something have to do over and over and over again
for years the devil slowly leaves your body as you
do these practices if you're doing them right but it's
easy to do these practices in such a way that
the devil never even begins to leave your body because
you just trick yourself into think that you're doing the
practices but really you're just sitting there daydreaming and you're
calling it meditation or something like that you're not really
confronting the emotional labor of it there's so many traps
here and you should expect that there would be all
these traps and you should expect that there should be
enormous emotional labor involved with awakening and with spirituality and
with God realization because if there wasn't everyone would be
walking around God realized and they would be acting like
Christ sir like the Buddha and do you see that
on noose do you see that with celebrities do you
see that in the business sector do you see that
amongst your friends and family no they're all Devils just
like you so you should expect that there's an enormous
cost or some sort of a barrier there must be
a barrier against awakening because if there wasn't everybody would
be awake and we wouldn't be here talking about it
but less than 1% of people are awake so the
barrier must be enormous and that barrier is unique for
different people and confronting that barrier you know you can
confront that barrier in a you know unhealthy dysfunctional way
like there are safe ways of doing psychedelics and there's
dangerous ways of doing psychedelics there are safe ways to
do yoga and dangerous ways to do yoga you have
to also understand that just by the nature of this
work this is psychological work that we're doing in spiritual
work there's always going to be some portion of the
population who listen to me who are going to end
up hurting themselves no matter what I say no matter
how many warnings and caveats I give because a lot
of times people who are attracting this work are people
who are already going through depression they are already neurotic
they already have various traumas that are dealing with they're
looking for solutions to that see in and whether some
of my techniques work and help that person or not
who knows you got to be careful see person like
that could try some psychedelic and lose their mind it's
possible in theory mm-hmm and then you know you can
you can date you can harm your own life in
the sense that you know maybe right now you have
a good career but you spent 10 years building up
that you're happy with maybe you got a wife and
a family and a husband or whatever that you're happy
with you got a house that you're happy with and
so forth and then you learned about awakening then you
go on this journey to do stuff that I say
and then what ends up happening is that you find
out that everything is meaningless maybe take some LSD whatever
find out that everything is meaningless and then you leave
your wife and husband and you you abandon your kids
and you abandon your house and you stop going to
work because you find it meaningless in all this and
then by the end of it you find your whole
life ruined and maybe you had a large savings and
you say oh well money's stupid so you just give
all that savings away to some charity and then you
end up with no money and then at the end
of all that you realize oh wait a minute I
probably didn't eat that money probably not I'm not smart
to give all my money away because I do need
to survive somehow see and then at the end of
that you could find yourself like having ruined your own
life so do be careful about if you're doing this
work there are gonna be phases expect that there's gonna
be highs and there's gonna be lows and usually after
a high comes alone so expect that be careful about
making rash decisions be careful about making decisions like quitting
your job giving away all your money leaving your family
you know this sort of stuff you know think those
through give yourself time find yourself maybe one or two
people who are also into this work that you could
have a conversation with in the worst case scenarios when
you're feeling really bad considering consider hiring a life coach
and working with a life coach that can be also
effective to help you to have somebody to rely on
or a therapist if you want although many therapists are
not going to understand what you're going through and in
fact they might try to discourage you and they might
say all your you're losing your mind or this the
the stuff that Leo told you isn't true and all
this well because of course you have to you have
to try to find people who are are pretty conscious
themselves already to be able to appreciate the things you're
learning here and to understand the stuff you're going through
of course it helps to read books to give yourself
a nice theoretical foundation I can't stress that enough especially
if you're gonna be tripping real deep really helps it
helps to create a sort of a context to tell
you like what's normal what's not normal what's healthy what's
unhealthy you can figure that out by reading some books
mmm check out my book list I got like close
to 50 books on spirituality non-duality on there which explain
a lot of these nuances a lot of traps a
lot of pathologies a lot of ways things can go
wrong stories that people share about how their awakenings went
wrong and how they fixed it or didn't fix it
so forth research that and still I feel like I'm
missing other dangers that I need to tell you about
but this is what's come to mind so far I
think you get the idea now right so yeah be
careful on the one hand really doesn't matter what happens
in your life even if you die it's all gonna
be okay that's from the absolute perspective now that doesn't
that doesn't help you at all from the relative ego
perspective from the perspective of your own little personal ego
and your own personal life and relative to your suffering
that you're gonna experience you can really paint yourself into
a corner in life where you do some some dumb
things and then hurt yourself physically mentally psychologically and you
just make the thing longer than it needs to be
see sometimes when you go slower you actually end up
getting there faster than when you try to rush sound
of one of those counterintuitive ways in which life works
see not always is the fastest speed the quickest way
to get to where you want to get to all
right that's it for this one please click like button

a sense of direction in your career and in your
life basically it's all the principles life purpose course what
it is first of all it's completely exclusive content all-new
not anything that I've talked about in my normal videos
that you've seen so there's that second of all in
the life purpose course we talk about new topics topics
I haven't talked about anywhere else and then thirdly basically
I give you principals and the the the blueprint that
I use to create my own career in my life
and not just actual as I work but even before
that with various businesses that I've worked on so I'm
not just telling you how to do what I do
it's not about that as much broader than that is
helping you to figure out what your what your ultimate
dream in life is what you want to be doing
what you're passionate about how to turn that passion convert
that passion into an action plan to then build a
real career out of it that earns you money so
it's a very practical course it's not abstract and airy-fairy
it it tells you it guides you step by step
how I did it and how you could do it
and those principles I developed myself by just trying to
figure it out for myself because this is one of
the things that occupied the first 25 years of my
life maybe even 30 years of my life basically is
figuring out how I could build a passion and career
for myself because I knew that that's what I wanted
and needed in order to be satisfied with my life
and it was a struggle I I I failed many
times before I figured it out so those principles are
in the course and what am I forgetting yeah the
book lists the course the patreon that's basically it the
last thing I want to say is that this work
requires nuance nuance nuance nuance you have to be very
careful and very nuanced in how you go about it
you can't be sloppy here you can't just take the
things I say for granted you have to think them
through do they actually make sense do they correspond with
your own experiences can you validate the things that I
say it's not about believing me it's also about being
being being careful not to misinterpret the things I say
sometimes the most important thing I say is the thing
that I don't say to really understand a teaching you
oftentimes have to understand what the teacher isn't saying not
just what they are saying see your ideas of God
or love or consciousness or awakening chances are they're very
wrong you might think you're understanding everything I'm talking about
but you don't so be careful assuming that you understand
the things I talk about there's many many layers to
it easy to misunderstand of course because your ego is
always lurking behind the scenes interpreting things in a way
that serves it rather than the way that's actually true
so you gotta be careful with self-deception denial distraction projection
these are all very common defense mechanisms and ways in
which you can misinterpret teachings and you also have to
recognize that I can make mistakes to see I'm not
immune to to these various defense mechanisms the only immunity
you have is just your consciousness how conscious are you
how vigilant are you so you need to verify everything
I talked about for yourself simply for the fact that
you have no idea what I'm wrong about even if
I'm right 90% of the time that those other 10%
of the time which are those you don't know am
I wrong about God am I wrong about love am
I wrong about meditation am I wrong about yoga am
I wrong about past lives am I wrong about aliens
am I wrong about psychedelics am i long wrong about
imagination am I wrong about hallucination am I wrong about
relationships you don't know it's almost guaranteed given how much
I talk that I'm wrong about some of this stuff
or maybe I'm perfect but how do you know from
your point of view you don't know so you can't
just take my word for it cuz I could be
wrong about that even if I told you that I
am perfect well what if I'm wrong you don't know
so you got to figure all this out for yourself
of course you can use my work as sort of
a launching point it can be helpful in that sense
but don't get too attached to it hold it loosely
don't get ideological about it be very nuanced about it
because understand that reality itself is far more nuanced than
anything that can be said about it everything we say
about it is the oversimplification and over generalization it's a
way of talking about it it's a partial perspective it's
a truth from a certain point of view as obi-wan
Kenobi told Luke so the things I tell you really
you got to always remember they're not absolute truths there
are truths from a certain point of view and that's
what you'll discover as you go through and you try
to verify some of the things I talk about is
that you'll discover like oh well this is what Leo
was talking about all that time here it is but
it it's not like what Leo said it was was
he lying was he wrong and then maybe you'll discover
that I was wrong or maybe what she'll discover is
like no he wasn't wrong he wasn't lying per se
it's just that he was explaining it from a certain
point of view from his point of view yeah how
else could anyone explain anything but from their point of
view given their biases given their prayer differences given their
filters and other things like that no one is ever
gonna deliver the raw absolute truth to you through language
in in some pure unadulterated form there's many layers of
corruption there's the corruption that comes from my own mental
filters and then there's a corruption from your mental filters
so the teacher can be corrupt and the student can
be corrupt and oftentimes both is the case and then
a lot of distortion happens in this way so keep
all that ninth stick around because there's going to be
a lot more content in the future about new topics
that I haven't covered yet you
