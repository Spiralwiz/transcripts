            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/LR2rB8tuD2I' target='_blank'>Deconstructing The Myth Of Science - Part 2</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding of Leo Gura's teachings</b>: The teachings are not a belief system but insights about the nature of reality, human knowledge, and science. These insights require deep contemplation and independent derivation from the listener.
</li><li><b>Objections to Leo Gura's teachings</b>: The objections raised against his teachings, such as potentially undermining science, opening a gate to pseudo-sciences, and questioning the evolutionary drive of science, are addressed in the transcript.
</li><li><b>Importance of skepticism</b>: Maintaining skepticism is essential for confronting important subject matter, provided it does not duplicate closed-mindedness. Dismissal or avoidance of uncomfortable truths is an act of self-deception that hampers the pursuit of deep understanding.
</li><li><b>Misuse of advanced truths and teachings</b>: While acknowledging that the teachings can be misused for malevolent individualistic purposes, Leo argues that this misuse shouldn't invalidate the validity and importance of said truths and teachings.
</li><li><b>Role of religion in preserving unity and morality</b>: Religious beliefs might not always be true, but they have a pragmatic purpose - fostering cohesion in communities and instilling morality.
</li><li><b>Use of science as a tool</b>: Science should be used as a tool for exploring the nature of the universe and not be solely focused on pragmatic applications and manipulations.
</li><li><b>Conflict between truth and practicality</b>: Gura denounces the idea that truth always needs to be practical and cautions against reducing science to a purely utilitarian approach.
</li><li><b>Culture's influence on science</b>: The influence of culture on scientific knowledge and practices is significant. This influence is often overlooked due to a lack of tangible evidence and the subjective standards set by society.
</li><li><b>Preserving the notion of truth</b>: Truth might not always have practical consequences, but it is fundamental to preserve the concept of truth.
</li><li><b>Objective criteria for scientific anomalies</b>: The lack of objective criteria in determining the significance of a scientific anomaly can potentially limit the scientific process.
</li><li><b>Partiality and bias in scientific claims</b>: All scientific claims contain inherent bias and partiality due to various entanglements within reality, culture, perception, consciousness.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on skepticism and openness</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for skepticism and the willingness to challenge and modify beliefs according to new interpretations and shifts in perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Issue of over-leveraging in scientific claims</b>: Over-leveraging in science, wherein the majority of scientific claims are validated through peer review, can create intellectual bubbles that may be challenged in paradigm shifts.
</li><li><b>Problem with narrow focus on practical application</b>: The prioritization of practical implications and economic gains in scientific research limits the exploration of new domains of reality and truth.
</li><li><b>Challenge of communication between scientific fields</b>: The fragmentation of scientific domains due to over-specialization restricts inter-disciplinary communication, leading to an incomplete understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Significance of personal insight and intuitive understanding</b>: The importance of intuition and personal insight in scientific discoveries is emphasized, challenging the notion that science purely relies on objective observation and pragmatic experimentation. 
</li><li><b>Perception of reality as infinite</b>: Leo points out the issue with perceiving reality as finite when it's essentially infinite. 
</li><li><b>Lack of proactive cross-verification in scientific acceptance</b>: Leo brings to light the common reliance on trusted sources and lack of personal experience in scientific experimentation by most people leading to a pyramid scheme of belief in science. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of the education system on scientific consensus</b>: Critiques the education system for focusing on memorization and belief rather than truth, leading to a scientific consensus that prioritizes the survival of institutions and bureaucracy over truth. 
</li><li><b>Entanglement of marketing and science</b>: The entanglement of marketing and science and its necessity for the advancement and acceptance of scientific ideas in society is discussed. 
</li><li><b>Resistance and denial towards new scientific paradigms</b>: The rejection and resistance faced by new scientific ideas, and the subsequent acceptance and dogmatism of new paradigms is discussed using historical examples of scientists. 
</li><li><b>Profit-driven motives in Science</b>: Highlights the profit-driven motives in science, arguing that it leads to a focus on research with practical applications and profitable outcomes, neglecting important scientific areas of study. 
</li><li><b>Recognition for holistic scientists in science</b>: The under-appreciation and lack of financial rewards for holistic scientists as compared to specialized scientists are critiqued. 
</li><li><b>Relative nature of scientific statements</b>: Leo discusses how scientific statements like "down" and "time" are relative to one's location, perspective, and various other factors like speed and perception of colors. 
</li><li><b>Role of intellect and consciousness in scientific understanding</b>: Stresses that intellectual capacity and consciousness play a significant role in understanding scientific principles and concepts.
</li><li><b>Dismissal of different understandings and interpretations of nature</b>: Criticizes the dismissal of less conventional understandings and interpretations of nature and reality due to them not aligning with mainstream scientific beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Science's intuitive drive</b>: Leo points out that scientific discoveries often come from highly intuitive minds and not purely from a mechanical process. 
</li><li><b>Interpenetration of mind and observed reality</b>: Quotes from various renowned scientists are used to illustrate the idea that the mind and observed reality are interpenetrating aspects of one whole reality. 
</li><li><b>Biases and assumptions in scientific peer review</b>: Discusses the biases and assumptions harbored within the process of scientific peer review, likening it to the same biases and assumptions present in the education system. 
</li><li><b>Retreatment of scientists to Pragmatism</b>: The retreat of some scientists to the perspective that science is about practical outcomes and not truth-seeking is criticized.  
</li><li><b>Impact and pressure of funding on scientific research</b>: Leo emphasizes the negative impact and pressure of funding on the integrity of scientific research. 
</li><li><b>Equating truth with survival</b>: Discusses the issue of associating truth with personal or species survival, asserting that it allows for and perpetuates lying, deception, and manipulation. 
</li><li><b>Importance of independent research</b>: Highlights the importance of independent research for gaining a broad and deep understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Role of intuition in scientific discoveries</b>: Discusses the importance of intuition and leaps of consciousness in making significant scientific discoveries. 
</li><li><b>Over-specialization in Science</b>: Criticizes the over-specialization in science, stating that it inhibits effective communication between different branches of science and hinders a comprehensive understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Interdisciplinary communication in Science</b>: Emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary communication for a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality. 
</li><li><b>Necessity for modification in education system</b>: Calls out the education system for focusing excessively on memorization and beliefs rather than on seeking truth.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Open-Mindedness for the Evolution of Science</b>: Science improves and evolves only when individuals are willing to reorient their understanding of the workings of science. Dogged defense of the existing paradigm inhibits the evolution of science.
</li><li><b>Addressing the Resistance to Critiques of Science</b>: Resistance to critiques and refusal to evolve is common to institutions and individuals alike, including in science. This resistance impedes the evolution of science, which in essence is contentious rather than effortless.
</li><li><b>Understanding Pragmatism's Limitations</b>:  It is problematic to equate the manipulation of reality with truth, as practiced by pragmatists. The utility of falsehoods (like lies) in achieving desired ends doesn't make them true. Similarly, useful scientific models like Newtonian mechanics and atomic theory are not 'true' in the absolute sense.
</li><li><b>Debating the Validity of 'Primitive' Knowledge Systems</b>: When applying pragmatism's emphasis on utility, knowledge systems of 'primitive' tribes living in the Amazon could be considered 'true'. They have utilized their unique worldviews, often dismissed as false due to non-scientific elements like animism or deities, to survive and thrive in their environment for centuries.
</li><li><b>Hypocrisy of Pragmatism</b>: If the definition of truth is what is useful (as per pragmatism), then even worldviews opposing modern science that have practical benefits in certain contexts would have to be accepted as true. This shows the inconsistencies in employing pragmatism as a foundation for justifying scientific truth.
</li><li><b>Objections to the Pragmatic Defense of Science</b>: Leo Gura criticizes certain scientists' belief that science is true because it is pragmatic and useful, stating that usefulness doesn't denote truth. He challenges this perspective by referencing religious beliefs, arguing that religious ideologies may not be true but they serve pragmatic purposes, such as community-building and shaping moral codes. He points out that religious individuals have been found to be happier, according to scientific studies, but asserts that this doesn't make religious beliefs true, emphasizing that truth in science should not be conflated with pragmatism, survival, manipulation, or happiness.
</li><li><b>Pragmatism and Truth</b>: Gura clarifies that not all aspects of truth have practical consequences, and it could be possible for truth to be entirely impractical. He warns against the assumption that truth needs to be practical, identifying it as an unscientific dogma. He calls for recognizing truth as separate from personal survival or the survival of a species, cautioning that equating these concepts opens the door for lying, deception, and manipulation. Gura asserts that there is an absolute truth which can be accessed through consciousness but cannot be reached with modern science methods. 
</li><li><b>The Risks Of Equating Truth with Survival</b>: He argues that if survival is defined as truth, then any lies, manipulation, and deception are justifiable as long as they contribute to survival. Gura mentions Donald Trump as an example of an individual defining truth by whatever fuels personal success and survival. He cautions that accepting this mindset can lead to a disregard for genuine truth.
</li><li><b>The Existence of Absolute Truth</b>: Gura states that absolute truth exists outside conventional scientific methods and cannot be fully grasped or explained by science. He suggests that this creates a dilemma for science: to either admit its limitations in accessing absolute truth, or to deny the existence of absolute truth altogether. He concludes that denying the existence of absolute truth poses a serious problem for science since it undermines science's credibility and authority, which relies on the pursuit of truth.
</li><li><b>Pragmatism and Science</b>: Leo Gura argues that some individuals are stuck in a mindset of practicality when it comes to science, dismissing the need for absolute truth-seeking. However, Gura emphasizes that while science might be practical and functional, its value stems from its correspondence, to some extent, with the absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Science and Absolute Truth</b>: Gura points out that absolute truth, or the state of things as they are, is fundamental to science; without absolute truth, science would cease to exist. He encourages individuals to deconstruct science to access this absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Science Working Perfectly</b>: Gura explains the common misconception that because science produces practical results, it must be completely true. He rebuts this, stressing that there are countless ways of interpreting and understanding nature, not all of which need to align with mainstream scientific models. What works for one party may not work for another, and what we see as functioning is influenced by our human survival needs and preconceptions.  
</li><li><b>Applicability of Scientific Models</b>: According to Gura, scientific models are not perfect representations of nature but rather mental schemes that try to explain natural phenomena. These models can vary greatly based on different needs and circumstances, making the science of today different from the science of 500 or 1,000 years ago.
</li><li><b>Observation and Denial in Science</b>: Gura points out that the definition of valid observation is relative and subject to the criteria set by the scientific community. He mentions ghosts as an example, stating that while there might be anecdotal observational data from numerous individuals claiming to have seen ghosts, mainstream science tends to repudiate such data due to the lack of tangible, measurable evidence that aligns with accepted scientific standards and methods. 
</li><li><b>Reality and Scientific Standards</b>: Gura argues that the standards set by science do not always correspond to all aspects of reality or nature. He suggests that the standards of evidence in scientific enquiry might need to be adapted to different natural phenomena, challenging ingrained beliefs about the materiality of all observable reality.
</li><li><b>On Observational Bias in Science</b>: Leo responds to objections regarding the validity of phenomena like ghosts or UFOs. He argues that what is considered observable evidence is extremely subjective and varies based on individual worldviews. This claim is exemplified by the dismissal of UFO sightings, psychedelic experiences, or mystical experiences by scientific institutions, which Leo alleges have resulted in ingrained biases in those within these institutions.
</li><li><b>On Presenting Evidence Against Science</b>: Leo acknowledges the difficulty of presenting evidence contradicting established scientific theories, not because of the lack of such evidence, but due to the unwillingness of many to accept evidence that challenges their current paradigm.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of postmodernism</b>: Leo takes issue with the likening of his arguments to postmodernist theory, particularly by those who lack an accurate understanding of what postmodernism represents. He clarifies that while some ideas may overlap, most of his theories are independently developed after hours of introspection and contemplation. He places his ideas beyond postmodernism.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Leo's approach</b>: Responding to criticism that his questioning of science reveals hypocrisy since he applies scientific understandings himself, Leo analogizes this to criticising a country while living in it. He asserts that criticism and usage aren't mutually exclusive, but rather criticism potentially leads to improvement or reform.
</li><li><b>Dismissing Differing Experiences</b>: Leo emphasizes that the dismissal of evidence that contradicts one's established worldview ultimately limits the ability to understand the full breadth of reality. From observations of unusual phenomena to the dismissal of profound insights from psychedelic experiences, narrow worldviews prevent a comprehensive understanding of nature and science. 
</li><li><b>Transgression of Knowledge</b>: Touching on transgressive knowledge, Leo highlights how radical, novel ideas are often met with staunch denial due to their divergence from established paradigms. These ideas, while controversial initially, can lead to significant shifts in understanding over time and he calls for increased open-mindedness in accepting such concepts. 
</li><li><b>Risks of Dismissing Evidence for Anomalies</b>: He also points to the issue of how minor anomalies that initially appear insignificant or are dismissed as noise can, over time, aggregate to provide substantial evidence against existing theories. Leo argues that biases often prevent these outliers from being taken seriously in the scientific process. 
</li><li><b>Mischaracterization of His Teachings</b>: Lastly, he refutes characterizations of his ideas as postmodern or socialist, asserting that such labels are often thrown as tactics to silence critique or undermine perspectives that challenge the status quo. He highlights that it is possible both to operate within a system while critiquing its flaws, just as one can love a country while critiquing its policies or actions.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Science is not Hypocrisy</b>: Leo Gura refutes the claim that criticizing science while using scientific technologies is hypocritical. He explains that just as a socialist who wishes to reform the capitalist system can still function within that system without hypocrisy, he can criticize aspects of science while still utilizing its tools. He emphasizes his aim is not to abolish science but to bring attention to necessary reforms.
</li><li><b>Problem of Anomalies in Science</b>: Gura highlights a major problem in current scientific paradigms - the reluctance to acknowledge and address anomalies. He explains that when newly discovered data contradicts a well-established theory, it often gets dismissed as noise or error. This habitual dismissal continues even as increasing evidence mounts, as there lacks an objective criterion to decide when cumulative anomalies indicate a need for paradigm shift.
</li><li><b>Problem of Recontextualization in Science</b>: Gura introduces the problem of recontextualization, where meaning attributed to a scientific fact can change dramatically when the context is altered. He illustrates this with an image that seems to depict child abuse but, after zooming out, reveals childs self-injury. Consequently, a fact seen in one context can have a different meaning when placed in another. With potential to transform the interpretations of scientific facts in the future, Gura argues that recontextualization is a major epistemic challenge to science.
</li><li><b>Entanglement Problem in Science</b>: Leo discusses the entanglement problem, explaining that reality cannot be neatly compartmentalized and this interconnectedness leads to various issues. The measurement tools used to observe nature are entangled with the data they produce, influencing interpretation. Measurements obtained using human senses, eyes and ears, or instruments like telescopes, are all entangled with data, shaping perceptions. He underscores that the observed reality is influenced by the manner in which we observe it.
</li><li><b>Imprecision and Uncertainty in Scientific Measurements</b>: Leo Gura brings attention to several problems intertwining or 'entangling' scientific knowledge. He starts by discussing how the scientific method itself is entangled with results. For instance, the methods used to generate a result inevitably influences the result. Due to this entanglement, questioning the method and its limitations is critical.
</li><li><b>Interpretation of Facts and its Relation with Scientific Framework</b>: Furthermore, Leo emphasizes how individual facts or statements are tied with their scientific framework. Here, the validity of facts can only be examined by the apparatus of the entire scientific framework. As this framework evolves and can be influenced by various factors, it makes the interpretation of facts questionable.
</li><li><b>Scientist's Influence on their Experiments</b>: Another significant entanglement highlighted by Leo involves the scientist themselves. Despite the ideal of neutrality in science, a scientist's personal beliefs, biases, upbringing, and worldview can profoundly impact their work. This bias not only influences how the experiments are carried out but also the kind of experiments the scientist chooses to conduct in the first place.
</li><li><b>Emotion and Reason Entanglement</b>: Leo further discusses the entanglement of reason and emotion. Against the popular belief in science that reason and emotion are separate entities, Leo highlights that emotions drive reason, which impacts the scientific process.
</li><li><b>Science's Entanglement with Perception, Consciousness and Survival</b>: In addition to the above, perception, consciousness, survival, and culture entangle with science. The perception and consciousness of scientists greatly influence scientific realities. Survival needs do the same, with most science experiments being designed not just for the pursuit of truth, but also for the survival of the scientist's ego. Moreover, the entanglement of science and culture sheds light on how culture can easily corrupt science.
</li><li><b>Consequences of Entanglements for Neutrality and Objectivity in Science</b>: Overall, these entanglements confirm that all scientific claims are biased, relative, and partial. This prevents science from being objective or neutral, and hence, accurate. Leo Gura underlines that these challenges cannot be ignored and calls for an acceptance of these entanglements as they are inherent in the domain of science.
</li><li><b>Quantum Entanglement</b>: In this section, Leo Gura discusses the concept of quantum entanglement, arguing that we are quantum mechanically entangled with everything around us. He quotes several distinguished scientists, including Leonard Susskind, Werner Heisenberg, David Boehm, Max Planck, and John Archibald Wheeler, all pointing to the idea that consciousness and the observed world are interpenetrating aspects of one whole reality. This, he argues, is an essential factor relativizing all data and facts.
</li><li><b>Partiality of Science</b>: According to Gura, science is a partial endeavor. Any methodology or perspective adopted by scientists limits their view of reality and creates inherent bias. This stands in opposition to the common assumption of science as an objective and neutral enterprise. According to Gura, the methodological biases of science exclude portions of reality, leading to blind spots in our understanding.
</li><li><b>Thought Experiment  The Simulation</b>: Gura introduces a thought experiment where individuals are born into a virtual reality simulation and later moved to another completely different simulation. He uses this thought experiment to argue against the idea that science and philosophy are separate and independent. The sudden switch in environments in the thought experiment renders all scientific understanding from the first simulation irrelevant. This demonstrates the relative truth of scientific knowledge which is contingent upon the particular circumstances or environment.
</li><li><b>Reality vs. Simulation</b>: Gura asserts that we are not in a simulation, contrary to some interpretations of his thought experiment. Rather, he proposes that individuals can become directly conscious that reality is not a simulation, suggesting a level of interconnectedness and oneness with the universe. 
</li><li><b>Relative Nature of Scientific Truth</b>: In Gura's view, all scientific truths are relative, influenced by individual cognitive structuring, cultural norms, and the context in which the science is practiced. This fluidity and limitation of scientific "truth" bring into question the assumed objectivity and universality of scientific knowledge.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Scientific Truths</b>: Scientific truths are always relative to several factors including culture, society, era, language, mental categories, paradigm or method, data collection tools, neurology, perception, mental capacity, ego, and consciousness state. This means that if these factors sufficiently change, any truth in science would no longer be true but false. This refutes the notion that scientists hold about their discoveries being absolutely true.
</li><li><b>Implications of Relativized Scientific Truths</b>: This relativity shows up in several instances: for instance, a statement like "down" in terms of objects falling is relative to the local curvature of the earth; time is relative as Einstein showed; the Eiffel Tower's height is relative to your inertial frame; the colour perception is relative to one's neurology and even mental states like being on LSD.
</li><li><b>Science is Majorly Belief and Authority</b>: Science is 99% belief and authority. Most people believe in scientific facts like the rotation of the earth, the atomic structure of matter etc., not because they've verified these facts themselves, but because these facts have been validated by scientists or other authorities in the field. Thus, science is majorly a pyramid scheme of belief upon belief.
</li><li><b>Overleveraging in Science</b>: Leo presents the problem of overleveraging in science, similar to the banking industry, where there's too much loaning and insufficient hard assets. Similarly in science, if over 90% of the world population has never conducted a science experiment and yet accept scientific claims, this means that science is highly vulnerable as it is mostly belief with very little hard, verifiable evidence. 
</li><li><b>Need for An Independent Verification of Scientific Facts</b>: Leo argues for the need to conduct independent verification of scientific facts, to move away from mere belief to direct experience and actual understanding of science. A lack of independent verification results in the overleveraging problem, where there's a gap between the amount of belief and the amount of real evidence in science.
</li><li><b>Problem of unvalidated belief in science</b>: It is highlighted that much of what people accept as scientific truth is based more on belief than personal validation. Many people have not personally tested or confirmed the broader knowledge base that science provides, relying heavily on peer review and scientific consensus. 
</li><li><b>Scientific indoctrination in education</b>: The educational system is pointed out as contributing to the problem of unvalidated belief, described as indoctrination into the paradigm of science. Science is taught primarily through memorization rather than encouraging understanding or testing, especially in the formative years of development. The lack of education on epistemology, metaphysics, and alternative worldviews further entrenches the scientific paradigm. 
</li><li><b>Peer review as a flawed system</b>: The system of peer review in science is criticized for being fundamentally flawed. It is described as being a system of confirmation bias and circular logic, as peers are those who already agree with the established methodologies and worldviews. Peer review is seen as a purely institutional validation process that does not challenge or evaluate the underlying assumptions of a field. 
</li><li><b>Distorted worldview from indoctrination</b>: The consequences of prolonged and unchecked indoctrination into science are suggested to have far-reaching effects on an individual's worldview, limiting the ability to think outside the indoctrinated paradigm. Leo emphasizes the significance of this indoctrination and potential dilution of understanding across the population. 
</li><li><b>Survival of scientific institutions over truth seeking</b>: The building of consensus in science is described as having a primary focus on the survival of institutions and bureaucracies, rather than on seeking truth. The consensus-building process is seen as being highly influenced by cultural, political, and survival factors, casting doubts on the absolute truth it claims to uphold. 
</li><li><b>Invalidity in the desire for external validation</b>: The seeking of validation from figures of authority or groups that conform to the existing paradigm is seen as a futile effort to ascertain truth. The perception of validation from such sources merely reinforces one's own beliefs and the consensus built by the scientific establishment.
</li><li><b>Bias in Peer Review</b>: Peer reviews in science often occur within the same paradigm with the same fundamental beliefs. For instance, if someone introduces a radical idea that falls outside of established thought, the reviewers  affected by their own biased beliefs  may reject it, not on the basis of its veracity, but because they lack the understanding to truly comprehend the depth of the new idea.
</li><li><b>Scientific Consensus vs Orthodoxy</b>: Scientific consensus can behave orthodoxy. Peers and experts considered during the review of any scientific idea are bound by their specific paradigms. Therefore, the acceptance and rejection of ideas is influenced by their already existent belief systems, often leading to false positives or the rejection of valid yet out-of-box ideas.
</li><li><b>Changing Science Requires Changing Culture</b>: The evolution of science requires a change in culture, and this necessitates a significant promotion and acceptance of new ideas which often extends over several generations, sometimes taking up to 200 years to be fully accepted. This evolution, however, also prompts a new layer of dogma over the new ideas.
</li><li><b>Science is Conservative</b>: Science is inherently conservative, established on maintaining authority and the metaphorical fortress around the purity of scientific knowledge. This approach, while beneficial in minimizing corruption and falsehoods, maintains a strict delineation of acceptable scientific thought which in turn limits the depth and breadth of understanding.
</li><li><b>Rolling Edge of Science</b>: A rolling edge of science exists often pushed by outlier scientists who dare to think outside established norms. Their groundbreaking discoveries at first are met with widespread resistance due to their radical nature, but the resistance eventually dies down with generational shifts, each new generation more open to the radical ideas than the last. However, this causes the new generation to form their own dogmatic beliefs around the now accepted idea. 
</li><li><b>The Process of Paradigm Shift</b>: The process of paradigm shift within the scientific field often involves initial denial and attack on the pioneers of the new paradigm by the old generations. The shift eventually occurs as older deniers die off and new, open-minded generations are born and accept the new paradigm. This leads to the new paradigm becoming the new orthodoxy over time.
</li><li><b>Continuing historical cycle of scientific paradigms</b>: Leo Gura discusses how with every generation, older scientific paradigms are replaced by the new, only to be defended later as solid truth against newer incoming paradigms. This endless cycle of rejecting and later accepting new concepts is observed throughout human history, creating "epistemic blunder after epistemic blunder" and "dogma after dogma".
</li><li><b>Resistance to groundbreaking scientific ideas</b>: Leo cites examples of Ignaz Semmelweis, who introduced antiseptic procedures but was mocked and institutionalized for his ideas, and Georg Cantor whose discovery of new mathematics of infinity was met with ridicule. These examples reflect how revolutionary ideas are commonly resisted and denied by the existing scientific community.
</li><li><b>Science controlled by survival instincts and reputation</b>: Leo argues that most scientific work happens within institutions that are primarily concerned with their survival and reputation, rather than the pursuit of truth. Scientists working at institutions like MIT or Harvard are required to confirm existing scientific biases, and exploring or presenting ideas that go against these biases can harm their careers.
</li><li><b>Corruption within scientific institutions</b>: These institutions, according to Leo, prioritize securing large funding and preserving their authority and legitimacy from donors over pursuing truth. Scientists are thus encouraged to conform to established scientific norms, which restricts their ability to challenge existing paradigms.
</li><li><b>Limits of working within academic institutions</b>: Scientists face strict limits when working within academic institutions, being bound by an implicit agreement to generate results that conform to the institution's accepted paradigm. These restrictions hinder the pursuit of fundamental truth. Such institutions, despite their valuable contributions, demonstrate a corrupted system that prioritizes survival over disruption and truth-seeking.
</li><li><b>The Indoctrination and Limitations of Academia</b>: Leo argues that academia indoctrinates individuals with set norms, values, and methodologies, discouraging critical thinking and questioning. The focus on achieving professional success and surviving in the system can dissuade individuals from genuine philosophical inquiry or exploration of truth. The education system actively promotes this approach, focusing primarily on rote learning and testing. 
</li><li><b>Criticisms of Modern Scientific Research</b>: According to Leo, the dominant capitalist society places significant pressures on scientific research, skewing it towards profitable and technology-producing fields. This funding bias often inhibits the exploration of uncharted territories in knowledge and truth. Non-conventional research areas, such as mystical experiences or psychedelics, largely remain unexplored due to the lack of immediate profitability.
</li><li><b>Fragmentation and Overspecialization in Science</b>: The increasing overspecialization and fragmentation in scientific studies limit holistic understanding of nature and reality. This division into subfields fails to consider the interdependent nature of reality, creating a disconnected and narrowed down picture. The gap in communication between different branches of science and other epistemic areas like shamanism, mysticism, etc., also exacerbates this problem.
</li><li><b>Reductionist Bias in Materialistic Science</b>: Material science operates on a reductionist bias, assuming that breaking down reality into smaller components would eventually lead to a comprehensive understanding. However, this approach fails to acknowledge the interconnectedness of different parts and their collective contribution to the whole. Different scientific fields need to communicate better and foster interdisciplinary discussions for an integrated understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Addressing Science's Reductionist Bias</b>: Leo Gura critiques the reductionist bias in science, arguing that comprehending a complex being like a frog as just a sum of molecules is problematic. He points out that this narrow lens of looking at the world is largely applied across various scientific disciplines, limiting the depth of understanding researchers can reach.
</li><li><b>Importance of Independent Research and Holism</b>: Leo highlights the value of independent research, which allows freedom in exploring various theories across diverse fields. This contributes to a broader, deeper understanding of reality, something not always achievable within the strict confines of academia. He proposes holism as a solution to the reductionist bias in science, although acknowledges it is often not financially rewarded, as specialism is more valued in professional establishments.
</li><li><b>Falsifiability and Predictive Power in Science</b>: The idea that every scientific theory must be falsifiable and have predictive power is considered a false belief within the scientific community, according to Leo. He argues that falsifiability and practical utility are not always immediate or apparent, and some theoretical discoveries can become significantly impactful in the future. Judging the value of truth based on immediate practicality is seen as a mistake.
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Infinity in Science</b>: Leo Gura identifies the issue science has with infinity - since science often considers reality as finite, an infinite reality poses a problem. As no finite method can completely capture an infinite reality, this implies that scientific methods are always incomplete and there will always be truths lying outside the boundary of these methods. To have a pure understanding of science, Gura suggests making the mind's approach as open, creative, flexible, and radical as possible to get closer to infinity and thus enhance its understanding of nature.
</li><li><b>The Finite Nature of Science</b>: Leo Gura explains that many scientists perceive nature as finite because their methods for investigation are finite and cannot comprehend infinity. This perception is viewed by Gura as a form of confirmation bias, as scientists interpret nature based on the limitations of their methods.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Proof</b>: Gura argues that the notion of proof is finite, unable to encapsulate the concept of infinity. He highlights that there will always exist truths in reality that cannot be proven due to the finite nature of proof. This is further explored in his episode about the metaphysical implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem.
</li><li><b>Non-Mechanical Nature of Science</b>: Gura asserts that science is not a mechanical process, but rather a field driven by highly intuitive minds making non-linear leaps of consciousness. He refutes the common belief that nature can be completely understood through reduction and analysis.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Proof</b>: Gura discusses the relative nature of proof, noting that the understanding and acceptance of any proof depends on an individual's personal intellectual capacity. For instance, concepts like quantum mechanics or math exist for humans due to their level of consciousness and neurology, but these would not exist for donkeys, indicating that our understanding of reality is largely subjective.
</li><li><b>Intuition at the Heart of Science</b>: Gura emphasizes that though science is often described as a hyper-rational, objective method, the great achievements in science are born from intuitive insights and holistic pattern recognition that cannot be captured in formal, mechanistic processes. 
</li><li><b>Truth Seeking</b>: Finally, Gura encourages viewers to question every assumption made by science in pursuit of truth. He asserts that truth, unlike human institutions or invented concepts, is not threatened by rigorous questioning because it predates human existence and is not a human invention. For Gura, loyalty should lie with truth rather than human-invented concepts like science or religion.
