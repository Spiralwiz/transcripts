hey this is leo for actualize.org and in this video
i'm going to cover how to build willpower [Music] all
right so i'm back we're going to talk about willpower
how to build it how to develop it what it
really is and why it's important to your life so
what is willpower why is it important to your life
let's get into this it's a fascinating topic well what
willpower is is really your ability to control your own
impulses impulse control so how easy is it for you
to get yourself out of bed in the morning when
you want to stay in all comfy and snuggy how
easy is it for you to get your ass off
the couch and to the gym when your favorite tv
show comes on how easy easy is it for you
to say no to that donut or that pizza that
shows up at the office how easy easy is it
for you to get your ass into gear and start
that project that you've been dreaming of starting but you
know you should start and you just for some reason
have been procrastinating on it like writing that novel or
starting that business or composing that song or directing that
movie or whatever other activity you want to be doing
out there so willpower is necessary to do all of
these things willpower really is your prefrontal cortex muscle it's
your prefrontal cortex and it's a its ability to exert
impulse control on other parts of your brain so this
is actually a physical phenomenon and willpower is something that
can be developed so if you have will low willpower
right now or if you feel like you do then
don't get discouraged because actually i'm going to give you
some tips right now in this video for how to
start building up your willpower and i'm also tell you
some stuff that is robbing you of your willpower so
that you can eliminate those activities that are really draining
and atrophying your willpower muscle so why is willpower important
why do we talk about this well willpower is critical
to the success that you get in your life and
it's especially critical if you're on board with the kind
of mission that i have for you and for myself
which is to be living an extraordinary kind of life
to be challenging ourselves to be living a life of
creative contribution when we're out there expressing ourselves when we're
creating amazing careers and businesses and we're starting these dream
projects and we're fulfilling them and we're you know we're
living on our edge to do that takes willpower because
that will power helps us overcome the fears that naturally
come up when we are out of our comfort zone
so willpower is important to advance your career willpower is
important to stay on top of your life purpose and
to pursue your life purpose in the beginning willpower is
important to uh working out problems and relationships and to
make sure that you're being conscious and self-aware in a
relationship you're not just being triggered and you're not being
a stimulus response animal in a relationship and just turning
it to basically when you do that willpower is essential
really to your happiness because happiness one way to define
happiness is to live integrity with your values and to
do that means that you need to be disciplined enough
to follow through on those activities that you know are
good for you but that are oh so easy to
fall through on so let's get into some of this
stuff well you know willpower is i said it was
like a muscle and it literally is to build willpower
the process of building willpower is no different than going
to the gym and pumping your biceps or pumping your
quads or whatever it is a muscle that you're working
on on your physical body your physical body actually atrophies
from disuse and the same thing happens with your brain
is that physically and this has now been proven by
neuroscience and some of the cutting edge neuroscience has been
done over the last 20 years where they've really done
a lot of mri scans fmri scans cat scans and
other things where they're really using these technologies and uh
electroencephalograms are using these cool new technologies to to to
look at what's going on inside your brain they're analyzing
and they're doing studies on people who are meditating and
they're doing exercise studies on people who are doing exercise
and people who are watching television and they're comparing the
brain activity of all these people and they're looking at
what's going on there and what they're seeing is that
the brain and the prefrontal cortex specifically can be built
up by using it so every time you actually use
your prefrontal cortex by resisting some sort of urge some
sort of lower urge then what that's doing is it's
building up your discipline and it's building up your willpower
reserve so that means that anytime you get some sort
of inclination to do something if you can resist then
that will build up your willpower just a little bit
and then the next time you reach a little bit
more that builds up your willpower a little bit more
and the more you do that and the more you
do that that ratchets up your willpower and it builds
it up just like it would a muscle so there's
really no way escaping having strong willpower and exercising willpower
because the two are the same thing if you're exercising
your willpower all the time and you're finding those opportunities
throughout the day then you're gonna have strong willpower you
know it's gonna take weeks maybe months maybe a year
or more to get your to the kind of high
level willpower that you want but as long as you're
taking those steps just like you would with you know
pumping your bicep you're going to get there on the
other hand if you're not taking those opportunities and you're
falling off and you're you're you're really falling through on
that and you're not living up to you know your
highest self the highest self that you know you need
to be then you're losing willpower with each one of
those right so it's kind of a matter of are
you building yourself up or are you building yourself down
atrophying all right so that's kind of the process let
me tell you now some of the ways that you
can build willpower these are some of the scientifically proven
most effective ways of building willpower number one is meditation
meditation is thousands of years old and it's a really
popular technique and it's remained popular for so long for
millennia because it is so effective at building willpower and
then the effect of that spills over into all areas
of life that's why meditation is powerful meditation not only
feels good in the moment when you're doing it but
meditation is good at improving your performance in your career
performance and relationships performance at the gym everywhere because it
builds up that muscle it really is like the gym
for the brain that's basically what i see meditation as
being and it's the number one proven way of building
up willpower it literally re-sculpts your prefrontal cortex physically when
you meditate and that puts you after a while that
puts you in a whole another league of impulse control
versus normal people so go ahead and start meditating if
you're not already start building up a practice of doing
that every day for 20 minutes that's what i recommend
and i have other videos that tell you exactly how
to do meditation so you might want to check those
out other things exercise exercise is a really good way
to build willpower because well it takes discipline to do
that right it takes an exercise of willpower muscle just
to get yourself into the gym just to do the
workout routine just to lift that extra extra five pounds
of weight just to run for an extra 10 minutes
on the treadmill that takes discipline to do and exercise
has a synergistic effect with the discipline that it takes
to go to the gym then you're doing the exercises
all that just synergizes and builds up your willpower muscles
so that's a great one another one is breathing kind
of seems a little bit silly breathing we all breathe
but doing deep breathing slow meditative type of breathing is
actually a really good way to calm yourself down and
to start to actually get in touch with a higher
sense of awareness within you because most of the time
throughout your day you're running through your day on autopilot
and you're not aware of your breathing you're not aware
of what your body's doing you're not even aware of
what your mind is thinking most of the time and
when you start to breathe consciously just like breathe in
for four seconds deeply and then hold it and then
breathe out for six seconds when you do that i
just did it right now and all of a sudden
look my my thought patterns have already slowed down my
voice is slower i'm talking slower i feel more grounded
and when i'm in that kind of state i have
more willpower i'm able to resist impulses much more easily
so practicing that you can practice that really well with
meditation so you can couple breathing in meditation or you
can just do uh separate breathing exercises make sure that
you're breathing in and then your exhale is longer than
your inhale so your inhale maybe four seconds and your
exhale six seconds or eight seconds that will calm you
down relax you and get you really in touch with
your whole body and your thoughts all right the next
way to build willpower is just little things i would
say taking right action anytime you take right action and
this just means doing the things that you know you
need to be doing you know are healthy and good
for you when you do those things that is building
up your willpower so these are just basic disciplines for
example maybe waking up on time not hitting that snooze
button how about eating right resisting that dessert resisting that
junk food that candy bar resisting you know that cheeseburger
if it's not on your diet how about working hard
going in and putting in a really solid day's worth
of work at your job or in your business being
on top of that staying on top of that stuff
making sure that if you do have a meditation practice
that you're staying on top of that meditation practice every
day and you're not being waffly about it and you're
not skipping one day here and one day there same
thing with your with your gym routine making sure you're
staying on top of that very consistently when you are
doing all those things and you're executing on them just
do that for a week take right action for a
whole week and just see how you feel compared to
when you don't you're going to feel so much more
alive you're going to feel so much more powerful and
you're going to feel like you have more control over
your life and it's going to be a lot easier
to start to do the things that are a little
bit outside your comfort zone because that's where your willpower
is necessary now you've got those reserves you can use
them to start that dream project or start that new
diet or crank it up even harder at the gym
or whatever it is that you really want to put
in place into your life so i find that you
know that taking right action is the general rule of
thumb that is important to building willpower and finally what
i'm going to talk about is ways to destroy willpower
so i've given you a lot of good ideas for
how to build it up now we're going to talk
about what is robbing you of it okay this is
a pretty obvious list but i'm sure that you're doing
some of the stuff on this list i know even
i'm doing some of the stuff on this list and
so as i'm talking to you about it i'm becoming
more aware and i'm making more of a commitment to
get this stuff out of my life number one television
make sure you're not watching television this is robbing you
this is killing you of your willpower it's putting into
low consciousness zombie mode turn off the television in fact
disconnect it disconnect your cable i don't even own cable
i haven't owned cable for years and it's been one
of the best changes that i've made in my life
such a simple little change but it's amazing it just
i have so much more uh energy i'm so much
happier so much more fulfilled i'm doing so much more
stuff i'm so much more productive because i'm not watching
television internet really no different than tv if you're habitual
internet browser if you're always watching youtube videos non-stop if
you're if you're always checking the news you're checking your
email you're chatting with your friends cut that out that's
destroying your willpower it's turning you into a low consciousness
zombie snacking over eating any kind of ways in which
you're using food as a crutch as an emotional crutch
as a psychological dependency cut that out that's destroying your
willpower it's making you feel guilty you're not taking right
action there you know that's not healthy for you sleeping
in if you're not waking up on time i know
that's actually been a problem lately for me because i
have a very odd sleep schedule i live in vegas
here so i go to bed very very late and
i tend to wake up late as a result and
that's a little bit screwing with my work schedule so
that's something i got to work on sleeping in less
drinking alcohol drugs smoking any kind of chemical substance abuses
that you are partaking in cut that out that is
destroying your willpower it's also destroying your body uh destroying
the performance that you can have in your life it's
really a waste of your life it's a shame that
you're doing that stuff cut that out video games i
used to partake in that a lot i still do
a little bit but uh not nearly to the point
where i did before cut that stuff out wean yourself
off video games huge time sink huge willpower drain get
yourself off that stuff porn if you're addicted to porn
if you watch a lot of porn unhook yourself from
that stuff that stuff is also hurting your willpower and
it's destroying your energy destroying your performance so that's basically
it those are the ways in which you're destroying your
willpower so if you cut some of those out and
you put in some of those good methods then you're
going to start to see that your willpower builds up
and up and up and up the more you keep
doing that so for you as a as an action
item right now because i don't want you to just
watch this video i want you to actually take some
action number one question to ask yourself is what can
you be doing to build up your willpower what's the
one thing for you that you know is going to
be right is it meditation is it exercise is it
breathing is it waking up on time decide what it
is just one thing don't don't try to fix everything
at once one thing and then the next thing is
what is the one thing right now that you're doing
that's destroying your willpower jot that down write that down
make it very clear in your mind is it too
much tv too much internet too much sleeping in too
much drinking too many video games too much porn decide
on that one thing and decide you're going to cut
it out so you're going to put one thing into
place and you're going to take one thing out of
place and then you're going to start to watch what
happens to your willpower and if you stay consistent on
that and you take right action you're going to notice
a big shift all right so that's it that's what
