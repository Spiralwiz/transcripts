hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I want to give you one really simple rule
for acing life okay so this rule is so super
simple so stupidly simple that it's really profound in how
its tentacles reach out into every aspect of your life
this is a big one this is huge right here
but it's very simple and because it's so simple you
might overlook it and you might dismiss it as just
like oh I kind of already knew that but I
encourage you to actually stick with me here and to
contemplate the significance of what I'm about to tell you
because this is a very significant and a very profound
insight here's the rule the one rule that you need
for acing life always do what's emotionally most difficult always
do the thing that's emotionally most difficult to do in
whatever situation you find yourself in this is the exact
opposite if you take a moment to think about it
the exact opposite of what most people do it's the
exact opposite of what you do in almost every situation
and this is the mother of all screw-ups and problems
and frustrations in life is this what most people do
is they do the exact opposite in a sense that
they're looking for the most emotionally convenient and comfortable and
easy thing that they can do in life and they
think that that's going to lead to the most cushy
comfortable and pleasant life that one can have but actually
what it does count is that it leads to a
mediocre and very frustrating kind of life so to really
hammer this point home I want to give you a
whole list of examples of how this principle applies to
many different contexts in life because it applies to everything
it applies to your relationships it applies to business it
applies to your health to your finances to your mood
to the way you think to the goals you pursue
in life everything literally everything and the trick about it
is is that it's a very counterintuitive thing counterintuitive living
a good life is counterintuitive remember that that means you
have to go against what the herd is doing against
the grain of what most people do in society the
problem is and this takes a lot of personal development
work to finally start to appreciate and become aware of
is that the way that your mind is designed to
run is that your emotional system is rigged to unconsciously
pursue comfort and basically what you're doing in your entire
life we could sum up your whole life this way
is that you're like a weasel trying to weasel your
way in for emotional security and comfort that's all you
basically want out of life emotional security and comfort and
you're not conscious that you do this and I mean
I could tell you about this and you might say
like oh yeah I kind of understand what you're talking
about leo like yeah it makes sense and you know
I'm kind of loosely aware of this but see you
don't see how far these tentacles reach into all the
different facets of your life and how it infects everything
you do and it robs you of all the joy
and the really amazing things that you can find in
life is this this weaselly attitude you're like this little
weasel always trying to find a shortcut to emotional comfort
that's what you're always looking for and it takes a
lot of work on yourself a lot of studying of
your own psychology to start to see like oh my
god this is like the prime directive of human beings
this is all that human beings basically do this is
like our mission in life is to be this emotional
weasel this is all that we do everything we do
is motivated by this is it's it's quite profound when
you start to actually see how this abstract principle that
I'm giving you here applies and connects to specific situations
in your life and the life of your friends and
your family and all the problems that creates it creates
a lot of fallout this one here takes a lot
of awareness development of awareness and start to see it
and that's just to start to see it I'm not
even talking about starting to unwire it first you got
to see it first you got to recognize it then
you got to ask the question like holy [ __
] how do I on wire this thing how do
I start on why this mechanism because you realize like
Danny I I can't live a good life when my
prime directive in life is to seek emotional security and
comfort it's not possible to live a good life that
way you must unwire this mechanism and the problem is
that this mechanism is unconscious it's largely unconscious it's largely
automatic it happens automatically it's the default thing that the
human mind does like a robot you've been programmed to
be an emotional weasel and what's even worse to throw
gasoline on the fire here is that society and our
education system and our political system and the culture that
you grew up in and business all of these create
an unholy alliance which is rigged against you and it's
really designed to cater to that emotional weasel that's within
you you see this everywhere in society our language our
books our advertising the products people sell you our education
system our political system religions you name it whatever it
is it's all rigged to satisfy that emotional weasel within
you and to give you a comfortable cushy easy emotionally
easy life that's what it's all rigged for now you
might think like well what's wrong with that I mean
why would I want an emotionally challenging in a stressful
life why would I want that don't we want an
easy comfortable existence but see the problem is is that
the the human body and the human mind aren't really
designed for that they're actually designed to to need challenge
in order to feel satisfied if we take the human
body and we just hook it up to an IV
full of opiates like morphine or heroin you would think
like man that's that's the best kind of life right
I'm just getting pure injections of chemical pleasure into my
veins into my brain directly what could be wrong with
that that's what I want but of course some we
know what the problem is with that right it doesn't
work it's not sustainable that's not really the kind of
life you want that's like a vegetable like a vegetable
state that's a brain-dead kind of life what you want
instead I would suggest to you is you don't want
an emotionally easy life you want to self-actualize life that's
the life you really want but this is counterintuitive because
the self actualized life is not the emotionally easy life
it's the emotionally challenging life and in the moment when
you try to actually live it and implement it it
going to feel challenging and you're going to quit you're
going to fall off track and you're going to fall
back into your emotional Weasley kind of life and then
you're going to wonder like why am i depressed why
am i anxious why am i unsatisfied why am I
not getting the success that I want and the the
whole reason is because you're doing the things that are
emotionally easy rather than the things that are emotionally challenging
so this is a counter to a thing you have
to really go against the grain against the grain of
society and also against the grain of your own natural
almost biological tendencies and that's what makes this a really
challenging journey it's also what makes it a rare journey
right not very many people in life choose to go
with the self actualized life they chose they choose to
go with the emotional weasel so let me give you
some examples I want to list out a lot so
you can see how this abstract principle applies okay so
in school let's take school in school the emotionally difficult
thing to do is to actually read the textbook from
cover to cover how about in college in college the
emotionally difficult thing to do is to take the hardest
classes your mind doesn't want you to take the cartas
classes that's difficult how about on YouTube when you're browsing
around on YouTube the emotionally difficult thing to do is
to not click on one of those stupid cat videos
when you're afraid in general anywhere in life when you're
afraid the emotionally difficult thing to do is to not
panic and to not feed into your fear with more
worry about a relationship in a relationship the emotionally difficult
thing to do is to learn how to establish clear
lines of communication that not what most people do in
intimate relationships how about when losing weight the emotionally difficult
thing to do is to actually give up sweets and
to get your ass into the gym consistently that's the
emotionally difficult thing to do the easy thing and this
is where society preys on you and business preys on
you is to say something like oh I'm going to
just go get some liposuction or I you know I
saw this ad the other day for how I can
get how I can get slim by eating chocolate I
actually saw this this was funny I was driving to
a to a Asian food market and there was a
car like a van parked there and this was somebody's
business on this van you know how they have advertisements
on the van if it's like a small business well
this person had this advertisement it says something along the
lines of lose fat by eating chocolate that was there
that was their business model lose fat by eating chocolate
so what is that doing that's appealing to the emotional
weasel within you it's like yes I want to be
slim and healthy but also I want to be picking
out on chocolate and bacon so what's the most popular
diet that we can come up with it's the bacon
and chocolate diet and I'm sure that there probably is
one like that because some clever marketer has figured out
how to appeal to that low consciousness emotional weasel within
you and they know that you're going to buy a
lot of [ __ ] from them you're going to
buy their book and you're going to buy their products
and you're going to buy their chocolate-covered bacon wrapped in
tin foil and all this stuff you know you're going
to buy all that stuff because you're emotional weasel is
going to want to do the easy thing not the
difficult thing the difficult thing is just say you know
what I got to give up bacon and maybe I
got to give up chocolate and maybe I give got
to give up you know eating ginormous portions of food
like they serve in America maybe have to give some
of that up so that I could get my health
back in return more examples in an argument when you're
having an argument the emotionally difficult thing is to consider
that you might be the wrong one your mind does
not want to do that your mind wants to insist
that it's right how about in a debate when you're
having a debate the emotionally difficult thing is to adopt
the other perspective the other side to step in the
into the other person's shoes the mind doesn't like to
do that either it likes to insist that it's got
the right perspective already in church the mostly difficult thing
to do is to question all your beliefs and all
the beliefs and dogma of the church your mind doesn't
want to do that if you grew up in that
one church and you have this faith in this church
you the last thing you want to do is question
all your beliefs about the church when you're dating the
emotionally difficult thing to do when you see that girl
or that guy that you really like anything is cute
is to walk up to them to say hey you
know I notice you thought you were kind of cute
and I just wanted to come over and get to
know you that's the emotionally difficult thing to do when
you're being criticized the emotionally difficult thing to do is
to consider the criticism seriously to actually use the criticisms
to try to evaluate your own behaviors and to take
it as feedback to see how you might improve in
life in general the emotional difficult thing to do is
just to sit down and to turn off your mind
and to meditate this one's huge most people cannot wrap
their mind around this this idea that someone could develop
a habit of meditation where they sit down for a
whole hour in their day and do absolutely nothing but
just sit in silence that that could somehow be beneficial
to one psyche this is completely outside most people's realities
and it's a real shame because this one habit if
they did it every day would completely transform the success
that they get in their life their level of happiness
and really their entire worldview something this simple could just
completely revolutionize your whole life and yet you don't do
it and even after I tell you all this you
still won't do it because your emotional weasel mind doesn't
like the emotional challenge of sitting there and being bored
out of your mind and not doing anything your emotional
weasel mind tells you hey need to go do stuff
let's go to that party let's go read a book
let's go watch a movie let's go talk to our
friends let's go post some stuff on Facebook whatever that's
what it does and resisting that is exactly what I'm
talking about here it's difficult when you're presenting information to
people the emotionally difficult thing to do is to present
the facts objectively without exaggerating them in business the emotionally
difficult thing to do is to create lots of value
massive quantities of value for people without asking for payment
in return most people cannot wrap their mind around this
it seems very counterintuitive to them they only want to
work and do an output of massive value only if
there's a prospect of massive payment in return and so
they are never able to start a successful business in
taking a self-help program the emotionally difficult thing to do
is to actually sit down and do every assignment and
exercise that you were told in the program rather than
just skipping through them and telling yourself at all just
do it some other day in spiritual work if you're
a spiritual person if you have spiritual ambitions the emotionally
difficult thing to do there is to admit your own
wishful thinking it's to say oh all my ideas about
spirituality what it is and how it works complete fiction
complete nonsense complete [ __ ] and that's what you
have to do if you want to make progress spiritually
like real spiritual progress you have to do that but
that's exactly what people do not do in fact what
they do is they use their spiritual work in their
spiritual pursuits to do the exact opposite is completely counterintuitive
what they do is they use their spiritual pursuits to
entrench their wishful thinking and their dogmas even deeper in
life in general the emotionally difficult thing to do is
to question your culture whatever culture you grew up in
try questioning your culture it's very challenging very counterintuitive thing
like Leo why would I even want to question my
culture what would be the benefit of that but there's
enormous benefits to that if you can summon the courage
to do it and managing your finances the mostly difficult
thing to do is to save money for retirement to
actually take money out of your paycheck today and put
it into an IRA account that you're not going to
see or touch for 40 years perhaps and to do
that consistently year after year month after month that's very
counterintuitive to our brain because our brain does not like
to delay gratification it wants gratification now in having sex
the emotionally difficult thing to do is to use a
condom with your health the emotionally difficult thing to do
is to go get that scary lab test done that
you don't want to get done because you're afraid of
what it might mean about your health that's emotionally difficult
and most people just sweep that under the rug month
after month year after year and then maybe they get
cancer or something that they could have prevented in business
the mostly difficult thing to do is to not take
shortcuts and to not go after get-rich-quick schemes but to
build a solid business on a solid foundation in life
in general the emotional difficult thing to do is to
not do what your friends and family are doing whatever
line of work your friends and family are in to
not do that that's difficult whatever beliefs your friends or
your family have to not believe that that's difficult that's
counterintuitive it's like bhalil why would I not believe what
my family or my friends believe or do what they
do or have the same hobbies that they have but
if you have wisdom and you can see a little
bit further down the road you can see enormous benefits
from that when you're angry the emotionally difficult thing to
do is to to stay mindful through that anger and
to not lose yourself in it and whenever you get
power in life the emotionally difficult thing to do is
to not abuse that power history and psychological experiments have
proven to us very clearly how easy it is for
the human mind to abuse its power in relationships in
political positions in positions of leadership wherever you find it
so that's a small list of examples and it really
is just a small list because we're just scratching the
tip of the iceberg here this thing goes really deep
notice that in all these situations if the person just
follow this one principle that I'm giving you here which
is simply do the thing that's emotionally difficult they would
get extraordinary results in life they would get success beyond
their wildest dreams they would have incredible relationships they would
have so much money they wouldn't even need to worry
about money anymore they would have incredible mood depression anxiety
these would be distant dreams this distant memories for a
person that follows this principle their health would be outstanding
um just every facet of life would go beautifully and
you would basically be living the self-actualized life if you
did this but is difficult so even though it might
seem like hey Leo is giving you a simple little
shortcut for life if you take it that way that's
actually not what I'm giving you here because it's difficult
to implement this is the exact opposite of really what
you want this advice is the exact opposite usually the
advice you want to something hey here's a magic peel
to solve this problem for you effortlessly and that's not
what I'm telling you here see what I'm giving you
here is kind of like that real high-quality timeless advice
that maybe your grandparents would give you when they tell
you to be honest and to have a strong work
ethic and that kind of [ __ ] right they
tell you something like that and you just say well
yeah we all know that but you know wouldn't it
be nice if I got a little shortcut here a
little shortcut there and so your mind is always looking
for shortcuts and because your mind is always looking for
shortcuts business and society and politics and all this stuff
in religion all of this is catering to that in
you why because they want your business they want your
approval they want your vote they want your donations whatever
it is right and you know what they're not going
to fight your weasely mind for you don't expect business
to fight that for you so when that guy has
that advertisement on the side of his van that says
that you can lose lots of weight by eating chocolate
and that that's a legitimate way to go about losing
weight then you know I mean a sense is kind
of like men that that guy is really unethical in
the way that he's doing its business and that that
that's one of the things that frustrates frustrates me a
lot about business gives me a lot of klomps about
doing business is that I see a lot of unethical
business and a lot of unethical advertising people just trying
to sell you [ __ ] that you don't need
that doesn't work that that they're not honest about that's
not a long-term sustainable solution it's just like a quick
little magic pill which is ultimately just going to postpone
your real serious problems till the very end which is
actually why I got really passionate about actualised org is
because I feel like the material that I present here
is kind of the antithesis of all that it's the
exact opposite I don't really like to come up here
and give you magic pill solutions I like to go
deep on topics I like to talk about these things
so you really get a deep understanding which is sustainable
and then you can actually use it to do hard
work in your life you can actually do some kind
of heavy lifting with these psychological concepts because that's what
I found you need to generate legitimate stable long-term success
and fulfillment in life but that's not what most people
want most people are [ __ ] lazy they're being
a weasel and you know I'm part of this too
as I was coming in with this list I actually
got a little angry it's coming up with this list
I'm like [ __ ] you know a lot of
the things on this list is like man I struggle
with that stuff too and there's there's plenty of stuff
in my life where I'm not able to to follow
this principle of doing the emotionally difficult thing all the
time simply because I forget and I get lazy I
get complacent you know life nowadays is so easy compared
to the way it was in the old days and
society and business is just it's just feeding into this
and it's just it's just really getting toxic it's getting
to the point of like we're living in almost like
an abusive relationship with society it's quite bad it's quite
bad you know how you can have an abusive intimate
relationship it's terrible for you just kind of keep coming
back to it and coming back to it coming back
to it even though you know it's terrible for you
and the other person just keeps eating into and feeding
into it and just it's like it's just a spiral
into hell well that's kind of like what's happening with
society right now and it's weird because it's like you
know we've got modern scientific understanding and we have technological
amazing breakthroughs the things we can do with computers and
the internet nowadays and airplane travel and flying to space
and we it seems like society is making so much
progress but you know psychologically in a sense society is
not as advanced as we think it is our technology
is far more advanced than our social psychology which is
a real big problem and that's that's going to be
one of the biggest challenges to world cultures to every
nation on the planet is overcoming this challenge here it's
a real big problem it's like a a global addiction
the good news is is that you can at least
for yourself personally buck the trend and you know if
like if a person was coming into this world just
getting born and I could just talk to that person
let's say that person had full consciousness and they understood
what I was saying they were mature not just a
little baby and I could tell that person hey look
here's what you got an O to live a really
incredible rich and rewarding life huh there's a lot of
stuff I want to tell that person it wouldn't just
be one thing but I think one of the things
at the top of my list would have to be
this this principle here just in every situation do the
thing that's most emotionally difficult and you're going to come
out on top you're going to have amazing money amazing
success amazing relationships amazing sex you're going to have pretty
much everything you want and the most important thing you're
gonna have you can have fulfillment and peace of mind
from that and the other most important thing you're going
to have at the end of that is you're gonna
you're going to die happy having lived that kind of
life and I feel confident that you know that person
could just take that simple little maxim that I gave
them and just apply it in every like literally every
situation in life and then by the end of their
life not even by the end even just a decade
into their life they would be so thankful because they
would look back and they'd say oh my god I'm
so glad I got that piece of wisdom that insight
and that I applied it religiously in every aspect of
my life because I can see what the alternative would
have been if I didn't do that my life would
be just like that person over there it would be
just like my dad or just like my mom or
just like my friend or just like my you know
abusive whoever's in my life or just like that failed
business or just like that fat 300-pound a woman that
I see at the store who can barely walk because
she's stuffed her body with so much [ __ ]
[ __ ] food why there's only one reason it's
because she's giving her into her emotional weasel and she's
not following this advice so you know if you're fed
up with the lack of success in your life if
you're fed up with crappy relationships if you're fed up
with your depression your anxiety and your bad mood if
you're fed up with your bad health whatever you're fed
up with in life and you really are at this
point where it's like [ __ ] leo I need
an answer like I really want to change how do
I change this I'm tired of bitching and moaning about
I'm tired of suffering it how do I actually change
it well here's your answer you got to bite this
bullet and this is not an answer that you want
to hear and this is not an answer that you're
going to hear in up like a really popular self-help
book this is not an answer you're going to hear
in some infomercial on TV this is not an answer
you're even going to hear on most YouTube videos most
YouTube videos are busy showing you funny cat pictures or
music videos or something like that why because it's really
not in their favor in a sense it's not in
my favor to come up here to tell you this
stuff because while I come up here and tell you
this stuff um I'm actually losing money when I do
that if I came up here and I shot a
shorter video if I shot a five-minute video that's had
a title that says something like lose 60 pounds by
eating chocolate-covered bacon in five weeks if I came up
with a title like that and I could I could
easily come up with a title like that I'm very
tempted to every week to come up with titles like
that you know clickbait ii type of titles [ __
] that you're emotional weasel mind will go for I
could come up with that [ __ ] but I
would feel a out feel disgusted on the inside to
be delivering that kind of content you know and because
it's really not helpful to you it feeds into the
whole problem that we have in society so actually what
I have to do is I have to tell myself
[ __ ] you know I could earn more money
I could earn a lot more money by coming up
here and delivering that kind of content but I don't
and so that's exactly the problem is that when a
business in general in the society tries to kind of
go green it tries to go good it tries to
kind of like be ethical it tries to do what's
good for you when the business tries to look out
for you more than you look out for yourself that's
generally a recipe for disaster for that business doesn't usually
work out well for that business why do you think
fast-food restaurants and even high-end restaurants they don't serve you
organic food they serve you the lowest cheapest food they
could possibly buy because they don't give a [ __
] about your health because they know that you don't
give a [ __ ] about your health and when
a organic fast-food store does open up you don't go
there it goes out of business or even if it
survives and it stays in business it doesn't earn nearly
as much as McDonald's does so this is a huge
and a very deep issue and I'll talk about more
of this in the future because it's really important that
we start to get awareness around this and we start
to so get like social consciousness over this because it's
a real problem um but just you know some food
for thought for you and like I said like I
was saying if you're tired of the kind of shitty
life you've been living you're not happy with your results
you got to bite the bullet stop looking for a
magic solution there are no magic solutions here the solution
is hard work it's emotional labor it's the thing you
don't want to do here's the good news though the
good news is that it's not as bad as you
think it is it's kind of like jumping into a
cold pool yeah it's like it's a pain in the
ass I don't want to jump in that cold pool
but once I jump in there and I start swimming
around for a few minutes like oh I get acclimated
it feels comfortable it feels natural it feels refreshing and
that's the best way that I can describe transitioning yourself
from your lazy Weasley life into a self-actualized life is
that it starts to feel refreshing to your spirit so
to say so give it a try stop giving in
to your emotional weasel alright this is Leo I'm signing
off go ahead post me your comments down below click
the like button please share this with a friend maybe
a lazy friend and then come sign up and check
out actualized org this is my website it's got free
content on it got some exclusive content on it got
some courses in a book list on it I release
a newsletter with new content every single week you know
despite the fact that this is not the most profitable
thing that I could be doing to me is a
rewarding thing that I do I like going deep on
these topics I like helping people to understand their psychology
umm the reason I like that is because I know
how powerful it is but it also requires wisdom on
your part because a lot of people they kind of
watch these videos they watch one or two and then
they don't really do anything about it and they miss
out on what's possible with these videos what's possible is
that if you watch these videos every single week has
a release more content and then you take baby steps
and do a little bit of the exercise that I
tell you to do take some of the action that
I tell you to do build some of the habits
that I tell you to do then over the next
few years what's going to happen if you do this
consistently is you're going to develop psychological self mastery you're
going to develop a deeper self mastery then like a
PhD psychology professor has and what that's going to allow
you to do is to literally construct whatever kind of
life you want and your life is going to take
on flavors of of joy and beauty and not just
these wonderful high consciousness qualities that very few people ever
tap into and kind of my mission is to help
more people tap into that so you know if you
can see the potential in that if you have the
wisdom to see that if you're not just a little
magic pill solution then I recommend you stick around sign
up and you'll see some big changes changes you might
not even be able to stat this point because this
stuff goes extremely deep and I'm excited to go deep
with you on it so sign up stay tuned and
I'll see you soon you
