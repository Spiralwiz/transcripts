hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to deal
with strong negative emotions what you're about to get right
here is V master key the master key to dealing
with all kinds of negative nasty emotions this is the
key right here what do I mean by strong negative
emotions well I mean the entire spectrum everything from sadness
to hurt to loss feelings that you have lost someone
close to you as with a death the strong emotions
and feelings that come with heartbreak when someone has betrayed
you or has abandoned you or has left you fear
nervousness anger so all that stuff all the stuff we
hate how do we deal with these kinds of emotions
effectively I'm going to show you right here and it's
extremely simple the author of a book called the road
less traveled Scott Peck he says the following that book
quote the tendency to avoid emotional suffering is the cause
of all mental illness to lead a healthy spiritual life
we must face problems directly and experience the pain involved
and quote so the solution to dealing with strong negative
emotions is very very simple it's to allow yourself to
fully feel the emotion that's it that's the solution this
is a very counterintuitive solution though counterintuitive and countered is
an interesting thing because to get success in almost any
facet of life and to be doing effective personal development
work if you do a lot of it what you're
going to discover is that success comes from counterintuitive moves
you have to do something counterintuitive that normally your psyche
would not want to do it's like the exact opposite
of what you think you should do it's kind of
like instead of running away from your assailant you charge
at your assailant that would be an example of a
counterintuitive move and it's the same thing here now why
is this counterintuitive why is it counter to if to
just allow the negative emotion to wash over you and
to feel it fully well because we don't want to
let our guard down and we don't want to be
vulnerable and we think that when we allow ourselves to
be vulnerable that somehow this makes us weak and this
exposes us to danger and this puts us in harm's
way when in fact it's actually the opposite of that
but it's hard for your ego to see this at
first it's hard for your ego to accept that it
should allow itself to feel the full impact of a
strong negative emotion because what your ego wants to do
is it wants to resist and deny and run away
and it wants to feel pleasant and good that's what
it want it wants to candy it doesn't want to
eat the vegetables it wants to eat the candy but
what we have to do here if we're going to
make this move successfully and I'm going to help you
to do that by giving you a little process simple
but powerful process is we have to start to become
okay with allowing ourselves to be vulnerable this doesn't make
you small or weak or effeminate it's actually the opposite
of all those now you might wonder well why should
I allow myself to be vulnerable if I'm vulnerable want
to get hurt isn't that what's happened in the past
and you're right in a sense because actually what your
psychology consists of especially if you have neurotic psychology if
you have problems in your life in relationships and work
with finances all these different areas if you have problems
they're actually the reason you have those problems is because
early on in your childhood you received wounds and you
did open yourself up and you were vulnerable and what
happened is that you got hurt and so what you
did is you have to close yourself down because the
hurt was so painful the vulnerability was so painful that
what you do what you did is that you you
started erecting defenses in various shields to protect yourself and
you adopted certain vows and you told yourself I will
never again allow myself to be vulnerable with people or
in an intimate relationship or with my career with my
finances or with some other situation and you made all
sorts of vows like this and these were all defenses
that you erected and now what you do is you
spend a lot of your mental energy maintaining these defenses
but these offenses are all a sham it seems like
they protect you but actually part of becoming a mature
emotional emotionally healthy adult is to dismantle all the defenses
that you erected in your childhood and in your teenage
years because you start to see that they weigh you
down and you start to see that they prevent you
from being aligned with the truth the truth is really
our Savior here when it comes to emotions and it
comes to understanding vulnerability and if you're wondering well Leah
why should I allow myself to be vulnerable don't I
need these defenses well here's the fact here's the truth
the real truth that you haven't been admitting to yourself
is that you actually are vulnerable you are doesn't matter
how many defenses you've put up you're still vulnerable here's
an example I like to think about when I think
about vulnerability imagine one of those macho tough guys that
you see at the gym the guy who does steroids
and he's all buffed up and he's got these beautiful
muscles and he's in there every to everyday you know
you see him working out real hard and he can
bench like 400 pounds this Arnold Schwarzenegger looking guy all
right so this is like the macho guy the in
vulnerable guy this guy surely is not vulnerable so there
I am at the gym and he's there he's he's
pumping his uh four hundred pounds on the bench press
well as he's doing that and he looks so macho
and and vulnerable and he also has that kind of
way that he carries himself also you know that kind
of like macho alpha male kind of thing okay well
he's got that going for him but as he's lifting
up his four hundred pounds on the bench press if
I walk up to him with a gun and pointed
at his head and click the trigger that's it lights
out for him all the muscles in the world and
all the macho acting and posing in the world and
all the macho talk in the world is not going
to change that I don't care who you are you
are vulnerable I don't care if you're the richest person
in the world the strongest person in the world a
military dictator surrounding himself by thousands of bodyguards it doesn't
matter you're still vulnerable and in fact the more you
try to defend yourself the more vulnerable you are it's
just a lie assault it's just a sham you see
how this works so let's not kid ourselves let's actually
admit and be adults here admit that we are vulnerable
and that we can get hurt and that we can
even get killed those are the stakes of life now
what do we do about this your job is not
to play defense your job is to become a superconductor
they have wires wires regular household wires conduct current now
current is connected through metallic material and then this material
has a conductive property to it and also have something
called resistance resistance is the inherent nature of the material
the metal which resists the flow of current through it
and it heats up and after a certain point it
can start to melt the wire so the reason I
talk about this because this is a really good analogy
for what you want to do with your negative emotions
instead of resisting them which is what you typically do
this is the standard automatic ego reaction is to resist
every negative emotion we all do it what we want
to do is we want to open ourselves up and
develop ourselves emotionally to the point where we become superconductors
and a superconductor is a material that allows current to
pass through it with zero resistance this is actually not
science fiction it's actually possible they do this in the
laboratory there are materials at certain temperatures where you can
create a wire and pass current through it through very
long distances and not a single drop of that electricity
is ever lost to resistance and no heat is generated
it's quite amazing now what's possible analogously is to become
a human being that way a superconducting human being takes
work though take some real inner work but this is
what's up ash as people are is they become better
and better super conductors of negative emotions and all emotions
in general this is what developing emotional maturity means so
let me talk a little bit about your automatic ego
reaction what is this this is what happens to you
when you first get a little tingle or a little
stab of that negative emotion whatever it is here's what
your ego automatically does it doesn't want to just open
up and feel it what it wants to do is
it wants to act stoic and cool or it wants
to deny that this is even happening the third thing
it does is it wants to distract with entertainment with
drugs with food with sex or some other distraction the
other thing that likes to do is it likes to
hide it likes to suppress the fact that this is
happening sweep it under the rug somehow the other thing
you like to do is it likes to suck it
up you tense up all the muscles in your stomach
and in your body unconsciously and you suck it up
and you just hold it in you take that pain
and the last thing I'd like to do is I
like to control and manipulate so rather than feel it
you start to come up with some kind of scheme
for how to change it or how to get your
way out of it how to weasel your way out
these are all typical ego reactions this is all this
stuff we're going to be fighting against so to speak
by opening ourselves up and allowing and not doing anyone
of these these things here they kill your ability to
super conduct what happens is they create resistance and then
from that resistance gets created most of your suffering see
one thing you have to realize here which is very
counterintuitive is that when you open yourself up and you
actually become vulnerable and you let down your guard you
think like oh that's going to hurt me it's going
to damage me but actually no when you suffer and
get damaged emotionally it's because you resist it's because you
hold back not because you allow yourself to fully open
up and that's the counterintuitive thing and we need to
train your mind for that so let me give you
a process here that you can use for any negative
emotion that you encounter in your life that you want
to work through so go ahead right now and if
you have a strong negative emotion with you right now
that you're kind of holding or carrying around great if
you don't think you can just kind of pretend we'll
quickly go through the process it's really simple go ahead
and sit upright in your seat and be alert and
I'll take you through some of the steps in this
process conjure up whatever emotion you're trying to work with
here so let's say as an example we're going to
use an emotion of betrayal let's say that your girlfriend
or boyfriend or your spouse has cheated on you and
you feel betrayed and you feel sadness and you feel
like you've really been hurt you've really been hurt so
that we're going to deal with that one so the
first thing I want you to do is I want
you to relax your body relax your body second thing
I want you to do is to get into the
present moment present time right now not into your fantasy
fairytale land of where you're thinking about oh he did
this to me and she did that and I'm going
to get them back in all this no right now
in the present moment that means you're in touch with
your senses you're hearing my voice you're seeing me if
you're watching this on video you're seeing the things around
you and you're feeling things in your body that's what's
happening right now everything else is thought stories forget about
those the next step is connect with your body right
now feel into your body and feel where that hurt
or whatever emotional dealing with feel where that negative emotion
is where is it it's right there in your body
it's nowhere else feel how it feels is there a
tingling sensation in your forehead is there a pain is
there an ache is there a warm sensation a cold
sensation are you expanding are you contracting is it in
your chest is it in your lower abdomen is it
in your hands and your shoulders and your back where
is it what's the quality of it is it big
as it smalls it tight is it loose is it
like a void and a vacuum do you feel hollow
and sad or do you feel tight and angry don't
judge anything that's there just notice literally what's there the
next step is to fully feel what is there open
yourself to it and fully feel it let it in
the next step is to allow allow is a little
bit different than just fully feeling allowing saying to yourself
oh it's okay I can allow this I don't need
to resist it it's like giving yourself permission to fully
feel so you're taking that initial fully feeling of it
and you're allowing it and you're kind of expanding it
the way I like to think of it is if
you have water flowing through a channel and you have
a gate like in an irrigation canal you can open
the gate water flows and you can shut the gate
real quick so to allow means you open the gate
and you keep it open and you let the flow
those emotions flow right through you the next step is
to observe with curiosity what's actually flowing through you through
your body you don't want to judge it or label
it or get into any kind of thoughts or concepts
about it just observe and be curious about what's there
why is it there why is it this way not
some other way what is an emotion anyways these are
all interesting questions get curious about it what does hurt
feel like why do I feel hurt but don't go
into stories about why you feel hurt just kind of
be curious and notice what's flowing through you the next
step is I want you to allow again because what's
going to happen is that you're so unused to this
you're so used to resisting that this gate your even
if you open it consciously for a few seconds or
minutes it's going to close right back down as you're
observing these emotions flowing through you you're going to feel
like it's so painful and you're going to be so
afraid of being vulnerable that you're going to just close
it right down so again allow yourself by opening this
thing up just allow give yourself permission to feel it
feel the hurt don't judge it don't resist it and
then the final step which is simply do nothing don't
do anything just feel what's there just sit on your
ass and don't do anything don't distract yourself don't go
order a pizza don't go get some ice cream don't
go have sex don't go starting plans for how you're
going to find your next boyfriend or girlfriend or how
you're going to get back at that person or how
you're gonna let's say you got screwed over in a
business deal it's like well he screwed me over so
I'm gonna do this with my business - no don't
do any of that just sit there and allow your
job is to be a superconductor and nothing else a
superconductor is not some fancy role you know the ego
has difficulty being a suit conductor because the ego likes
to like you know it likes to be front and
center it likes to get all the attention but to
be a good conductor you just need to be there
and not do anything the wire it's not wiggling around
it's not doing anything fancy it's just lying there and
current is passing through it so it's a very passive
role that's the role I want you to play here
all right so that's the whole process very simple challenging
but simple now what's going to happen with you is
that when you get hit by a strong emotion usually
it comes in waves it's like you really get hurt
and you feel it real bad like when you first
let's say hear the news you really feel it and
then it lasts for 15-20 minutes and then it kind
of subsides and then you remember it again an hour
later and it hurts you again and another hour later
hurts you again it comes in waves so what will
happen is that every time you get hit by any
wave I want you to run this process I want
you to open yourself up allow it feel it do
nothing and just keep doing that throughout the day throughout
the week however long these negative emotional spells last for
you okay also what I want you to do is
I want you to notice the tension and tightness in
your body it's certainly there because this is how resistance
happens if you're suffering a negative emotions because you're resisting
it it's not because the emotion is negative and you
resist with your body so what I want you to
do is I want you to relax all the major
areas of your body the belly and stomach area make
sure you let that stick out completely and don't tighten
any of those muscles let it all out don't suck
in your belly your shoulders relax your shoulders make them
loose relax your hands and your arms instead of holding
tight fists just let your hands just flop down wherever
you're placing them your jaw let your jaw go loose
and of course very importantly remember to breathe deep breathe
your chest and breathe all the way down into your
belly it's very important you're going to lose consciousness right
now as I'm telling you these things you're developing more
awareness and consciousness this is what consciousness is just awareness
but then what happens is that later in the day
you'll probably forget and then you'll forget you'll forget will
forget and you'll tighten up and tense up and you'll
resist and this will create problems so just notice that
this is a practice this is a skill you have
to develop over time so just keep practicing this technique
and that's it that's it you don't need to get
rid of negative emotions emotions will go through you and
then they will disappear and they might come again and
then they'll disappear that's how emotions are there's no need
to do anything about them other than to fully feel
them and this is the behavior of a self actualized
highly emotionally mature individual the opposite of a neurotic individual
what's a neurotic individual someone who holds back and resists
reality again noticed that what we're doing here is we're
actually facing reality to resist reality what you have to
do is you have to deny the present moment and
the only way you can deny the present moment of
course the president moment includes all the emotions in your
body is to dissociate from your body by going into
your mind into fairytale land that's where you go that's
the only place you can go if you don't go
into your mind in fairytale land they you're in reality
and if you don't tense up your your body and
your muscles then you let the emotion flow unrestricted and
that's reality that's what is that's what it is before
I let you go I want to tackle a couple
of limiting beliefs you might have about emotions one thing
we got to challenge this belief that negative emotions are
bad quote-unquote negative emotions are bad there actually is no
such thing as a negative emotion or a bad emotion
and emotion is just a sensation coursing through some part
of your body and usually also there's some mental phenomenon
that comes with it some mental imagery or some mental
verbal labels nothing is bad here this is a judgment
if you feel hurt notice that the heart itself is
not bad that's just the ego saying that that's just
a judgment it's not even negative not if you're very
honest you have a habit of resisting that's been developed
over the last however many decades of life you've been
living from basically the very very beginning you've been resisting
emotions this is a habit that's very strongly ingrained in
you and the labeling habit is also strongly ingrained any
time you feel something you don't like even just a
little bit you automatically label it as bad or evil
or negative and you immediately say know one thing you
have to start doing if you want to develop real
emotional maturity is you want to stop labeling things as
bad or negative or evil because as soon as you
do that automatically what happens is that you create a
separation between that thing and yourself and automatically you have
to resist that thing you have to fight that thing
and I'm not telling you this just as some positive
thinking technique like oh you're just gonna you're just going
to do something in your mind to make yourself feel
a little bit better about the situation and you're not
going to be living in truth no this goes a
lot deeper than that what I'm telling you is actually
to live in truth you might think I'm telling you
to live in falsehood if you've never practiced this before
but actually no I'm telling you to live in truth
falsehood is when you call things bad that's falsehood that's
created only in the fairy tales of your mind what's
here in reality is not bad it just is so
the labeling habit you have to stop this the resisting
habit you've to stop this too don't be afraid if
you can't do it immediately it takes lots of practice
lots and lots of practice meditation is very good habit
to teach you this mindfulness is a very good habit
to teach you this I have videos on all those
you can go look those up if you want to
learn more it'll take time to retrain yourself but it'll
be very worth it I want you to notice is
the profound insight is that the feeling of hurt does
not actually hurt you have you noticed this the feeling
of being hurt does not actually hurt you you might
think that allowing negative emotions to just come in there
unrestricted like this could be damaging Leo isn't that dangerous
couldn't I caused myself some kind of psychological damage no
just the opposite what causes psychological damage is resistance a
superconductor is never damaged by electricity even if it's very
strong you could have a lightning rod on top of
a building it gets hit by lightning which has mega
or gigawatts of power in it the lightning rod is
just fine strike after strike after strike why because it
has low resistance doesn't damage the rod electricity just goes
right into the ground perfectly fine and emotion only damages
you when you resist it an emotion only causes suffering
to you when you resist it if you think that
suffering is inherent to hurt or to loss or to
loneliness or to sadness then this just shows you how
emotionally underdeveloped you are how immature you are because the
suffering is not inherent there the suffering is only there
because you resist so if you feel an emotion that's
causing lots of suffering remember oh [ __ ] that
means I must be resisting because if I wasn't resisting
on some level and there's many sneaky levels at which
you could there's many sneaky ways and many levels of
depth at which you could resist these things so just
remember that that the two are connected and there's nothing
inherent there about negative emotions causing you suffering now I
want to give you a couple last pointers here now
I know you came in here with strong negative emotion
you're probably looking for a magic pill the definition of
a magic pill is avoiding of emotional labor what you
were looking for is a technique where you could not
have to feel anything because that's what ego wants it
wants to resist and deny and disown and disconnect from
reality the approach I gave you here is the exact
opposite of what you really wanted but the nice thing
is that I gave you a real solution not a
fake solution they solutions they sweep dirt under the rug
until finally it starts to stink and fester and this
creates a lot of problems in your life a real
solution cleans away that smelly dirt and leads to real
freedom but it takes courage to go in there and
really look under the rug especially if you haven't looked
under the rug for a decade or two takes real
courage to implement this solution you have to grow up
you have to grow the [ __ ] up it's
time to stop being a child and stop being emotionally
immature and it's time to align yourself with what's true
not with what's false it's time to educate yourself about
how emotions actually work and not how you've been taught
that they work or how you suspect or think they
work but how they actually work emotions work in a
very counterintuitive way requires study to know this so commit
yourself to study commit yourself to mastery this is a
process do it not just because you want to get
over this you know this one boyfriend or girlfriend who
cheated on you and betrayed you or this one business
partner who screwed you over don't do it because you
just want to get over this one emotional hiccup that
you have right now in your life that will pass
anyways see the bigger picture here do it for the
vision you have of your dream life do it because
you want to be emotionally mature do it because you
understand that to live your life purpose and to be
self actualized and to live a happy life you need
to master your emotions can you imagine what your life
would look like what every facet of your life would
look like if you became an emotional superconductor what would
your relationships look like what would your career look like
and your business how much more money could you earn
how much more competitive could you be what would your
friendships look like how much self confidence would you have
how much more self-esteem would you have how would you
relate differently to your family and to your children how
much more resourceful would you be how much more effective
would you be in the world how much of a
stronger leader would you be how much more impact could
you have on the world how much more could you
contribute to the world that's why you want to pursue
emotional mastery that's why you want to become a superconductor
because if you can become an emotional superconductor you can
then get extraordinary results across the board in all these
different facets and that's what constitutes your dream life that's
