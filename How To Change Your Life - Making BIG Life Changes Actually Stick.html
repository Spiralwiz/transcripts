hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment we are going to talk about how
to change your life all right this is a deep
deep deep passion of mine that's why I found it
actualized on work is to help people change their lives
because that's the position that I was in really five
years ago so I was really struggling and trying to
figure out how do I change my life and set
it up and design it in such a way that
I'm always happy I'm not dealing with all this fear
and anxiety all these negative emotions and then I'm out
there and I'm financially secure and I have everything that
I want in my life I'm just living an awesome
exciting kind of life how do I get that how
do I go from this mediocre life that I've got
now to this supercharged life that I know I could
have that I see other people having and I know
I'm capable of getting into that kind of life and
then the question for me was well I don't really
know the techniques I don't have any friends that have
done that is it even possible so that was always
on my mind and now after I made this journey
of studying literally over a hundred thousand dollars of personal
development material and making all these radical changes in my
life from starting a business becoming financially independent moving all
across the country improving my dating life dramatically improving my
fitness dramatically losing a lot of weight keeping it off
improving my mindsets getting myself thinking more positively just like
all these changes that have made it's just like it's
shown to me that it's possible and that literally right
now we live in an information era where there are
information products that will help you change your life in
any way that you want and they're not overhyped actually
all these changes are real and they're actually possible the
only question is are you gonna work it are you
gonna work the program are you gonna go out there
and take the initiative and actually decide that you want
to do this are you actually gonna shell out some
money to maybe buy the programs that you need the
books whatever get the help that you need and actually
go out there and capitalize on these opportunities and I
think what's most amazing is that people don't realize that
this is out there for them literally right now you
can create and become whoever you want that doesn't mean
you can fly to the moon but it does mean
that whatever career you want to master you can do
you can do that whatever kind of relationship you want
you can get that whatever kind of family life you
want you can get that whatever changes you want to
make to your beliefs and to any past trauma that
is holding you back you can make all those changes
however good you want to make yourself feel proud optimistic
excited you can do that however much travel you want
to do you can do that however much money you
want to make you can do that so all this
is available to you and the tools are actually available
to you but you do have to go out there
and look and you have to follow certain principles to
do this successfully and these are the principles of success
which are also the principles of change because success in
a lot of ways is how to make great changes
and make sustainable changes because what happens is that most
of us are not lucky enough to be born successful
to be in the kind of situation that we want
to be in for their whole life we usually start
off kind of struggling we don't really know where we're
going where we grow up in a negative environment with
limiting beliefs and friends and family they're not very supportive
and so what happens is that we feel stuck and
we feel like there could be something better and we
don't know that there are certain principles that can be
followed and so changes are necessary and by this process
of making changes you create this exciting life so how
do you actually do this well to do this what
I found I'm going to give you some just some
practical ways this is a very deep topic which I'm
going to cover in other videos on my site but
to create change number one you got to find out
what it is that you want you have to be
very clear about what you want if you don't know
what you want you will not get it you will
you will you will weave around life like this back
and forth and you're gonna be running around life like
a head like a chicken with its head cut off
so you got to get very clear about what it
is that you want you gotta articulate it be very
specific about what your goals are why do you want
to create a vision for yourself once you've got that
down the rest really is just a matter of time
and a little bit of hard work so you have
to be very clear about who you are what you
want what your purpose in life is what your vision
is that's understanding yourself then you want to set some
goals set some bold goals for yourself because if who
you want to be and who you are what your
values are is not aligned with what your life is
like right now then that means you need some change
to get you there and to do that you need
some goals so what are your goals what are specific
things that you want to accomplish in the next year
in the next five years in the next 10 years
sit down make a list and then think about it
and then visualize it and ask yourself is this really
what I want or maybe I would rather prefer this
or maybe that and through this process of introspection and
journaling create a very nice specific list of goals that's
also very important and then of course you can have
to go out there take action on these goals there's
no way to avoid that you can have all the
mindsets and all the all the all the knowledge that
you want but you have to in the end go
out and do some hard work and apply some some
elbow grease to the problem and actually get these things
happening and that's gonna be an unavoidable and unavoidable aspect
of getting any kind of change in your life but
one point that I really want to stress in this
whole process is that the really important part actually is
the psychology it's the inner game that you have with
regards to change because most people try to make change
in their life but they're not able to sustain it
and they fall back to to the place that they
started at and the reason that happens is because they
don't understand that they need to change their inner game
before they really get sustainable change in the external world
the inner game are your beliefs your mindsets your ways
of thinking your your emotional control over yourself right your
discipline level any kind of any kind of mental techniques
that you do like visualizations and affirmations that's what I
talked about that's what I mean when I talk about
inner game so you need to have those things dialed
in before you can get a change like losing a
lot of weight and keeping it off or earning a
million dollars and keeping a million dollars or finding a
good relationship and maintaining that relationship notice that when you're
asking about making a change nobody cares about making a
one-time change and then popping back down the next day
nobody wants to have a million dollars for a day
and then lose it nobody wants to drop 50 pounds
for a week and then lose it nobody wants that
right you want to make a sustainable change yet very
few of us think about change in a sustainable way
very few of us use strategies that are sustainable this
is very true with diets it's very true with pursuing
money very true with relationships so what you've got to
do is you've got to ultimately bite the bullet on
this one and buy into the concept of self mastery
the fact that your success and your ability to change
comes ultimately from your mastery of your own emotions in
your own psychology and that means studying what that is
like that means understanding yourself on a deep level about
you know what are the things that do create change
what are the things that don't create change how do
you self-sabotage how do you think in negative ways that
that keep you from getting to the place that you
want to get to how are old beliefs limiting you
and holding you back how is old conditioning and training
from childhood perhaps holding you back you have to fix
that stuff to get sustainable changes right and you have
to know some techniques to like how do you set
proper goals how do you create a vision how do
you create a personal mission statement what are your values
these are all important to understand because if you don't
understand these these are like the fundamentals of success then
you're not going to be able to have success in
any area of your life and when I say no
success that means no real positive lasting change all right
