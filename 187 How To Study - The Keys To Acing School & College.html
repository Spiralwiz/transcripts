            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/i4EwtuSuF1E' target='_blank'>How To Study - The Keys To Acing School & College</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Emphasize the growth mindset for learning</b>: Studying is a developed skill and not something individuals are inherently good at from birth. Having a growth mindset, the belief that you can improve and are just as capable as anyone else, is essential. Through lots of practice, hard work, and repetition, you can develop amazing studying skills.
</li><li><b>Grades don't define your learning abilities</b>: People often mistakenly focus too much on grades, believing that they're representative of their learning abilities. It's important not to let grades or school bureaucracy define you or limit your potential. 
</li><li><b>Intrinsic motivation is key to becoming a great student</b>: Studying skills should be developed not for approval or grades, but for personal growth and understanding. You should find interest in studying because it is a life skill that impacts all areas of your life.
</li><li><b>Studying should be about understanding life</b>: Life is inherently fascinating. Each topic or subject offers understanding and insight into different aspects of life and the universe, irrespective of if they seem trivial. 
</li><li><b>Finding your passion and pursuit</b>: It's important to decide what fascinates you and how you want to approach learning - whether you want to delve into the details or piece together the bigger picture.
</li><li><b>Importance of Intrinsic Interest in Studying</b>: Studying should not be solely motivated by the need to do well on tests. It's important to set aside societal expectations and pressures and instead focus on the fundamental core, which is the genuine desire to understand life and various aspects of it. Intrinsic fascination and interest in a subject, whether it's how technology functions, human psychology, historical happenings, or the working of economies, fuels effective studying.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Close-mindedness towards Certain Subjects</b>: It is natural to lean towards certain subjects more than others, but it is crucial not to label one's self as 'bad' at certain subjects out of aversion. For instance, one might express disinterest in mathematics. Instead of affirming this disinterest, it is helpful to explore reasons for it and acknowledge that every subject, being a part of reality, holds its own patterns and logic that can be fascinating. This mindset is particularly important in school where certain subjects are mandatory, regardless of personal preference.
</li><li><b>Choosing Subjects of Study</b>: As one advances through school, more options to choose subjects of preference become available. It is advisable to select subjects that truly fascinate and interest you. Even in case of less preferred subjects, finding something intriguing about them can improve the studying experience and effectiveness. It is possible to find satisfaction in learning almost anything if the mind is open to it.
</li><li><b>Listing Deeply Fascinating Areas of Life</b>: This exercise helps identify the areas one is genuinely interested in and would like to research and learn more about. These areas need not be limited to academic subjects and may extend to hobbies, interests, and various aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Repetition as the Key to Learning</b>: Learning is fundamentally about repetition. Through repeated exposure to the same information, the brain eventually learns and memorizes it, regardless of complexity or quantity. The real power of repetition, however, lies in how it facilitates the mind in making deeper interconnections and understanding patterns more than plainly memorizing facts. Consciously immersing oneself in the field of study and repeating information helps this process.
</li><li><b>Enjoyment of Studying</b>: Essential for becoming a good student is enjoying the activity of studying. Being intrinsically motivated and enjoying studying leads to better academic performance and overall learning experience.
</li><li><b>Actual Study Procedure</b>: A quiet, distraction-free space is essential for effective studying. One needs to schedule their time around studying rather than the other way round. Remember that for high school and college students, studying essentially is their full-time job. Hence, time should be allocated thoughtfully and dedicatedly towards it.
</li><li><b>Study Schedule</b>: Leo sets a regular schedule for studying. It usually begins at 6 pm and can last several hours depending on the amount of assignments he has. He keeps Friday and Saturday as his days off and includes study time on Sunday to prepare for Monday's classes.
</li><li><b>Slow Down and Be Patient</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to slow down and become comfortable when studying, suggesting that rushing through materials only leads to a superficial understanding. He promotes honest effort, patience, and repetition when faced with challenging concepts, even if it takes longer to grasp them.
</li><li><b>Value Dedication and Curiosity</b>: Leo encourages a change of mindset towards studying. He discourages studying merely for the sake of passing exams or seeking parents' approval. Instead, he advocates for a genuine curiosity and interest in various subjects and educational connections.
</li><li><b>Understanding Over Memorization</b>: Leo underscores the importance of understanding concepts rather than solely memorizing facts. He argues that it is essential to gain depth into the subject matter and seek accuracy in understanding, as it is fundamental to genuinely knowing how things work.
</li><li><b>Note-taking and Retention Mechanisms</b>: Leo stresses the significance of taking and keeping notes as an effective study technique. He also discusses the practice of self-testing by asking oneself questions about the material read and recalling the answers until they're correct and memorable. 
</li><li><b>Key to Learning</b>: Leo states that effective learning and memory retention need successful recall of the information. He insists on active recall as being central to the study process and underlines the fact that information is genuinely learned only when it is correctly recollected.
</li><li><b>Recalling for Effective Memorization</b>: Leo underlines the importance of recalling information multiple times for effective memorization. It strengthens the brain's recall process and is a vital aspect of studying.
</li><li><b>Building Momentum takes Time</b>: Leo emphasizes that becoming a great student is not immediate but a process that takes time. It involves building momentum, good habits, and integrating all these aspects into one's mindset over weeks or even months. 
</li><li><b>The Purpose of Studying</b>: Studying is not just about gaining knowledge but also for building discipline and healthy habits that you can apply to other areas of life. From studying, you learn how to understand reality and design your life according to your desires. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Rest and Sleep</b>: Leo advises avoiding cramming and emphasizes the need for proper rest and sleep during studying. Giving yourself enough time for rest, including naps and long sleep durations on weekends, is crucial as studying can be mentally exhausting.
</li><li><b>Shifting away from Cramming and Extrinsic Motivation</b>: Cramming is seen as stressful and unenjoyable. It's crucial to enjoy the process of studying by setting up a comfortable environment, slowing down, and finding intrinsic motivation. The pain of avoiding studying can potentially be worse than studying itself.
</li><li><b>Becoming an Effective Student</b>: Discipline, a good study environment, and appreciating the process of learning can lead to becoming an effective student. With these habits, one can achieve high academic success and carry the acquired wisdom into other parts of life.
