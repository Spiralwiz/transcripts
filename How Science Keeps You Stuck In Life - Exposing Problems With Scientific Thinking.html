Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this video,
I want to cover an interesting topic, I want to
talk about how to stop using science as an ego
defense mechanism. You know, there is an interesting thing that
I've noticed, as I've been publishing more and more my
videos and interacting with more and more of you guys
out there, my audience. And one of the things that
I noticed is that what sometimes people will do to
keep themselves stuck in life, and not getting the results
that they really want. In whatever area of life they
want it, whether it's career or relationships, or health, or
their own personal inner development, is that they will use
this idea of silence and the lack of proof that
I'm providing as a reason not to listen to the
advice and as a listener, a reason to stay obstinate,
and stay stuck in their current paradigm. So what I
want to do this video is go into some detail
about how this really works and what's really going on.
Because, nowadays, we are very scientifically minded. And anything that
gets the label of science attached to it is automatically
perceived as being true as being accurate, as being superior
to anything that gets the label attached as religious, or
woowoo, or hippie or positive thinking and these other kinds
of labels, that imply that somehow these ideas or concepts
are not as important, not as significant, not as accurate
as ones that are scientific. But this is an interesting
thing, because there's a lot of nuance here between what
is scientific and what's not scientific. And I think that
a lot of well intentioned, scientific thinking people will get
themselves stuck, because what they do is they follow science
in a dogmatic sort of way. And this is preventing
them from going out there taking the practical, more practical
types of steps they need to take to actually improve
their life. Because there is a difference between clearly proving
something on the one hand, and then actually doing something
that works and generates results in your life. On the
other hand, these are two very, very different things. And
one common assumption that I see people making, especially people
that are really into science, and think of themselves as
honouring truth and being very intellectually rigorous, I mean, don't
get me wrong, I love that, I think it's very
important to be intellectually rigorous, because there honestly, there is
a lot of bullshit out there in society. And we've
come from a tradition, honestly, for the last couple 1000
years, where there was lots and lots and lots of
bullshit. And slowly, we're weeding that out of our system
out of our social matrix as, as it were, we're
slowly weeding more and more of that out, which is
great. You know, with the internet, we have better resources,
better sources of information. Also, we have worse sources of
information. So you have to be more careful about what
kind of information you do believe and don't believe, but
in general, I think we're getting better and better at
that our information overall is getting more and more accurate.
But just because our theory, and our scientific models getting
more and more accurate, that doesn't necessarily translate into getting
you the results that you want in your life. This
is a very big distinction that we need to make
here. Just because we have some sort of mathematical proof,
or a scientific study, or an experiment, or something was
written in a textbook, or some college professor told you
something. Just because you have that kind of intellectual academic
rigor behind a certain idea or concept, doesn't mean that
you could just go blindly apply that concept and get
good results in your life. And this is actually why
IQ doesn't correlate with life success that much. Studies have
actually been done on this. And what they found is
that after you get about over 120, and 130, IQ,
any extra IQ beyond that has to actually start to
hurt you and diminish your results in life and your
success. Because what's more important in life is having emotional
intelligence, rather than just pure intellectual logical intelligence. Because your
logic even though it has a lot of good things
to it, and you can use it to do a
lot of powerful stuff in life. It can also be
become a trap for you. Because you start thinking down
this very narrow alley, and you miss everything else that's
around you. You basically become too narrow, focused, and really
to be successful at life. I think one of the
things that I'm doing with actualize that org is I'm
trying to, to paint a big model, a holistic model
of how life works and how you can get the
results that you want in your life. So sometimes I'll
hear people leaving me these kinds of comments, frankly, So
if I'm talking about topics like depression, or positive thinking,
or attracting women, or even nutritional type topics about nutrition
and health, or if I'm talking about enlightenment, any of
these kinds of topics, someone might come in there and
say, BillyOh, Where's the proof? Where's that double blind study
that we need to show us that what you're saying
is accurate and that it will work. Leo, show me
a double blind study, rigorously performed, peer reviewed study. And
then I'll believe you, and then I'll start to follow
your advice. I hear this kind of this kind of
objection to be made. Now, this is a very dangerous
when I hear this, it shows me that there's, there's
too much of a narrow focus in that person's mind
on this, this kind of criteria of, of studies, and
scientific backing and proof. And what's actually going on on
there is, is very deceptive. It's actually an ego game,
that you're playing with yourself when you're saying that, because
what that's doing is creating blind spots within you. And
those blind spots actually are very cleverly designed to keep
you stuck where you're at, in life. So it's not
really about science, it's not really about proof. It's more
about justifications, which your mind is extremely good at coming
up with, for keeping you in your current situation life,
whether that's your current financial situation, or your current relationship
situation, or your current lack of results and success in
business, or career, or health or fitness, or anything else
like that. So it's tricky, you gotta you gotta really
watch out for yourself, because in a lot of ways,
your own mind is your own greatest enemy. So this
idea of the double blind study, the peer reviewed study,
you know, almost everything I talked about, first of all,
I talk about it, and I don't really go out
of my way to prove this stuff to you guys.
Why? Because honestly, you know, I used to be kind
of obsessed about that in the past. In my youth,
I was very focused on, you know, what is the
truth? How can we prove the truth? How can we
justify and make sure that the truth is proved, conclusively,
intuitively, actually, life is so complex, that this kind of
criteria of always even proof and knowing the truth all
the time, that's going to come back to bite you,
what that's doing is if you set that kind of
criteria for yourself in life, then you're, you might be
telling yourself that you're honoring truth, and you're being very
intellectually rigorous. But actually, what you're doing is you're, you're
binding your hands, you kind of like, tie your hands
behind your back, and then you're going and trying to
live life. That way, I feel that to really understand
like, you have to just kind of like get in
there and sort of experiment around a teacher, right. And
don't think that this is somehow anti scientific, this is
very scientific, this is kind of the heart of science
is to tinker around with stuff. The problem is, though,
that a lot of the science that's that's kind of,
that's being perpetuated, and like, kind of like the typical
science that we assume is, oh, this is science, nowadays,
you know, that, that means it has to be in
a journal, it has to be peer reviewed, it has
to be coming from some PhD has to be coming
from a university, it has to be backed by some
sort of, by some sort of, you know, credentialed institution.
And although you know, nothing against that, that's great. There's
a lot of good scientists doing a lot of amazing
work out there, especially in the fields of psychology and
positive psychology. Nowadays, there's a lot of good work being
done there. And we can use that stuff. But we
don't want to limit ourselves just to that, because academics
is a very specific type of game. And make no
mistake that academia is a big, big, big game. And
it's happening within a big bureaucracy. And there are limitations
within that in life is a lot more than what
is encapsulated by this bureaucracy, by our government, or by
our school systems, or by our college institutions, there's a
lot more to life, and life is extremely messy. And
life is very complex. And there's stuff about life that
quite frankly, we don't know yet. And there's also errors
that we've made in our previous analysis and judgments. And
moreover, the way that science has done a lot of
times in universities is dealing with individual variables. A lot
of times, what a scientist will do is he'll pick
a very specialized problem within the field of physics, or
chemistry, or biology, or even social science or political science,
whatever kind of science we're doing, and then he'll get
to work studying that. But you got to understand that
it's like a very small slice of a much, much,
much bigger pie. And this one little cross section, even
if we can get some really good information there by
running a study or an experiment, or doing surveys or
however we're gonna go about doing our science. That's just,
that's just one facet of this much bigger thing. And
what I've always been, like fascinated by and I always
felt was very important. To get a much broader, more
holistic picture, very few things in life can be shown
and demonstrated with a double blind study. Some things can,
but a lot of things can't. And the most practical
stuff that you do in your day and in your
life, the decisions that you make on a practical basis,
the business decisions you make the relationship decisions, you make
the career decisions, you make, the health and fitness decisions
you make, the decisions you make about the trajectory of
your life, all that kind of stuff, this is a,
this is a very rich, extremely multivariate situation. There are
so many there are 1000s of variables and some of
these decisions and some of these strategies. So to say
that you need a double blind study, to prove, for
example, that, you know, one particular technique might work and
help you with your depression. Or to show you that
positive thinking is something that you should be doing in
your life. Or to show you all the benefits and
the effects of meditation, or to show you, for example,
how to attract a woman in your life. Or to
show you exactly what kind of food you should be
eating, and it will kind of exercise you should be
doing. That's, that's just a standard that we can't meet
right now. Maybe in the future, maybe 500 years from
now, 1000 years from now, we would have analyzed this
to such a degree that we'll know exactly very scientifically,
demonstrably, how some of this stuff works. But right now
we're very, very, very far away from that. Science is
very good at working with things that contain few variables.
Science starts to break down when you're working with stuff
that contains many, many, many, many variables. Because you can't
track all of them. At the same time. We don't
have the instruments, we don't have the time, the resources
to do all that stuff. So I sometimes hear that
scientific minded people will make fun of the social sciences.
They'll make fun of the social sciences, they'll say stuff
like, well, that's not real science. Real science is math.
Real science is physics and chemistry. And it'd be biology,
since it's very tangible stuff that has laws behind it.
You know, political science, social science, psychology, that's not a
real science, they'll say, because there's a lot of room
for fudging there. It's interesting, because that's one way you
could look at it. Another way you can look at
it, is this way that I'm about to tell you,
is that actually science, math, and physics and chemistry and
biology. These are the easy sciences. Right? They're the easy
ones. Why are they easy? Well, even though studying math
might be difficult, and studying physics and chemistry, biology might
be difficult compared to let's say, studying psychology. In a
college classroom. Actually, psychology is a lot more complex. There
are so many variables within psychology, that are so difficult
to, to grasp to track, because they're very nebulous, you're
dealing with human beings, which literally are systems comprised of
trillions of cells. Your brains comprise of, you know, billions
of neurons all interconnected in interesting ways. And you're dealing
with so much input that's going into your brain getting
analyzed and getting, like molded and remoulded. It's hard to
track a system like that. Where as with simple math
equation, or a physics equation, or understanding the laws of
motion, or understanding some sort of chemical reaction, or some
sort of biological system, that's a lot easier. Because the
more like, fundamental you get in life, for example, when
you're studying cells, or you're even studying molecules, or even
individual atoms, or within the atoms, you're studying the subatomic
particles, actually, it gets simpler and simpler and simpler. But
as you go up levels in life, you start to
study actual living organisms. And then even more advanced than
that is social interactions, right? The emotions that organ that
these organisms are having and the social interactions that they're
having with one another. There are so many variables at
play, that you can't have a simple formula or equation.
You can maybe there is a formula behind it, but
you would have hundreds of 1000s Maybe millions of variables
in it is very hard for our human minds to
grasp that scientific models because what they're doing is they're
simplifying life, always simplifying, simplifying, simplifying, they work really well
for stuff that actually is simple and only has a
few variables. Once you get into a lot of variables,
then it's harder and harder to get demonstrable kind of
provable results. And there's less and less situations where a
simple one, you know, one line formula or equation will
tell you what's right or what you should be doing
or how things will play out. And what's interesting is
that where do we live life? As human beings, you
know, your practical everyday life, where is that lived is
that lived at the level of subatomic particles, or atoms,
or cells, or the individual, let's say mammalian organism as
a mammal, or doesn't even go beyond that, and you're
living in, in a very, very rich social matrix. Right?
We live in a society, we live in a government,
we live in a district, we live in a state,
we live in a city, we live with our family,
we live in a social circle, we live in a
marriage we live with, with kids. So all of this
stuff is this, you know, very high level we live
in at a very high level of life. And if
you want to actually get good results on this high
level, then you have to start thinking and working on
this level, rather than trying to take principles from the
low level and thinking that they're gonna apply in high
level, and that they're gonna get good results in the
high level just because they're true at the low level.
So this is the fundamental mistake that I see people
making here, though, who are very scientific minded. Is that
Yes, sure. I mean, there's great science being done. And
we know a lot of stuff about the fundamentals of,
of our reality. And we can use that stuff to
build amazing things. I mean, we can build airplanes and
rockets, and computers and cell phones, and we've got the
internet, we've got all this amazing technology. But in a
sense, that's, that's the easy stuff. That's why we have
that stuff is because it was easy to make, right?
The stuff that's easy to make that comes first in
human evolution, the stuff that's hard to make comes later.
And what's harder to make is to actually get people
to create the kind of life that they want, right?
Why is it that we have internet, and we have
this amazing technology, and we can send a man to
the moon, but yet, there's record depression numbers, record number
of people are depressed. People can't get a business going.
People are stuck in codependent relationships, record numbers of overweight
people, like half the country is obese. Why do we
have all these psychological problems, life problems, you might say
just very practical, Ordinary, ordinary, everyday problems. Yet we have
such a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, we understand quantum
mechanics so well, that literally we can produce computer chips
that can do billions, if not trillions of calculations per
second. But yet we can't solve the problem of obesity.
We can't solve the problem of neurotic negative thinking. We
can't get people meditating properly. We can't get people exercising
properly. We can't get people having relationships. Well, we have
about a 40% divorce rate. So we have all these
practical, everyday problems. And yet, we're very advanced on the
kind of technical geeky technological level? Well, my answer to
that is that that's the easy stuff. The hard stuff
is actually, you know, dealing with your mind here, because
there's so many variables here. And there's no, there's no
simple formula for how this works. So I think one
thing that you have to do is have to start
to drop your expectations for these rigorous double blind studies.
Sometimes you can get them and you when you will,
we can get one of those. Yeah, that's great. For
example, with meditation, there's been a lot of studies done
over the last 50 years about the benefits of meditation.
And I don't think they even go far enough. Even
though so many benefits have been studied. I think that
still there's a lot that's missing there that we still
haven't found, as long as you know, people are working
on on that every day, I'm sure there's research being
done right now about even more benefits to meditation. So
we can, we can track that stuff. And that's great.
And I love, you know, introducing scientific proofs and backing
when it's available. But generally, I don't care about that.
Because here's the approach that I take to get good
results in my life. I'm actually very scientifically oriented. But
I kind of take the heart in the spirit of
science, which to me, is really tinkering and being able
to produce the results that you want in life. One
way to understand science is to say science is trying
to get us an understanding of life to find out
what truth is, right? Another way to understand science, is
to say that really, science is about recreating predictable results.
Because why do we care about science, because it allows
us to have a better way to architect and manipulate
life in a way that is conducive to us. So
if you want something in your life, science can help
you get it, right. That's kind of what technology is
so great at is to helping you to get stuff.
Well, if we take this idea and we apply to
our own personal lives, then we can see that really,
we can be scientists of our own lives. And this
doesn't mean that you have to study math, or that
you have to wear a lab coat to do rigorous
studies or you have to be in a university with
the academic. It simply means that you take an empirical
approach to life. That means you're eager to go out
there and try stuff, right. The scientific process is very
simple. You come up with As a possible hypothesis about
how something works, then you go out there and you
try it. You work with it, you tinker with it,
you see, does it work? Does it not work? If
it does work, then you start to suspect that maybe
your hypothesis was correct. And you could do a little
further testing to refine it. If it doesn't work, then
you can see, okay, my hypothesis was wrong. Let me
repeat, work my hypothesis, and then go back and try
it again. And you keep doing that again, and again
and again. And as you iterate and keep going, keep
going, keep going, you start to get a better and
deeper understanding of what actually works. And over time, you
can build up these models that will help you to
create whatever kind of results you want in your life.
And this is kind of the approach that I take
with my own personal development. I'm not so concerned about
reading a book that proves conclusively to me that meditation
is good for me. I'm not too concerned about reading
a book about what is the ultimate food that I
should be eating, that's the healthiest. I'm not too concerned
about reading a book that will tell me whether positive
thinking is good or bad for me. What I'm more
interested in is my feelings. How do I feel from
the stuff that I'm doing in my life? If I'm
advancing in my career, am I seeing the results that
I want there? Is it making me feel the way
that I want? If I'm doing fitness work, and I'm
doing nutrition work? Is it making me feel the way
that I want? Does it make me look the way
that I want? And that look, is that making me
feel good too? Ultimately, it all boils? It comes back
down to feelings, right? Because your personal life? What do
you really care about in your life? Do you honestly
care about some sort of theory? Or are you what
you're really after is an emotion we might give it
the umbrella term of happiness, what you're really after is
happiness. Maybe you're after other types of emotions, you're after
love, after excitement. Because the good emotions, and you're also
trying to avoid the bad emotions, anger, sadness, frustration, loneliness,
depression, these kinds of emotions. So everything that you're doing
in your life, all your actions are ultimately aimed at
increasing your happiness. But sometimes these actions are successful, sometimes
not a lot of people don't even realize that this
is what they're doing in their life is every action
they're taking, no matter how small or how big is
aimed at increasing their happiness. But a lot of times,
that doesn't work, simply because the action that you take
they, they have the opposite effect. So what science to
me is in my own life, is to try this
stuff out and see what works for me, what doesn't
work for me. Because another thing you have to realize
about these double blind studies is that a lot of
times these studies, they're designed to help scientists understand sort
of general trends within large numbers of people. But in
the end, you don't care about that. Because you might
be different than the average crowd. And what's good for
you, what's appropriate for you what's going to produce the
best results for you might not be at all what's
what's right and appropriate for the general population. So even
if there is a study out there that says, well,
the average person should be doing this, or for the
average person who works this way. I mean, that's all
well and good, that might give you that might give
me kind of a hint of what maybe I want
to try out next to my life. But ultimately, you
have to do a very personal science here. This is
the science of No, no PhD, no doctor, no, no
student can do for you, you have to go do
this for yourself, right, you have to try it out
for yourself, and see how it fits in which everything
else in your life. holistic thinking, this is a really
big concept. I want to cover it more in other
videos, that this idea of holistic thinking, where you're not
just thinking about one little piece of your life, but
you're thinking about how all the pieces fit together. And
I find that this is one of the problem with
studies and was kind of traditional science is that what
they'll do is let's say you've got this giant jigsaw
puzzle, 1000 pieces, what they'll do is they'll take four
of those pieces, and they'll fit them all together and
say, hey, look, we got a little piece of the
picture right here. Look, it's it's nice and pristine. It's
very clear. It's very, very well documented. Here it is.
I mean, that's well and good. And when a scientist
does that, he might win a Nobel Prize for putting
those four pieces together, he might win a lot of
recognition. And we get published in a journal that might
go on and you know, create some sort of new
business suit or a new technology might spring up from
that. And that's great. But in my own life, what
I'm concerned about is the very, very big picture, right?
Like the 10,000 foot perspective of all these pieces fitting
together. How does this piece fit together with the other
996 pieces in my 1000 piece puzzle? Because even though
this little four piece, puzzle configuration might be well on
its own, when I add it to everything else here,
it might not make any sense, or it might fit
in in a different way. Or I might have to
rearrange these pieces somehow to make it fit with everything
else. And that's kind of the thing with studies is
that a lot of times what studies will do is
that they will tell you that something is true in
a very narrow, narrowly defined context. And a lot of
times this context is a laboratory setting. It's not a
real life setting. It's not the kind of study that
you have sitting in your home, sitting in your office,
running your business, in your family in your relationship. Don't
get me wrong, some studies actually do go out there
and try to get more of those kinds of practical
situations. And, you know, positive psychology is great at doing
the kind of work. But I think even there, a
scientist still has to narrow stuff down stuff to put
like, put his or her conclusions and discoveries into this
little box, and say, okay, under these conditions, in these
situations, this is what works. This is maybe what produces
general happiness, this may be what causes your depression, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But that doesn't mean that
it's going to really apply to you, you have to
go figure out does this apply to you? How well
does it apply to you? How do you have to
custom tailor this thing? That's how I want to go
about really doing personal development. Right? I think that the
most valuable advice that you'll get in life is never
going to be something that you get in a lab
study. It's not something it's going to be easily observed
in the laboratory. And that's because like I said, these
laboratory studies are not holistic enough. They give you little
technical points, and you can use them to fine tune
what you're doing in your life, that's great. But they're
not good for general life strategies, right? No lab study,
for example, is going to tell you who you should
marry. No lab study is going to tell you how
much you should meditate. For some of you should meditate
more than others for so you should do one type
of meditation for others, you should do other other type
of meditation. So even though there is a study that
tells you the meditation is good, it doesn't, that's not
enough for you, you have to go out there and
custom tailor and apply it in your life, right kind
of integrated into you know, study is going to tell
you how to become a millionaire. No study is going
to tell you how to succeed in your career. Your
specific career, sure, you might get general advice, but how
to succeed in your career. Specifically, no study is going
to tell you that. This is what where wisdom comes
in, right wisdom is required for this. That's why I
love to read and study and listen to people from
a wide variety of different sources. Because what happens is
that when you look and you study all these different
sources, they come together in your mind, you get a
very big picture, you develop wisdom, you can then use
this wisdom to make decisions to create strategies for your
life. So that you can create priorities, you can set
different values, right? Science is not going to help you
with this kind of stuff. And quite honestly, when you
expect and demand from me or from anybody else, to
prove to you that you should be doing something. That's
a pretty silly expectation to put out there. Because honestly,
99.9% of the stuff that you do every single day
very practically, has no studies behind it has no science
behind it, you just do it, you do it out
of habit you do out of social convention, you do
it because your parents told you to do it. You
do it because of peer pressure. You do it because
of your wisdom. You do it because of your intuition.
You do it because of your emotions. So you're guided
by all these. You might say loosey goosey type concepts.
They're not very scientific. The reason they're not scientific, it's
not that they're not actually scientific. I mean, you could
do science on them. The problem is that there's so
many variables in there, the science can't cope with that.
Science copes with very simple truths, not complex truths. So
that's something you got to keep in mind. You also
got to keep in mind that the university system, the
system of doing kind of traditional academic research, PhDs and
all that kind of stuff. It's it's a flawed system.
And I see this as a dangerous thing that a
lot of people do is what they'll do is they
say, well, where's your PhD? Leo? Did you go get
a degree? Are you a licensed therapist? Have you done
the research? Do you have a Harvard diploma? Who has
who has the peer reviewed your work? To me this
is kind of laughable, because I don't like I don't
want to be in that in that home game. I
mean, there's great stuff that's coming out of that system,
but there's also big constraints in that system. Right that
school academic system, because I said Giant bureaucracy, that academic
stuff. And a lot of those studies are great. A
lot of those studies are complete garbage. A lot of
those studies are scientists who don't have any real world
experience with starting a business or attracting a woman, or
creating a great relationship. Going out there doing some research,
interviewing some college kids on campus, coming up with some
sort of theories been proving them under extremely narrow circumstances,
extremely artificial situations. And then throwing that that study out
there as though it applies to everybody in the world,
as though I can now use those results to really
make something of my life. So sometimes that might work.
But a lot of times, that might not work. Frankly,
I see a lot of studies that are just completely
ridiculous. They're not real world, they can't apply. And one
of the best examples of this that I can think
of is with attraction and dating. So there's one thing
that has really made me skeptical about the scientific academic
system. Because if you read textbooks on male female attraction,
they're gonna tell you something very different than what you're
gonna actually experience in real life. So if, for example,
like me, a few years ago, you were really concerned
about how do I get a great girlfriend? How do
I build sexual abundance? How do I attract a really
hot, cute girl that I really want in my life?
How do I practically do that? Science would tell me
something like, well, we've done some research, and one of
the things we found is that females are very attracted
to a symmetrical face. So the more symmetrical Your face
is, the more a female is likely to choose you.
And we've also done some studies that females are attracted
by male pheromones. So if you have more testosterone, maybe
you have a certain type of pheromone that's a little
more potent, that will make a female more attracted to
you. And stuff along these lines. And all those might
actually be true, maybe there is pheromones that females are
attracted to. And maybe a female does prefer a slightly
more symmetrical face. And maybe it is true that females
will prefer one type of face over another type of
face and one type of body over another type of
body. And maybe the waist to hip ratio, when a
guy has a certain number that is slightly more appealing
to a woman, when she's sitting in a laboratory environment
looking at photographs, and is asked to rate them under
extremely artificial conditions, except the thing that I discovered is
that you go out to a nightclub, you go out
to a bar, and all of a sudden, all that
stuff flies out the window. Because you got a totally
different situation, you've got to realize situation, which has so
many variables, and the variables are so different, that any
truth that was in those scientific studies is completely eclipsed
and blown just completely out of importance. There's no importance
to it at all. Because what I discovered is that
if I go out there, and I work on, for
example, my personality, my charisma, on my competence on my
body language, I work on my assertiveness, I simply work
on very simple stuff, like knowing when to pull a
girl out of the nightclub, that if I, if I
studied that kind of stuff, and I go out there,
I practice it. And I interact with 1000s of women,
I talk to guys who have had sex with hundreds
of women, I pick their brains, I see what they
did, right what they're doing wrong, I see their own
growth curve, I apply to my own life, I go
out there and tinker with all this stuff. If I
do that, then when discovered is that I can literally
attract any kind of woman that I want, like the
hottest woman you could imagine, I could attract. And that
it doesn't matter how symmetrical or asymmetrical my faces, or
how little or how much hair I have. Or my
waist to hip ratio, like this stuff is absurd. When
you go into the real world, and you actually like
go into a nightclub, or into a bar and go
try to attract a woman or even with online dating,
or anything like that. So this is just like one
little example, you can find a lot more examples like
this, you can find examples like this with nutrition, too,
I find that science right now about nutrition is very,
very poor. One of the challenges with nutrition is that
there's so many factors with nutrition. And what the nutrition
research has been done now is again, very, very focused
on just isolating individual variables. So for example, you might
read a study, they'll say, oh, omega threes are good
for you. And how do they find that out? Well,
they take some omega three, and maybe they feed it
to rats, or maybe they even take Omega three and
feed it to humans. And then they track those results.
And they see that, you know, certain markers in the
blood are improved. Maybe cardiovascular risk goes down and stuff
like that, right? But in the end, they're only tracking
a couple of factors. And they're not looking at how
that omega three, for example, is interacting with other stuff
that you're eating, other supplements that you're taking other things
that you're doing in your life. So it's very hard
to say that that this stuff is is good or
bad for you. I mean, certain studies are better than
others. But what I find is that a lot of
the nutritional biceps out there is it's just like these
little individual little islands within this giant sea of what's
potentially right and good, you kind of see little, like
flashes of what's right and good, and what's what's wrong
and bad. But right now, the state of nutritional research,
I feel is very inadequate. So it's really hard to
make proper nutrition decisions based on science. Because some studies
will tell you that coffee is great. Some studies will
tell you coffee is bad. And it's great, maybe for
one thing, but it's bad for another thing. And maybe
coffee is good in isolation. Or maybe it's not good
in isolation, maybe it's good if you take it with
other things. But when you mix it with something else,
some other type of food, then all of a sudden
it becomes bad. And how do you judge the quantity
of it that you need. And then also, you're you
have to ask yourself, they're doing a study on a
large number of people. People are different people process coffee
in different ways. So one person might process coffee, and
it might be healthy for them. Maybe other person processes
that coffee differently because he has different slightly different genetics,
and it has a different effect. Right? Same thing with
fats. Same thing with with meat, same thing with all
the different potential supplements and vitamins that you could be
taking. So it's, it's really a very gray area. And
right now, I feel like we're woefully inadequately informed about
this kind of stuff, just because it's very hard to
track 1000s of variables that are going on in your
system, you might be drinking coffee, maybe it's improving some
aspect of your performance. Maybe it's hurting other aspects of
your performance that you can't even track, maybe it's gonna
give you cancer and 20 years, no study has been
done to show whether it does or doesn't. Because it's
really hard to run a study like that. If you
do run a study like that, there's so many different
components and variables, and that so many different individual body
types and genetic factors, environmental factors, they're difficult to track.
So the point here is that if you want results
in your real life, everyday life, then what you got
to do is you gotta go out there and tinker
and experiment around with this stuff. Right? Don't be don't
be too bought into one study, just because the study
proves something doesn't mean it's going to work for you
and your life doesn't mean it's right. Because once you
take it out of the laboratory setting, and you apply
it to you, once you take it out of the
general population setting, you know, let's say a study was
done on 10,000 people, and you apply just to you,
your mileage may vary significantly vary significantly. For example, one
thing I've been struggling with last few years, I've been
struggling with acne, right, and I'll go to a dermatologist
and I'll pay this dermatologist a lot of money to
help me figure out like what's going on with acne?
Why am I having acne? And one of the things
I would ask a dermatologist is, hey, could it be
my diet? Could it be something that I'm eating, that's
giving me this acne? And if you go to a
dermatologist, their standard line is no. It has been shown
studies have shown that there's absolutely no correlation between diet
and acne. That's what a dermatologist would tell you. And
then he'll give you some medication here, but this on,
this might work for you. But what I discovered through
my own self experimentation by practicing elimination diet, which means
I literally cut out everything but one or two types
of food from my whole diet for a while. And
then I see how it affects my performance and my
acne. What I found, for example, is that dairy, cheese
milk other dairy products have a huge impact on on
acne for me, I don't know about other people. See,
when you do a general study, I don't know how
they did the study. But if you do a general
population study on 100,000 people, let's say, or 10,000 people,
then it might all come out as a wash. If
you do a big study like that maybe diet doesn't
affect acne for for every one of those people. Maybe
it only does for few, but I only care about
my acne, I honestly don't care about other people's acne.
So if I need a solution for my acne, what
do I need, I need to experiment on myself to
figure it out. And I find that I'm I'm pretty
pissed that these dermatologists are telling me this, like these
stupid ideas because it really threw me off track. And
now I'm like, I'm very skeptical about that kind of
like the stupid like rules of thumb that your doctor
will give you know, that your therapist or psychologist would
give you because a lot of them what they're doing
is they're just like swallowing, whatever kind of information is
being fed to them from I don't know who universities
or studies or their, you know, their doctors associations, or
even companies that have a vested interest in selling medication
or a vested interest in selling certain types of products.
So it's, it's really something you have to like keep
your eye on, be a little bit skeptical about that
kind of stuff, right? Don't just swallow it wholesale because
your doctor told you or because your therapist told you
or because a professor told you or because it was
published in this journal. That means very little. What actually
matters? Does it work for you? Does it get you
the results you want? Does it get you the money
you want? Does it get you the help you want?
Does it get you the relationship you want them to
get you the feelings that you want it All right,
you gotta remember that these doctors, these, these scientists, these
researchers, they're human beings, they're under a lot of pressure.
They're working in a bureaucracy, they're working in companies. Right.
So a lot of times, they're doing studies that might
be influenced by all sorts of stuff, who knows what
it's influenced by. And just because it comes out as
a study, a year later, there might be a study
that shows the exact opposite effect. That also happens, you
read about that kind of stuff. So, you know, you
don't take a study as being some sort of conclusive
proof. And then telling yourself, well, if there is no
study, then it must be, it must not be worthwhile
to try. I will try anything that makes reasonable sense
to me, I go out there, I want to try
it. And then I'll see what results are generated. That's
the kind of approach that I want you to take.
Don't use this science stuff as an excuse, as an
ego defense mechanism. Because what I see really happening this
is the core of it is that people will click
the science and the studies, because either they have a
pet belief of theirs, they want to entrench even deeper,
but they want to protect, they have a habit that
they've been running in their life that they want to
protect, that they hold near and dear, they can't be
objective with themselves. And really, they don't want to do
the hard work to test it themselves. I'll tell a
person go Do you believe that affirmations work? Go try
for 90 days, the person will say, No, I need
a double. A double blind study first. Okay, so you're
gonna sit around, you're gonna waste your whole life not
trying stuff, because there's not conclusive double blind studies on
this stuff. But if you just go out there, and
you actually try it in your life, you'll see the
results. And some, some scientific folks might say, well, Leo,
you can't be your own scientist. You're biased. Because there's
a there's a placebo effect. There's also confirmation bias. There's
all these different biases we have as human beings. So
if we're experimenting on ourselves, how can we trust ourselves?
Well, look, the fact is that there's biases and everything.
There's biases in the in the research system, there's biases
that your company that you're working for, if you're a
researcher, there's biases at universities, there's biases in governments. All
those biases still exist, you can't exist. You can't avoid
biases. And when you're experimenting on yourself and your own
scientists, you can certainly be your own scientists. It's a
very valid way to go. Because in the end, who
cares about your life, who cares about how you feel
in your life? Who cares about the results that are
happening in your life? You do? Only you nobody else.
So if you're doing this thing, and it's working for
you, it's making you feel if you feel good, it's
getting the results that you are happy with, then that's
something that's right for you. Is it a placebo effect,
maybe there is a placebo effect in there, maybe you
won't know maybe you'll get deceived. This is a very
dirty system. It's not a clean system. We're not doing
mathematical proofs here. That's not That's not what life is,
is a mathematical proof. mathematical proofs work in a barrel,
very narrow context. And life is a lot broader than
that. So you have to think more holistically more outside
the box, more open minded. And this is not to
say that you should just be swallowing bullshit. I think
there's a lot of bullshit out there. A lot of
bullshit with religion, a lot of bullshit with politics, a
lot of bullshit out there with some of the New
Age stuff that that's out there about enlightenment, about meditation,
about law of attraction about positive thinking, there's a lot
of bullshit out there. So you have to weed through,
and there's no one simple formula, you have to be
wise, you have to be intelligent to be very well
read, you also have to be very practical about this
stuff, not just the building some philosophical systems in your
mind about is law of attraction this way, or is
it that way? A lot of try it. Just be
very pragmatic about the way you do this stuff. Build
your little pet theories if you want. But the final
arbiter is simply go out and try it and see
does it get you the result that you want. And
also, instead of listening to PhDs and to researchers and
to Harvard studies, try learning more from the people who
actually got the result that you want. A lot of
times these people, they're not traditionally credible people. They're not
researchers. They're not academics. They're not Nobel Prize winners. They're
just everyday people who get amazing results. For example, when
I wanted to learn how to attract women, I didn't
go to science books. I went to guys who have
fucked LOTS OF hot WOMEN, hundreds of them, right. I
literally tried to find the best guys in the world.
I tried to buy their information products study from them.
I tried to meet them face to face. I pay
them to coach me to teach me in field. I
observed them actually picking up girls at the club. I
observed this up with my own eyes because I didn't
believe it. I wanted to see it. I didn't see
it. Sometimes I saw things that that were incredible to
me. And then what I did is I went out
and I tried the opposite of that, because in no
way that works, I tried the exact opposite of it.
And I failed. I tried again, and I fail. I
tried to get on the failed and I say, maybe
this works, maybe what do you do actually is actually
true, I can't believe it, but I'll try it, I
try it and then it works amazing. Right. And you'll
find this with, with dating advice, you'll find this with
business advice, too. If you want to get really good
at business, one of the best things you can do
is go out there, find a guy who's really good
at business, find a guy who's really good at what
you want to be good at, and then study him,
ask him questions, see if he can be your mentor,
see, if he can teach you, you'll learn so much
more. And that will advance your career in your business
so much more than if you just read even 20
business books, or 20 business studies. Or even if you
get a whole MBA, that one person can teach you
more than a whole foot now a couple of years
of NBA work will teach you. So don't dismiss that
kind of stuff, right? And somebody who's good at business
might not even have a college degree. You know why?
Because business people are intuitive to be successful business, you
have to be wise, you have to put a lot
of pieces of the puzzle into place in your own
mind. And there are people that are really good at
that they have just an intuitive understanding of business. But
then they don't have that kind of like book smarts,
or they don't have any kind of proofs or theories,
or the kind of rigorous research that you might expect
from some sort of business school. But that doesn't mean
that the information is any less valuable. In fact, it
might be a lot more valuable. And it will cut
a lot of that theoretical bullshit out. Because in academia,
there is quite frankly, a lot of theoretical bullshit, that
doesn't translate into the real world. And it's just not
important in the real world. A lot of it might
even be true, but it's simply a low, low, low
priority. And it might not need to be on your
radar at all. Because there's other stuff that's much more
important that you really should be focusing on. So in
the end, what what I want to end on here
is the fact that you can learn very accurate rules
of thumb for how to create amazing results in life.
But I don't think you can do that through the
traditional scientific model. We'll use the scientific model when it
helps us. But generally, as we're doing personal development, we're
kind of going rogue, right? That's what I love about
is that you know, it's very real, and you can
do it yourself, you can be your own scientist is
exciting to do this kind of stuff, because you have
so much power. It feels good to be tinkering with
the stuff and putting it together. Because you can get
amazing results in business, you can get amazing results, in
relationships, in health and in meditation and managing your own
mood, you can get amazing results there. And you can
actually learn very accurate, almost scientific like principles and laws
about how to be good and get amazing results and
all these different areas, but you're not going to learn
them in a textbook, you're going to learn them in
the real world. Alright, so this is Leo, I'm going
