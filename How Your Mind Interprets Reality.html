[Music] so finally we've reached the topic of interpretation this
is going to be a foundational epistemic episode it's going
to take you a good 10 years to fathom the
significance of this episode because what i want to communicate
about interpretation and how it shapes your mind's construction of
reality is very very deep and we're going to use
dozens and dozens of examples to start to illustrate this
for you but like i'm telling you there's so much
here so this is what i live for let's dig
in the core point of this episode is actually very
simple and uh it belies the depth of what's really
here the core point is just this that every situation
has multiple interpretations to it and people fall into the
trap of treating situations as though they only have one
or two interpretations the worst case scenario is when you
fall into the trap of thinking that there's only one
interpretation because if you only have one interpretation of a
situation whatever the situation is and i'll be giving you
a list of dozens of them in a moment then
look what happens that becomes your reality that becomes fact
for you that becomes absolute truth for you because you
can't conceive your imagination is too limited to conceive of
alternative interpretations so that then locks you into whatever your
interpretation is you don't even recognize it as an interpretation
at that point that's the worst case scenario that's the
most unconscious way to go about it and this is
what most people are doing in most situations then there's
a situation of expanding your mind to seeing two interpretations
really when there's only one interpretation it's not even an
interpretation it's taken as fact but then when you've got
two interpretations two sides of a coin two perspectives now
you actually get a little bit of a taste of
the fact that interpreting is going on that the mind
is not just receiving raw facts it's doing a lot
of interpretive work but the problem here is that now
you get caught up in this tug of war this
duality you see reality in a dualistic black and white
way this leads to tribalism and to partisanship and so
the ultimate problem here is of course is that this
is all part of a larger theme of self-deception that
i've talked about not being cognizant of one's interpretations and
treating them as fact or only seeing two sides and
two possible interpretations to a situation leads to much misunderstanding
of reality via self-deception most situations have way more than
one or two interpretations interpretation is core to how you
make sense of the world facts just the very idea
of a fact this idea that there is something that
exists independent of you and your mind and how you
think about it something that wasn't constructed by you this
is what you call a fact and oftentimes the mind
appeals to these facts which aren't really facts the mind
treats it as a fact for the convenience of going
about survival so you have to think very deeply about
anything you just say oh that's a fact it's not
really a fact but you treat it that way and
that becomes your reality you need to notice that most
of what people call facts are actually interpretations and of
course by people i mean you facts alone have no
value no meaning no sense to them and furthermore which
set of facts you focus upon this is highly biased
and selective so the problem is not that you're citing
facts it's which facts you're cherry-picking to bolster your sense
of reality see a fact alone tells you nothing about
what you should do what's worthwhile what's not worthwhile what's
right what's wrong what's good what's bad what you should
pursue or not a fact doesn't tell you this that
requires interpretation and the tricky thing here is that there's
always more than one way to make sense of facts
people like to act as though the way they make
sense of facts is the only way or the right
way or the best way and that is where the
self-deception happens epistemic blunders mostly lie not in the facts
themselves but in how you make sense of them and
which facts you focus upon now let's get into the
examples to make this very concrete for you but before
i do it's very important that you understand the idea
of going meta this whole episode is very meta go
check out my previous episode called what it means to
go meta and also check out my previous episode called
content versus structure because even though i'm going to be
giving you a bunch of examples here and various interpretations
to situations i don't want you to get lost in
the content of these examples these are just to help
your mind get a little bit of traction make this
concrete and to help you see some applications here but
the danger here is that you're gonna start to your
mind's gonna start to wonder like well which of these
interpretations is the true one the correct one and in
this episode i don't care that's not what i'm teaching
you here i'm trying to communicate something meta to you
which is not the content of these interpretations and i
don't want you to get lost in thinking of like
well is this interpretation right or is that one right
it doesn't matter what matters is that you see that
there are multiple interpretations and the need to have one
right one and to falsify all the other ones that
in and of itself is part of the problem that's
you getting stuck in the content and failing to go
meta and to see the structure right so stay meta
with me here don't get lost in the content all
right so the first example situation is why did the
united states invade iraq interpretation number one to defend against
terrorism interpretation number two because of greedy executives running giant
military companies and defense contractors and oil companies for whom
this was beneficial and so they conspired to do so
that's interpretation number two interpretation number three dick cheney was
a war criminal and george w bush was an idiot
who let him manipulate him like a puppet master that
was number three number four we could interpret the us
invasion of iraq as a collective psychic backlash to 911
or in other words it's a fear response it's a
collective fear response interpretation number five there were weapons of
mass destruction or at least that's what people believed at
the time regardless of whether it was true or not
from their epistemic point of view if they thought there
were weapons of mass destruction didn't matter whether they actually
were there or not what mattered is the perception of
them being there because there was a threat again that
was a fear response so we can keep going for
sake of brevity we'll just cut it off there that's
that's five very different interpretations and you see that within
politics the way that most people behave when they discuss
or debate politics is they pick one interpretation and they
act as if that interpretation is just the situation itself
like if somebody believes that dick cheney is a war
criminal and george w bush was an idiot uh that's
their view of reality they don't see that as just
an interpretation right they don't see deeper levels of interpretation
such as what i offered for example with the with
the last two of this sort of idea of a
like or the last uh the fourth one rather the
idea of a collective psychic backlash to 911 like see
that interpretation is actually very profound and a deep one
there's different levels of quality to interpretations they're not all
equal some of them are very simplistic and some of
them are are profound and even go to a spiritual
degree of understanding so for example this idea of a
collective psychic backlash to 9 11 this is a very
powerful idea because see if you believe the united states
invaded iraq because just of some greedy corporate executives or
whatever who wanted oil or defense contracts that's that's one
way of that's a whole way of seeing the world
you see that it's this adversarial way of like well
there's the greedy corporate executives who are separate from us
normal people and they're very corrupt and they're evil and
they're running the world and they're manipulating all of us
it's the globalists and so forth that's a whole way
of looking at the world and it leads to certain
consequences and it also leads to you feeling a certain
way how are you going to feel if you think
the entire world is run by these cabals of globalists
how does that make you feel in your life does
that empower you to be constructive and creative and to
follow your life purpose or does it demotivate you and
make you feel like a victim like you can't do
anything like you're being exploited and manipulated you see so
how you interpret the world very much affects how you
feel that's why it's so important and ultimately what you
care about is how you feel not the facts you
never care about the facts of a situation you care
about how the facts relate to you and ultimately how
it's going to make you feel but now with this
interpretation about the collective psychic backlash to 911 see when
you understand that you can empathize more with what really
happened and then you're not looking at the us government
as this group of evil people you're seeing it from
a more compassionate understanding and conscious place where you're seeing
it as uh like yeah mistakes were made and they
were made because of fear and fear is such a
powerful emotion especially when it happens at a collective level
that it makes us blind it leads to self-deception in
its own right and it makes us do stupid things
that in fact fear tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy
so the very thing you fear like for example if
you fear terrorism going in and destabilizing the middle east
with a with a poorly thought out war leading to
sectarian violence and collapse of of delicately maintained orders of
geopolitical balance in that region leads to a destabilization actually
creates more terrorism but you can empathize with that because
you yourself have acted out of fear before and fear
blinds people individually and collectively now that's just one situation
with multiple interpretations now again i'm not trying to suggest
that one of these interpretations is true and the others
are false that would be a trap in and of
itself for you to to get into that debate rather
what i want you to see is how people get
stuck in that trap how you tend to get stuck
in that trap and what the solution is to getting
out of that trap which is to start to see
the whole situation in a multi-perspectival multifaceted way with multiple
interpretations seeing that each of these interpretations captures some element
of the situation but not the total thing and that
really what you want is you want a compound perspective
of interconnected and intersecting interpretations and you want to see
furthermore even more importantly how your mind is constructing these
interpretations how many different kinds of interpretations there are of
such sorts you want to start to be cognizant of
maybe which interpretations you're missing maybe there's interpretations on this
situation i haven't even mentioned here because we'd have to
sit down and think about it for hours to come
up with all of them that are even better than
anything that i've said so far also i want you
to see that there's different qualities of interpretation usually the
interpretation that some group of people is doing evil because
they're monsters or their criminals or their idiots that's one
of the lowest quality kinds of interpretations but even though
there are low quality interpretations and high quality interpretations that
does not mean that the high quality should monopolize and
squeeze out all the lower quality that itself would be
too limiting we want a more expanded view that even
appreciates some of the truths contained in the low quality
interpretations every interpretation contains some sort of partial truth even
though it might be very twisted and distorted all right
let's move on to the next example so this this
this first example sort of sets up how all the
other examples are going to go it's basically all the
same stuff but just with different content and different situations
so the next situation is why does religion exist this
is a question that many serious people think they have
an answer to you can ask a scientist a mathematician
a philosopher or an average person or a religious person
for that matter you can ask an atheist and they're
all going to have different ideas and different explanations so
interpretation number one is that religion is just wishful thinking
it's it's a holdover from superstitious ancestors from the past
like our ancestors in the past you know they weren't
very scientifically rigorous and because of this they had a
lot of superstitious thinking we know this because if we
go and we look at primitive cultures they have a
lot of superstitious mystical thinking most of it is and
and then we grew out of that that's interpretation number
one interpretation number two is that a religion is a
tool designed to control the minds of the masses and
it's used in this political fashion interpretation number three is
that religion even though it's not scientifically true like the
stories in the bible noah's ark noah gathering all you
know two of every creature that's not literally true but
these are myths which contain deep psychological lessons without which
you can go astray in life and for this reason
religion is important this interpretation would be sort of the
jordan peterson approach to religion he doesn't believe it's literally
true but he believes it's very important that's an interesting
one you see that's a more nuanced interpretation than just
simply oh saying all religion is you see there's different
qualities of interpretation and and then here's a fourth one
for you religion actually points to absolute truth which is
incommunicable because it's infinite and therefore it can never be
articulated in a literal scientific sense do you see how
different these different interpretations are and how they change your
orientation to what religion is you're going to react to
religious people very differently depending on whether you think that
religion is literally true or it's or it's a political
tool to control the minds of the masses by the
elites or you believe it contains these deep psychological truths
along the lines of jordan peterson or that religion actually
points to some profound truths that are trans psychological and
not merely mythological or allegorical but deep metaphysical truths which
simply cannot be communicated with language because they transcend the
finite limits of language so which of these interpretations is
the right one well that's not what we're interested in
here what we're interested in more is again the meta
point of just seeing how many different ways there are
to interpret what religion is and we want to appreciate
all these different interpretations and we want to appreciate that
and notice that our mind is doing this these are
not facts found in the world the idea that religion
is is not a fact it's not a scientific fact
next situation the situation of islam people have a lot
of different ideas and opinions about islam interpretation of one
about islam is islam is the highest religion in truth
that would be your interpretation if you're a muslim most
likely a second alternative interpretation is that islam is evil
barbaric and violent that would be your interpretation if you're
maybe a christian if you're not very well experienced or
educated about what islam is and how people practice it
uh a lot of conservatives in america in red states
tend to hold this interpretation of islam and notice that
they don't hold that as an interpretation to them that's
their reality that's their truth likewise when a muslim believes
that islam is the highest religion the highest truth she
also doesn't hold that as an interpretation that is her
reality interpretation number three is that islam has some good
parts and it has some bad parts and whether it's
good or bad it's used for good or for evil
depends on how you read these parts and which you
pick and which ones you leave out a fourth interpretation
is that islam contains profound truths that are more advanced
than science but the way in which the truths are
communicated are outdated and include many archaic cultural customs from
the middle east from a thousand and a half years
ago ago and it's taken too literally and dogmatically by
most people which corrupts and distorts those advanced truths but
the truths are more advanced even than science from a
certain point of view notice the the the gradations in
in nuance between these different perspectives again we don't really
care which one is the true one that's not the
issue here the next situation is with donald trump interpretation
number one of trump is trump is a true patriot
he's a secret genius he's a secret systems thinking a
systems thinker uh who is just acting dumb and buffoonish
in order to subvert the system that's his method it's
a calculation he's running circles around the elitist globalist media
there are people who have this view of trump that's
how they interpret what trump is doing interpretation number two
is that trump is actually just an opportunistic grifter and
con artist interpretation number three is that trump is actually
god acting out of the highest good and love from
his point of view and that all his actions are
the seeking of love notice how radically different that perspective
is so see how you relate to trump how trump
makes you feel and then how you even act and
behave politically very much depends on which of these interpretations
you take how about the situation of psychedelics interpretation number
one is they're just drugs drugs are dangerous and bad
interpretation number two they're just hallucinations in the brain so
even if you experience some sort of truth or whatever
you think you're experiencing their mystical experience it's all just
a hallucination interpretation number three is that psychedelics expand consciousness
and allowing you to see higher truths realer reality than
you see in your sober life interpretation number four is
that psychedelics are an immature shortcut to genuine spirituality in
other words they are fake spirituality the awakenings and enlightenments
you get aren't real because they're not permanent it's a
common interpretation many many spiritual teachers take this interpretation without
realizing what they're doing uh interpretation number five psychedelics are
the future of spiritual work they just haven't caught on
yet because they've been so stigmatized and demonized do you
see how differently you can relate to psychedelics depending on
what interpretation you take some of these interpretations completely exclude
the possibility of you exploring psychedelics that entire domain ever
in your life that's how powerful interpretation can be and
others of them empower you to explore that domain of
course they could also get you into trouble too you
could explore the domain in such a way that you
end up hurting yourself or killing yourself and that has
to be taken into account too and psychedelics are also
one of those contentious sort of almost political issues where
people adopt one of these interpretations and they and they
only believe that interpretation and they just can't see any
of the other interpretations and that gets their mind stuck
that actually limits your ability to be spiritual the next
situation is actualize.org what is the status of actualized and
right teachings interpretation number one it's occult interpretation number two
actualize.org is not a proper cult but it's simply false
it's misinformation it's self-deception interpretation number three actualize.org offers some
advanced perspectives and insights about the nature of reality but
it's still partial it's not a complete picture the next
interpretation is that actualize.org seems like a cult because it's
trying to teach you advanced things that most of mankind
finds threatening and therefore the most convenient thing for the
ego of mine to do is just to call it
a cult anything you find threatening any information you find
threatening which is not mainstream and approved of by authorities
that you look up to you're gonna just simply label
as a cult the next interpretation is that actualize.org is
a communication from god the next interpretation is that actualize.org
is your own mind your own self teaching you how
to awaken it's the universe teaching itself how to awaken
so which of these is true well it depends on
how you want to look at it so this was
the initial salvo of examples we're going to have dozens
more here but before we get to that i want
to interrupt the list of examples with uh an important
point about this problem there's a problem within philosophy and
within science and philosophy of science known as the under
determination problem and that's really what we're facing here so
let's explain what this is with some quotes so i'm
going to read you a quote here from colin myrna
that explains under determination he says quote under determination is
a thesis explaining that for any scientifically based theory there
will always be at least one rival theory that is
also supported by the evidence given and that that theory
can also be logically maintained in the face of any
new evidence quine's non-uniqueness thesis says that for any theory
t and any given body of evidence supporting t there
is at least one rival or contrary to t that
is also as well supported as t this is a
result of our inability to completely understand or gain access
to the whole set of empirical evidence for any one
particular situation or system and therefore our acceptance that new
evidence could be made available at any time this thesis
maintains that since there is no method for selecting between
our two or more valid solutions the validity of our
conclusion is always in question end quote and then there's
a further point made from wikipedia which says quote under
determination refers to quine's assessment that evidence alone does not
dictate the choice of a scientific theory as different theories
observationally equivalent may be able to explain the same facts
end quote so who is quine then you might be
wondering well if you've been following my work for a
while you know i love to quote klein he's actually
one of my favorite uh western analytical philosophers is his
his work in philosophy of science and logic uh and
epistemology is is very dense and technical and but also
profound um there are some profound quotations that i've read
in the past and uh there's actually an example i
want to give to you here which is klein's gava
guy example so what is the gava guy example this
explains the problem of underdetermination so imagine that someone from
western culture goes and finds a remote tribe in the
amazon that has not been contacted by humans ever and
we try to make contact with this tribe and we
try to learn their language and their customs their ways
and their view of reality ordinarily we would think well
this is not a problem we would just go there
we would you know use some sign language and stuff
to figure out how to communicate and then eventually we
would get to a point where we learned their language
and we'd be able to talk and understand them and
all that and what kwine says is that no this
problem is much deeper than you think because how would
this actually work let's go through the example so let's
say i'm a westerner and i'm sitting with one of
these natives we're sitting around the campfire or something and
then a rabbit runs across the field as we're sitting
there and we're both looking at it and the native
points his finger at that rabbit and says gavagay gava
guy and then i look at that rabbit and i
say oh rabbit and he says gav a guy and
i say rabbit and then you know we keep saying
that and then eventually we start to think that okay
so gaba guy is there is there a word for
a rabbit but when he's pointing at the rabbit what
if he doesn't mean rabbit as a furry living animal
but what if what he means by gava guy is
god manifesting itself as a rabbit that's what gava guy
means to him to me gabba gai just means lunch
or and a furry animal and if if if you
think well but leo i mean this is silly this
is a silly problem because you know god manifesting itself
as a rabbit what is what is the difference between
that and a rabbit there's no there's no difference between
these things that's just some sort of fluffy mystical stuff
and superstition that that guy you know added in there
that native added in there because you know he's primitive
and he doesn't think scientifically and uh quine's point here
was very deep and in fact it's beautiful coming from
klein because see unlike certain other kinds of philosophers kline
was like a hardcore materialist highly technical logical scientific philosopher
he was not one of those french existentialists or something
he did serious scientific research and uh and theorizing uh
within quantum mechanics and other things right so anyways the
problem here is much deeper than you think because actually
there is a significant difference between seeing that rabbit as
a piece of meat for you to eat or a
biological creature that exists independently of you somewhere in the
external physical world see that's your notion of a rabbit
rabbit is a metaphysically and epistemically conceptually loaded notion because
in your mind the way your mind thinks of rabbit
it's not just a piece of meat and it's not
just an animal that's disconnected from your your entire sense
of reality how you think of that rabbit how you
think it relates to you what you think you can
do with it what its purpose is whether it's good
or bad what its value is in the world uh
whether you think it's evil or not um whether you
think it's even separate from you physically and metaphysically whether
you think it even exists independently of your own mind
all of these are baked into your notion of rabbit
so when the native points to that thing and says
gav a guy what he might be saying really is
not what you're saying by rabbit because when you say
rabbit you say that's a discrete physical material object man
of atoms that's usually what you mean but what he
might mean is that that is a hallucination a construction
of my mind so when he says gava guy that
means my mind is constructing that image of this furry
creature that's maybe what he means and that's very different
from what you mean by rabbit so every concept within
our language brings in it an entire metaphysics and epistemology
that framework which is latent and implicit which you're not
conscious of but it very much shapes how you relate
to that rabbit because you see if you treat that
rabbit as a manifestation of god maybe you're not going
to have it for lunch tomorrow but maybe i will
maybe i will butcher that rabbit because to me it's
just a piece of meat but to that native it's
it's consciousness and it's even a manifestation of god so
he treats that rabbit very differently the mistake here is
to think that the native is being is being superstitious
and unscientific quine's point is that there is no such
thing as scientific because what you what you've called scientific
is itself part of this problem how do you interpret
what science is this leads us into the topic of
what is the nature of science which i've talked about
in my profound three-part series deconstruction the myth of science
so this is part of the deconstruction of the myth
of science as you see most people treat science as
though it's just an objective singular thing there's just science
that's how most people think of science whereas if you
watch my deconstructing the myth of science series and you
start to think about the issues i bring up about
science very profound ones then uh what you start to
realize is that actually science is full of interpretation and
what you think science is itself an interpretation creating a
very strange loopy paradoxical problem within your epistemology because how
do you find the right interpretation of what science is
can you use science to do that you see this
is a meta-scientific problem you actually can't do it with
science and this is what many atheists materialists rationalists and
people who subscribe to scientism don't understand they don't grasp
the depth of the epistemic problem here and there's many
more interpretations of what gava guy could mean it doesn't
have to be related to god or to spirit when
that native says gavagai what he could be talking about
is he could be talking about the rabbit-ness as an
abstraction not that specific rabbit so see you might think
oh he meant that rabbit right there but no his
view of reality might be such that he doesn't think
in terms of particular animals or whatever because he doesn't
place value on that he places value on the abstract
forms maybe he's sort of a platonist to him rabbit
is this platonic form manifested by that one particular you
know instantiation of it but really when he says gava
guy he's not pointing at that instance of a rabbit
he's talking about the abstract category or we might say
the sort of the essence of what a rabbit is
the rabbitness of the rabbit and there are many more
possible interpretations of what gava guy could be could be
or what it could mean and quine's point is that
we will never be able to fully resolve this problem
within language uh because it's so infinitely entangled with our
entire framework for what we think reality is and that
we don't actually have any objective criteria for adjudicating between
one framework and one set of ways of looking at
reality and another and you might think well but leah
we can just figure all this out just by having
a deeper conversation with this native and klein's point is
that actually you'll never figure it out you can get
a little bit more accurate by having a deeper conversation
but ultimately there's no way to know that when i
say rabbit and you say rabbit that we really are
talking about the same thing that we're holding it in
the same way now of course we can point our
finger at a thing and call it a rabbit but
that doesn't ensure that my mind's way of holding the
concept of rabbit is the same as your mind's way
of holding the concept of rabbit and in fact uh
we're basically guaranteed to to have different ways of holding
it and quine's point the reason this is called the
under determination problem is that the facts of the situation
alone are under determined because our way of interpreting and
seeing the facts go way beyond merely what is there
in the facts and you never just work with the
facts of a situation because that's not useful to your
survival that's not what your mind cares about your mind
doesn't really care about the facts your mind cares about
the additional connections that that fact has to your entire
worldview that's what's significant to your mind that's what's crucial
for you to see a rabbit by itself is not
important what's important is how it fits into your entire
scheme what you can do with it what you can't
do with it what it's value is whether it's evil
or good whether you could have sex with it or
whether you can eat it whether it's poisonous or not
whether even it's a real object or not whether it's
an illusion a hallucination a dream all of these are
much more important to you than the rabbit itself as
a physical material object and the notion that it is
a physical material object that is already an interpretation that's
not a given you see the problem with these interpretations
that they're so implicit they're so unconscious they're so sneaky
that you're making them all the time but you're not
aware that you're making them and so the point of
this episode is to make you more aware of how
you're interpreting everything because then that gets you some distance
and allows you to start to see how your mind
is constructing many of these things rather than taking the
constructions of your mind as reality itself so the lesson
of the gavagai example is that most situations are in
life are deeply ambiguous and this is true for science
too see most people think that science just finds out
the facts of reality it doesn't science finds some very
minuscule amount of facts and then it does a whole
bunch of interpreting and different scientists do different interpretations of
those facts and they can come up with completely different
theories of of reality based upon those limited sets of
data and then how do you adjudicate which of these
theories is the correct one you might say well we
will go out and do more tests and gather more
data and then that data could potentially in you know
disqualify one of these theories and that's true it could
but whatever data you gather is still going to be
far smaller than the theory itself so maybe it could
invalidate a theory but for that new data you can
always come up with multiple alternative theories again and this
process keeps going forever so you never reach a point
within science where you have one theory that perfectly matches
all the facts because every theory is underdetermined and so
this creates a an open-ended problem an infinite problem for
science you can always have hundreds of theories that fit
the existing set of data i'm not talking about the
invalidated theories you can have millions of false theories i'm
talking about the ones that will still fit the data
and people don't take this problem seriously enough and this
gets them stuck in one paradigm or another and this
is the situation for example with materialism versus idealism um
and and spirituality too for that matter is that like
when we're talking and debating between materialism versus idealism the
facts in in the debate don't really change we all
sort of agree on the facts that like i see
a chair you see the seams the same chair okay
fine we can agree on on that as a fact
but the question still remains that as a materialist you
hold that cherish like existing independently of you whereas an
idealist you don't that's that's a pretty significant difference in
how to view a chair but the but the actual
image of that chair as it is arising in your
consciousness is the same for the materialist and for the
idealist so how do you adjudicate that situation well not
by looking at more chairs no matter how many more
chairs you look at it's not going to adjudicate that
situation nor by changing up the object and changing it
to trees or to cars or to people no matter
how many cars trees and people and chairs you see
in the world it's never going to help you to
adjudicate between materialism and idealism now the mistake people make
here is they say ah well if that's the case
leo then it's just a word game and there's actually
no difference between materialism and idealism but that's wrong because
there actually are ways to adjudicate between them but not
at your current level of consciousness and not using the
materialistic methods see the problem is that the way you're
trying to adjudicate between materialism and idealism is already biased
by your attachment to materialism and therefore the only methods
you're willing to use to adjudicate this problem are the
ones that validate materialism you see you won't consider something
like direct consciousness of truth as a possibility as a
materialist to adjudicate this problem whereas an idealist does consider
that possibility and is open to it a materialist is
not so i want you to notice that it's not
just all the word game there are real stakes and
consequences here there are serious epistemic blunders that can be
made here serious profound self-deceptions that can be life-threatening and
could destroy civilization if we don't get this right you
can destroy your life if you don't get this right
so it it has serious consequences it's not just empty
philosophy or just armchair speculation about stuff so the lesson
here is that most situations in life are deeply ambiguous
and that's something that most people have a difficult time
grappling with the mind doesn't like ambiguity because it's too
open-ended the mind wants a grounded reality but see even
though life is deeply ambiguous survival forces you to act
in the face of com of incomplete information survival forces
you to interpret if you don't interpret you die basically
so one of the lessons here is to increase your
capacity for handling ambiguity uncertainty and multiplicity of perspectives see
your mind one of the things your mind hates the
most is uncertainty and ambiguity your mind wants reality to
be one way this particular way that serves you and
your survival and it doesn't like leaving things open-ended because
that is a lot of work for the mind it's
a lot easier to live life thinking that islam is
the one true religion and that's it every everything else
is false and evil that's a much simpler task for
the mind that it is to be doing the sort
of metacognitive work that we're doing here with actualize.org in
this episode and many of the others thinking about epistemology
metaphysics rabbits and gava guy and god and spirit and
materialism idealism and all this it's complicated it's overwhelming it's
stressful it can leave you feeling nihilistic it can make
you start to question your sanity even you're not even
sure what's true anymore is the chair real or not
are other people real or not leo are you even
real you might reach that point in your investigations and
of course that's the whole point all right so let's
pick up with our examples now so uh these next
examples i'm going to go through them more quickly than
the previous ones because we just don't have enough time
to cover everything and i want to i want to
rattle off a bunch of i just want to hammer
you and pummel you with these examples so you see
just how significant uh ubiquitous this problem of interpretation is
and how many real world implications it has so um
the situation with god what is god well god is
a fiction created by irrational people who didn't know about
evolution that's one interpretation or god is actually a state
of higher consciousness consider that as a valid interpretation which
one is true which one is more true i'm going
to leave it open ended here i'm not going to
give you any answers i just want you to start
to see the situation from multiple perspectives another situation or
interpretation is something like when it comes to mysticism what
is mysticism mystics are just loose-minded fools who have succumbed
to their own wishful thinking about trying to transcend death
they just don't want to face death and so they've
invented various kinds of silly self-deceptions that's one way of
seeing mysticism or maybe mystics have figured out how to
access higher dimensions of reality have you thought of that
as a possibility so see when i'm presenting you with
these different interpretations i want you to seriously consider this
one as being possible and then i want you to
seriously consider this one as being possible and if you
can do that this opens your mind i've discussed this
in my episode called how open mindedness works a very
profound episode make sure you watch that none of my
work works if you don't understand radical open-mindedness another situation
science is truth a lot of people hold that or
what if science is a set of mental constructions that
are convenient for manipulating reality and for survival what if
that's the case have you considered that possibility how seriously
have you considered it how would you know the difference
between the two how would you adjudicate between science being
truth or science just being a set of mental instructions
convenient for manipulating reality and to helping you survive after
all if what you care about so much is survival
and nothing else really you could easily conflate survival with
truth therefore you can see science as the truth if
you make the mistake of confusing truth with survival which
of course you do how about this situation senator whatever
his name is corrupted by the nra gun lobby and
that's why he doesn't vote for gun reform or have
you considered the possibility that senator what's his name actually
believes in gun rights and he believes that these are
really important rights guaranteed by the constitution in which case
he's not voting for gun reform not because the nra
bribed him or made him scared but because of genuine
philosophical convictions he has i see a lot of liberals
and progressives making this mistake a lot of progressives love
to accuse certain senators or politicians of not supporting their
policies because they've been corrupted or bribed or influenced in
some way and hey that's definitely true in many situations
but that's not the only possible situation a lot of
conservative politicians simply believe in the in in the gun
culture they grew up in the gun culture they don't
need the nra to lobby them they already were on
the side of the nra philosophically for their entire lifetimes
so see a progressive can get the can interpret the
situation improperly because from a progressives point of view the
idea that someone could be a genuine believer in the
right to own guns to a progressive this doesn't compute
in their reality because in their reality they interpret that
as being some sort of stupidity or they have to
explain it somehow so the way they explain it is
that the nra is influencing them but you can explain
it alternatively that where does the nra get its power
and its money from it gets it from people who
genuinely believe in the right to own guns that's where
most of the nra power came from right so it
might not be that the senator is being corrupted by
the nra gun lobby it might be actually sort of
a reverse causality where the senator already believes in the
philosophy of the nra gun lobby and actually feeds it
rather than it feeding him and you might say well
what's the difference but there is an important difference if
you misunderstand the causal links in these kinds of situations
you're going to end up straw manning that politician or
whoever you're disagreeing with and then this is going to
lead to discord and it's going to lead to political
division part of it a polarizate partisan polarization and so
forth and then we have the political situation we're in
today where both sides basically don't understand each other and
they mischaracterize each other straw man each other and this
is a problem of failure to being able to step
out of being able to step outside one's own interpretation
you see so a progressive has a certain set of
interpretations a conservative has a certain set of interpretations and
then they get stuck in those that's the meta problem
so if you want to be a good progressives you
actually should care about getting this right understanding your political
opponents and their true motivations now i'm not saying some
of them aren't grifters i mean plenty of politicians and
and conservatives are grifters or they're just uh they are
influenced by the money and the gun lobby of course
that also happens but it's see it's not easy it's
not so black and white to distinguish between what's really
happening because the way humans operate is that our financial
interests are always deeply entangled with our philosophy our worldview
our sense of reality our metaphysics our epistemology you never
have a clean division of these two things how you
earn your money is deeply intertwined with how you think
reality is what you think is right wrong good bad
in your entire philosophy why would it be that way
because money is the distillation of survival and your world
view is your world view because it helps you to
survive to understand that go check out my two-part series
called uh understanding survival part one and part two another
situation bill gates is trying to control the population and
get rich via vaccines that's a common interpretation you've heard
lately or bill gates is actually trying to help mankind
in the best way he knows how but maybe the
way he knows how or how he thinks is the
best way isn't the best way or maybe it is
have you considered that interpretation after all how would you
know the difference how would you tell if bill gates
was doing it for the money and to manipulate others
for the power or if he was actually doing it
out of the kindness of his heart and genuinely just
doing what he thinks is best for mankind but then
again you know he's just a human and as a
human he has limited knowledge of how to help mankind
i mean do you know how to help mankind in
the best way what if you had billions of dollars
but hey you had maybe some wrong ideas about how
to help mankind or maybe they they weren't even so
wrong maybe you had good ideas but they just weren't
perfect ideas after all it's hard to help all of
mankind perfectly you're probably not going to be able to
help everybody in the way that they agree with because
people have different ideas of what kind of help they
need and what help mankind needs mankind needs a lot
of different kinds of help and the help you might
need is different from the help somebody in africa might
need another situation person x is insane or maybe person
x understands something you don't this is in fact the
situation because it's very easy to just dismiss someone as
being insane but a lot of people who are considered
to be insane really they're people who understand something you
don't or that mainstream culture doesn't then again some people
truly are insane so how do you distinguish these two
things it's not so easy there's no easy answers here
all of it finding truth requires work that's why it's
difficult there is no simple algorithm there's no set of
rules i can give you for how to distinguish these
two things you have to deeply study epistemology you have
to deeply study reality you have to be a student
of of this work you have to do it for
years and for decades and then you'll get good at
distinguishing these things but without the experience of doing it
without the study without the research without hours and hours
of watching and listening to this material and doing contemplation
for yourself you're never going to figure it out another
similar situation is person x is evil that's a very
common way to dismiss somebody or another alternative interpretation is
that person x is doing good but from their limited
point of view and their limited consciousness so hitler was
evil that's this one and this one says hitler was
actually doing good but his point of view and his
consciousness was limited therefore his doing good actually created a
lot of bad for many people how would you know
which of these is the case or consider this person
x is evil or person x is actually doing things
for a greater good using his higher vision that you
are too narrow to see that's a that's an even
deeper twist on this problem of evil a lot of
what ordinary normies call evil is actually people who aren't
evil but are actually extra good but are operating on
such a high playing field of what they're doing their
vision is so broad and deep and long that the
normie can't understand what the person on this higher plane
is doing therefore they call him evil this has happened
to mystics and sages and saints throughout the entire span
of human history in all cultures the wisest and most
conscious and mystical of humans the highest geniuses were often
regarded as insane criminal or evil by their culture and
put to death or uh jailed or burned or tortured
or crucified think of christ think of socrates think of
gandhi think of martin luther king uh um bruno was
burned at the stake next situation is consciousness is just
a product of the brain that's an interpretation that's not
a scientific fact that's an interpretation or the brain is
imagined by consciousness how would you tell the difference between
these two just to play with you right now can
you do this open your mind to the possibility that
your brain is imagined by consciousness just i'm not saying
to believe it i'm just saying can you open your
mind to that possibility and can you see the massive
repercussions of that if that's true another situation criticism of
science means that the one criticizing is unscientific or there's
a different interpretation you could have criticisms of science from
a meta-scientific perspective where the criticism is coming from a
trans scientific above science not below science means it's actually
more accurate and rigorous than science is able to be
how would you know the difference see a lot of
people who are attached to science anytime they hear criticism
of science they interpret that automatically to be oh that's
just some religious nut case who doesn't want to believe
in science or some conspiracy theorist or something like that
and it's below science it's less rigorous than science they
don't consider the possibility of somebody being critical of science
from a more rigorous more epistemically rigorous perspective than science
itself because science refuses oftentimes to do epistemology and metaphysics
but they don't consider this as a legitimate possibility because
they are so attached to science they don't think there's
anything above science and in fact if i would explain
this whole situation to them this is called the pre-trans
fallacy by ken wilbur if i explain the situation to
them they would say oh leo this this notion of
meta scientific that you're using this itself is it's some
notion that you invented because you have your cult that
you're trying to run and you need to invent these
these notions of meta scientific so that you can put
yourself above science and that helps you to earn money
from part of your cult maybe that's certainly a possibility
or have you considered the the alternative interpretation which is
that meta-scientific is actually not it actually is real there
is things in reality which are meta-scientific which science cannot
understand or access but which are true have you considered
this possibility or are you so attached to science that
you're not willing to because your interpretation that science is
truth is your reality and you're not willing to see
that as an interpretation next case people who talk about
god are dumb ideologues they're just dogmatic and superstitious or
have you considered the alternative interpretation which is that some
people who talk about god are dogmatic ideologues but others
who talk about god actually have direct experience of god
that's a very radically different interpretation it turns the whole
situation upside down on its head it leads to a
radical recontextualization because you see most religious people i mean
sorry most materialistic and atheistic people are not open to
the interpretation that it's possible to have a direct experience
of god and for it to be genuine see their
interpretation of any experience of god is that oh well
sure you can have all sorts of hallucinations and stuff
but that's not really god it's just you hallucinating stuff
but that's an interpretation so you can have an interpretation
that all experiences of god are just hallucinations that would
be one interpretation or you could have an alternative interpretation
which is actually that some of them could be hallucinations
but that is actually possible to have a direct experience
of god have you considered that as a possibility you
see the ultimate meta interpretation you make when you're debating
these points and you're thinking about this is that since
you're selfish and it serves your survival the meta interpretation
is that you're right and leo is wrong or anybody
who disagrees with what you consider to be right is
wrong but that itself is an interpretation see so for
you to start to open your mind to the possibility
for example that you could have a direct experience of
god which is not a hallucination but which is genuine
more genuine than science is more true than science more
true than mathematics to open your mind to that possibility
you would first have to open your mind to the
possibility that your entire interpretation of reality is wrong are
you open to that interpretation probably not which is why
you have the worldview that you have here's the next
case a lack of proof for god means that god
doesn't exist that's a very common interpretation among materialists or
have you considered this possibility maybe god is a type
of thing which cannot be proven because god exists prior
to proof because god created the notion of proof how
would you tell the difference now here the materialist will
say ah leo but this is just a cop-out this
is just a sort of a rhetorical trick that you're
using because actually you have no proof of god because
if you did you'd give it and then we'd believe
you but since you don't give it then you're just
bluffing and just making up stories and excuses okay i
grant you that that's one interpretation of what i just
communicated to you maybe that's true but have you considered
the alternative interpretation that actually what i told you is
not a cop-out and it's not a rhetorical trick but
it's actually the case what if there is such a
thing as god but it cannot be proven because the
very notion of proof itself doesn't go deep enough metaphysically
and epistemically in order to be able to prove itself
most people haven't considered this possibility consider this case the
earth is is moving around the sun that's a common
interpretation see most people take that as a fact that's
not a fact that's an interpretation or see to see
how that's an interpretation you need an alternative but have
you considered that the entire universe is moving around the
earth that sure flips the situation on its head doesn't
it how about this case other people exist or what
about what if this is all a dream and i'm
dreaming up other people to construct a sense of reality
in the same way that i do when i'm sleeping
at night after all when i'm dreaming people up at
night i wake up and then i realize yeah they
were all just imaginary but then why can't that apply
to this current consciousness that i'm in right now have
you considered that possibility here's another case love when it
comes to the topic of love love is just a
mammalian emotion produced by the brain it has no metaphysical
significance whatsoever it's just a good feeling we enjoy feeling
it when i talk about love a lot of people
interpret what i'm saying as that or have you considered
this possibility that love is a core metaphysical aspect of
universal mind and consciousness see when i talk about god
as love or love as being fundamental metaphysically to what
reality is when i say reality is love people hear
that and then they interpret that as meaning like oh
well leo is just this sort of hippie guy who
has a soft mind and he's sort of fantastical and
he likes to talk in his flowery language and exaggerate
stuff and he just he's just taking some psychedelics and
he's conflated his feelings of love that he feels on
psychedelics he's conflated this mammalian emotion which feels good he's
just so deluded he's conflated that with genuine physical metaphysical
stuff that's an interpretation an alternative interpretation is that actually
you think that's what i did but i'm not stupid
enough to do that and that i've actually thought one
step ahead of you and i've already anticipated that problem
i've thought through that i've deconstructed even that to realize
that actually reality is metaphysically love actually but see most
people are not open to that interpretation because to be
open to this you have to admit that your previous
interpretation is wrong see you could as you're listening to
me everything i'm telling you you could interpret in this
way you your mind can can interpret some of the
radical things i say as like oh leo is leo
is just wrong because he's foolish and he doesn't understand
he's tricked himself or he's building a cult and in
this way you can dismiss many of the things i
say many of the most important things i say can
be easily dismissed this way and in fact they are
by most people um because their minds are not open
but but there's an alternative interpretation anytime you think i'm
wrong the alternative interpretation is that actually you're wrong how
would you tell the difference like when you listen to
me talking about trump and bad mouthing trump and saying
trump is low consciousness and a bad leader and selfish
and all this sort of stuff if you're concerned if
you hear me say that if you're a trump supporter
and and you will almost instantly your mind will instantly
unconsciously just interpret that as like oh leo is wrong
this is evidence of leo being wrong and in fact
i'm going to use this evidence to try to discredit
everything else he's taught it's like leo i like all
the stuff you teach that doesn't talk about trump but
when you talk about trump i don't like it and
because of that it gets me to start to doubt
all of your other teachings because if you're wrong about
trump think of how many other things you're wrong about
leo how do i even know how wrong you are
if you're wrong about one thing okay that's that i
grant you that that's a that's one interpretation but have
you considered the alternative interpretation that when i'm talking about
trump you're wrong and you say to me no no
no no no no no leo leo leo you're wrong
it's not i about trump who's wrong it's leo who's
wrong you see and so you're gay you're the game
your mind is playing is that your mind can insist
on its interpretation come what may literally any interpretation your
mind wants to attach itself to it will attach itself
to that to its death there is no limit to
the degree of denial and attachment that your mind can
take towards any interpretation so if you want to interpret
my teachings as proof of me being wrong me being
a cult leader me being deluded me being a grifter
um me being a criminal or whatever me being insane
you're entitled to do that precisely because you're imagining all
of reality so one of sort of the meta traps
of doing this work is you have to be very
careful about when your mind interprets me as being wrong
i receive emails and private messages on a weekly basis
of from people i've received hundreds thousands of them over
the years telling me how wrong i am about this
thing or that thing how long i am about trump
how wrong i am about politics how wrong i am
about love how wrong i am about god how wrong
i am about enlightenment how wrong i am about consciousness
how long wrong i am about women about sex about
femininity masculinity about everything everything i talk about someone thinks
i'm wrong about and these emails all read in a
very similar fashion usually in that they they accuse me
of being wrong in such a blind way where i
can tell that the person who accuses me of being
wrong hasn't even considered the possibility actually it's they who's
wrong and are just projecting that onto me that hasn't
even entered their mind yet that's the level of development
and consciousness that they're at you can find all these
sorts of people in my comment sections now now now
look now look this is a very tricky situation because
you might say oh leo so you're just saying all
this because you know it's it's very self-serving a household
serving of you to say that leo you're never wrong
but that's not what i said i can certainly be
wrong i can always be wrong about anything pretty much
especially from your point of view um and i have
been wrong about certain things in the past i've i've
admitted some of them i've been admitted and others i
haven't simply because uh the reality is that the human
mind is wrong about so many things that you can't
you don't first of all you don't know all the
things you're wrong about um you're discovering new new things
all the time that you've been wrong about um it
would just take too long to list them all but
i i've literally made blog posts in the past where
i would list things that i was wrong about but
i'd have to do that on a weekly basis for
the rest of my life you see so this idea
that that you're never going to be wrong is just
silly it's silly of course i'm wrong on on on
many things i've been wrong many times in my life
um it's not a a question of being wrong or
right it's really a question just about of accuracy what's
your batting average you're never going to have 100 batting
average in your life you're never gonna have a you
know perf every golf game you play is never gonna
be perfect um the best golfers they don't play perfect
golf they just play better golf than every other golfer
likewise in my teachings i'm not claiming to be perfect
i'm just claiming that my epistemology is better than most
other people's epistemologies that's ultimately my claim and then you
could say well leo you're wrong about that well i
could be i could generally be wrong but also consider
the possibility that when you think i'm wrong actually i'm
right that's also possible how would you know the difference
actually it's it's quite dangerous for you to take a
position that i'm wrong and this is arrogant it's going
to sound arrogant to say but i'll say it anyways
because i feel like it needs to be said um
these teachings are so self-deceptive and i've literally spent so
many years over a decade of my life deeply contemplating
all of these metaphysical and epistemic scientific and philosophical and
spiritual topics that unless you've spent decades doing this work
when you assume i'm wrong on something it's a safe
bet that you're actually wrong it's not it's not a
good idea to bet against me on metaphysical and epistemic
issues now even though i say that i don't say
that from a position of sort of i'm above you
it's not about me being above you or better than
you it's got nothing anything to do with that it's
not about ego i'm simply saying this it's a it's
a function of experience how many hours have you spent
meditating contemplating reading studying deeply questioning yourself life reality others
your dreams metaphysics about how many hours have you done
this for have you done it for thousands of hours
if you haven't then how can you possibly expect to
be have a more accurate view of reality than someone
who has done that that's real work you know i
do real work for these teachings for these episodes i
don't just come up here and talk out of my
ass this particular episode on interpretation i've been developing this
episode for for over six months i've been contemplating it
massaging it i've recorded it twice in full didn't like
the recordings doing it over again contemplating thinking of all
these examples thinking of ways how i could be missing
things here now again this doesn't guarantee perfection in what
i'm doing it's just a matter of like if you're
gonna go play golf against someone who has spent literally
half his life professionally playing golf and you think you're
gonna beat him you think that his choice of which
club to use you think he's making a bad choice
when he chooses his club because you think he's an
idiot you think he's overlooked something well actually it's probably
you the inexperienced one who's only golfed for 100 hours
in your life it's actually probably you who's missing something
he's choosing that particular club that particular shot in that
particular way because he sees something you don't because he
has thousands of hours of more experience than you in
this particular field now does that make him a perfect
golfer no does that mean he can't screw up his
shot no does that mean he can't make a mistake
and choose the wrong club at the wrong time sometimes
of course he can it's just a question of accuracy
and experience and it's nothing personal next case evolution proves
that god isn't real if we have evolution why do
we need god it's a very common interpretation made by
atheists or have you considered this possibility that evolution is
the process by which god creates now see the atheist
will come up with a a meta interpretation here and
say ah leo but that's just a cop-out that's a
common trick that religious people use in order to save
their religion see religion is always playing this game of
moving the goalposts so at first religion was saying that
there was no evolution now that evolution is undeniable now
you move the goalposts and say that oh well god
you're trying to co-opt evolution and give it to god
as though god is working through evolution see this is
just a rhetorical trick you're using to defend your little
you know silly world view of god that could be
correct or an alternative interpretation is that actually evolution is
the process by which god creates have you seriously consider
that how about this case very common case these days
cop x is a racist because he did so and
so or have you considered that cop x is not
a racist but his actions appear that way because he's
acting under extreme pressures because it's a difficult job and
really only a cop could truly appreciate the pressures of
that job see that's a very different way of viewing
police and excessive use of force in police then he's
a racist now then again could a cop simply be
a racist yes could the entire police system be corrupted
with racism explicit or implicit yes how do you know
which of these is the case my point is that
it's a lot more difficult to know than you think
if you think that it's easy to know that you
lack experience and you're fooling yourself here's another case the
buddha didn't talk about love so love can't be the
truth because the buddha taught the truth okay that's a
that's a common buddhist interpretation or have you considered this
possibility that the buddha did realize love and that he
realized that love is truth and that what he called
truth was actually love or another interpretation is that the
buddha's nirvana is actually love metaphysical existential love but you
actually haven't become deeply conscious enough to reach nirvana so
when you hear a buddhist say nirvana or nothingness you
get some image of emptiness in your mind a blank
void you might think that that nirvana is just emptiness
uh but when you actually experience nirvana very deeply your
ideas of what nirvana is changes you interpret it in
a different way you interpret as love how about this
one uh obama's drone strikes were evil and acts of
war crime or have you considered this interpretation that actually
drone strikes saved many lives of military troops on the
ground that would have to be sent there if drones
were not used and that they actually prevented many terrorist
attacks and terrorist activity that's also a valid possibility how
can you be so sure that the drone strikes didn't
actually save more lives than they killed now you say
oh leo but reports suggest that 80 to 90 of
drone strikes are innocent civilian casualties okay let's say that's
true let's say that's true let's say a thousand civilians
were killed with drone strikes during obama's presidency okay but
what if those let's say 10 percent that were not
innocent civilians what if that 10 percent you know ten
percent of a thousand is like a hundred what if
there were a hundred serious hardcore terrorists who would have
committed to you know suicide attacks and uh um uh
other kind of terrorist attacks in europe in america in
the middle east wherever uh they would have destabilized the
region the government which would have led to the deaths
of let's say five to ten thousand civilians or what
if these were leaders and masterminds of terrorist cells that
would have radicalized foul and recruited thousands of more terrorists
who then over time would go on to kill thousands
and maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands of people
leading to instability in the region uh you know and
the the the regional instability and civil wars that would
have resulted in the middle east as a result of
this geopolitical instability would have led to the lives of
a loss of lives of 100 000 people so how
do you weigh those two things which which is actually
the right way to see these drone strikes again i'm
not trying to justify the drone strikes truly i don't
know i really i don't know the calculus uh if
i had to be honest i would have to say
that the calculus is very complicated and hairy it's so
hairy that probably most people at the pentagon don't even
know the answers to these questions because there's a lot
of counter factuals like when you kill the mastermind of
a of a serious terrorist organization um how do you
quantify how many people would have died had you not
killed him like let's say that osama bin laden was
killed by a drone strike let's say he was still
alive uh he was killed by a drone strike but
it cost a hundred civilian lives would that have been
worth it let's say you were very compact let's say
you went and you became president and you were going
to be a very loving compassionate president and you got
rid of the entire drone strikes program but then what
happens if you did that and then the terrorist situation
got so out of hand because you had people like
osama bin laden that were just rising up in the
middle east and then um to the point where then
it got the situation got so bad and so toxic
you'd have to send in troops u.s 100 000 u.s
troops to quell the situation because it gets so out
of hand um is that worth it is it worth
are a hundred civilian lives worth not sending in 100
000 troops see what i want you to see is
that it's these are such difficult situations and even the
people in charge don't really have good answers to these
situations because we're dealing with uncertainty incomplete information under determination
ambiguity and yet we have to act in the face
of that see good leadership is not about perfectly knowing
everything a good leader doesn't know a lot of stuff
a good leader is someone who's able to make decisive
choices and to have some sort of principle and integrity
in the face of great ambiguity uncertainty and turmoil and
chaos whereas most people are paralyzed by that a good
leader is able to maintain a steady course and to
keep people grounded in uncertain and chaotic times with integrity
that's very difficult to do again i'm not justifying what
obama did i don't know what the you know the
net result is i just can appreciate the complexity of
it so when people take this simplistic attitude of like
oh it's just drone strikes are evil it's like i'm
not so sure about that because you're not considering the
greater evil of sending cruise missiles before we did drove
strikes we used cruise missiles before that we sent troops
the situation could even get so out of hand that
we'd have to use a nuclear weapon how many civilians
are acceptable to kill with drone strikes in order to
prevent a nuclear war these are the realities that you
would actually face if you were the president or a
leader of any major nation there are no easy or
good choices they're all uncertain ambiguous complex hairy they have
trade-offs and they're all usually always choices between the lesser
of two evils next case absolute truth is impossible to
access even if it exists the human mind just can't
access it or absolute truth is possible to access you've
simply not done the work to do it how how
much work have you done 10 hours 100 hours a
thousand hours what if absolute truth requires ten thousand hours
of work and you've only done a thousand does that
mean it's inaccessible or does that mean you're lazy which
is true how would you know do you see how
easy it is to confuse your own personal laziness with
inaccessibility another case leo when you say that absolute truth
exists and that you have accessed it personally you are
being arrogant and narcissistic and egotistical sure that's possible or
have you considered that actually i'm simply telling you what's
true that's also possible see i could be lying or
i could not be i could be self-deceived or i
could not be i could have accessed absolute truth or
maybe i couldn't or maybe i didn't how would you
know another situation witchcraft is everybody knows that witches don't
exist it's just silly ancient superstitions or witches actually do
exist witches are simply people born with supernatural conscious abilities
that have been demonized by mainstream society because it's a
threat to political power and to the established culture have
you considered this possibility another case liberalism is a mental
disorder i've actually seen cars with bumper stickers that say
say something like that or to the person who has
that kind of bumper sticker have you considered that actually
liberals are more conscious than you you see don't don't
ignore that possibility whenever you think you're more conscious of
somebody else always consider the alternative possibility that they're more
conscious than you and you're just projecting your unconsciousness onto
them now this cuts both ways because we can flip
the situation we can say okay so like a lot
of progressives will say conservatives are racists that's one interpretation
or have you considered this possibility the conservative mind is
more prone to fear and survival than the progressive mind
and as a result conservatives are more xenophobic because of
the structure of their neurology now see as a progressive
you say oh well that's just a racist leo you're
just trying to whitewash racists um actually no i gave
you a more nuanced interpretation that could be true um
but if you insist that all conservatives are racist and
you insist that that's the only right interpretation i can't
i can't convince you otherwise you see your own mind
is doing this if you're convinced that some interpretation is
the truth god himself cannot help you you're stuck and
you're gonna stay stuck until you open your mind to
other possibilities how about this case capitalism exploits workers that's
a very common progressive idea socialist idea okay interesting idea
how about this interpretation though or whatever problems capitalism has
higher systems are not yet sustainable because humans aren't selfless
and conscious enough therefore the exploitation of capitalism is just
a natural byproduct of our lack of self selflessness and
consciousness and love do you see how different this interpretation
is from that one it changes your whole orientation towards
capitalism towards work towards our politics towards our economics now
if you're a socialist you might say oh leo well
you're just again you're creating justifications and excuses for the
perpetuation of the exploitation of workers by capitalism you're the
enemy you're just a shill for capitalism because it benefits
you that's one interpretation maybe i am just a capitalist
shill or maybe just maybe could it be possible that
actually we're not yet collectively conscious enough to sustain a
higher more humane system maybe that's why your socialism isn't
working maybe that's why progressive politicians aren't getting elected maybe
that's why you keep losing elections because there's something you
misinterpreted about the situation maybe your ideas are very utopian
and good in theory but in practice you don't realize
that the majority of mankind is not conscious or developed
enough to adopt and live by your utopian ideals maybe
in a thousand years we can do that but not
today have you considered that possibility how about this situation
this is a very abstract and general one something is
the case therefore i must do this or an alternative
interpretation is something is the case and it doesn't mean
for what i should do so for example let's say
that we can say something like [Music] animals suffer therefore
i must not eat animals that's one interpretation or another
interpretation is animals suffer and it doesn't mean for what
i eat how would you know the difference how would
you know when you're making up the difference again be
careful i'm not trying to justify any action here i'm
just trying to get you to see the meta in
the situation here's another case women are who only want
chads with money that's a very common attitude within in-cell
communities and pick-up communities or have you considered this interpretation
of the situation is that your personality sucks and you're
so lazy that you invented this ideology to excuse yourself
from actually having to develop yourself as a man to
properly attract women and that the reason women want your
money is because you have nothing else to offer them
but money so while you might think that women only
want money actually the situation is that when you have
nothing to offer but money then of course people will
take money but that's because you have nothing else to
offer so maybe the problem isn't that women want money
the problem is you have nothing else to offer but
money and you don't even have that either and then
you're sitting there complaining about not having money when you
could just have develop aspects of you to offer that
have nothing to do with money that women actually love
love more you just haven't developed those aspects of yourself
along the same lines there's an interpretation that women are
cheating this is a very common view within pickup the
pickup community women are cheating or have you considered this
interpretation is that you expect that women owe you sex
and then you blame them when they act on their
own agenda instead of giving you what you want and
furthermore that you yourself are a when you're doing pickup
and it's actually you who's projecting your own sluttiness as
a man onto women because see you only look at
women as how often you can have sex with them
and then you expect them to also see you in
the same way you wouldn't hesitate to cheat on on
a woman therefore you're afraid that she will cheat on
you because it's a projection of your own mind so
when a pickup guy says that women are cheating have
you considered the possibility that he's actually saying that he's
a cheating how would you know the difference how about
this case if life has no meaning then that sucks
and i should kill myself or if life has no
meaning i can imagine whatever meaning i want i get
to construct my own meaning and this gives life paradoxically
the deepest meaning you can have or another interpretation is
that if life has no meaning then death has no
meaning and then i'm free from death another case very
common one solipsism is bad and depressing or have you
considered solipsism is beautiful profoundly beautiful why haven't you opened
your mind to this you're so busy ranting and denying
solipsism that you're not even able to see the beauty
of it assuming it's true i'm just throwing out ideas
here i'm not telling you what's true i'm just throwing
ideas you find out for yourself uh how about this
jesus was the son of god interesting or have you
considered this that jesus was a son of god because
we're all sons of god because god is everything see
this this encapsulates and epitomizes the under determination problem because
it could be the case that jesus is the son
of god or was the son of god however you
want to say it um and that everyone is the
son of god because you see if everyone is a
son of god that includes jesus in it but it
also doesn't limit god or sons of god to jesus
exclusively do you see how this interpretation is actually broader
and more inclusive than this one which is more exclusive
and partial and it's this one is so open-ended that
it actually incorporates that one into it that's why this
interpretation is more powerful or more robust we might say
because an interpretation or perspective that can hold and integrate
other perspectives is the higher perspective that's how you distinguish
higher from lower perspectives a higher perspective doesn't demonize and
exclude the lower perspectives whereas the lower perspectives do how
about this those who reject christianity are working for the
devil that's one interpretation that many christians might have fundamentalist
christians or if you're a fundamentalist christian have you considered
this interpretation that christianity itself has been co-opted by the
devil thousands of years ago has been completely corrupted and
that now what you call christianity is literally devilry how
would you know the difference how about this case i
need lots of money to be happy or have you
considered this you need to find a new mode for
happiness think about how this changes your entire approach to
life if you just start to see that your idea
that you need lots of money to be happy that
that is not a fact but that is an interpretation
that you could change see it's a lot easier to
change interpretations than facts although with how stubborn and close-minded
most people are actually sometimes it can be easier to
change a fact than it is to change someone's mind
about one of their interpretations but it doesn't have to
be that way that's the point the point is that
if you want you could open yourself to have such
a flexible fluid mind that you could change many of
your your interpretations easily and that would be the wiser
course because it is actually easier to change your mind
than it is to change reality but not if you're
stubborn like a mule only if you're open and you
take responsibility and you actually are willing to change yourself
how about this case life sucks that it's unfair or
your life sucks because you haven't been living by the
right principles maybe life sucking and being unfair is just
a consequence of the wrong principles and the wrong ways
in which you're living your life in which case life
actually is fair because it's fair to those who follow
the principles and it's also fair to those who don't
in the sense that if you don't follow the principles
there's natural consequences and suffering which is what you're experiencing
and then you call that unfair but it's not unfair
you know like if if you take a hammer and
you and you you hit your big toe with your
hammer it hurts is that unfair is life unfair or
are you just doing something stupid you shouldn't be doing
see when an idiot hits his toe with a hammer
and then experiences excruciating pain he blames that on the
hammer and he blames that on god he blames that
on life and other people he doesn't take responsibility for
the fact that he's the one who picked up the
hammer and he's the one who got the idea to
hit himself over the on the toe and then if
you just stop doing that then life would seem fair
and beautiful but of course if you keep living that
way your life is going to keep sucking because there's
principles one of the principles of life is don't pick
up a hammer and hit your toe how about this
case blacks have lower iq due to their genetics they
have inferior genetics that's a that's a common view held
by by many sort of ultra national conservative types but
have you considered this possibility what if just what if
what if you believe that blacks have a lower iq
due to their genetics because it serves your nationalist identity
not because they actually do but because it serves your
worldview to believe so how about this case related similar
the middle east is less developed than the west because
people in the middle east are just inferior savages they
have an inferior culture and they have inferior genetics or
have you considered this the middle east is less developed
because the middle east was a harder harsher environment to
survive in had less resources from the very beginning and
that people in that region historically required more time to
develop then those civilizations that arose in europe and elsewhere
which had certain geographical and resource benefits that those in
the middle middle east didn't have and that the middle
east are not um inherently doomed to be underdeveloped forever
it's just that they need more time to overcome the
harsher environment that they started out in they had harsher
survival conditions and they just need more time to develop
themselves and they will eventually develop to the standards of
western culture and beyond and there's nothing really stopping them
from doing that other than just more development not some
inherent inferiority or some genetic defect or even some sort
of cultural problem how about this case person x has
the truth because because he won a debate he knows
the truth because he he proved it in the debate
or have you considered this possibility that winning debates has
nothing to do with truth you could win a debate
and be wrong you could be right and lose a
debate that might be possible how about this case it's
a scientific fact that women have penis that men have
penises and women have vaginas that people take that as
a fact that's actually an interpretation an alternative interpretation is
that the idea of penises and vaginas and men and
women that these are abstract categories created beyond and outside
of empirical science i've discussed this in my episode called
um is gender a social construct how about this case
logic reveals truth or alternative interpretation logic is a rationalization
mechanism co-opted by the ego mind for the purposes of
your survival the mind's survival what if all of your
logic is nothing other than your mind's intellectual way of
surviving have you considered that how about this case you
must do x because the constitution says so or how
about this interpretation the constitution was written 300 years ago
or 250 years ago or so and it contains outdated
ideas which need to change to fit with modern times
otherwise the nation will stagnate and perhaps even collapse how
about this case i can't get laid because i don't
have a square jaw and a big dick that's a
common in-cell interpretation and they treat that as a fact
they really hold it scientifically as like this is why
i can't get laid and then there's this interpretation i
can't get laid because i actually don't understand female attraction
i have cripplingly low self-esteem and i don't socialize maybe
that's why you can't get laid how would you know
the difference if you've never tried to seriously socialize if
you've never tried to seriously learn female attraction if you've
never worked on your self-esteem issues how can you know
that that's not the cause of you not being able
to get laid rather than your dick and your jaw
size how about this i can't get laid because of
feminism that's also a common excuse that many people men
who struggle to get laid take on or how about
this interpretation as an alternative i can't get laid and
i blame feminism because i've actually never done the hard
work of approaching women and i i play hundreds of
hours of video games all year long and i should
talk on an insult forum all the time and i'm
immersed in that ideology and that's why i can't get
laid not because of feminism how would you know the
difference what if feminism is just a scapegoat you invented
because of your own personal irresponsibility on this matter how
about this case jordan peterson is a fascist maybe or
have you considered this possibility that you have such a
political attachment to whatever ideology you have politically that you
are unable to look at his work with nuance and
that you misunderstand the conservative mind because you don't actually
care about truly understanding the conservative mind because your worldview
can't accommodate it because your worldview is too limited since
you're attached to your limited worldview you can't understand the
concern of mind and therefore the only recourse you have
is to call conservatives fascists now also some conservatives could
be fascists but they also could not how would you
know the difference how about this one i'm poor because
capitalists exploit me or alternatively i'm poor because i haven't
taken responsibility for developing highly valuable skills and building mastery
and expertise maybe my blaming of capitalism is just an
excuse for not doing the hard labor of developing valuable
skills how about this person x is a lying hypocrite
grifter that's a very common attack that we see online
within politics especially or how about this person x is
just weak like all of us are and has failed
up to live up to his own ideals and has
been corrupted by money think of all the times you've
been corrupted by money all of us like money all
of us would like to have more money does that
make us hypocrites does that make everyone a grifter how
about this person x criticized me because i did something
wrong and now i feel that or how about this
interpretation person x is projecting their own shadow on to
me and i'm feeling guilt feeling guilty because i'm failing
to distinguish that or hey maybe i actually am wrong
how about this person x is a crazy sociopath charlatan
or he's actually trying to teach me something that i'm
deeply fearful of and therefore i paint him in my
mind as a crazy sociopath charlatan because the ideas he's
teaching are threatening to me how about this landing a
man on the moon proves that science is true or
it's possible to land on the moon even with untrue
science have you considered that how about this ceos are
greedy capitalists or ceos have crazy pressures put upon them
for survival of the company how about this slavery is
evil or actually maybe slavery is evil only relative to
today's cultural norms and level of development how about this
walls are real because i can't walk through them and
that's proof of their reality or how about this interpretation
i could be imagining walls that can't be walked through
how would you tell the difference this is the underdetermination
problem and again it's not merely a word game again
see when i tell you this you can say oh
leo it's just all a word game that's one interpretation
or another fly another interpretation is that it isn't only
a word game it has consequences that tentacle out in
many subtle ways that you just aren't conscious of yet
how about this case she is not i'm sorry she
is acting selfish for not giving me sex that's a
common attitude women men take towards women or have you
considered this actually you are the selfish one by needing
her to give you sex when you want it on
demand how would you know the difference how would you
know that you're not projecting your own selfishness onto her
how about this life the the number of stars and
galaxies in the universe that we've observed means that life
is very common or have you considered that it it
means exactly the opposite it means that life is extremely
rare do you see how significantly different that interpretation it
just flips the whole thing on its head how about
this ufo sightings are just diluted people and hoaxes or
ufo sightings are real or ufo sightings are there's conspiracy
to hide ufo sightings or another interpretation is that there
is no conspiracy to hide them as simply that the
government and the people studying them don't even know what
they are and how to explain them properly because it
doesn't fit their own worldview how about this leo you're
being biased and partisan when you call trump a corrupt
fool maybe i'm biased or have you considered the possibility
that actually i'm describing him accurately but you don't want
to hear it because you're biased how about this case
if the paranormal was real science would say so but
science doesn't say so therefore it can't be real or
how about this possibility science can't say so because any
scientist who dares to say it would be discredited at
outcast from the community of science which is the case
how would you know how about this god will punish
you for your sins or how about this god punishes
no one for their sins it's just that sins naturally
produce their own suffering by disconnecting you from loving consciousness
so it's not god who's punishing you for your sins
it's actually just you again the situation of hitting yourself
on the toe with a hammer it's not god who's
punishing you in that case it's just you you're punishing
yourself by not connecting the dots between the hammer and
suffering and your actions and your thoughts how about this
stage green socialism is dangerous or how about this stage
green socialism is being conflated with stage red and blue
communism which are not the same things at all soviet
communism is not nordic social democracy about this government regulation
is socialism or you can't have a government at all
without regulations regulation is crucial for the harmonious balance of
a society how about this taxation is theft or maybe
just maybe everything you enjoy in life is only made
possible by taxation which is needed to fund the military
to fund the court system to fund the road system
to fund the infrastructure the electricity and many other things
how about this case this girl i was dating and
texting didn't text me back and that's because she didn't
like me and because i was being too needy with
her or she lost her phone and lost your number
this actually happened to me um when i first got
into pickup and i was just learning female attraction um
one of the first girls i hooked up with uh
you know a beautiful um beautiful girl and we we
slept together multiple times and then like i was really
into her she was into me and all this but
i was i was still in a place where i
was very needy i was just kind of new to
the whole dating market and situation i was still very
needy and very insecure and trying to like figuring figuring
out how to like you know keep her and all
this stuff and i wasn't sure if she wanted to
keep seeing me so you know i was texting her
but i was worried like am i texting her too
much am i coming off as too needy and then
one night you know um i felt like i texted
her too much and then she didn't reply and she
didn't reply for like a whole day and i started
just getting all in my head about it i started
worrying and thinking like oh man i must have ruined
everything i was being too needy and i was just
preoccupied with you know not coming off as too needy
because i knew that that would repel girls and um
i really like this one so anyways so i got
like bummed out that night and went to sleep thinking
that i lost her and then the next morning i'm
in the shower and i hear a knock on my
door and um i open the door and it's her
and she's standing there crying because she lost her phone
last night at a party or someplace and it completely
recontextualized the situation you see sometimes you think you have
a correct interpretation and then reality shows you otherwise how
about this case democrats want illegal immigration because it gives
them more voters this is a very common talking point
amongst conservatives what i don't see them considering though is
this alternative possibility which is that have you considered that
actually democrats are simply more compassionate towards the suffering of
immigrants and they're less fearful of them they're not welcoming
in immigrants because they want more voters for themselves to
win elections but simply because they actually care about the
suffering of immigrants see to most conservatives that interpretation doesn't
even enter into their mind that someone could actually have
compassion for the suffering of immigrants in third world countries
and could want to help them and could not be
afraid of them and cannot think that this will destroy
our country just by welcoming some of them in a
conservative mind can't compute that possibility therefore when you can't
compute that possibility the only alternative is to come up
with some sort of idea that democrats are doing it
for their own selfish gain how about this communism was
a failure or communism actually led to the greatest growth
in living standards in the 20th century both in russia
and in china that throws you for a loop see
people who talk about communism being such a great failure
if you actually look at the gdp growth and the
rise in living standards percentage-wise in russia and in china
over the last century it rose way more than in
non-communist countries that's pretty interesting now again i'm not saying
this to say that communism is good and to justify
communism there are many problems with communism i'm just i'm
just showing you how these interpretations are much trickier than
it seems how about this guru x is a rapist
and an abuser or maybe guru x actually had consensual
sexual relationships with a bunch of groupies as they tend
to do and then those groupies became disgruntled because he
wouldn't marry them or whatever and go exclusive with them
which is true this is a very common spirit common
problem in spiritual communities or how about this guru x
is a rapist therefore he cannot be enlightened that's proof
of his lack of enlightenment or have you considered this
radical crazy interpretation that enlightened people can be rapists maybe
how would you know how would you know that an
enlightened person can't be a rapist i mean you tell
yourself that oh enlightened people are supposed to act all
saintly and stuff enlightened person can't be a rapist but
how do you know that you certainly want to keep
your mind open to that possibility maybe enlightenment doesn't work
the way you think it works how about this people
voted for trump because they were racist maybe or people
voted for trump because he appealed their spiral dynamic stage
blue and orange value set and many people subscribe to
the blue and orange value set because that's just your
level of cognitive and moral development how about this when
leo says that he's god he is being narcissistic and
unspiritual maybe or or maybe he actually is god but
you're not conscious of it yet maybe you're god and
you're not conscious of it yet maybe we're all god
but you're not conscious of it yet how would you
know the difference what's the difference between me being god
or me being narcissistic maybe god is a narcissist have
you considered that after all where did narcissus come from
who created narcissists how about this supernatural healing is delusion
and or supernatural healing is real but it's only accessible
from exceptionally high and rare states of consciousness that you
haven't accessed yet how about this the miracles of jesus
are just a myth and exaggeration stories to tell to
children or jesus was so exceptionally conscious that he actually
had those powers how about this this is a very
crucial one disputes between spiritual teachers are just differences in
word and style not in substance all spiritual disagreement is
just a word game and miscommunication that's one possibility or
how about this consider the alternative is that some teachers
actually are more conscious and more awake than others which
accounts for the difference in teachings and styles and wording
and also it could be both remember these interpretations aren't
necessarily mutually exclusive you can have a blend between the
two in fact oftentimes that's the case how would you
know the difference between spiritual teachings disagreeing simply because of
word and style versus actual underlying substance in consciousness do
you see how how tricky that epistemic problem is and
people just so so often assume that oh it's just
it's just a disagreement in word only and if there's
no difference in levels of consciousness between teachers what if
there is how would you know how about this there
is no proof of paranormal phenomena because it's maybe or
how about this the alternative is that the notion of
proof that you are using is not appropriate for measuring
paranormal phenomena the problem is not the lack of the
phenomena the problem is the methods of proof that you're
using are too limited after all your method determines what
you're going to get back how about this being short
makes me bad with women or how about this my
insecurity makes me bad with women how would you know
the difference do you see how easy it is to
conflate your physical height with insecurity you might spend your
entire life thinking you're bad with women because of your
physical height and attribute that to a physical material fact
but actually it's your crippling insecurity about your physical height
and how you hold it in relation to yourself into
women that is the cause the true cause of you
being bad with women after all there are many short
men who do really well with women one of the
best guys i knew from pickup he was way better
than me i'm six foot two he's he was five
foot five imagine being five foot five he was five
foot five pakistani guy he would kill it he would
kill he he would do better than a white six
foot tall guy at the club why because this dude
had the uh the attitude of a boss this dude
was the opposite of insecure he was one of the
most secure and brash and confident guys that i knew
in game and his results directly reflected that it wasn't
it wasn't because of his height it was because of
his character how about this women care about my dick
size very common one or consider this crazy i know
this is crazy crazy possibility only you care about your
dick size how would you know the difference how about
this leo stole some insight of mine and didn't give
me credit for it i sometimes get accused of this
people will write me and say how dare you steal
this and didn't credit me or but have you considered
this possibility is that it's possible to develop insights independently
just because i say something that you've thought of before
doesn't mean i copied you um people have the same
ideas independently all the time this is common throughout history
throughout human civilization there's not a single source of ideas
not all ideas have one origin point there can be
independent origination of ideas and people oftentimes don't don't understand
that then again maybe i did steal your insight and
just didn't give you credit that's also possible this is
a funny example from one of my some of the
some of the vlog videos that i've done or some
of the videos i've shot inside my old apartment where
i used to live i have this decoration on the
back wall that looks like a six like six six
six triple six um and before i published my first
video from that apartment and read the comments section i
didn't even notice that it was a 666. so some
people when they watch that video for the first time
they write in the comments section very common um comment
is they say oh leo why do you have a
666 on your back wall what does this secretly mean
about you are you part of the illuminati or whatever
some something like that um that's one interpretation but what
they don't consider is that the alternative interpretation is that
these are just decorations that i got at pier one
um they're not six six sixes really they're just swirls
that happen to look that way if i rearranged them
the other way they would not be sixes they would
look in the opposite direction and so it's very funny
to me how people accuse me of deliberately putting this
666 on my wall when the reality is you know
in this case i didn't even i didn't even register
that it looked like a 666 until i posted the
videos and then i got all this you know all
these comments and people are so what's so funny about
is that people are so sure of their interpretations when
they leave that comment they're just so sure that i
did this on purpose when the simple explanation is that
i so didn't give a that i didn't even see
it the way that you see it right like i
so don't give a about the symbol of 666 to
me it's completely meaningless nonsense whereas to some of you
it has a very deep significance see being a being
a teacher and being exposed to lots of people's opinions
and critiques of my work it's actually been very illuminating
because what i get to experience on a daily basis
for years is just projection constant projection just like people
projecting their egos onto me like all the time like
i i experience projection like 10 times a day every
day for the last 10 years um and it has
it has a certain profound psychological impact on you both
negative and positive because it can be difficult when you're
actually open to criticism and feedback the way that i
am it can actually be difficult to distinguish that from
projection because most of what most the feedback and comments
i get is just pure projection but then again i
don't want to close myself off to that because i
do want to be open to feedback and to to
valid constructive criticism and so it's a very interesting situation
and what it does for me is that as i
experience all this projection i start to realize like holy
everybody is projecting all the time and of course i'm
doing it too to others and then that makes me
more aware of my own projections when i feel it
so poignantly done on to me by others how about
this interesting case um i'm going to go through some
personal cases now from my own personal experience leo deleted
my youtube comment because he doesn't like it and he's
censoring me i've been accused of that in the past
um but an alternative interpretation is that did you know
that youtube has automatic comment filters if you say something
that youtube doesn't like it filters you automatically for spam
now you might interpret that as like oh well that
means youtube is part of some globalist conspiracy to suppress
free speech it could be that or have you considered
that the internet is spammed by bots more than there
are more users of the internet that are just bots
spammers spammers then there are actual humans and that every
major website is just inundated with spam all the time
which makes uh makes the site virtually unrunnable these bots
try to hack the website try to manipulate the website
try to put in spam links try to do whatever
and then there need to be filters against this stuff
on any website whether it's facebook youtube anything otherwise your
website turns to have you considered that um so a
lot of times when people think that i'm deleting their
comments i'm not it's just that my channel gets so
many comments thousands of comments some of them are automatically
filtered by youtube spam filters and then i'm too lazy
to go in there and to check them all manually
by hand it's too much work it's it's a full-time
job to do that so if your comment gets caught
by the spam filters i'm sorry but it won't be
visible then again also i do actually moderate some of
the most toxic comments on my channel if i see
racist comments homophobic comments if i see like extreme vulgarity
in language if i see spam links if i see
people spreading complete you know disinformation and gossip and conspiracy
theories that are toxic i do moderate some of that
stuff not often maybe 100 comments i'll delete but it's
usually like obnoxious toxic stuff i try not to delete
something just because i disagree with somebody's opinion on something
or because it's a criticism of me i do sometimes
delete criticisms of me which are just what i perceive
as complete slander like for example if if someone accuses
me of you know child molestation or something like that
um i will delete that because it's just it's like
it's it's so preposterously slanderous um that i perceive it
as just pure toxic disinformation or trolling so sometimes i
do that um so that explains it to you okay
here's another one about me leo is just parroting stuff
that he ripped off from advaita vedanta and other spiritual
traditions and he stole it from there and now he's
co-opting it as his own and he's presenting it as
his own truth or our alternative interpretation is that actually
leo discovered many of these insights independently on his own
again if something is true you have to figure that
it's not coming from a human source because somehow the
original humans discovered it for themselves if it was true
it was true before they were there in which case
if they discovered it why can't others so for example
if you think that some yogi in india discovered enlightenment
and then all other enlightened people are just disciples of
that one yogi well this is nonsense because if that
original yogi was able to discover it for himself which
supposedly he should have been able to because he didn't
get it from somebody else because you're saying he's the
discoverer of it so whoever that first person was that
became awakened and enlightened or whatever god realized um obviously
he didn't do it by talking to a human he
got it directly from the source but if he did
that then why can't anybody else do that everybody can
do that in theory therefore they don't need the yogi
that's the beauty of truth if one man can discover
the truth any man any woman can discover the truth
but people get so attached their lineages their schools and
their yogis and their gurus that they tend to interpret
all other teachings as though they're supposed to source from
from from there uh here's another one about me leo
doesn't want to debate others because he's afraid of being
exposed as a fraud maybe that's why i don't debate
people or have you considered this possibility that leo has
become too conscious to be interested in debating anyone has
that possibility even entered into your mind the idea that
a conscious human has no interest in debating people or
proving anything to anybody and that this is actually not
evidence of them avoiding or being untruthful this is actually
evidence of their development and their maturity in their consciousness
mature teachers don't debate have you noticed this how about
this funny one about me leo is a cult leader
because he's denies that he's a cult leader and that's
exactly what a cult leader would do a cult leader
would deny he's a cult leader that makes him a
cult leader maybe or have you considered the simpler possibility
which is that leo denies he's a cult leader because
he's not one after all i can i can play
this game on you i can play this trick on
you i can call you a cult leader and you
will deny it and as soon as you deny it
i'll say ah but according to your logic if you
deny your occult leader that's exactly what makes you a
cult leader you see it's circular logic i can also
do this with a scientist give me any scientist give
me the most reputable scientist i can sit down with
him and i can just accuse him of being a
cult leader i can accuse science of being a cult
and immediately he's going to deny it he's going to
say no science is not a cult my university is
not a cult i do serious work and as soon
as he says that i say ah well but that's
just that's just evidence of you being a cult leader
because of course you deny it a cult denies it's
a cult therefore science is a cult do you see
the stupidity of this logic how about this one leo
didn't respond to my email because he doesn't like me
maybe maybe that's why i didn't respond or have you
considered this simpler possibility that leo didn't respond to your
email because he gets so much email he doesn't even
look at it he didn't even see your email how
about this this is a very fascinating one some spiritual
teacher or guru worked really hard to become enlightened or
have you considered that he was actually born with exceptional
spiritual talent and consciousness already as a baseline and actually
he didn't have to work that hard how about this
psychedelics are bad because they're dangerous or psychedelics are demonized
because they're truth revealing and people are threatened by truth
because people don't care about truth because people care about
survival instead how about this situation spiral dynamics actually with
spider dynamics there are some very interesting interpretive problems because
spiral dynamics as a model also has the under determination
problem so for example when it comes to trump assessing
trump on spiral dynamics model how do you know the
difference between whether trump is orange stage orange with a
bit of red or he's stage red with a veneer
of orange could account for his behavior or for example
with jordan peterson there's an interesting sort of interpretive problem
with jordan peterson assessing him in that the question is
is jordan peterson's stage yellow with a green shadow or
is he staged orange with some yellow capacities both could
explain some of the ways in which he behaves and
it can be difficult to adjudicate this it takes a
lot of experience and study of spiral dynamics and a
lot of application of it to be able to start
to distinguish between these things and and it's not easy
even the developers of spiral dynamics suffer from this problem
even don beck i've seen don beck i've seen ken
wilbur in what is my opinion misinterpreting some of the
stuff going on in politics and in our culture they
are misinterpreting i think they are overestimating how developed we
are for example ken wilber has this idea that you
know we've already exhausted stage green and now we need
to jump over green and get to yellow and that
yellow is the stage that we need to be pushing
towards in my opinion he seriously underestimates how much green
there is the majority of society is not green green
is only prevalent in advanced universities pretty much uh the
majority of society is still in blue and orange even
in developed countries and so that means we've got to
move through green first for many years more before we
can get to yellow yellow is just it's a pipe
dream at this point within our politics within our economics
we don't have a green economic system we don't have
a green political system not yet um similar problems with
with don beck too uh i won't go into all
those there we're running short on time but just i
wanted to make you aware of the complexity of the
spiral dynamics and the interpretive problems involved there because spider
dynamics is an interpretation that you're projecting on reality and
it can be difficult to know which interpretation to apply
which one is more accurate how about this people who
believe in ufos are idiots or scientists and skeptics are
simply too close-minded maybe that's the problem how about this
if absolute truth was accessible everybody would know about it
and talk about it and since they don't it doesn't
exist or how about this absolute truth is so radical
that everyone mostly everyone is in denial about it how
would you know the difference how about this this is
a very important one all spiritual teachings lead to the
same place different roads up the same mountaintop to the
same peak a very common interpretation or how about this
not all teachings lead to the same place there are
lower and higher places up on the mountain and it's
not a single mountain it's a mountain range with many
different peaks and not all paths lead to the same
peaks consider that how about this immortality cannot possibly be
real that's just religious wishful thinking or alternative possibility death
is actually a mental construction that you're imagining how about
this in a relationship you might say to the other
person you're the problem in this relationship thinking that's a
fact actually that's an interpretation maybe you are actually the
problem not them maybe it's you who's the problem or
maybe the problem in this relationship is not them and
it's not you but it's simply that you two are
not a good fit and so it's not a a
matter of somebody being wrong or evil here or misbehaving
it's just that you're not a good you're not a
good match or maybe both of you are the problem
how about this there's a problem with the world this
is a very general there's something wrong with the world
maybe but have you considered the possibility that there's nothing
wrong with the world and that it's just there's a
problem and something wrong with your mind and how it
sees the world maybe the world is perfect but your
mind is not because see when you assume that the
world is imperfect you're sort of implicitly assuming that your
mind is perfect because you're assuming that you're accurately seeing
the world maybe you aren't how about this all men
are shallow cheating pigs maybe some women take on that
view if they've been burned by a man before um
or have you considered though that maybe that's not the
case maybe what the case is is that you're attracted
to immature and narcissistic men because of low self-esteem problems
that you aren't taking responsibility for correcting and as long
as you have this low self-esteem you will always keep
attracting men who are shallow cheating pigs and therefore it
will seem to you as if all men are like
that but really men are like that in your experience
simply because you have low self-esteem and that's how loaf
is self-esteem tends to play out in relationships how about
this god is a fiction or god is a bearded
man in the sky or alternative interpretation god is jesus
or god is love or god is consciousness or god
is nothing or god is everything or god is you
which of those is correct how would you know maybe
multiple of them are correct maybe all of them are
correct if god exists he created an evil world and
therefore god is not good therefore maybe therefore he he
can't exist because if god existed he wouldn't create this
evil world or consider that what you call evil is
just an illusion created by your own selfish biases and
actually there is no evil in the world god created
a perfect world you just don't know how to see
it because your vision isn't perfect not because god made
it imperfect but because you're just selfish you're making it
imperfect yourself because you're god how about this philosophy is
impractical and it's a waste of time or have you
considered that you haven't done philosophy long enough to realize
its value and its consequences how about this it's impossible
to know if there's anything outside of consciousness it's just
impossible this is one of those questions we'll never answer
or have you considered this possibility actually it's possible to
know that there is nothing outside of consciousness because you
are consciousness and consciousness is infinite but you don't understand
that yet because you haven't become conscious of it and
lastly leo is wrong because he hasn't considered whatever point
i want him to consider maybe or leo has already
taken that point into account and seen beyond it and
has seen things and points that you have yet to
consider so there you go hopefully you can see by
now that the notion of raw facts is a naive
myth it mostly doesn't exist and it mostly doesn't matter
what the raw facts of a situation are because your
mind does so much interpretive work all the time it
does so much cherry picking the amount of raw facts
in your world view and your relationship to reality is
less than one percent the other 99 percent are your
own projections interpretations assumptions metaphysical and epistemic frameworks biases attitudes
beliefs fears emotions etc and even your logic and reason
which you think of as factual they aren't they're they're
part of the 99 that are co-opted for your survival
generally speaking the problem is that people don't question their
initial gut interpretations of situations refusing to consider or acknowledge
alternatives therefore they are not even conscious that these are
interpretations moreover it should be stated that your interpretations are
not arbitrary they are deeply distorted by your survival needs
and insecurities so yourself and your interpretations are hitched like
this it's all entangled with your survival whatever you need
to survive it's not merely that you're interpreting it's that
you're interpreting in a self-serving and worldview reaffirming way your
interpretations serve to reinforce whatever initial world view you have
no matter how wrong and accurate or diluted it is
the key point of this conversation is that i want
you to start to catch when your own interpretations trick
you i want you to start to notice your own
interpretive process ever deeper notice yourself denying that your interpretation
is an interpretation and trying to retcon it as a
fact or as science or just as how things are
or as obvious notice yourself treating your own interpretations as
facts privileging your own interpretations over the interpretations of others
so see it's very easy to see when somebody else
is interpreting or misinterpreting a situation it's very hard to
see it within your own self notice how rash and
unconscious interpretations lead to self-deception and misunderstanding of the world
and of people notice that in your own life notice
how obvious and singular interpretations make a fool out of
you reality is a lot less obvious than it seems
admit that you are interpreting start taking alternative interpretations more
seriously spiral dynamics tier 2 stage yellow cognition and above
is defined by being interpretation aware and able to hold
multiple perspectives at once the ability to go meta this
is crucial for tier two if you're not able to
be aware of interpretations you're in tier one and you
will be until you become aware of that this takes
cognitive development first and foremost takes consciousness be aware that
most knowledge opinions and reporting that you see in culture
on the internet and elsewhere that actually what you're getting
is an interpretation and you're not treating it as such
you unconsciously swallow these interpretations and their implicit frames and
this becomes very epistemically treacherous for you and this leads
you to very deep self-deception in your life the meta
point here the mental lesson i want you to learn
from this episode is that rather than looking for one
right interpretation and defending it notice rather all possible interpretations
of the situation this is much healthier it's much more
powerful and much more resourceful it'll make you a better
human a better creator to make you more effective in
business and relationships with your health with your wealth it'll
make you happier it'll make it easier to do spiritual
work now here are some tips for how to apply
the lessons in this episode first realize that there is
always more than one or two interpretations there are dozens
so if you look at a situation you can only
see one or two interpretations that's your clue that you're
not being creative enough and mentally flexible enough and curious
enough to find other ones if you can see 10
different interpretations for a situation then you can kind of
feel like you've done your job and that you're being
epistemically responsible if you can only see one or two
interpretations you're being epistemically irresponsible so that's a easy way
to know if you're fooling yourself realize also that your
first interpretation is usually the worst your initial gut interpretation
of a situation unless you're extremely spiritually developed it's it's
going to be very crude foolish ignorant and wrong the
more experienced you become generally speaking the more contemplation you
do of epistemology and metaphysics the better your interpretations will
get and eventually you can reach a stage where your
initial gut interpretations of situations are very accurate but that's
only because you spend decades doing serious serious work and
because you've studied your own mind and you've overcome many
of your self-deceptions because you're too conscious to notice them
happening you you're conscious of your denials your projections your
scapegoating your judging you're playing victim you're playing various kinds
of ego games all the mechanisms i talked about in
my three-part series called self-deception which is foundational uh all
those when you become deeply experienced for decades in in
those mechanisms catching yourself in those mechanisms then then you
can have some pretty decent gut interpretations but still you
have to be careful and unless you've done that your
gut interpretations are going to be very foolish and crude
get in the habit of looking for alternative interpretations like
a little game that you play with yourself see how
many new interpretations you can come up with for a
situation whether it's in politics or in business or whatever
finding the best interpretations requires open-mindedly and without bias exploring
multiple perspectives so radical open mindedness is crucial here understanding
bias is crucial here go watch my episodes about radical
open mindedness watch my episode about self bias other tips
seek more and alternative interpretations just sheer quantity of interpretations
is good but not just quantity also secondly seek more
nuanced interpretations remember in these examples sometimes i gave you
very crude interpretations and then i gave you some very
nuanced ones too so notice that difference generate novel interpretations
yourself you can actually sit down with a piece of
paper with a notebook and generate new interpretations for all
sorts of situations for your relationships for your children for
um your love life for your sexuality for your views
about men women the government yourself whatever you can reinterpret
your own self i didn't even bring up many interpretations
about yourself i mean you have tons of negative interpretations
of your own capacities you might interpret yourself to be
weak bad at certain things broken unlovable with bad health
and many other interpretations that you consider as facts about
yourself which really aren't facts for example you might interpret
yourself to be unhumorous or lacking charm and wit and
you might think these are genetic limitations you have but
then that itself genetics itself is an interpretation uh furthermore
seek more charitable and loving interpretations some interpretations are very
fear-based they're sort of us versus them they're very tribalistic
and polarizing i've given you plenty of those examples today
and then other interpretations are more charitable they're more compassionate
they're more loving they're more inclusive they don't seek to
straw man the other interpretations they they understand they're able
to accommodate they're able to see the partial truthfulness in
different perspectives even if they're limited or toxic as you're
doing that also question and discard fear-based interpretations these are
killing you these are robbing you of the quality of
your life and your ability to function in the world
effectively and to see reality truthfully fear is the smog
that clouds up your vision so if you want to
reach truth give up your fear-based interpretations and fear is
very sneaky it sneaks into many of your interpretations you
don't even see how it's doing so yet question and
discard toxic disempowering victim hood interpretations the best example this
is what in cells are up to you know in
cells have developed this very toxic disempowering victim interpretation of
why they can't get laid and why feminism is a
problem and all this sorts of stuff and this is
really debilitating it becomes your reality when you start to
interpret yourself as a victim you become a victim slowly
over time and then it becomes true just by virtue
of you constantly drilling that into your mind also an
important point here is that if you want to understand
the problem with conspiracy theories the problem fundamentally is that
conspiracy theories hinge on a lack of interpretive awareness so
this is what you'll see amongst virtually all conspiracy theorists
is that their epistemology is very poor and so what
they do is their mind latches on to one theory
um without realizing that the under determination problem and they
just start to believe that one theory and they lack
awareness of the fact that that theory is just one
interpretive framework and that there are many other frameworks and
moreover that that framework that they're using is probably a
toxic disempowering victim-based fear-based interpretive framework and the conspiracy theory
is alluring precisely because it hits your reptilian brain it
uses fear and hatred and judgment of others to make
you feel like you're being empowered by the theory but
actually you're not and you're not open to charitable loving
interpretations that are not fear-based in fact the conspiracy theory
dismisses those it has sneaky mechanisms that it uses to
dismiss the dismiss those so this is uh this is
one way how you can know when conspiracy theories are
toxic and bad is when they're fear-based and when the
person you're talking to lacks interpretive awareness lacks the ability
to go meta lacks the ability to self-reflect uh now
there's one final question you might have which is leo
how is interpretation different from recontextualization i have a video
called understanding recontextualization it's actually a very important uh older
video of mine make sure you watch that it's closely
gonna dovetail what we talked about here i would say
that they're similar the difference is that really it's a
difference of degree so with the recontextualization episode i talked
about how the context of a situation changes what the
facts are and how you perceive the facts and that
is sort of what interpretation is so they're very similar
um i would say that interpretation is happening on a
much more fine grained level to actually have a serious
recontextualization of something in your life this is this is
not a you know a daily occurrence this maybe happens
to you once a month once a year something like
that major recontextualizations are pretty rare um and that's what
that episode focused on but with interpretation your mind is
always interpreting basically everything you're interpreting hundreds of times per
day at a very fine grained micro level and then
you're also doing it at a macro level too when
your interpretation is upended at the macro level it basically
leads to a recontextualization and then if it's happening at
a micro level then i mean it you could still
call it re-contextualization but it's just it's it's much smaller
so like that example i gave about texting the girl
and being too needy with her and then her losing
her phone and then me realizing it later that would
be an example of a sort of a recontextualization that
happened um based on how i was interpreting that situation
you see so a recontextualization is something that happens when
your interpretation is subverted by the facts of reality so
to speak you know reality pummels you with something and
then you're forced to change your interpretation sometimes reality hits
you so hard that your interpretation your old interpretation simply
can't survive and it has to drop away and die
and when that happens it can be painful or it
can be funny it can be relieving too to know
that you don't have to live with that old interpretation
you know it can be very empowering to get rid
of your negative victim toxic interpretations because it does free
you up to then go out and do more in
the world and to live the kind of life that
you want to live so there you go i hope
you are starting to see and feel the power of
this idea of interpretation i spent a lot of time
developing this episode because of how important and foundational that
i knew it would be and here we are three
hours three hours just on interpretation and even though we
spent three hours on this i guarantee you it will
take you a good 10 years of doing this work
to really appreciate what was communicated today but for now
that's it all right i'm done here please click that

and you can check out my second channel called actualize
clips with short snippets of my long videos that are
more digestible that are not three hour monsters like this
one so that is that and the final thing i'll
conclude on is this i want to warn you to
be careful about how you interpret my teachings i see
a lot of people misinterpreting my teachings i go to
great lengths to provide lots of examples and details and
caveats and warnings and traps and pointing out all these
things but no matter how much i do that my
teachings will always be misinterpreted because that's just the nature
of unconscious people unconscious people who need these teachings the
most are the most prone to misinterpreting them so it's
a tricky catch-22 how do you teach this stuff without
getting it misinterpreted sometimes the misinterpretations get so bad it
makes me even want to stop teaching because it makes
you wonder like how many people are even going to
interpret this properly how many of them are actually going
to use these teachings to reach love and how many
of these people are going to misinterpret them and then
use these teachings towards devilry i've warned about this many
many times in the past but no matter how much
i warn about it it's not going to be enough
to stop it it's going to happen but nevertheless i
hope that you're going to be an exception and that
you won't do it in your life you have to
be very careful when listening to everything i say there
can be double triple meanings to the words i use
the sentences i say sometimes i say something you think
i said something i didn't say that i said something
else just like with that gava guy example i might
be talking about god or love or truth or consciousness
or meditation or psychedelics and you might hear those words
and concepts and you might think ah okay i know
what he's talking about but you don't and in fact
maybe i'm saying the opposite of what you think i'm
saying when i say ego death when i say death
is imaginary when i say some of these radical things
when i say reality is nothingness when i say god
is nothingness when i say infinity what you think i
said might be the opposite of what i actually intended
to say these are the difficulties of communication these difficulties
will never be resolved i'm always struggling and trying to
be a better communicator i take so much feedback in
terms of how i can communicate things better and i
think i've improved a lot over the last eight years
of doing this and i will continue to improve and
i think i'm gonna get better in the years to
come i'm gonna get a lot better but no matter
how good i get just the nature of what we're
talking about is so self-deceptive it's so sneaky that you
have to really be careful with how you interpret it
and this is not just true of my teachings there's
nothing special about my teachings per se it's true of
all spiritual teachings spiritual teachings since the dawn of civilization
for 10 000 years since ancient egypt and even before
that have been being misinterpreted by the majority of mankind
the majority of christians do not understand christianity they've misinterpreted
it the majority of buddhists misinterpret the buddha the majority
of jews misunderstand judaism the majority of muslims misunderstand islam
this is just the nature of the beast and even
with modern teachers the majority of neo-evidence the the majority
of eckhart tolle followers misinterpret the teachings what's the solution
to that well there is no algorithmic solution this is
a core struggle of life epistemology is at the core
of all of your problems in life this is why
i harp on epistemology so much is because how can
you live a quality life when you don't have a
quality perception of reality and how can you have a
quality perception of reality when you don't spend time deeply
contemplating the nature of knowledge and self-deception when you don't
take these problems seriously and you treat them as mere
philosophy and word games when you take that attitude then
you misinterpret everywhere everything and the more advanced the teaching
the easier it is to misinterpret because interpretation is not
something that happens accidentally interpretation is done by design your
mind is misinterpreting by design you are literally misinterpreting reality
on purpose so that you can survive as the little
finite thing that you are because the finite thing you
believe you are itself is a gross misinterpretation of what
you actually are you fundamentally have misinterpreted infinity as something
finite you've misinterpreted consciousness as material substance you've misinterpreted mind
as physical reality and body and atoms you've misinterpreted science
as truth rather than a construction you've misinterpreted culture in
social constructions and institutions you've misinterpreted how government and politics
works you've misinterpreted your own capacities as a human and
what you're capable of this is the real work the
real work is correcting these misinterpretations in your mind the
real work is fixing your epistemology because if we can't
fix that you're rotten at the root you have no
foundation and your life will reflect that in subtle ways
that you can't even understand yet this is why i
push for the depth in these teachings that i push
for even though it doesn't seem immediately practical and you
might say well leo how does this concept help me
to get laid or how does this concept help me
earn more money or get something tangible that i want
and um it it very much will help you to
do all those things but it's going to be a
slow burn we're starting by reconfiguring your foundation because what
i'm interested in is helping you to build a very
solid structure not a house of cards what you get
with most other spiritual and personal development teachings are houses
of cards they're very flimsy they won't stand up to
serious scrutiny and a serious collision with reality if you
want to build something solid you got to start from
the bottom and when you start from the bottom it's
not as flashy and it doesn't give you as immediate
results you know when when the foundation of a skyscraper
is being laid most of the people in the city
don't see anything it doesn't look fancy it doesn't look
impressive but later when the highest levels of the skyscraper
are built everyone can see it and it looks impressive
but the highest layer the highest stories on the skyscraper
can only exist thanks to the foundation that was laid
that's what we're up to with actualize.org and i hope
you stay with me especially for these very foundational episodes
this is an investment that you are making into reconfiguring
the mental software the operating system that is going to
run the rest of your life it's going to pay
dividends day after day week after week month after month
year after year for your entire life and the only
cost is just your time and interest and energy and
passion for this that's the only thing that's keeping you
from actualizing this your complacency your laziness your closed-mindedness too
so really it's all up to you how great do
you want your life to be if you want your
life to be incredible if you want to live a
deep rich life then get serious right now about laying
a deep foundation upon which those fruits will be born
this is the fundamental mistake that people make when living
life is that they're not interested in the foundation they're
interested in the highest stories of the skyscraper and you
can't get those any other way but by building a
foundation and if you try to get them some other
way through fakery you're going to end up building a
house of cards and it's going to collapse it's not
going to be a solid skyscraper so be wary of
the shortcuts you want to take many times the short
easy solutions end up wasting more of your time than
sitting through one of these long three-hour episodes because at
least when you're done with one of my episodes it
will change something about how you see the world and
over time that changes your life so i hope you
stay tuned for more
