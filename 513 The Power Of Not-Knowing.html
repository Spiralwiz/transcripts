            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/RMXNQ-nGBSA' target='_blank'>The Power Of Not-Knowing</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Epistemology and the limits of knowledge</b>: The video highlights that while people may think they know a variety of things, from objects to abstract concepts, they often take for granted the limits of their knowledge. Knowing is a complex process and is often based on assumptions and biases shaped by our survival needs, comfort, and sanity. The video encourages questioning these assumptions and considering the possibility that one may not actually know what they think they know.
</li><li><b>The illusion of knowing</b>: The video emphasizes that most of the knowledge people hold is constructed, often biased, and can be seen as a conceptual illusion mistaken for reality. This illusion can make people defensive and attached to their beliefs, leading to disagreements and debates. However, this constructed knowledge can also quickly collapse under scrutiny, altered states of consciousness, or profound questioning.
</li><li><b>The challenge of truly understanding anything</b>: Using a fork as a simple example, the video unpacks the challenges of truly understanding or knowing what anything is. The task of defining a fork leads to subdividing it into other concepts (e.g., instrument, metal object, food utensil, etc.), and each of these subdivisions then also needs defining. This exercise reveals the complexity and difficulty in knowing anything in absolute terms, raising the question about whether knowing anything is truly possible.
</li><li><b>Dealing with the unknown</b>: The video suggests that confronting and embracing an awareness of the unknown can be a transformative process. It presents a shift from a 'knowing mode' to an 'unknowing mode' of thinking as a practice that can help in challenging the mind's assumptions and preconceived notions about the nature of reality.
</li><li><b>The implications of not truly knowing</b>: If people realize that they do not truly know the things they think they know, this has profound implications on their worldview. It challenges the whole conceptual framework through which they understand and interact with the world, thereby raising questions on more complex concepts such as life, death, reality, and knowledge itself. 
</li><li><b>Knowledge as a survival mechanism</b>: The video argues that the knowledge people think they possess is largely a survival mechanism, existing more for comfort and sanity rather than grounded in deep truth. Most of what is treated as known is highly relative, biased, and anchored in the survival needs of humans rather than in an objective understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Conceptual fortresses and knowledge bias</b>: The video argues that people's lives are built around a fortress of conceptual knowledge, which is in reality a fragile house of cards. Much of this knowledge is biased with people often being unaware of its relativity and quick to collapse under deeper scrutiny. This leads to people becoming defensive, especially when their ideologies and beliefs are challenged. 
</li><li><b>The challenge of defining knowledge</b>: Even among the greatest intellectuals, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, there is disagreement on what constitutes knowledge. This uncertainty and disagreement often lead to defensive behaviors and debates, further demonstrating the relative and biased nature of knowledge. 
</li><li><b>Societal pressure and constructed knowledge</b>: The video discusses how society and culture treat many concepts and realities as known, thereby fueling the illusion of knowledge. This societal pressure, particularly during formative years, reinforces the constructed nature of knowledge, confusing this construction with reality or objective truth. This is largely driven by the needs for survival, sanity, and comfort rather than the pursuit of deep truth. 
</li><li><b>Defending the conceptual house of cards</b>: The commentary highlights the defensive nature of people when their beliefs or understanding are challenged, due to being deeply engrossed in their conceptual house of cards. These defenses are triggered by perceived threats to their survival, sanity and comfort, further underscoring the notion that much of what people believe they know revolves around maintaining these essentials rather than seeking deep truth.
</li><li><b>Conceptual Illusion</b>: People often construct and defend their knowledge, creating a conceptual illusion that offers comfort and stability but is easily collapsed under questioning. These illusions lead to defensiveness and blame for others when problems arise, rather than recognizing the problems as a result of limited and flawed understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Ego and Knowledge</b>: The ego shapes knowledge to suit its needs, not with objective truth in mind. The desire for survival, sanity, and comfort often outweighs the pursuit of truth. This biassed perspective contributes to the many problems individuals face in life. 
</li><li><b>Partial and Biased Knowing</b>: Understanding of the world is often partial, biased and can be wrong, which leads to problems in life such as relationship issues, depression, obesity, etc. People often blame external factors for these problems rather than addressing the root cause - the flawed understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Programmed Beliefs and Ignorance</b>: Society programs individuals with social conditioning from birth through forms such as religion, science, education, and media. These programs lead individuals to accept beliefs that align with societal survival, not necessarily the truth. 
</li><li><b>Society's Illusion of Knowing</b>: Society creates an illusion of knowing, causing people to overestimate their knowledge, and underestimate the depth of their ignorance. This results in false assumptions about reality and a disregard for the importance of not knowing.
</li><li><b>Truth Seeking vs Being Right</b>: Individuals often prefer being right over seeking the truth, because admitting one's ignorant stance can be uncomfortable and threatening to the ego's security. This resistance to admit ignorance leads to biases, assumptions and often to wrong information being accepted as truth.
</li><li><b>The Role of Science</b>: Although science claims to support the concept of not knowing, it often overestimates its own insights and understanding, leading to intellectual arrogance. The areas that science claims to have understood are often, in fact, partially known or misunderstood.
</li><li><b>Pressure to Know</b>: Society and culture pressure individuals to claim knowledge even when they lack it, treating not knowing as a weakness. However, embracing the state of not knowing can lead to deeper understanding and knowledge.
</li><li><b>Humans as Conformists</b>: Humans often conform to societal and cultural ideas that work for their survival. However, this collective survival mechanism can lead to self-deception and trickery, particularly when conceptualized constructs like money are involved.
</li><li><b>Conceptual manipulation of intangible things</b>: Leo Gura explains that the powerful abstraction abilities of humans can both serve and harm us. Such abilities allow manipulation of intangible things like stock markets and currencies, which can have profound impacts on real-world tangible things. 
</li><li><b>Ignoring ancient skeptics' arguments against knowing</b>: Gura points out that humanity has largely ignored arguments made by ancient skeptics, such as the Pyronians, asserting the impossibility of knowledge. However, their arguments were dismissed as mankind prioritized the practicality and instrumentality of knowledge without considering its costs.
</li><li><b>Costs of pragmatic and instrumental knowledge</b>: Leo claims that while pragmatic and instrumental knowledge may benefit us in business and science, it comes with costs. These include closed-mindedness, getting stuck in simplistic narratives, self-deception, ideology, confusing the map for the territory, distorted perception of reality, and a disconnection from being, consciousness, and spirit.
</li><li><b>Fragility of mind and distaste for uncertainty</b>: Leo posits that the ego mind creates narratives to ground itself in reality and help itself to survive, in part due to its distaste for uncertainty. This simplification of reality is a necessary survival mechanism due to reality's infinite complexity.
</li><li><b>Interplay between mind and reality in knowledge acquisition</b>: He discusses the co-creative process between the mind and the world in understanding reality, where they entangle and invent as they come to know the world. This entanglement complicates the understanding of reality because one must question what existed before their own perception of it.
</li><li><b>Reality's infinite complexity and oversimplification by humans</b>: Leo highlights that reality's infinite complexity warrants simplification by human minds to make it knowable. These simplifications, like scientific models, are themselves realities and make reality feel more solid and objective than it actually is. However, this comes at the cost of a distorted perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Mind's primordial need to know itself</b>: Leo emphasizes how the mind's primordial need to know itself drives mankind's intellectual traditions and culture. He remarks that this desire underlines childish curiosities and even the seeking of knowledge by scientists, urging us to ponder on why reality strives to know itself.
</li><li><b>Reality as an infinite mind seeking self-understanding</b>: In this segment, Leo Gura discusses the concept of reality as an infinite mind constantly striving to understand and know itself. He believes this self-understanding drives all of consciousness and asserts that curiosity, often seen as a trait unique to humans, actually represents the universe or reality trying to comprehend itself. Gura suggests that if one were to follow this thread of curiosity with commitment and passion, it would lead to a profound understanding or realization of infinity and our true nature as god or reality itself.
</li><li><b>Understanding reality through finite concepts and narratives</b>: Gura critiques scientific attempts to encapsulate reality within finite concepts and narratives. He suggests that while these attempts generate detailed models and stories about the universe and its origins, they continually fail to grasp the true nature of reality due to its inherently infinite character. The dissatisfaction and unsatisfied curiosity resulting from this failure, he argues, reflect our deep-seated desire to understand ourselves and reality at a more profound existential level.
</li><li><b>Reality as too profound to be fully known</b>: Gura asserts that reality is too profound to be completely known through science, logic or any other system of finite concepts. Instead, he suggests awakening to the profundity of reality, which he presents as a deeper and more foundational experience than conventional systems of knowledge. This awakening involves embracing uncertainty or a state of not knowing, a process Gura admits can be difficult due to the ego's desire for knowledge and certainty.
</li><li><b>Intellectual arrogance and the courage to admit being wrong</b>: Gura addresses the intellectual arrogance often exhibited by people who pride themselves on their knowledge, including academics, public intellectuals, and scientists. He emphasizes the importance of having the courage to admit being wrong and suggests that acknowledging past mistakes can be less painful than perpetuating false beliefs.
</li><li><b>Approach to knowledge as a commitment towards truth</b>: Gura presents an ideal approach to knowledge as a commitment to truth, which often implies being comfortable with uncertainty and a state of not knowing. He gives importance to questioning and challenging beliefs and assumptions with a focus on seeking truth rather than clinging to falsified knowledge for the sake of maintaining one's intellectual ego and pride.
</li><li><b>Discussion on Denial of Being Wrong and Self-Deception</b>: Leo Gura suggests it's more feasible to admit when one's belief systems, like a religious one, are incorrect rather than living a life consistently justifying them to oneself. He emphasizes that many people would rather deny contradiction and not deeply consider their beliefs. He proposes that the 'state of not knowing' can save one from self-deception and closed-mindedness, as it pushes one out of self-induced fantasies.
</li><li><b>On Habitual Ignorance and Practicing "Not Knowing"</b>: Leo discusses the inherent difficulty in convincing a close-minded person to embrace uncertainty. He urges the listener to be brutally honest with oneself about the limitations of their knowledge, differentiating between believing and truly knowing something. This can be achieved through practicing introspection and embracing an honest state of "not knowing".
</li><li><b>Distinguishing between Theory and Reality of Not-Knowing</b>: Leo explains the difference between understanding the theory of "not knowing" and actually experiencing a state of not knowing. He elaborates on an exercise wherein individuals are guided to erase their past and future, as well as their knowledge of their immediate environment, in order to experience a true state of not knowing. This approach encourages one to leave behind preconceived notions and beliefs, resulting in a more aware present state. 
</li><li><b>Applying "Not Knowing" in Practical Life Situations</b>: Leo urges listeners to apply the concept of not knowing in everyday life scenarios like business, investing, and even personal relationships. By embracing the state of not knowing and discarding fantasies, individuals can shift to a more improvisational mindset that is rooted in the present. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Focusing on Direct Experience</b>: Leo advocates for the transition from pre-planning to an improvisational mindset. By focussing on the present moment, individuals can be more authentic and responsive. This approach encourages individuals to be open to higher truths while staying true to their own unique experiences. Leo emphasizes that personal truths will vary among individuals, hence the importance of testing his teachings for oneself.
</li><li><b>The importance of acknowledging uncertainty</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the need to acknowledge the uncertainty of supposedly known facts. He refers to widely accepted notions about our reality and asks his audience to admit their ignorance about these. He cites examples such as the age of the Earth, the health benefits of fish oil, the existence of Jesus, and the consciousness of others. 
</li><li><b>Entering a genuine state of not knowing</b>: Leo guides his audience to develop a state of not knowing that mirrors a newborn's perception of reality. This state disregards preconceived concepts and labeling, creating a deep contrast with our regular state of knowing and the theoretical concept of not knowing. He states that it's crucial to distinguish between talking about the concept of not knowing and the actual shift in state. 
</li><li><b>Alienation of familiar experiences</b>: Confronting the state of not knowing can be shocking, as it includes questioning seemingly certain aspects of reality. As an example, an individual is supposed to question their understanding of dwelling in a house or living on Earth. 
</li><li><b>Releasing societal norms and beliefs</b>: Leo argues that partisan perspectives, such as a commitment to Christianity or a scientific worldview, can hinder entry into a complete not-knowing state. All pre-existing labels, identities, and concepts need to be dropped to achieve this state, including concepts that define one's worldview.
</li><li><b>Cultivation of genuine not knowing</b>: Practicing the state of not knowing regularly is advised, to foster comfort with this state and to allow space for new insights and understandings. This process isn't a mere intellectual exercise, but a transformative shift in one's approach to reality. 
</li><li><b>Exploring personal ignorance</b>: Leo proposes an exercise where individuals list out ten things they claim to know but don't truly comprehend. The aim is to be honest about the limitations of knowledge and confront the gap between belief and direct experience. 
</li><li><b>Maintaining uncertainty</b>: Leo advises retaining a sense of humility and uncertainty even while interacting with common constructs of reality. By honing this approach, individuals can experience reality more directly and vividly, fostering deeper understanding and authenticity. 
</li><li><b>An open-minded approach to knowing</b>: Leo warns against presumptions of definitive knowledge and the refusal to truthfully admit, "I don't know." He suggests embracing the truth-seeking mindset and acknowledges that knowing anything with certainty is a paradoxically elusive pursuit. To anchor in wisdom, one should be comfortable admitting ignorance.
</li><li><b>Concept of God</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that for most people who have never had a direct consciousness of God, the honest truth is that they don't actually know whether God is real or not. This applies to atheists and Christians alike.
</li><li><b>Self-Deception and Belief</b>: Individuals often delude themselves with beliefs that they claim to know but don't actually know. Examples range from diet beliefs, like the benefits of fish oil, to personal beliefs, like whether they truly love their family or not. Admitting uncertainties, and by extension, their self-deception, can be difficult but is vital for growth.
</li><li><b>Honesty and Forgiveness</b>: It's crucial to be honest with oneself and admit when one has been posturing about knowing something. Recognizing past self-deception and accepting it aids personal growth. Forgiving oneself for past posturing is equally important since the mind usually tricks itself into believing things as a survival strategy.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience is King</b>: All knowledge is fundamentally second-order. It's about being, which is first-order. The raw experience of an object is its being and is separate from any knowledge or concepts associated with it. Leo Gura urges individuals to ground themselves in this direct experience rather than believing hearsay or unverified beliefs.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Conceptual Knowledge</b>: Conceptual knowledge allows one to avoid confronting the direct existence of an object. Additionally, it is prone to change, making it an unstable basis for understanding reality. It is the raw being or first-order of an object that allows for any conceptual understanding.
</li><li><b>Existence Precedes Knowledge</b>: The existence of a person, or their 'being', is independent of their knowledge about it. Understanding this is acknowledging that you exist prior to knowing what existence is or what you are.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization of Objects</b>: The understanding of objects like a fork can be recontextualized through deeper exploration. With consciousness awakening, a fork isn't merely a practical utensil. Instead, it can be recontextualized to symbolize concepts such as the mind, God, consciousness, or infinity.
</li><li><b>Knowledge as Second Order Infinity</b>: The process of knowing is seen as a subset of infinite reality. Like a hand that cannot grasp itself, infinity is unable to fully grasp itself. Knowledge is finite, explicit, and a part of infinity, while being is inherently mysterious and mystical, beyond explicit understanding. The error of science arises from the assumption that reality can be fully and explicitly explained.
</li><li><b>Relationship between Knowing and Being</b>: There is an inextricable link between knowledge, the world, and self. All knowing, ultimately, is being. Even the knowledge about a physical object, such as a fork, has its own state of being, separate from the object, creating layers of reality and knowledge. This stepping back to observe process refers to the problems addressed in previous discussions about the concept of going meta.
</li><li><b>Awakening and Direct Experience</b>: An awakening fundamentally replaces knowing with being. One understands something not by thinking or conceptualizing about it, but by becoming it. This transformation is facilitated by techniques such as meditation, self-inquiry, and psychedelics. In the deepest sense, all knowing results from being in contact with being.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Development through Being</b>: An awakening, awakening, an essential step in consciousness development, makes one intimately know an object by being it. Our intellectual or conceptual understanding falls short in comprehension when compared to direct experience or existence. The truth is found in states of not knowing, where one must become a part of reality in its raw form.
</li><li><b>Grasping Reality</b>: Advanced intellectual consciousness, like an alien species or AI, can grasp reality not through language or description but through direct experience. In this advanced state of consciousness, there is a one-to-one connection with reality that bypasses the need for secondary interpretive processes, eliminating the loss in translation issue inherent in language. The direct experience allows for a richer understanding that is lost in the second-order translation process. 
</li><li><b>Reflecting on Consciousness and Infinity</b>: Becoming reality is seen as a path to achieving a profound realization of infinite reality. Increasing one's consciousness serves as a platform to more accurately and fully experience reality. In this, there is no need for the second-order processes of labeling or language, as all understanding is direct and at the first order, similar to an advanced AI's understanding.
</li><li><b>Concept of Construct Awareness and Omniscience</b>: Leo Gura explains that knowing an object like a fork is to understand that it is not separate from our mind, but a part of it. True understanding arises not from the second-order conceptual level, but at the first-order level of being. This position allows us to grasp the concept of omniscience, which isn't knowing all specific information (like the count of atoms in a fork), but realizing our own mental constructions and perceptions.
</li><li><b>Implications of Closing the Gap Between Knowing and Being</b>: Open-ended curiosity might cause stress and other health issues if not properly addressed. It is exhausting to try to understand infinity from a second-order viewpoint. Achieving a state of complete "not-knowing" can lead to a deep satisfaction. The deepest form of omniscience is in realizing that every object, including our mind, is an image with intricacies that we construct.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Second-Order Knowing</b>: Using second-order methods such as science and religion to understand an infinite entity is futile. Traditional approaches to knowledge, including religion, philosophy, and science, fail as they seek the ultimate through relative knowledge, while the ultimate is absolute. The ultimate is best understood through first-order knowing, as experiencing something is itself absolute knowledge.
</li><li><b>The Role of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can produce powerful states of "not knowing" and provide deep insights into the fragility and relativity of knowledge. Psychedelics can reveal both the illusory nature of relative knowledge and the attainability of absolute knowledge. However, many intellectuals, scientists, historians, religious figures, politicians, and business people often fear psychedelics due to their potential to dismantle previously held paradigms and concepts.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction & Relationship with Not Knowing</b>: Deconstructing our understandings can lead to heightened states of "not knowing", and embracing "not knowing" can further facilitate deconstruction. The method of deconstruction involves analyzing and breaking down concepts or beliefs, thereby leading to a more profound understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Credit to Peter Ralston</b>: Leo Gura credits Peter Ralston for inspiring the topic of 'not knowing' through his book 'The Book of Not Knowing'. 
</li><li><b>Growth of the 'Not Knowing' Concept</b>: Leo shares how the concept of 'not knowing' has grown in his mind over the past year, which he relates to an acorn growing into an oak tree. He explains his continuous practice and application of 'not knowing' despite his intellectual nature and the frequent knowledge-based content he puts out for Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Mature Minds and 'Not Knowing'</b>: Leo proffers an observation about the relationship between understanding and ignorance the mature mind recognizes its ignorance more than the immature mind, but it ends up knowing the things the immature mind deems impossible, like the nature of reality, absolute truth, God, consciousness, love, infinity, and the paranormal.
</li><li><b>Practical Use of 'Not Knowing'</b>: Leo clarifies that embracing 'not knowing' doesn't mean discarding all knowing forever. He warns against getting lost in skepticism, cynicism, and epistemic nihilism to the point of becoming inactive and passive. He also advises caution to prevent the disruption of practical daily life activities through the misuse of 'not knowing'.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Core Survival Principles</b>: Even with the adoption of 'not knowing', Leo stresses the necessity of maintaining certain core practical survival activities such as working with purpose, maintaining a work ethic, good health practices, and conscious socializing. 
</li><li><b>Passion and Love in 'Not Knowing'</b>: He explains that passion and love for something should transcend any state of 'not knowing'. If a deeply held passion such as a life purpose starts wavering, it should be questioned consciously instead of letting the mind run wild to the point of derailment. 
</li><li><b>Misuse of 'Not Knowing'</b>: Leo reiterates the importance of using 'not knowing' carefully to avoid falling into traps of nihilism and depression, or using it as an excuse to indulge in unhealthy habits. 
</li><li><b>'Not Knowing' and Survival</b>: Leo concludes by highlighting a potential conflict between the quest for truth and survival. Deconstructing worldviews and questioning reality can challenge survival, but they're pursued with the aim to enhance and purify it.
</li><li><b>Construct Awareness and Mind Entanglement with Reality</b>: As we develop ego stages, our minds begin to realize that they construct reality. Objects like a fork become entangled with our minds, posing challenges to knowing because we question if something exists beyond our perceptions. The desire to understand ourselves and reality transcends mere curiosity, as we are God and reality wishes to understand itself. Many people deny that reality can understand itself, reflecting their lack of deep comprehension of what reality truly is.
</li><li><b>Importance of Not-Knowing for Growth</b>: Acknowledging our lack of knowledge is an integral part of growth. It allows us to become humble and open to the exploration of new ideas. It can be applied in our everyday lives as well; in the workplace, at school, or even within religious institutions.
</li><li><b>The Realization of Being Part of an Infinite Reality</b>: Reality is an infinite mind attempting to understand itself. Most people do not fully appreciate or explore their curiosity long enough to realize this. We must accept that reality is too profound to be fully known and stand in the unknown. The act of admitting "I don't know" can be challenging but is necessary for growth.
</li><li><b>Intellectual Arrogance and Pride</b>: Qualities like arrogance and pride among public intellectuals and academics can lead to flawed interpretations. To counter this, it is important to have the courage to admit when one is wrong. Leo uses the example of a religious cult to articulate the long-term benefits of admitting when a belief system is wrong.
</li><li><b>Achieving a Genuine State of Not Knowing</b>: Leo Gura guides viewers towards achieving a genuine state of not knowing. This involves erasing our past and get rid of any preconceived ideas about the world or ourselves. The aim is to be fully present in the moment, similar to the mindset of a newborn baby. This state allows us to experience the truth of our raw, present experience.
</li><li><b>Significance and Applications of Not Knowing</b>: Being in a state of not knowing is incredibly valuable for fostering new insights, understanding, and potentially even awakening. Leo suggests an exercise where individuals list 10 things they think they know, but aren't really sure of. This forces us to be honest with ourselves about our knowledge limitations and confront the truth.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality through Experience</b>: Trying to understand reality through second-order methods, such as science or religion, often leads to dissatisfaction. A direct, first-hand experience or "awakening" is required for a deeper understanding. Despite the potential dangers, psychedelics can induce powerful states of not knowing and can aid in this experience.
</li><li><b>Utilizing Not Knowing in Actions and Decisions</b>: Life decisions should be based on limited knowledge and probabilities, not waiting for absolute certainty. This doesn't mean acting half-heartedly but being decisive even with imperfect information. It is crucial to question one's desires, goals, and career choices rather than blindly following societal norms and expectations.
</li><li><b>Wise Use of Not Knowing</b>: Training in discernment is critical to avoid misuse of not knowing concept. It should neither lead to equating foolishness with wisdom nor inexperience with experience. Its recommended to tread safely while practicing not knowing, keeping survival and safety considerations in the forefront. Not knowing does not mean disregarding education and seeking knowledge through various mediums.
</li><li><b>Embracing Both the State and the Theory of Not Knowing</b>: Leo advises that dwelling in a state of not knowing and applying it to various aspects of life such as business, dating, investing and handling conflicts can lead to better understanding and growth. It is beneficial to embrace uncertainty as it paves the way for ridding oneself of assumptions and expectations, making way for a more improvisational mindset. 
</li><li><b>Handling Information Overwhelm and Misinformation</b>: Leo warns against falling into the trap of false equivalency where all information is seen as equally valid due to not knowing. He advises maintaining discernment and a healthy skepticism to prevent being misled by false information or propaganda proliferated by bad actors in the society.
</li><li><b>Applicability of Not Knowing in Day-to-Day Life</b>: He encourages practicing improvisation for better communication and authenticity. While not knowing can be applied across various situations, it should never be used to justify foolish actions or ideologies. It should also never become an excuse to avoid productive activities that contribute to self-growth and development.
</li><li><b>Pressure of Survival</b>: There's a societal expectation and pressure for people to appear knowledgeable due to their daily responsibilities and struggles, attributed metaphorically to a 'gun to the head'. This creates a cycle where people feel too busy or stressed to indulge in "not knowing".
</li><li><b>Practical Versus Philosophical</b>: Not knowing what a thing is (in a philosophical or metaphysical sense) does not prevent practical use of the thing. Hence, not knowing the philosophical nature of a fork doesn't prevent one from mastering its use. 
</li><li><b>Relativity of Knowledge and Personal worldview</b>: Leo Gura's understanding and teachings evolve as he goes deeper into 'not knowing'. This exploration reveals the limitations, contextual validity, and relativity of knowledge. He expresses a consciousness of how his own mind constructs his teachings and the necessity to be pragmatic in delivering them.
</li><li><b>Intuition and Higher Calling</b>: Leo emphasizes the role of intuition and following what the heart is drawn to. Conscience and the pursuit of personal interests can help guide right decisions and actions, even in the face of uncertainty.
</li><li><b>Unhealthy Lifestyles and Consequences</b>: Pursuing unhealthy habits such as excessive drug use, watching too many hours of television, and eating unhealthy food, can lead to undesirable consequences such as depression, suicide, and general discomfort. Real-world experiences can dictate the validity and effectiveness of choices made, pushing individuals towards healthier decisions.
</li><li><b>Being Open to Imperfection</b>: Life requires making imperfect choices through trial and error and gaining wisdom from suffering and experiences. Following intuition and being open to making mistakes is a part of this process.
</li><li><b>Applying 'Not Knowing'</b>: Embracing and applying 'not knowing' begins with contemplating the limits of what can be known. This involves recognizing societal pressures for absolute knowledge, respecting philosophical not knowing while still mastering practical usage, and balancing pragmatism with deeper philosophical ponderings. Lastly, it requires embracing intuition and personal desires despite imperfections and uncertainties.
</li><li><b>Embracing Epistemology</b>: Leo Gura underlines the importance of adopting epistemology, or the theory of knowledge. He urges viewers to question everything deeply and encourages critical contemplation to enhance understanding. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing our Ignorance</b>: Gura argues that we must continuously remind ourselves that we do not fully understand the essence of anything. This realization can pave the way for profound learning experiences.
</li><li><b>Entering a State of Not Knowing</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of regularly immersing ourselves in states of not knowing. This practice requires repeated effort and can lead to transformative insights.
</li><li><b>Potential of Psychedelics</b>: Gura suggests the use of psychedelics as a tool for entering deeper states of not knowing. However, he outlines crucial guidelines for safe usage, including ensuring one's mental health stability, maturity, and absence of medication interference.
</li><li><b>Resisting Societal Pressure</b>: Gura acknowledges societal pressure to possess knowledge. Despite this, he encourages the boldness to admit ignorance in various settings including workplaces and educational institutions. 
</li><li><b>Practicing Uncertainty</b>: Gura advises viewers to actively practice saying "I don't know," to confront and handle uncertainty better. This conscious practice makes room for deeper understanding and eliminates unnecessary debates or discussions based on speculation.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing Belief from Experience</b>: Gura highlights the importance of distinguishing between belief and direct experience. If the knowledge is based on belief or speculation, it should be categorized as an unknown.
