            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jOCfE0ZL0Xw' target='_blank'>Personal Development - Tips About How to Give Advice</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding a Topic Logically vs Emotionally</b>: Learning something logically is different from integrating it emotionally. An individual might comprehend the advice provided but may not emotionally align with it. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of Advice Giving</b>: It's easy to assume that everyone shares the same values, desires, and learning styles. But this leads to ineffective advice as the advice may not suit the person's individual values or current situation.
</li><li><b>The Important Role of Personal Experience in Learning</b>: Recognizing the value of personal struggle and experience is paramount. Lessons internalized through personal experiences with extreme pain or pleasure are likely to have a more significant impact than lessons learned from books, religious leaders, or mentors.
</li><li><b>Potential Pitfall in Sharing Learned Lessons</b>: While it's understandable to want to share hard-earned lessons with others to help them avoid similar struggles, providing these "golden nuggets" overlooked the importance of personal struggle in the learning process.
</li><li><b>The Accuracy of Advice Based on Personal Experiences</b>: Even if the advice giver's experiences and research support their advice, it may not be the right advice for the recipient at their current stage or situation in life.
</li><li><b>Role of Deep Questions in Advice Giving</b>: Asking deep, thought-provoking questions can be an effective advice-giving tool, as it prompts the recipient to reflect and generate their own answers, fostering motivation and boosting the likelihood of active implementation. 
</li><li><b>Embracing Mistakes as Part of the Learning Process</b>: Mistakes are valuable learning tools that contribute to wisdom and experience. It's essential to allow room for individuals to make their own mistakes and learn from them, provided they don't have severe consequences. 
</li><li><b>Respecting Individual Intellect to Discern Best Course of Action</b>: It's important to trust in the recipient's resourcefulness and capacity to determine what works best for them in the long run, while resisting the urge to rush their learning process. 
</li><li><b>Engaging in Empathetic Acknowledgement</b>: Rather than resorting to condescending approaches, it is often more effective to acknowledge the recipient's struggle and share personal experiences that can potentially guide them.
</li><li><b>Importance of acknowledging individual learning processes</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that even though the advice given may be objectively good and backed by research or personal experiences, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right advice for that particular person or that it's the right time for them to hear it. It's important to understand that everyone has different learning processes and some people may need to struggle through things to really understand and internalize them. 
</li><li><b>Shifting from advice-giving to deep questioning</b>: Gura suggests a shift from direct advice-giving to asking deep, prodding questions. This encourages individuals to think and re-evaluate their lives, eventually leading to them generating their own answers. This approach tends to create more sustainable change as people are more likely to act on insights that they have discovered themselves. 
</li><li><b>Value of allowing struggle and mistakes</b>: Gura dissuades from attempting to shortcut someone's learning process, emphasizing that struggles and mistakes are integral parts of life that contribute to building wisdom and experience. He advises that, bar extreme cases with drastic consequences, individuals should be allowed the freedom to explore, make mistakes, and learn from them. 
</li><li><b>Promoting trust and resourcefulness</b>: Instead of asserting personal wisdom, Gura suggests trusting in individual's resourcefulness and intellect, allowing them to find out solutions that work best for them in the long run. He encourages creating an environment where individuals can reflect on their paths, possibly realizing missteps and seeking advice on their terms, thus avoiding a condescending "I-told-you-so" stance. 
</li><li><b>Self-awareness in advice-giving</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own tendency to want to shortcut others' learning processes. For anyone in the advice-giving profession, or for parents and mentors, this awareness is crucial to resist the urge to bypass someone's unique learning curve.
