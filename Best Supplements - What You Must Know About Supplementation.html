hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're doing something a little bit different now I've
been getting some requests from people asking me about supplementation
I've been giving you guys some recommendations about nutrition and
what you should be doing there and also people have
been asking about what kind of supplements should you take
and I think I'm a good person to ask because
I've been taking a lot of supplements lately a few
years ago I really got involved with with biohacking which
is the idea that you can you can start to
optimize your body in various ways through nutrition and fitness
and other little life hacks you can start to optimize
your body to give you the best performance for work
and for life and you can also start to optimize
your mind as well so your cognitive performance I really
got interested by this idea that you can optimize cognitive
performance and actually become more creative increase your IQ become
sharper become more clear minded become more conscious through various
things you can do besides just mental work so I
give you guys a lot of ideas about personal development
work that you can do which is all going on
inside your psyche but there's also stuff you can do
on the outside stuff you can do physically with your
body and stuff you can do physically with your brain
which aids you in doing that and I am excited
about finding every the little possible optimization that I can
so in an effort to do that I really got
involved with with supplements and I started researching them and
started taking a little bit of supplements here a little
bit of supplements there until eventually I got to the
point where I'm taking all these look at this this
right here this is all the supplements that I take
every day and this is I counted about 25 bottles
so that's about 25 different supplements here now this is
a little bit overkill I don't recommend you take this
many I did this for some very specific reasons first
of all I was kind of experimenting second of all
I had a thyroid issue at a low thyroid and
because of that I started researching causes of thyroid and
one of the concerns that I found was that there
could be various in insufficiencies with vitamins and minerals and
so I started to go through this trial and error
process of trying different vitamins and minerals and seeing if
they improve my energy improved my mood when you have
a little thyroid the symptoms of that are really sleeping
is grogginess low energy not wanting to work as hard
lack of motivation problem controlling body temperature because your thyroid
controls your metabolism and so I wanted to find a
natural solution to this and I started doing a lot
of research and kind of went down this deep little
rabbit hole of supplementation what I thought I would do
with you guys here is I would take you through
each one of the supplements that I take explain a
little bit and as I'm going through you're gonna get
some some insights into how to supplement properly and let's
just crack into that but before we do let me
show you what this actually looks like one of the
things that I did and this is a really good
little just time-saving technique is you get a large large
large pill box because when you get the spinning supplements
it just became too big of a hassle every day
to open 25 bottles and pull one out and what
I found myself doing was not taking my supplements so
what I found as a solution is you get a
pill box and I got one originally that was significantly
smaller and it was so small that I could only
fit a couple of different supplements into it and so
I had to go on Amazon and specifically find the
largest pill box constructed by man and this is it
and this guy can probably fit a hundred pills I
haven't even really filled half of it but let me
just show you what it kind of looks like what
we're talking about these supplements so it kind of looks
like that as far as quantity goes and some of
these supplements you take double pills off because you need
you just need more of them than one so that's
about that's about right and so I take a handful
of those everyday let's get into each supplement and I'm
gonna go through I'm gonna tell you the ones that
are more iffy and probably ones that you don't really
really need to take and I'm gonna tell you some
other ones that are pretty essential and I think that
everyone should take because there's actually some some solid science
behind them and the first one that we should start
off with that fits that bill is where is it
yes omega-3 omega-3 fish oil this one is probably the
number one supplement that you should be taking everyone should
be taking the ratio Omega threes to Omega 6s in
your body is it's directly correlated to the disease that
you experience an inflammation and cardiovascular health and all sorts
of other nasty problems so if you're eating the standard
American diet which is just garbage and complete then you
you have a ratio of Omega 6s to Omega 3s
that's totally totally out of whack that means you have
so many Omega 6s and so little Omega 3s that
is just throwing your body from the inside out pretty
much so you obviously want to clean up your diet
but you also want a supplement with high quality omega-3
supplement and this one has 500 EPA and 250 DHA
and that comes as two pills so you take two
of these to get the daily dose you take two
of these per day and this one comes from I
don't know what this is coming from from cod liver
oil or something like that okay so this is like
from sardines and anchovies and mackerel so you want to
make sure it's a really highly filtered source of omega-3
because fish can contain various toxins and mercury and other
stuff so you want to make sure that this is
highly filtered by a high quality one and even better
is you might want to invest in krill oil krill
oil is a source of omega-3 that's the highest quality
that you can get but it tends to be a
little pricey so this is just regular fish oil so
that one I recommend you definitely take the next one
I think that is important is vitamin C vitamin C
right there this is a hundred milligrams per per pill
so this is what a pill looks like you take
one of these that's 100 milligrams so I take one
of these a day vitamin C is good for strengthening
your immune system basically it's a it just it makes
all the chemical process disease in your body run smoother
and this will help you from catching colds if you
catch colds a lot it will help you from some
of the aches and pains that you have so this
one is good IDE some recommend you take it especially
if you're having a cold or you feel a cold
coming on I'll start taking these in large quantities like
I'll start taking five or ten a day you can
take a lot of vitamin c without overdose it's not
something that is gonna stay and your body's gonna flush
out and your body can actually utilize a lot of
vitamin c so this is good stuff and this brand
this solar a brand what's nice about it is that
these are two stage time release capsules so this is
a more expensive brand but what's good about it is
that it releases in stages so it's gonna release in
one stage when it gets in your stomach and then
it'll actually it'll it'll still stay not completely dissolved and
then hours later when it goes into your like lower
intestines it will dissolve again a second time so this
gives you a more steady and consistent flow of that
vitamin C rather than just getting one big hit of
it this will stay with you for the whole day
so that's a nice little extra feature of that one
the next one I'm gonna recommend is well let's see
you I'm gonna I want to do them in order
of importance for you guys so it's gonna be vitamin
d3 this is a crucial crucial crucial vitamin that you
in fact are probably right now lacking and you might
be severely lacking in it and when you lack in
it you get all sorts of problems energy problems just
bad stuff starts to happen so what you want is
you want to actually get a blood test for vitamin
d3 at your doctor's office and you should do this
every year it's a simple test it'll cost about 50
bucks but what I'll tell you it'll tell you exactly
what your d3 level is because it is possible to
have too much d3 although that's probably not the case
for you unless you're taking extraordinary quantities of supplements because
the way vitamin d3 is synthesized in your body is
through sunlight contacting your skin and since most of us
are not out in the Sun very often what happens
is that we don't get enough natural vitamin d3 and
vitamin d3 is not found in foods so that means
that you either go out into the Sun more or
you start taking supplements and I recommend taking a large
dose the recommended doses that most websites out there or
books are telling you about are too low that's why
you get tested because I am taking this look this
is one pill is 5,000 IU's which is already a
lot but I take two of these a day so
that's 10,000 IU's now that's way above all the recommendations
but I actually get my d3 tested and I'm a
little bit low I'm not low but I'm on the
low end of the of the normal range so that
means that that I could still be taking even more
of it this is what it looks like it's a
really small pill so it's easy to to swallow that
sucker but definitely check yourself there especially if you're having
any sort of energy problems or health problems you want
to make sure that your d3 level is solid all
right next one I'm going to recommend and this one
is actually probably my favorite of all this is one
of the miracle discoveries that I found in the last
two years this is my well-kept little secret is called
maca maca maca root so this is a root from
South America I believe and it's called an energizing herb
but actually what it does is it it acts to
boost your libido so this is really good for reproductive
health and oh my god does it work it works
so power this is like natural viagra so this works
actually for both men and for women and I stumbled
upon this and I was reading the reviews on Amazon
for this vitamin or for this for this maca supplement
and most the reviews are actually they're from women who
are having problems with with the reproductive system or administration
problems irregular periods other stuff like that and so they
they say that taking this helps and but it's also
great for men because it makes you ridiculously ridiculously horny
it gives you a super strong sex drive when you
take this your woman is going to be pleased what
you can do in bed on this is ridiculous it's
absolutely ridiculous so I think it just beyond that I
think it's just healthy for you because this is a
natural this is not like viagra it's not a chemical
so this is gonna not only just make you more
energetic and more vigorous it's also going to just strengthen
your immune system make sure that everything is firing on
all cylinders for you I recommend this for men and
for women at least one a day this is 500
milligrams and it's just a normal size feel so I'm
not going to show it to you what else what
else what else vitamin A vitamin A I love vitamin
A this is another one that I love because I
can actually feel the effect of it what this one
does for me I don't have good vision I actually
wear contacts and even when I wear my contacts I'm
not at 20/20 vision because it's hard to focus in
context if you get a really strong prescription so what
this does is this eye actually improves my vision when
I take it I can feel my vision get sharper
when I'm on vitamin A so if you have vision
problems or you have problems with with your eyes then
definitely start to take this stuff now vitamin A you
got to be a little bit careful with because you
can overdose on it so ideally you want to get
blood tests for it I don't get blood tests for
it but I just make sure that I'm not really
going over overboard although I do take a pretty high
dose this this one I take here is 10,000 IU's
I found that that's a safe dose to take without
having to really do blood tests and this vitamin A
comes from fish liver oil which is actually important because
if you get vitamin A that comes from a plant
source and many of the vitamin A is out there
do come from plant sources then they are not going
to do the they're not going to have the same
effect as as an animal-based vitamin A they're they're really
different compounds so you want to make sure that you're
getting one that's coming from really some sort of fish
liver oil ideally so that one is great let's see
what else do I like magnesium magnesium is important especially
if you're having any sort of issues with your bowels
bowel movements especially if you have constipation problems then magnesium
is really going to help you out I know when
I was really doing heavy paleo and I was eating
very low carbs I was having some issues with with
that with digestion and magnesium really really helped me out
until I stumbled upon this I was really having a
lot of difficulty so magnesium will just make everything kind
of flow through your system very nicely and this is
just like one of those natural elements that that you
need and you need quite a lot of it and
that means that I take six of these pills today
six of these guys magnesium is kind of like a
big molecule so you need a lot of these pills
to really get the daily dose that you want and
what's important about this is that you want to get
a magnesium source there are various forms of magnesium you
want to get one that's chelated what that means is
that it's a more bioavailable form of the molecule than
than other forms and that means that it's going to
be actually absorbed by your intestines easier this is actually
a common theme among all the supplements here is that
you want to make sure that you get forms of
these supplements that are highly bioavailable because a lot of
the cheaper brands a lot of the cheap stuff that
you will get at Walmart or one of the grocery
stores what's gonna happen there is that yes your service
saving some money but you're actually wasting money because of
what you're getting is you're getting a non bioavailable form
of it and that means that most of it is
going through your system it's not being absorbed and there
that means you're you're really are wasting a lot of
your money so what I found is important is to
get chelated magnesium alright so what is next done okay
here's a good one eg CG what is eg CG
it's an extract from green tea and it's basically giving
you a lot of antioxidants so green tea has been
studied in a lot of research and it's been shown
that green tea drinking just a cup of high-quality natural
green tea every day helps with antioxidants and giving you
anti-aging and all sorts of health benefits so the next
best thing unless you're going to drink a cup of
green tea every day is perhaps to take it in
a pill form it's not quite clear whether the pill
form is as effective as actually drinking the tea so
ideally you actually would drink a cup of green tea
and I've actually been doing that so that's nice but
you can also take it in pill form this is
400 milligrams recommend that one as well alright what else
we get natural resveratrol okay what is that resveratrol resveratrol
is good for cardiovascular support and also antioxidants in a
the aging and this is coming from grapes this is
coming from the compound in red wine that studies have
been showing has actually been having a good positive effect
on on heart health and an anti-aging well if you
take that and you take the wine out of it
and you take all the alcohol out of it and
you reduce it and you just get the Ritz marrow
which is the key compound then you can get it
as a pill form this is 200 milligrams and so
that might be something that you're interested in what else
do I have here ooh I like this one okay
this one is called astha Faxon a little hard to
pronounce ask the Faxon and the brand of it is
called bio Aston so I recommend the brand and the
the supplement itself is called astha saxon what is that
this is actually one of the most potent antioxidants that's
been found and it's like potent by a factor of
a hundred greater than other antioxidants and what this is
is this is if you know anything about salmon and
you know that salmon has pink flesh the reason that
salmon has pink flesh at least the wild salmon that
is because it eats little krill and other shrimp and
and little fish from the sea which give it that
that red that red that red coloration and that is
that red coloration is the anise taxon so if you're
eating salmon a high quality source of wild alaskan salmon
that's not contaminated by mercury then you're getting some anise
tax in there but what this company did is they
actually found a way to develop it from from various
algae so they they farm algae and then they extract
anti-sex and from it somehow and they give you this
very pure very highly concentrated form of it and this
is supposed to be just an overall awesome antioxidant one
of the most powerful ones out there so that's why
I like it and I take a really high dose
I take 12 milligrams and it comes in a black
pill that looks kind of cool like this little pill
not too hard to swallow the other nice thing that
I like about it if you're fair-skinned like me and
you burn easily in the Sun supposedly haven't proved this
myself but supposedly this acts as a natural sunscreen so
it makes your skin actually resistant to sunburn which I
find really cool if that is true I haven't really
tested it myself yet okay what else do we have
I'm gonna go through and give you just some kind
of just basic minerals for example copper that's kind of
like an essential mineral you might be missing it so
you might want to supplement also zinc make sure you're
getting your zinc in a in a absorbable form I
get the zinc picolinate it's also just kind of a
basic mineral what else do we got we've got vitamin
K no vitamin K is here okay vitamin K so
this is a k2 complex so it's a mix of
vitamin K's it's got vitamin k1 and k2 and this
is good also if you're lacking in vitamin K you
might get a blood test for that and check what
else do we got manganese also kind of just a
basic element that you might be missing and we've got
mega full onyx so this is full onic acid this
is actually a more bioactive form of folic acid and
folic acid is something that you really shouldn't be taking
from what I've read so Falana Cassidy is better so
this is something you might be interested in iron now
iron you have to be careful with because you don't
want too much iron in the blood it'll actually cause
cancer so you want to be careful with this women
should be supplementing iron because because they're men straighting every
month for men iron supplementation usually not required unless you
have heavy bleeding for some reason but actually I found
my my blood test shows a little bit low iron
and that's related to low thyroid so I figured that
I would supplement a little bit with it it's not
something you want to be taking constantly this is something
you take when you need it and the form of
iron I take here is called Ferro gel which is
actually important because iron is hard for your body to
absorb so you want to get the most bioavailable form
that you can possibly get all right next what do
we got rhodiola you've probably heard of that one it's
pretty popular herb rhodiola is an app the genic herb
and what it does is it kind of smoothes out
your cortisol levels and your your hormones and it gives
you energy and it really stabilizes your energy so your
energy is nice and consistent and high so check that
one out if you're having energy issues and sleepiness issues
the other one that's nice is selenium now this is
a basic element that your body needs and sometimes we
don't get enough of it it is possible to overdose
on selenium so don't take too much I take 200
milligrams 200 micrograms a day that's one of these pills
and and that's it don't take too much of it
what else okay here's a little one this one is
called Tarot stilbene kind of like a pterodactyl kind of
a weird name what this is is it's actually a
an even better version of resveratrol this is extracted from
from grapes from the seeds of red grapes and this
is like the supposedly the ultimate compound that is responsible
for all the health benefits of wine so that one
is even better than resveratrol what else we have here
I've got vitamin b6 except this is the best form
of it and it's called p5 p5 no just P
5 P pyridoxal 5 phosphate so it's a form of
vitamin b6 that's the most bioavailable and this is just
if you have low b6 what else do I have
here super bio curcumin this is a cool one so
curcumin that's the active ingredient in turmeric and tumeric actually
has been shown to have a lot of positive benefits
on colon health and digestive the digestive system and really
turmeric and curcumin have been used for millennia in you
know Indian cultures and Asian cultures in East so this
is an awesome one because it prevents colon cancer and
other nasty things like that and just make sure that
just have system good so the trick with curcumin though
is that it's really difficult for your body to absorb
it and so most forms of curcumin like eighty percent
of it doesn't get absorbed it just comes out of
your system and of course that's a waste of money
and you're not getting any of the benefit so what
I got is I got super bio curcumin this is
actually a patented new form of curcumin that's been specifically
designed for high bioavailability and most of this like 80%
or 90% of it gets absorbed so this is worth
the investment even though it costs a little more all
right the next is my community host defense alright what
is this this is a combination of 15 different exotic
mushrooms and it's supposed to help your immune system so
the mushrooms listed here include all sorts of weird things
but the more familiar ones are Maya taki reishi lion's
mane shitake so there's a lot of mushroom cheese there's
literally like 15 different types and they're all blended together
and this comes from Paul stamens he's kind of a
he's a mushroom expert and this is recommended by him
for improved immune system I take these when I'm having
a cold people say that this helps them get over
colds faster so you might want to check that one
out what else do we have extra strength ginkgo biloba
so you've probably heard of this this is a classic
herb that helps with mental function and memory and this
is actually one of the ones that I really was
interested in because I'm always interested the most and anything
that will improve my cognitive performance so this is supposed
to improve just clear thinking and memory what else do
we have huperzine a that's another one that's for your
brain this one is supposed to improve learning and memory
you might want to check that one out acetal l-carnitine
that is also one for your brain that a chemical
that your brain uses to run more smoothly and so
this is gonna give you sharper clearer thinking it's a
500 milligram tablets and final two we've got beta glucan
this is a cool one because I heard a lecture
by one guy that was talking about how farmers what
they'll do farmers and ranchers who mass-produce cattle and feed
cattle a lot of corn in order to get the
most yield from the cow at the least cost what
that ends up doing is that ends up sickening the
cow because literally what's happening is that they're feeding the
cow the lowest possible quality of food and so that
cow can barely live on that food and so they
feed it just the right quantity of food and the
quality of food so that that cow can live just
enough days for it to get slaughtered if it have
to live any more than that it would die naturally
because of the horrible food of a you feed it
so in order to actually make that happen what they
do because the cows get diseases and all sorts of
problems what they do is farmers will buy by the
ton load literally by the ton they will buy beta
glucan and they will feed it to the cows because
this helps the cows immune system and it helps them
live long enough to actually get slaughtered so the farmers
know that this works and they use it by the
by the ton load to feed it to the cattle
to keep it to keep it alive and what is
beta glucan exactly well it's a complex polysaccharide so it's
a composed of glucose molecules extracted and purified from cell
walls of common baker's yeast so it's it's kind of
like a form of sugar but apparently somehow it helps
your immune system and last is an interestingly called herb
called gymnema Sylvestre and I got interested in this one
because supposedly what it does is it supports your glucose
metabolism and it helps even out your blood sugar and
it it reduces sugar cravings I actually got on this
when I was eating very strict paleo and I was
due super super low carbs I was under fifty grams
of carbs per day and if you've ever tried that
it's really difficult because almost everything has carbs in it
and you also start to get cravings for sugar because
you're everything you're eating has no sugar in it so
to do that I started taking this to see if
it would reduce my my sugar cravings alright so that
is it that's about 25 different supplements I've already showed
you what they look like in my pill box and
I just take them all every day that's about it
ultimately what you want to remember from this you don't
want to probably get this deep first of all this
is expensive right this is 25 degree supplements and these
need to be replaced every month so what does this
cost this cost about hundred forty dollars per month to
maintain this that's pretty pretty big expense so don't do
unless you have reasons I have some important reasons because
I was working out my thyroid and honestly I'll probably
scale back on some of these because some of them
like you know I don't know I don't really feel
the effect so I'm not sure if they're working or
not and it isn't expense that you know I don't
want to be spending money on something that isn't working
but there's also the case to be made that this
is your health and if you have viable research that
shows that this is something that's important to you it's
gonna help you then I say go out and do
it and spend money because you're wasting that money elsewhere
anyways instead invest it in your health make sure that
you're living healthy and I think the most important for
you guys if you're just kind of a layman and
you're not going to get too heavy into biohacking then
I would just recommend a couple of these I would
say definitely the omega-3 have a high quality vitamin C
maca everyone should be taking maca this is gonna this
is gonna make you so much happier in the bedroom
and what else do I recommend definitely vitamin d3 supercritical
I also think vitamin A is good for eye health
and I would recommend anise Taksin because this is the
highest antioxidant that there is known to man and if
you're going to take an antioxidant this is the one
that you should be taking as far as the rest
of them I would say you know hold off unless
you have good reasons then don't take them unless there's
blood work or you have energy problems or something like
that I think magnesium is also a good one to
recommend generally because it helps with digestion so really you
don't need to go all out and be crazy you
can just you know pick the ones that you need
and then if you find yourself getting more involved and
looking for ways to really optimize yourself and maybe look
into enhancing your brain function then you can try some
of these other ones and there's literally hundreds of others
out there I think the key tips are eight do
your research okay make sure you do the research and
you understand each supplement you take as you can see
here like I didn't I didn't prepare for this talk
I did so much research on these supplements over the
summer that I know them all by heart I know
exactly what they do I know I know I know
the quantities the volumes etc so make sure that that's
what's happening don't just take a supplement not knowing what
it's doing also point B is that I want you
to find the most high-quality supplements that you can not
necessarily most expensive but the high quality ones make sure
that this is a bioavailable form of the supplement and
that it has good reviews and this is a you
know something that there's been Studies on so that point
and the next point I would make is the next
tip I actually have for you is use amazon.com to
research supplements I found this is an awesome tip what
you do is you just go and you search your
supplement and then you can look at all the different
brands and look at the reviews and people there will
tell you a lot of anecdotal evidence about how it's
working for them what kind of problems it's solving for
them and I found that's a good way to do
research the problem is that actual science on this stuff
right now is pretty limited aside from stuff like fish
oil and maybe vitamin C and and vitamin D there's
just not that much evidence out there just the the
state of nutrition science and health science right now is
it's quite limited so we're very much in the dark
ages I feel and maybe 50 or 100 years from
now all this stuff will be really figured out and
we'll know exactly what every one of these does or
does not do but right now you're just kind of
gambling a little bit none of these are gonna hurt
you not if you get a decent source of it
I mean I been taking this stuff for for a
couple of years now and there's no negative effects from
it it's just that you might be kind of wasting
your money wasting your time so start with the ones
that really have give you a bang for your buck
and the rest of them you have to experiment you
