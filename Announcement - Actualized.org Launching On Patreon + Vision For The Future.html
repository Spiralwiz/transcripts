hey there Leo here for actualize org and this is
an announcement video of actualized org launching on patreon if
you're not familiar with patreon already patreon is a platform
that allows you to support independent artists and creators by
making small monthly donations and contributions through that platform so
if you want to help support actualize org if you
find a value in the content that I produce and
you want to incentivize more of this then go there
go to patreon.com/scishow the gist of my announcement here but
I want to continue a little bit to elaborate upon
my thought process behind why I decided to do this
and where actualize that org is going in the future
I want to share a little bit of my vision
for where this can go so I've actually been mulling
this idea over for probably close to a year about
whether I should join patreon or not and I've been
hesitant about it because I don't generally like to heavily
monetize my work I feels like it undermines my work
to do that I don't like to cheapen it that
way I don't want to beg people for donations you
know I could be monetizing actualized I work a lot
more than I am I could hire a business guy
a marketing guy who could come in here and squeeze
every penny out of it that we could squeeze out
of it and we could squeeze out of it probably
five times more than I'm earning right now if I
if I really wanted to the way that some other
channels do it by running a ton more ads by
doing you know in video sponsorships which is common nowadays
by doing paid reviews and all this sorts of stuff
of various self-help products you know this is all standard
industry practice in the self-help industry I've been very careful
to avoid that with my work you know my videos
are very long generally you know to our videos I
could easily stuff 10 20 ads into one of those
videos when they're that long but I don't and I
want to keep it that way and I could turn
actualize org into a large corporate organization which is all
about growth and maximizing profits I could have done that
years ago I've decided not to I don't want to
go down that road see because what we're doing here
is something special something different something that's not mainstream something
that's not corporatized something that's not about the profits yet
at the same time of course survival is as you
should know by now just a general function of life
and so actualize that org is a business it is
competing with other businesses and other channels on YouTube it
is competing for advertising and it has to compete in
that marketplace not because I need massive profits although of
course that's nice but simply because money is the lifeblood
of business if your business isn't profitable you go out
of business then you can't do the thing you want
to do you can't help people in the ways you
want to help them now of course it's easy to
go overboard with that and just to make the business
about the profits so it's all about striking a very
careful and delicate balance now as far as these patreon
donations go I'm not doing it because I'm starving for
money and because I need money personally to support myself
I'm very comfortable I'm very well-off I don't need more
money in terms of that but as I was looking
at the situation I saw that patreon could allow me
some new opportunities with actualize that org for expanding improving
and growing it in the future and that's really what
these donations are about so it's not about personally for
me I'm actually a very frugal person I had to
be in order to get to the point where I'm
at now so for me now it's just easy to
be frugal I don't waste my money on fancy sports
cars and fancy luxury watches and all the sorts of
stuff I mean I could I could go out and
buy a Lamborghini tomorrow with cash I could do that
I don't because it does nothing for me like the
things that I'm interested in life are way beyond that
kind of materialistic stuff but money is a resource and
we can use this resource we can leverage this resource
to do good in the world one infant one of
the problems in fact that the world faces right now
is that there's so much wealth and money going around
in the economy but it's going largely to the wrong
sources it's being used to fund low consciousness versus high
consciousness activities and teachings and that's a big problem I've
talked about in my episode called the deep problem of
marketing see and that's something we're facing here like we're
trying to spread self actualizing wisdom and we're trying to
spread awareness of awakening in all this but that's hard
to do when you're competing against giant conglomerates corporations that
are raking in millions and billions of dollars and then
using it simply for pure profits and then of course
they do that by exploiting you by showing you various
kinds of low consciousness ads and getting you to buy
low consciousness products and services which ultimately keep the population
in a state of low consciousness so this is something
that we're dealing with and in this way I saw
that will we can use this possibility for donations as
a way to combat that trend see so here's what
your money might go to if you donate through patreon
first of all it helps me to maintain my creative
independence and that's huge for me really that was my
whole point of becoming an entrepreneur in the very beginning
is I had big ambitions and dreams of things I
wanted to share with people the kind of artistic work
that I wanted to do the creative work that I
wanted to do and I saw that it was it
was not gonna be possible to do that work unless
I develop complete autonomy complete independence from any corporation or
any investors or anything like that because I don't want
to be beholden to any of them I want to
put out the kind of content and work that needs
to be put out and I want to be able
to say the brutal things the truthful things that I
need to say sometimes that would just impossible in any
kind of corporate or institutional environment and so of course
the only reason actualized work exists in the first place
is because I was already financially successful from prior businesses
that I started when I started actualised org you see
I didn't really start it from scratch truly I already
had a comfortable cushion of money that I earned I
talked a little bit more about how I did that
in my life purpose course but anyways that is what
allowed me to cover many of the niche topics that
I covered because otherwise I wouldn't be able to actually
lift my channel off the ground because I would have
to be covering topics that are very click Beatty that
are very mainstream to get it off the ground otherwise
because I would be desperate for money and say I
don't want to be in that position so I still
have full creative independence but you know who knows what
the future holds I want to be able to maintain
that so your your donations help with that it means
that I can cover deeper topics less mainstream topics I
can cover more esoteric topics I don't have to rely
on clickbait as much with the work that I do
I don't have to worry as much about monetizing things
because you know as a business person you do have
to worry about monetization of your products and services because
if you don't it's easy to go out of business
you see for me this business is not about earning
lots of money this business is about sharing these powerful
and deep insights that I feel are not being shared
nearly enough in our society and in our culture so
your donation can help with that to maintain my independence
another way that your donation can help is with more
original research I do quite a bit of original research
with my work I don't just read books and pare
it back what I read to you of course I
do some of that but I also go out and
invest money and my time into researching new technologies new
techniques new gadgets new chemicals and whatever else I can
help you to self-actualize and to give me deeper insights
that I can then share with you a lot of
my time is devoted to that in fact over the
last three years or so since I released my life
purpose course originally my plan was that I was gonna
be releasing like a new course every year but the
life purpose of course came out and I sort of
had a choice I could have worked on the next
course immediately which would have earned me a lot of
money you know releasing courses of course helps me earn
money and helps to maintain actualize that org without the
courses that wouldn't be possible but what I did instead
over the last three years is I poured more of
my time and energy into research to deepen the content
of the free videos which you've seen it deepened a
lot over the last three years and this has been
a major time sync for me which basically ate up
all of my time to the point where I I
didn't have time to work on new courses I'm still
working on some and I still plan to be releasing
more paid courses in the future and sometimes people ask
well Leo why why do you charge money for your
courses because if I didn't there couldn't be actualized that
org another reason actually why is because I already shower
you with a bunch of free content in fact it's
actually a detriment to many of you guys because you
get so glutted with free content you sort of take
it so for granted these amazing insights that usually other
companies and people would charge you thousands of dollars for
here you take a so for granted and actually it
it paradoxically becomes a disservice to you because it cheapens
this content usually you have to work your ass off
for this content so when it's just showered upon you
week after week after week for years it's very easy
to start to take it for granted one of the
things I discovered when I started doing life coaching is
that very ironically when you offer free life coaching to
people they don't take it they can't actually utilize it
in the way that someone who's paying for it can
it seems like how could that be you know you're
offering somebody hundreds of dollars were the free services you
know life coaching usually costs at least $100 an hour
I was charging $200 an hour at some point but
when you offer it to somebody for free they don't
appreciate it they treat it as though it's like oh
this is just some [ __ ] it's just some
friendly conversation that we're having they don't treat it seriously
but when they pay 200 ollars an hours for it
then they treat it much more seriously they show up
on time they're there committed they actually follow up and
do the homework that is assigned to them after every
call and so forth well it's the same thing here
I try to actually price my courses very affordably I
could charge a lot more for the courses I price
them affordably because I want them to be accessible to
most people but also I wanted to be a bit
of investment so when you invest in a course you're
like okay I'm actually committing to this I've put some
money in this I've got some skin in the game
I'm gonna take the content seriously and that's actually a
win-win for both of us in a sense plus there's
so much free content that if you want to be
free and you want to be cheap it's all there
for you so speaking of research I'll just give you
one example of what I mean by research you might
wonder well Lia what original research well for example recently
I've discovered a new psychedelic substance which is more powerful
than five Meo DMT this is a substance that nobody
knows about you've never heard of it no books have
been written about it no videos have been released about
it this substance is more powerful than five Meo DMT
per milligram it produces more profound trips than five Meo
DMP if you could believe that it's got less body
load it's better for this work that we're interested in
doing it's an absolutely amazing miraculous substance that I managed
to discover through doing a read original research that you
know I invest time and energy and money into doing
so I'm gonna hold back I'm not gonna reveal what
the substance is so don't don't beg me for it
just yet I will reveal it at some point in
the future but just know that stuff like that is
out there now you might leo how is this possible
are you talking about DPT or what no I'm not
talking about DPT I'm talking about something you don't know
about something totally new well how is that possible well
you should know by now if you've been following my
content that you don't know what the [ __ ]
is possible a lot is possible that you've never imagined
so we're always pushing the cutting edge here one of
the principles of actualize that already is that not everything
is known not everything spiritual is known the Buddha didn't
know everything Christ didn't know everything there's a lot more
spiritual technologies to be discovered and so that's part of
what we're doing here and of course that takes time
and money and in the future I plan to do
more research I plan to experiment with new techniques and
and methods maybe I'll do a dark room retreat and
I'll do a video about that maybe I'll experiment with
new forms of meditation or yoga or other kinds of
retreats so there's interesting possibilities there and your donations can
help fund that sort of cutting edge research which will
advance mankind into the future these really are some of
these techniques and some of these chemicals are life transforming
technologies it's really quite amazing and we're on the cutting
edge of that it's exciting to be doing this work
in the 21st century because there's still so much we
don't know about spirituality also your donation helps me to
share more freely sometimes because I am worried about monetization
and the survival the business I do have to hold
certain content back because I think like well this this
content I want to hold back for some paid product
or some for some course so with with a steady
stream of donations I have to worry less about that
I can share more fleet freely it would also incentivize
me to make better content for you because if I
am getting the majority of my my funding directly from
you guys not from advertisers or from other places then
I can focus just on making the best videos without
being worried about other factors and that's ultimately what I
would love to be doing so I don't even have
to worry about courses or whatever I can just focus
on making the best free content that I can there's
also the potential of using these donations to help spread
the word of actualized org so one possibility is that
I could start running ads on YouTube videos elsewhere not
on my videos I mean mean running actualised videos on
other channels and other places online to help to draw
more people in cuz as you see one of the
challenges with this work is that the deeper the work
goes the more radical and truthful it becomes the less
click baby it is the less it appeals to people
the less views it gets the longer the videos get
the less views see I could triple my views if
I cut my videos in half that's just how it
works but I don't want to do that but as
my content gets deeper one of the problems is that
fewer and fewer people get exposed to it see so
one way to combat this is using to then run
ads to attract people in think about how you discovered
this channel in the first place by accident right you
typed something into YouTube or just some search box somewhere
online or you just stumbled upon some recommended video you
clicked on it for whatever reason randomly and then you
discovered some amazing rabbit hole that you went down but
think about how many people in the world are never
going to be that lucky to stumble upon this content
ever 99% of people will never stumble upon this content
because it's rare and it's hard to stumble upon it
doesn't get many views it's not some flashy click Beatty
title type stuff it's not viral as you've probably seen
it's very hard to share this content with your friends
and get them to buy into it well a better
use of your time rather than trying to convince your
friends to watch actualize that work a better use might
be to donate 5 10 bucks a month through patreon
and then I could create a system where we have
these ads that target specific places where these people can
be found and can be introduced to this content so
for five or ten bucks a month you can help
spread this material to somebody whose life it will transform
who otherwise would never have seen it and that's a
that's a that's a pretty powerful use of money right
there another potential use of this money is to create
new kinds of videos one of the things I've been
toying around with in my mind is creating videos that
are more well polished and well produced that don't just
feature my face but that feature 3d visualizations or maybe
2d visualizations of various interesting topics about metaphysics and epistemology
but these kinds of videos are expensive to produce I
would have to work with an animator or with various
kinds of artists graphic artists would have to hire them
or pay them as contractors whatever and that can be
an exciting new possibility that could draw in more more
views and more audience these would be short videos they
wouldn't be hour long videos but um but they could
be but they can be very powerful as well so
that's something that I'm exploring but of course one of
the bottlenecks there is that these animators and so forth
can be expensive to hire and it can be risky
to hire such people without proper funding so that's an
interesting possibility in the future depending on how much funding
I have I could experiment with that another thing that
I could do and I probably will be doing anyways
even if I don't get donations from you guys I
will still be I have to upgrade camera equipment have
to upgrade probably to upgrade my my studio gonna upgrade
my background my set all this stuff pushing it to
make it better upgrade the lenses on my cameras and
so forth so of course I'm always investing in that
sort of infrastructure and getting more funding is very helpful
with that like for example the next camera I upgrade
is probably gonna be a six thousand dollar camera so
you see the money adds up upgrading microphones and editing
software and so forth another possibility for the use of
this money is I've been considering doing a tour touring
around the country holding various kinds of workshops that might
be something that comes in the future and of course
doing that is a little bit difficult because it's expensive
traveling to a new city flying they're renting hotels and
doing you know car rentals and all this even renting
meeting spaces and rooms all of this adds up to
at least a thousand dollars per city at least to
do that sort of stuff so doing a tours is
quite costly and it would be difficult to offset that
through through selling of the tour because the tour prices
would have to be very low in order to attract
more people so if I have more funding then it's
easier to get a tour or some workshops going I've
even in the very long term thought about the possibility
of building a retreat center of buying a large chunk
of land like 50 acres in Hawaii for example in
the middle of the rainforest and actually constructing a retreat
center there with bungalows that people could come and stay
at and live in and and we do live in-person
trainings that's you know a far-off possibility but of course
doing something like that requires enormous funding we're talking about
millions of dollars to get something like that done but
that's a that's a pretty cool possibility - there's also
the possibility depending on how much funding again through donations
in the end is to eliminate all YouTube ads on
my own videos that's something that I think might be
cool to do because ultimately I don't like having ads
on my videos that advertise all sorts of low consciousness
stuff - you get get-rich-quick schemes that are advertised and
fast-food and various stupid movies and whatever else it gets
advertised on my videos I don't even know it would
be nice to actually be able to eliminate that but
of course that would be losing a large chunk of
of income so that will all depend on how much
donations I can ultimately get and also lastly having a
stream of donations helps to stay safe guard actualize that
org against D monetization and D listing that is always
a possibility in fact the more truthful and more radical
my content gets the more likely I am to get
D listed in the future you know there's a possibility
that YouTube could ban my channel entirely and if in
the future for whatever reason because the content is radical
and once it gets popular enough you know people catch
wind of it who don't like it who are opposed
to it it's gonna be tricky so it's nice to
have a cushion of funding that would allow me to
to weather those kinds of storms and to even operate
outside of YouTube if necessary it's kind of like the
worst of the worst comes to pass so those are
some possibilities I'm not promising any of them necessarily it
all depends on where things are gonna go what you
guys are gonna be interested in what I'm gonna be
interested in it's gonna depend on how much funding I
have how much things cost and what's workable what's not
workable and also these are many of these are long-term
possibilities so when I'm talking about building some sort of
retreat center don't expect something like that to happen next
year this is like I'm talking 10 years down the
road or when I'm talking about doing some workshops again
this might be a few years down the road right
this stuff takes a lot of work and time to
do right and to make sure that it doesn't um
that it doesn't turn into devilry I'm always very careful
with with expanding actualize that order because I don't want
it to turn into a cult I'm very careful about
that I don't want it to turn into some sort
of Osho like you know situation where it gets out
of hand and and becomes a source of devilry and
gives a bad reputation to this kind of spiritual work
that we're doing so we have to be very careful
how we expand and how we get more people introduced
that's always a danger devilry is always a danger my
ultimate vision though for actualize that org is that I
want to create a free catalog of the most advanced
teachings on the planet that integrate science and mysticism my
ultimate goal with this work is not to personally help
you to be successful sure that could be a side
effect of this work and it's not even to personally
enlighten you that's also just a side effect of this
work the real purpose and vision behind my work is
that I want to change the epistemology of the human
race that's really what we're doing here we're shifting how
humanity thinks about itself how it thinks about knowledge how
thinks about science how it thinks about religion how thinks
about spirituality how the things about logic and reason and
language how it thinks about belief systems and points of
view how it thinks about politics how thinks about government
how it thinks about society and culture this is a
this is a enormous undertaking and one of the ways
that I'm gonna do this is by writing some books
so I'm working on some some deep books that are
that are designed to integrate science and mysticism of course
I'm doing that through the videos as well but these
books are gonna go deep and again it's a long-term
project that I have it'll probably take years to to
release any of this stuff so don't don't be thinking
of this is some sort of short-term project and like
Leo was your book coming out next year no it's
not coming out next year five years at the earliest
because our mission here is a lot bigger than just
publishing some silly flimsy little book I'm talking about a
book that will transform how all of mankind and how
scientists understand reality and how they do science that's what
I'm talking about and of course it would also be
nice to have funding to be able to promote that
book once it's written once all the the work has
been done to write it I've also spent the last
three years a lot of my time has went into
doing research for this book I have copious notes I
have probably thousands of pages of notes for the research
for this book the research is mostly all done it's
all in my head now it's just a matter of
combining it all together and putting it into a nice
presenter organize form but that's still very difficult to do
because the content is so massive and so deep and
so tricky that it's going to take thousands of pages
to properly explain it all so that's something that I'm
working on as well and by donating you can help
to contribute to to this ultimate vision that I have
in conclusion just keep in mind that actualized that org
is only getting started we're only seeing the the tip
of the iceberg of where this can go there's still
tons of content to create free content paid content courses
that I have planned various resource lists and stuff that
I plan to release a lot more research that I'm
gonna do and share with you guys and books and
so forth so there's there's a lot of potential here
if you would like to support me in this please
go down below click on the link or go to
patreon.com/scishow I'm very grateful if you do don't do it
because you should or because you have to or because
you feel guilty only do it if you want to
if you feel this is a good use of your
resources do it if not then don't and if you
don't don't feel guilty about it keep watching the free
videos that's that's totally fine by me and otherwise thank
you for your support and I could not do this
without you doing this work has been my dream come
true and the only reason I'm doing it is because
I have an audience otherwise it's pointless to do this
work and of course if you can support me directly
that makes our relationship as direct and as pure as
it can be so I don't have to be beholden
to various kinds of other interests and pressures from the
outside and to me that's really the ideal situation is
where I can be putting out my best creative work
for free but still being able to sustain myself and
to grow the business and to attract more people to
the work and in this way we get help to
awaken mankind you
