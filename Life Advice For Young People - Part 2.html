life advice for young people part two we're picking up
right where we left off in part one if you
haven't watched part 1 go do so that was very
foundational and I won't be repeating at least I won't
be trying to repeat the same material here again we're
building and adding more so right off the bat and
I should have really mentioned this in part one since
this is a conversation for young people is that your
youth is your most precious resource I remember reading a
book a long time ago by a famous multi-millionaire Felix
Dennis who's actually the founder of Maxim magazine and he
was not just Maxim magazine but he ran an entire
publishing Empire in the UK and he was giving advice
for how to become wealthy and his standards of wealth
were extremely high yeah his net worth is I think
750 million dollars before he died he died not too
long ago from cancer but he had this amazing chapter
which really made me think twice and I never will
forget it where he talks about just how precious of
a resource youth is and he put it like this
in a nutshell he said that if he could take
his entire empire publishing Empire worth 750 million dollars and
if he could trade that to become 20 years old
again and he was writing this probably in his 60s
so if he could trade all of everything he's developed
and earned to be 20 years old again but losing
all of it so he's sort of starting from scratch
he would he would take that deal that's how much
your youth is worth if you use it properly assuming
you use it properly that you don't squander it but
what's happening with most people these days is that there's
squandering their youth it's extremely easy to squander your youth
these days especially if you're growing up in a developed
part of the world where life is relatively easy your
parents are paying for stuff for you you don't really
need to work very hard you can just play video
games and mmo's and fortnight and all this sort of
stuff and you can just sort of like live this
numbed existence where you're just doing the bare minimum to
survive this is what it means to squander your youth
or to squander it by partying all the time with
your friends or to squander it in various kinds of
young immature relationships which go around in circles they're dysfunctional
they don't go anywhere and they of course they always
break up and so be very very careful about how
you're investing your time and this should really start once
you get to like 15 years old once you're already
15 you're at a point in your life where you
need to be developing and investing into your future that's
what most of your time should be spent doing whether
that's through school through work through independent projects that you're
doing whatever there's lots of different ways that you can
be investing in yourself we talked about some of that
in part one you're finding your passions and you're following
those but it's not just passion it's you have to
think more strategically about how you're going to be investing
your most precious resource which is your time and your
youth and the energy that you have while you're young
see because it's all gonna get much harder as you
get older because as you get older you can have
health problems you're gonna have lower energy your hormones are
gonna start to dip after your 30s your mental peak
is gonna start to decline after your 30s you're gonna
have all sorts of commitments and obligations as you get
older because you're probably gonna develop you know you're gonna
acquire a house that's gonna tie you down you're gonna
develop longer term relationships with friends and with intimate partners
and marriage and children perhaps all of that is gonna
tie you down you're gonna get tied down by your
career tie down by all these commitments you make so
right now between the ages of like 15 and 30
let's say that's a solid 15 years right there that's
where your entire life can be made or lost in
that period now I'm not saying that if you're past
30 and you haven't worked on your life then you're
hopeless so don't don't don't turn this into some victim
mindset or some limiting belief system you can still turn
your life around even in your 40s and 50s but
it's harder it's a lot harder right so you want
to start your life on the right foot do not
waste your life in stupid activities that don't pay you
anything back and I don't necessarily mean just money and
I say this even though I myself have have squandered
a lot of my youth playing video games so I
totally get it if you're stuck playing some video game
and you're singing hundreds and thousands of hours into these
online games and whatever else or you're watching a bunch
of TV or screwing around on YouTube and Facebook and
this is taking literally hundreds and thousands of hours of
your life hey I've done that stuff I've played MMOs
I've gotten sucked into these sorts of time sinks and
your life even in your youth your life is still
long enough that you can still screw around you don't
you don't need to live a perfect life so don't
become neurotic about this and become some sort of workaholic
where you're just working all the time you're not allowing
yourself to enjoy a video game here or there or
a movie or a TV show or to watch some
YouTube or whatever you can enjoy life so don't get
this idea that I'm I'm trying to program you with
this belief that you need to be working non-stop all
the time that itself is a is a trap and
a toxic mindset so by no means am I saying
that but also just be aware that almost everybody around
you your friends your co-workers your family members they are
squandering so much of their life and so much of
their time and they're setting a bad example for you
in most cases of course there's a few rare exceptions
here and there you can find good role models but
for the most part people are squandering their time and
it's easier than ever to squander your time because entertainment
these days is so ubiquitous it's free it's cheap there's
all these streaming services you can just sit there and
watch decades and decades of old shows and reruns of
stuff and there's a giant catalog of video games to
play and there's virtual reality that's coming and it's only
getting better and graphics are getting better and video games
are getting juicier and all of this and you've got
pornography and you've got so our society in a sense
is becoming too decadent if you're living in a developed
country it's too easy it's getting so easy that your
greatest enemy is just combating the complacency and laziness and
the taking of life for granted that is happening all
around you amongst your peers so you want to avoid
falling into that complacency you want to make a commitment
to make strategic long-term investments in yourself think of your
life as a the ultimate do-it-yourself project in fact that's
what makes me I think so passionate about life is
that I've always seen it as a do-it-yourself project I'm
working on myself there's all these aspects of myself that
I could improve it's actually really fun and cool when
you adopt that sort of frame of mind in a
sense really and you guys might with this you youngsters
who are stuck in in eats mmo's and online games
what's exciting about these MMOs and online games if you've
ever played one is that you're taking on a new
identity a new persona like you're playing as some elf
or you're playing as some mage or some wizard or
some fighter or whatever your you're doing and and it's
almost like you get to live a life within the
larger life that is your whole life you're living a
life within a life and there's something appealing about that
because you can sort of like you have this freedom
to to explore a new world and to build yourself
up in this virtual world you could build yourself a
house and you can acquire lots of money and you
can acquire loot and you can acquire friends and guilds
and do all the sorts of stuff and that becomes
very addictive if you've ever got addicted to something like
World of Warcraft or whatever the problem though is that
you sink all your time into that and then after
a few years you're gonna drop that the game is
gonna go out of fashion you're gonna get bored of
it and then what are you gonna be left with
nothing very little of what you've built there will survive
and eventually that game will just be turned off the
servers will be shut down and then yours gonna move
on to the next game and the next game in
the next game you just keep doing that doing that
doing that and you're not really making a deep long-term
investment in anything you see you're losing every everything that
you're gaining there but what you can do is you
can realize that actually you can play the game of
life exactly the same way that you would play World
of Warcraft or some other MMO and in fact this
is the ultimate MMO right here but the trick with
the MMO of life is that like I said before
it's a sandbox game it's very open it's so free
there's so much freedom that in a sense you get
lost in the freedom of it you see there are
so many things to do so many ways you can
be that there's nobody holding your hand and guiding you
the way that they do in world of warcraft see
world of warcraft you just start doing quests and the
quests are designed by the designers in such a smart
way that is like you just do one quest at
least the next quest at least the next quest your
level ups are all guaranteed basically you know exactly what
you got to do you got to go kill a
hundred rats kill a thousand orcs whatever get the loot
that you know you're gonna get by killing those orcs
and those rats and going to that dungeon and so
it's all planned out it's all mapped out for you
just you get on the rail and it's just like
this amusement park ride but with life it's not like
that with life it's a much more what do you
want out of it you have to be the the
designer so to speak of your own game of your
own life you've to set your own objectives you have
to have enough vision to see the possibilities cuz there's
so much freedom you have the freedom to just sit
at home and to watch Netflix all day or to
play video games or you have the freedom to build
an amazing business and send people to Mars or to
the moon or you you can you can develop yourself
into it into a ridiculously POW overpowered character you see
but most people what they do is like they don't
treat their life that way they're they treat life as
though it's this sort of like well everyone's life is
sort of the same we wake up we shower we
go to work for eight hours we come back home
we eat we clean we cook and then we we
go and we you know get a few hours of
entertainment then we do it all over again the next
day they're not treating their life as an adventure they're
not treating their life as this work of art to
see what can you create with your life and that's
of course because life is more challenging than a game
the stakes are higher there's real pain and suffering that
you don't quite get any game and you have to
work harder at it to achieve your goals whereas in
a game you can just screw around and then it's
easy to get money in a game easy to get
loot in a game and so forth this is harder
to do in real life but then again even though
it's harder it takes more investment it takes more commitment
it takes more vision also the payoff is greater as
well you have to realize that take risks and don't
be afraid to fail in life fail more fail faster
the real danger is not that you're gonna take some
crazy risk the real danger is that you're gonna be
complacent and do nothing and that you're just going to
get the same result that everybody around you is getting
which is a mediocre result what you should be scared
to death of is not taking some bold action like
starting a business and then maybe failing at it or
getting into this relationship and maybe failing at it or
traveling to this new country and living there and maybe
failing at it and having to return back home these
are not the real risks all of that is great
stuff that will grow you even if you fail at
it and those failures will be investments that you're actually
making into building the foundation for the rest of your
life so don't worry about those sorts of failures the
greatest failure you should be scared to death of is
just sitting around and squandering your time and achieving nothing
and investing nothing and then by the time you're 50
or 60 you have nothing to show for it but
a dead-end job and just this listless passionless life that's
what you should be afraid of what you should be
most afraid of is getting distracted by all the frivolous
unimportant stuff that's happening around you that most people are
engaged in not having a vision that you're working on
the next point I have for you is to commit
to challenging yourself with your life stop looking for life
to be easy stop trying to find the path of
least resistance in life stop looking for some shortcut for
how to get rich or how to quickly build a
business so that it just earns you money or how
to just get some quick sex or how to just
get any kind of job so you just have a
job stop with this bare minimum approach to life counter-intuitively
as I said in part one life is very counterintuitive
counter-intuitively the easier you try to make your life the
harder it's gonna be but if you deliberately challenge yourself
and you are the one who sets the challenges you
don't wait for life to come challenging you so there's
like you're like sitting at home watching TV and then
you're waiting for the end of the month to roll
around and then you're waiting for your landlord to come
knock on your door asking you for your payment for
your rent rather than waiting for life to come to
you and demand things from you flip the script on
that whole thing and you be the one that sets
the challenges this is so crucial by challenging yourself you
get to live life on your terms and then that
strengthens you up such that then the demands of life
they don't overwhelm you and you can easily deal with
them and then also you're much more passionate about your
own challenges because you get to choose them and you
get to choose the the challenges you're passionate about rather
than the challenges that are enforced upon you from the
outside things that other people want you to do or
that society demands of you because you might not be
passionate about those things you might not find those things
to be meaningful be wary of shortcuts and magic pills
usually they don't pan out and they end up wasting
your time you go from one shortcut to the next
shortcut to the next shortcut hoping that it's gonna make
your life easy but actually what you end up with
in the end is you end up with nothing because
you haven't actually built anything stable focus on building stable
things in your life there's a stable way to build
a business that's grounded a deep foundation or there's a
flimsy way to build a business if you build a
business in a flimsy way sure it might make you
some decent money for a few years but it's gonna
crumble and in the end you're not gonna have anything
left that's gonna pay you dividends whereas if you focus
on building a solid foundation for your business is gonna
take longer might take you five years might take you
ten years to do that but once you do it
that foundation will be so solid it'll pay you dividends
for a long time to come and not just that
but the skills you learn and who you have to
become to build a solid foundation for a business for
example that's that's the real gold of life and it's
not just business I'm also talking about relationships for example
I'm also talking about your health and your fitness there's
ways you can do fitness and health and nutrition that's
flimsy or that solid always go for the solid thing
what you'll find around you in society is that people
are always looking for shortcuts they're always looking for handouts
they're looking for the fastest flimsiest way just to make
two ends meet they're not thinking long-term they're not thinking
about the dividends that this will pay they're not connecting
the dots and seeing that if they build a deep
foundation then they're gonna be able to build a higher
skyscraper long term take the time to do things right
even though it's going to take more work and there's
gonna be less immediate payoff and there's always going to
be temptations to take shortcuts in your business in your
relationships in the development of yourself even in your spiritual
pursuits you will try to look for shortcuts and eventually
you'll discover that life is not about finding shortcuts look
for the substance don't let people fool you with flimsy
solutions to to life's deepest challenges you're gonna get from
life exactly the effort that you put into it in
this way life is fair develop a strong work ethic
this is crucial and I think that a lot of
people these days millennial types are missing this I think
in past generations our parents and ancestors and grandparents life
simply demanded of them that they develop a strong work
ethic from their youth whereas now a society is becoming
more decadent there's this glut of entertainment and games and
movies and so forth ways to stimulate yourself that kids
grow up and they get into their early 20s and
they have no work ethic because they just coasted through
life their parents paid for their games paid for their
movies paid for everything they didn't have to work until
they got into their mid-20s or something and by that
point you're like you're like a lion who wasn't taught
how to hunt because you've just been fed food from
the grocery store your entire upbringing you need that strong
worth that work ethic because how else are you gonna
actually fulfill on your vision and on all of your
potential in your life that takes work also my advice
to you is that you set a set a high
standard for yourself what you tend to get in life
is whatever your lowest standard is so whatever your lowest
standard is for the house that you want to live
in that's probably the house you'll end up living in
whatever your lowest standard is for the relationship you're willing
to tolerate that's probably the relationship you'll end up with
whatever your lowest standard is for the kind of career
or job that you have that's probably the kind of
career job that you're gonna have whatever your lowest standard
is for how much money should be in your bank
account like for example if you're satisfied with having $10,000
in your bank account that's probably how much you're gonna
have and this goes all across every domain of life
your physical appearance your weight what kind of food you
put in your body if your standard for the kind
of food you eat is that you're satisfied with the
cheap $2.00 McDonald's hamburger that's probably what you're gonna end
up feeding yourself but if your standards that you want
to eat high quality foods then you're not gonna settle
for anything less than going to Whole Foods and getting
the the most wholesome kind of ingredients and then if
you say well Billy I can't afford it but see
if your standard was higher then you wouldn't settle for
the excuse at all well I can't afford to shop
at Whole Foods every day you would go and you
would find a way to got enough money so that
you can afford it because it all hinges on what
your standards are most people have such low standards for
all these different areas in their life they're willing to
settle for mediocrity now of course you can take this
overboard you can become perfectionistic and you can just be
chasing luxury and and perfection all the time whether it's
with your sexual partners or with your money or with
your career that also becomes neurotic so I'm not saying
you should do that but you do want to have
high standards have high standards for the people that you
relate with have high standards for your friends don't just
let anybody be your friend have some standards don't just
sleep with anybody have some standards have some standards for
the kind of teachers you learn from have standards with
the kind of books you read have standards for the
kind of environment that you live in see it's having
these standards that then pushes you to go and then
to actually achieve them it's also important that you aim
beyond basic survival in life if your life is just
gonna be about survival and getting by and it's just
gonna be about utility and pragmatism there's no way you're
ever going to be satisfied with life the greatest joys
of life are not basic survival and they are not
pragmatic and utilitarian you can become very successful and wealthy
by being highly pragmatic and utilitarian but it won't be
satisfying there's a deeper dimension to life than survival that
doesn't mean you have to ignore survival survival is still
crucial it's just that survival is is the bare minimum
and then we're going beyond that and really when we're
talking about going beyond survival that's putting us into spirituality
another advice I have for you is to commit to
never doing mindless work there are many jobs you can
get where you are just pumping out widgets that have
no larger meaning in the world they don't add anything
to the advancement of mankind you're licking stamps or you're
selling coffee at Starbucks or you're flipping burgers now don't
get me wrong in the ultimate grand scheme of things
everything even flipping burgers and filling coffee cups at Starbucks
and pumping out widgets even that ultimately is advancing society
you might say well Leo how can society exist and
be advanced if there aren't people cleaning toilets and mopping
floors and doing this grunt work and like I said
in the grand scheme of things of course but that's
not where you want to be where you want to
be is you want you want to put yourself into
a position where your work is actually advancing mankind in
a conscious way beyond something like mopping floors or filling
coffee cups right there's more you can do with your
life than filling [ __ ] coffee cups for eight
hours a day if that's the most intelligent use of
your life that you can think of then I don't
know it breaks my heart makes me feel sorry for
you that that that out of all the things you
could do in life all the things you could invent
and create all the people you could lead all the
relationships you could craft all the technology that's possible all
the advancement all of this amazing stuff all the books
you could ride all the movies you could make and
all the different adventures you can go on you are
going to settle for filling cups with coffee for eight
hours a day you can't think of anything better to
do you're wasting your life it's like God gave you
this incredible gift and you're just pissing all over it
that's what you're doing when you're settling for something like
that there are many jobs where you can get well-paid
for just sitting around and doing almost nothing secretarial type
work or where your boss is telling you to do
something then you do it and then he doesn't even
use your work it was just some project that you
know was gonna go somewhere but it ends up going
nowhere it doesn't actually add to the development of mankind
in some way if you've ever done this kind of
work you know how soul-crushing it can be so make
a commitment never to get crap in that make sure
that your work is contributing to the Ansett of mankind
that's how you end up making sure that what you're
doing has meaning that you can be passionate about it
and that you could you can feel like you're not
just going to work but that you're actually contributing to
society in some important way and if you're at a
job like that to begin with that's okay I'm not
saying that you have to be so arrogant and lack
the humility to ever do some grunt work know when
when grunt work is called for you do some grunt
work but that grunt work should be a stepping stone
towards something larger so if you got a mop floors
for a year in order to save up enough money
so that then you can maybe put yourself through art
school and then become a great artist then that's totally
fine because you were mopping those floors to ultimately become
a great artist so it was all just it was
just an extension of that you see and so in
this way the mopping of the floors was simply just
a part of you doing your art but if you're
just mopping floors and that's it and there's nothing beyond
that then that's the problem right there another tip I
have for you is don't over plan your future you
need to be adaptable improvisational and opportunistic give your life
room to breathe and to unfold if you just sit
back and you make a plan for how your whole
life should unfold like you say well I'm gonna go
to college I'm gonna become a lawyer then I'm after
grad school I'm gonna become you know an entry-level lawyer
then I'm an equal partner in a firm that I'm
gonna earn a lot of money then I'm gonna have
a wife and a family and children and this then
I'm gonna retire and I move gonna move there this
is way too much over planning you want to look
for opportunity so you don't want to have no plan
at all you want to have a vision for your
life and you want to be clear about what you're
passionate about but also let your passion guide you and
leave room for exploration so if you're passionate for example
about law okay fine you're passionate about law but you
don't know which kind of law maybe you would fit
best in so you go and you navigate the field
of law and you try different positions there and you
try to find stuff that that resonates with you and
then like you don't try to plan your life out
too much so that as you're exploring life you see
opportunities you can on those opportunities that you're free to
do so don't have some rigid idea like my life
has to unfold in this particular way because I guarantee
you that the greatest opportunities that will come in your
life you're not going to be able to predict them
or to see them years in advance it's going to
be something that is an opportunity that arises in the
moment it's a particular time in human history that you're
living in that something arises you're at a particular company
with or with a particular person some opportunity presents itself
and there you have to have the courage and the
vision to seize on those and what that ends up
meaning is that your life is not going to be
a simple trajectory of like point A to point Z
a straight line that you can predict from your 20s
to your 60s rather ideally your life is going to
be this very twisted winding process where you can go
a to B to C to this and then finally
you get to Z by the time you're in your
60s or 80s or something but you're jumping all over
the place and it's it's very widening and the difference
is gonna be that if you just plot out sort
of a linear path in your life then where you're
gonna get to is not going to be as great
as if you go through all those winding steps and
it's gonna lead you to a totally different place see
maybe you have this idea that ah I'm gonna become
a lawyer but then as you're pursuing law you bump
into a person in your dorm room or something who
presents you with some brilliant business idea and to you
you can sense like oh yeah that's a great idea
it's a very sort of limited by time idea that's
only gonna work right now if I seize on it
but no I'm just gonna continue being a lawyer because
that's the vision I had for myself so that you
just continue being a lawyer but Hugh sees on that
opportunity and you went into business with this person maybe
you would have to say no to being a lawyer
but you would you would jump on that opportunity maybe
that would fail but that's new opportunities ends up you'd
go on jump on that and through this process you
would end up in the end you would end up
some something totally different not a lawyer but that's gonna
suit you much better and you're gonna grow much more
from that process because you're willing to dance with life
so to speak you have to be willing to improvise
on the fly because stuff is gonna be happening there's
gonna be crises society's gonna be changing there's gonna be
new technologies evolving there's gonna be new types of people
you're bumping into you yourself are gonna be growing and
outgrowing your old desires if you're doing this whole process
correctly so you got a you have to be willing
to improvise there if to take those opportunities and taking
those opportunities can be very scary it's much easier to
just follow some plan that you came up with this
very simplistic linear plan whereas these opportunities they come with
risk and with danger potential for failure of course you
don't want to take unnecessary risk but if the risk
is reasonable take it because just the fact that you're
putting yourself into a difficult situation is gonna grow you
so much more than just doing the same old thing
over and over again another tip I have for you
is be careful not to get stuck in a rut
I recommend that when you're in your early 20s and
even through your 30s that you don't tie yourself down
too much with a bunch of commitments don't tie yourself
down to a house don't tie yourself down to a
marriage with children you want the freedom to explore yourself
more you can you can tie yourself down more once
you get into your 40s and 50s but in your
20s and 30s you want room for exploration you want
to be able to travel to different places you want
to be able to live in different cities so you
don't get stuck in some complacent rut in fact I
recommend that you change the city that you live in
every five years at least because I find that after
about five years of living in one city one place
one country you just you become so complacent you start
taking it all for granted and you get into a
rut you have all the same friends there's no challenges
anymore you know everything too much too well and you're
not growing keep putting yourself in new situations start a
new business start a new relationship go a little bit
a different country go try out different stuff this is
important this is grist for the mill of your growth
if you're only feeding your mind one grist all the
time then it can only process that one grist you
want different kinds of grist for your mind you will
be very tempted in your life to imitate others don't
and this is one of the hardest things to do
is to notice when you're imitating somebody else too much
and to stop yourself and to force yourself to be
authentically you the greatest joy in life comes from being
authentically yourself from discovering yourself it's a self-discovery process when
you start when you're young when you're 20 years old
or something like that you might be going into art
you might be going into business whatever you're doing there
there's gonna be a temptation to just copy others because
what they're doing you think is so great and it
inspires you so much that's maybe why you even went
in to that field in the first place and you
are not connected with your authentic self yet you haven't
discovered yourself you haven't really built yourself up you don't
have that kind of confidence and what you your self
are generating isn't so good so instead you have a
desire to copy others copy the success of others jump
on top of other fads and trends in society be
very careful about this make the long-term investment not to
imitate others or to chase the success of others but
really to develop your own internal success by discovering your
authentic passions and motivations and values this is a process
that takes a years find your own voice find your
own style whether you're gonna start a YouTube channel find
your own way of doing a YouTube channel stop cupping
up copying others or for that matter don't even start
a YouTube channel because every every fool and his mom
nowadays is starting a YouTube channel why are they starting
a YouTube channel simply because they're imitating others they don't
know what else to do they're not thinking outside the
box they're not truly being creative they're not being authentically
themselves they just see that oh well Leo's doing YouTube
channel so I should do one or like Joe Rogan's
doing one so I should do a podcast it's like
I'm not saying you shouldn't start a YouTube channel or
a podcast if you really have that vision but but
man like look for greener pastures look for new opportunities
out there they're out there you just have to start
to really be creative the first few ideas that you
get for what your business should be or what you
should do with your life throw those away those are
like junk that's the most on the nose imitative just
copycat idea that you could possibly have throw all those
away throw away your first 10 good ideas and then
maybe your 11th good idea could really be something authentic
to you something new something original that contributes something fresh
to mankind we don't eat everybody the world to have
a YouTube channel what we need is we need new
people to find the next thing that comes after YouTube
channels and after podcasts what is that thing go do
that see what you're gonna be paid for and rewarded
for is not copycat activity but developing something new that's
hard to do but it's also very rewarding stress innovation
and creativity in your life try to be innovative and
creative and whatever field you're entering into and doing don't
just assume that it's all been done already find new
ways of doing things whether it's spirituality like it amazes
me how sometimes I try to present something new within
spirituality and people post me a comment like olio how
dare you think that you could discover something new it's
all been talked about by the Buddha for our thousand
years you can't possibly discover anything new no there's there's
totally new ways to do spirituality that were not discovered
by the Buddha which is the whole point of spirituality
spirituality would be so stale and boring if it just
had to be done the same old way for thousands
of years the point of spirituality if you look at
the evolution of spirituality as just one example I mean
you see this in every field not just spirituality is
that it's constantly evolving spirituality has never been the same
that's why we have this gigantic diversification of different spiritual
methods and techniques and teachings that all contradict each other
it's because every generation spirituality is being reinvented I mean
of course the fundamental truths are basically the same but
new things are happening in every field whether it's medicine
computers science policy it's not staying the same it's all
evolving changing be on the cutting edge that's where it's
exciting that's where you can contribute the most to mankind
and then reap those benefits and speaking of innovation of
thinking about side the box and being creative in it's
important that you learn to go beyond the mainstream most
popular sources yeah every idiot and his mother listens to
Joe Rogan that's not a knock on Joe Rogan he
has a interesting podcast and all that and he's very
successful but see if all you do is you get
your information from sources that are the most mainstream the
most popular then your mind is gonna get stuck on
that and think along those grooves and those lines and
you're not gonna generate very interesting new possibilities in your
life go out there and find sources that are not
popular go find some YouTube or who doesn't have a
million followers or even a hundred thousand followers who has
a couple thousand followers but who's generating amazing content and
follow that rather than following somebody with 10 million subscribers
see this is how you become creative you pull from
many many different sources and perspectives and you don't just
do what everybody else in the mainstream is doing now
of course you can you can screw this up and
you can go down the road of conspiracy theories and
various weird cults and crazy you know occult practices and
all of this that just because something isn't mainstream doesn't
mean that it's automatically good or true or wise for
you to be doing sometimes mainstream stuff is great you
got to make sure that the non mainstream stuff you're
finding is still high-quality stuff and that it's still truthful
because there's a lot of Fringe wacky crazy stuff out
there you know Alex Jones and so forth that doesn't
make it good although even with something like Alex Jones
I mean people who watch Alex Jones the only reason
they really watch him is again because in a sort
of set in a certain sense Alex Jones is the
mainstream of what you would go to if you're challenging
the mainstream you see so again you're not really thinking
outside the box when you're watching Alex Jones it's Alex
Jones is like for stupid people who want to think
that they're thinking outside the box and that they're being
original by engaging all these conspiracy theories that you know
they think that they're being somehow oh we're challenging the
mainstream but actually no you're just being stupid in some
other mainstream way it's sort of in the same sense
that like you know in in school you had those
kids who were trying to be rebels and trying to
like do the opposite of what the mainstream was they
were trying to be non conformist but they were all
being nonconformist in a conformist sort of way and so
ironically they they had no they had no real originality
because like if they got tattoos they all got tattoos
of a certain kind if they all dress like Goths
and they all just dressed just dressed like Goths and
that was their thing and then no you weren't really
being original by doing that to be truly original to
go off on your own to explore some new facet
of life that no human has ever discovered before that's
what's amazing about life and there's an endless amount of
that because reality is infinite there's no end to it
so you can always discover more new stuff that's what's
so amazing about it don't squander that infinity and that
creativity by just rehashing the same old thing over and
over again you see the power of infinity when you
really understand it people sometimes think we will but you
for reality's infinity Leo does that mean that it just
keeps cycling over and over and over again the same
things have been happening forever in a cycle an infinite
number of times actually infinity is the opposite of that
infinity means that everything is so endless that it can
keep going and going and going forever new stuff can
be generated forever without ever repeating a single time in
the same way that you have the natural numbers you
know one two three four five six seven eight is
there any risk that the numbers will repeat if we
keep counting up no you can always find a new
number that that never repeats an old one that's the
nature of infinity there's always a higher number there's always
a new number it's endless same thing with reality in
every domain there's always a new kind of movie you
could make there's always a new video game a new
piece of art a new piece of literature a new
business a new piece of technology a new way to
do science a new way to do spirituality forever and
not just that but then new categories of things imagine
a new category beyond technology beyond spirituality a new thing
beyond science a new thing beyond movies and beyond video
games and beyond virtual reality a new thing beyond computers
a new thing beyond medicine a new thing beyond whatever
you can already imagine something that you can't yet imagine
there's some new thing there that you haven't yet imagined
or discovered so go discover it and then you'll be
excited by life creativity is the source of passion innocence
another tip I have for you is don't get distracted
by petty human [ __ ] there's a lot of
pettiness human stuff I put human sort of in quotes
human stuff and business and human affairs that most of
the people around you are involved in gossip and politics
and who did what to whom and who's a victim
and who's the victimized and who's the victimizer and who
started a war who's fighting who and who's judging who
and who's being mean to who and who did what
to who who killed who and like that's all horseshit
there's no satisfaction in playing these games who slept with
who who's the most famous person today who's more famous
tomorrow who has more money today who has more money
tomorrow this is this is the the pettiness of human
affairs ground yourself and something beyond that something metaphysical spiritual
existential try to imagine for example what your life would
be like if you were the only human alive on
the planet and there were no other humans you see
how that cuts out so much [ __ ] all
the gossip and all the trying to be like everybody
else and trying to be social and doing all the
social [ __ ] games that people do going to
dinner parties and try to please each other and try
to dress up a certain way and trying to earn
awards and trying to please their boss and like all
of that gets cut away what's life about like in
that case when you cut all of that petty human
[ __ ] away it's so easy to get distracted
by that society and culture will constantly keep distracting you
by this human petty [ __ ] trying to convince
you that it's important is not important at all you
need to block that stuff out don't get distracted by
it keep your eye on the ball focus on your
vision focus on what you want to create with your
life focus on growing yourself to be a stronger human
being so when people are in the streets rioting you're
at home working on your vision when people are bullshitting
about politics you're at home working on developing yourself you're
sitting there reading a book you're sitting there contemplating and
introspecting when people are going to some dinner party trying
to impress each other and trying to you know brown-nose
to whoever's running the dinner party to get their favors
and stuff like that and building political connections you're sitting
at home and you are working on your life purpose
you're building your business you're investing in yourself you're meditating
you're contemplating and doing this sort of stuff don't pay
too much attention to what the herd around you is
doing they're not doing anything profound they're engaged in surface
level activity that's going to pay them very little dividends
and it's gonna produce very little satisfaction for them all
this petty human business don't overload your schedule with a
bunch of commitments and obligations especially when you're young don't
tie yourself up too much leave room for the inner
work that you gotta be doing leave room for solitude
leave empty time in your schedule where you can sit
and meditate contemplate self-reflect read a book plan out your
life vision dream imagine stuff work on some side project
be creative because if you're running around all the time
just doing petty chores and socializing and just doing non-stop
work like business and trying to socialize with your friends
and to please them and your schedule simply doesn't have
enough time for you to really go inward to listen
to yourself to find the deep answers that's another point
that we need to underscore here is that the deepest
answers to life are not found in books or from
other people they're found inside yourself in moments of solitude
and deep self-reflection make time for solitude make time where
you can just sit for an entire day with no
obligations no chores no socializing no work no entertainment no
distractions no internet no social media no phone calls it
just sit in solitude and think about life listen to
your heart listen to your highest self listen to your
creative inspirations and passions discover yourself in these moments and
really a single day is not even enough you need
to do retreats you need to be able to carve
out an entire week in your schedule at least once
a year carve out seven or ten days where you
can be in total solitude by yourself secluded in meditation
in contemplation in visioning in thinking about your life self
reflecting doing the inner work that's where the real work
happens not out there in the world when you're in
the office and the cubicle you know punching away the
keyboard that's not where the real work happens but most
people are so busy that they don't make this time
for solitude and their life reflects that their life isn't
deep they're living life at the surface don't waste your
time hating fighting judging criticizing blaming others negativity or trying
to control others this is a huge trap the trap
of trying to control other people say no to this
have no desire to control anybody else but yourself have
no desire to be telling others from some righteous position
how they are wrong and what they're doing is bad
and evil and it could be done better and then
blaming them for things no that's all [ __ ]
and distraction rather focus on what you need to do
to be creative in your life then you're never going
to be negative because you're gonna feel empowered you feel
like a victim and you feel disempowered when you're not
being creative but when all of your time is and
energy is focused on inner work making yourself more creative
more passionate growing yourself investing in yourself you know becoming
more spiritual when when you're doing this you have no
time and room for negativity blaming criticizing judging fighting hating
it's all pointless it's a distraction and you have no
desire to control or manipulate anybody else because then you
become self-reliant you don't need to control somebody else or
manipulate them to get you something that you can get
yourself by turning inwards and anything important that's of any
real value in life you can generate for yourself you
don't need to control or manipulate somebody else to give
it to you so why play those games go directly
to the source generate it yourself create it yourself people
invent all sorts of ideologies and political philosophies that are
just based on negativity and blame and criticism people start
entire YouTube channels and entire careers based on criticizing and
hating on others they create entire identities out of fighting
against conservatives or liberals or this or that while they're
doing all that they're neglecting the most important thing they're
taking their eye off the ball what are you gonna
create for the world that's positive how are you gonna
grow yourself when you're busy growing yourself you don't have
time for these distractions you don't care what others are
doing around you because they can't stop you you're too
powerful you're too creative you don't need their approval you
don't care about their criticism because you're going full steam
ahead another important point I want to underscore and spend
some time on is this notion that people in society
will try to trick you and in fact this is
one of the first things I would say if a
human just landed on Earth or let's say some alien
from another planet was like plopped down on earth it
had to understand how society works and had to understand
how to navigate people one of the first things I
would tell them is be careful because people in society
will try to trick you and scam you and deceive
you this is just par for the course of the
level of development of our current society there are scams
and tricks and deceptions all around do not take people's
words at face value and they're tricking you and scamming
you not so much because they're evil and that you
should resent them for it it's simply because they themselves
are ignorant and they're looking for shortcuts and this is
just a survival strategy trickery and scam artists tree is
prevalent throughout all of society every business is trying to
is trying to do it to you on some level
entire institutions are built around this so be wary because
when you yourself are not in touch with your own
deep creative resources and power you still got to survive
somehow in the world so how you gonna do it
through trickery and deception and scamming you're gonna build a
business that doesn't actually generate something new and valuable for
mankind rather it tries to scam you in some way
there are just so many examples of this sort of
trickery all the false advertising that we see everywhere even
just on the packages when you go to the grocery
store the package is on the grocery store selfi shelf
are trying to scam you and trick you they're advertising
oh this is fat-free but really yeah it's us it's
fat-free but when you look down and deep inside you
look at the ingredients there's all sorts of terrible ingredients
in there which are even worse than fat but of
course you're trying to trick you by putting a big
fat free label on the thing cuz deep down inside
they know this this product is not healthy for you
and it contains all sort of toxic chemicals and ingredients
but they'll still put a giant fat-free as well like
all fat-free it's healthy or you go to the grocery
store you want to buy some some some steak for
example and you asked the guy what is that is
that like pasture-raised is that is that grass-fed steak that
I want that I want the healthy kind and you'll
say yeah sure it's grass-fed you say really that's grass-fed
and he says well yeah it's I mean it's it's
grass-fed but then it's grain finished see that's how the
meat companies try to trick you is that they will
they will take the cow sure maybe it's raised on
a pasture technically but what really matters is at the
very end of the cow's existence they what do they
feed the cow usually what they do to get it
weight up is that they feed the cow a bunch
of grain to fatten it up to like double its
size and then sell it to you it at double
the profit see and then they label that pasture raised
yeah technically it's pasture raised but then it's grain finished
so you got to be like very very specific about
these things and we're just talking about food here but
I mean this is just but one example of you
see this all around society trickery and deception everywhere people
are talking to you telling you things when actually the
thing they're describing is exactly the opposite of what they're
trying to convince you it is people will try to
trick you and deceive you in relationships in friendships in
business when you go to the grocery store when you
go to the restaurant oh when you are reading books
when you're watching the media because most people are engaged
in lying to themselves most people don't value truth very
much they don't they don't hold their own feet to
the fire of truth so of course that means that
they're gonna be tricking deceiving and scamming in some way
don't automatically assume that what somebody is telling you is
true someone tells you they're enlightened don't believe them somebody
tells you all this is a good deal don't believe
them somebody tells you all you're gonna earn a lot
of money this way the way that I did don't
believe them now again it's possible to take this too
far in the opposite direction where you become paranoid and
you become skeptical and fearful and you're not able to
to relate to anybody because you're not able to trust
anybody because oh Leo told me that I can't trust
anybody no that's not really what I'm telling I'm just
telling you don't turn it into a paranoia or a
neurosis but just be aware of how much people lie
to themselves and try to lie to you and how
they try to trick you and of course at the
same time be aware of how you try to trick
others Society is this giant game of trickery and manipulation
ultimately you want to rise above that and the way
you do that is by trying to by starting to
notice it see there's a lot of different scams and
schemes and traps that have been designed as businesses to
separate you from your money without concern for your well-being
most businesses do not care about your well-being or the
well-being of their customers they're interested in the fastest way
to make some money and usually that involves some kind
of trick like for example I went to sign up
for a gym membership not long ago cuz my old
one expired so I was gonna buy a new one
and before I was buying it like two years at
a time for a membership and then and here I
decided to go a month-by-month cuz I thought maybe that's
a better deal for me because I haven't been using
the gym so much lately so I sign up for
it but it's so tricky the way that they design
their pricing models this is exactly what I mean by
this sort of trickery and scam artists tree is what
they do is they they charge you for the first
month of your membership and also for the last month
at the same time such that what happens is that
when you want to quit the gym like let's say
I use the I have a membership I use it
for a year and then I decide that like I'm
moving to a different city so now I have to
cancel that membership I'll have to find a new one
at a new city okay so in that case the
way they structure the payment is that if I cancel
now they're still gonna be a whole month that I've
already prepaid at the very beginning that I'm not gonna
use and they know I'm not gonna use it they
designed their whole system such that they basically steal a
month of gym memberships from me and they do this
to everybody this is just part of their business model
and the people who are working in that gym like
the employees who are selling this to you they don't
even bat an eye about it to them this is
totally normal they don't even see that there's a problem
with this and yet this is how they earn their
money through trickery in this sort of scamming you will
find this all across society like literally everywhere almost every
business resorts to some kind of trickery of this sort
it's it's quite disgusting but at the same time you
need to understand why it's there it's not because these
people are evil they're just ignorant and they haven't been
following all the principles that I've been talking about here
so they have to resort to these trickery methods because
otherwise they couldn't survive this is how many people feed
their children is through trickery it's really no different than
like in the animal kingdom when you have a rattlesnake
sitting in the grass all camouflaged and then some rat
scurries through the grass and doesn't see the rattlesnake because
it's so well camouflaged and it gets tricked and it
gets killed and eaten well that's exactly what's happening but
in much more devious and subtle ways within business within
relationships and within culture and human society so just watch
out for that it's sort of like if you were
a rat and I was giving you advice to a
rat one of the first things I would tell you
is like be careful as you're running around in the
grass over there because it's full of tricks there's all
sorts of beasts that will trick you that are all
well camouflaged and they will resort to sorts of sorts
of tricks to to eat you that's very valuable to
know and that's exactly what I'm telling you here is
a human mankind has not evolved beyond trickery yet that's
a higher stage of development we have yet to get
to all right what's next this one's important this next
point stop trying to get love from others or from
things like I said in part one ultimately there's only
two forces that are running your life fear and love
and all like I said in part one if you've
experienced trauma in your life especially the earlier the more
this is a problem then you've been denied love that's
what trauma basically is and you're gonna be desperate for
love and that's basically what you're doing in life is
you're like a rat running around in a field you're
not looking for seeds you're looking for love that's what's
really going on and so love is very counterintuitive because
you think that you're gonna get love by getting others
to fill your cup and so you're gonna be running
around with your empty cup sticky in people's faces asking
them to fill your cup for you begging them being
needy try to manipulate and control others to give you
the love that you seek this is the opposite of
how love really works this is not going to produce
satisfaction or good result in your life if you want
good results in your life develop yourself to be a
non needy person such that you are the one whose
cup is already filled and you are the one who
is filling others people's empty cups that's what life is
really about that's what love is really about and how
do you fill your own cup especially if you already
are needy and traumatized and wounded and so forth you
do it by developing yourself through spiritual practice and through
creative work and passion that's what life is all about
that's what really when I talk about investing in yourself
and building yourself up and life is this do-it-yourself project
what we're really talking about is that you're filling your
own cup with love every single day you keep doing
that for years and for decades until your cup runneth
over and then you become a fountain of this love
and you are able to give more and more and
more of it until ultimately you become literally an infinite
ever flowing fountain of and you are not limited in
how much love you can give and you're always raising
your own ceiling as to how much love you can
carry in yourself and you become a superconductor for love
you become an instrument a vehicle for love and then
your life becomes about pouring it forth in various ways
on to others that's the kind of loved life you
want to live just think about it ask yourself put
it in any struck terms do I want to be
someone who's sitting there on the side of the road
begging others to fill my cup with love or do
I want to be the one who's already overflowing with
love I have so much love that if someone comes
to me begging for love I can give them some
and then I won't be diminished by that I also
have much more to give and I can give more
to others which life do you think is a more
satisfying life to live now I hear you saying but
Leo my cup is so empty I don't know I
don't know how to fill myself up how do I
turn myself into this ever flowing fountain of infinite love
I don't know how remember what I taught you in
part one I told you that you don't need to
know how you simply need to cultivate the vision and
the desire and the intention to be a certain way
it doesn't matter that you don't know how to not
be needy right now set that as your goal make
that your commitment and then you'll figure out how along
the way there are many resources available to you on
my channel and in many other places that's a very
big topic I can't just explain it to you in
a few sentences how to become non needy and how
to overflow with love that's what my entire work is
about my life's work here all of actualised I learned
all the content that the hundreds of hours of content
that I've generated is leading you towards that you will
spend the next decades of your life learning how to
do that this is a big accomplishments not something you
do in a year or in a few months this
takes real work this is that work that I talk
about that's not the flimsy kind of work this is
the real solid work that will pay you dividends for
the rest of your life and it will lead to
genuine satisfaction and not just some temporary pleasure or some
temporary material you know achievement this is really changing how
you are in the world it's changing your being at
the identity level that's where your deepest results come from
also stop trying to get love from things from physical
things you buy that car why do you buy it
because it gets it gives you a feeling of love
you buy a house cuz it gets you a feeling
of love you do some drugs cuz it gets you
a feeling of love you know it's okay to buy
a house I just recently bought a house so I
can't criticize you for that it's fine to buy a
house it's fine to own a car it's fine to
even have a luxury car that's fine but stop expecting
these things to give you love stop stop making these
the things the source of your love these things should
be tertiary for most people these things are primary because
they don't know how to generate love within themselves so
then the only substitute is to get love from the
outside through purchasing stuff or to stuff transcend that whole
paradigm by working on yourself by doing spiritual practice by
being passionate about life one of the ways that you
overflow with love is by being so passionate and following
up on your passion see if you have a passion
but you're not following up on it that passion will
wither away and die like a fruit on a tree
you have to keep tending and cultivating that passion and
stoking it and growing it and feeding it and letting
it like become this echo chamber where it amplifies itself
and it permeates your whole life that's one of the
ways the next important point I have for you is
that there are many different stages of development that human
beings go through and that not all human beings are
on the same level of development these levels of development
are totally different ways of looking at the world and
being in the world and there's a certain sequence of
these developmental levels and stages that people typically go through
you can studies these developmental stages they can give you
a preview and a roadmap of what kind of things
you'll be getting yourself into in the next stage which
can be very useful it can speed up your entire
growth process and they can point out to you all
the common obstacles and traps human beings have been developing
themselves for thousands of years you see so we don't
need to reinvent the wheel we don't need to act
and pretend as though we don't know what the next
stage of human development is we already know it because
those humans already exist on this planet they're just in
fewer numbers than the mainstream so by studying these rare
more highly developed individuals we can see what the next
stage of evolution is for mankind for society and also
individually for you so I highly recommend that you make
a study of these developmental stages I've devoted an enormous
amount of time on my channel and on my website
talking about these stages otherwise known as spiral dynamics but
that's not the only model of these stages there are
various other models out there ken Wilber has a pretty
good model many other there's a whole basically field called
developmental psychology which is the field of these different models
of human development there's different categories and different levels of
it and different degrees of it and so forth so
studying these stage is very useful I've shared resources in
the past I have books on my book list that
explain these different models and developmental stages on my forum
we have many examples and mega threads about these different
stages so you can study them and see what the
next level is for you what's holding you back from
reaching the next level this is quite predictable stuff and
it's one of the most one of the most useful
tools in self-development is to understand the stages that are
there and then even going beyond that what is really
important for you to understand is that there are stages
of human development that we could call superhuman these are
stages of development and ways of being in the world
that are so radically advanced and profound and different from
whatever stage you're at right now when you're beginning this
journey that you can't even imagine it you can't conceive
of it and it would be so shocking and radical
if you were dropped into it that you would have
a hard time believing that such a thing is even
possible or real and that's one of the challenges of
this work is trying to communicate to you the superhuman
levels of development and being that are possible for you
but that you're just nowhere even near to actualize it
yet or to seeing and therefore you won't believe it's
even possible it seems like a fantasy and yet it's
crucial for you to understand that these superhuman levels of
development are possible to open your mind to this possibility
so I'm being kind of vague here necessarily but what
do I really mean by these superhuman levels of development
see the mistake and I alluded to this in part
one where I talked about how people are very different
rember I said in their minds people are very very
different don't just assume that everybody is the same than
everybody is like you well what I'm saying here is
that there exist rare numbers of individuals on this planet
right now who are in such radically advanced stages of
development and consciousness that we couldn't even call them human
anymore they are beyond human this is a radical possibility
that's not taken seriously in school and university by science
or by most of the people that you know the
chances are is that you've never met one of these
superhuman developed people in your entire life if you're young
you have no examples or role models like that this
is a totally different way of seeing the world at
interacting with the world it actually literally changes your perception
of reality you will you will see physical objects in
a different way this is not just some belief system
or some ideology that you adopt it's not just that
all you've developed yourself and now you have some extra
wisdom or extra knowledge or extra experience about the world
or you have some extra technical skills like you know
how to program or you know how to do good
art this is still all within the level of human
I'm talking the level of superhuman I'm talking about being
able to actually see physical reality in a different way
to understand what reality is in a different way to
have new capacities that ordinary humans do not have and
while that might seem outlandish consider this the only reason
it seems outlandish and fantastical to you is because all
you know is the people around you and the people
around you are extremely mediocre and they've never seriously developed
themselves that's the only reason it seems outlandish then again
if we go back into the history books and into
the scriptures of every tradition all around the world in
every culture we hear stories and myths of superhuman people
now scientists of course look at that and atheists and
skeptics look at that and rationalist look at that and
they say oh well that's just myths and fairy tales
what if they weren't myths in fairy tales what if
actually you could develop yourself to such extraordinary degrees that
you transcend your humanity and it would be as though
you evolved into a new form of human in the
way that a caterpillar evolves into a butterfly in a
sense it's still a caterpillar even when it's about a
butterfly but it's gone through such a radical transformation and
it has such new abilities that we would call it
super caterpillar and that's what I mean by superhuman I'm
talking about a way of relating to reality and seeing
reality that will that will explain it it's just it's
not something you think is even a possibility and that's
ultimately what we're trying to get you to true happiness
and a true point of life is to reach these
superhuman levels of development to break out of the mold
of what you consider ordinary physical reality and all the
limitations that come with it that's ultimately what all of
this is leading you towards and you can realize that
by studying these different stages of development and realizing that
every stage is taking you higher and higher and higher
and higher to the point where eventually you will transform
from the butter from the caterpillar into the butterfly but
that will probably take you decades of work and you
will have to execute on all the stuff that I
said in these two-part episodes and even more stuff beyond
that and not that's what actualized utterly in my entire
channel and all these videos and all of my teachings
are ultimately here for is that I'm I'm creating a
sort of a ramp that is helping to gradually move
you up towards becoming this butterfly and the difficulty of
it is is that you don't know you don't even
believe that you can become this butterfly you have no
idea what it means to be a butterfly and you
never will until you reach some of these higher ways
of being these higher states of consciousness but when you
do what you get a little peek at it when
you get a little taste of it then you will
suddenly understand why all of this material that I teach
exists why it's here for you to help you to
move up to that and then you will really discover
the true potential of this work it takes probably a
decade of this work just to realize the true potential
of this work and then that's when the real work
begins only after a decade or so when you really
realize what's possible and hey I haven't even reached the
the the the end of realizing what's possible and I've
been doing this for a long time and I've been
using some very powerful tools and techniques for for this
some unconventional techniques that are extra effective um you have
to be really open about what the possibilities are the
reason I'm telling you all this is because again this
gives you a vision for what you can do with
your life because it takes so much work so when
it takes so much work to do this stuff to
actualize it the only way you're gonna do that work
is if you have some idea of the possibility of
how amazing it's gonna be when you reach the highest
levels see most human beings haven't ever lived they will
die without realizing that superhuman levels of being were possible
to them the entire time that they were alive but
they were so lazy and complacent that they didn't note
of the work to reach it they were so closed-minded
and skeptical and cynical that they didn't bother to actually
experiment enough with life to discover these human superhuman levels
and all the people that tried to tell them about
these superhuman levels well they dismissed them they criticized them
they ridiculed them they poo pooed them and so they
blocked themselves from this possibility so I want to make
sure that you don't fall into that trap another point
I have for you is that reality is perspectival relative
and subjective what do I mean by perspectival sounds like
a fancy word just means perspective it means that reality
is perspective reality is not one-way reality is the perspective
you take on it and everybody is taking different perspectives
upon reality if you haven't noticed this people have very
different perspectives than you one of the biggest mistakes people
make is that they they cling to their own perspective
and then they tried to denounce the perspectives of others
because one of the challenges in life is that you
are coming into contact with all these different perspectives and
it's difficult to make sense of how people could have
such radically different perspectives if reality is a material objective
thing the way that science likes to say it is
the way that most of us assume that it is
we assume that reality is just this one thing and
then sure we each have a perspective on it but
there is that one thing that's there and what I'm
telling you is that no there's no one thing that's
there there's only perspectives the one thing that's there is
an infinite number of perspectives and without those perspectives there's
nothing there that's what we mean by perspectival relative and
subjective and it's very important that you start to understand
and appreciate this and that you study all the implications
of this first what it'll do is it'll open you
up from being locked into one perspective yourself and then
it'll allow you to explore other perspectives and to appreciate
them all and to become free of them all because
every perspective is limited so what I recommend is that
you go through life not trying to defend your perspective
as though it's the only right one and not thinking
that there's some one true perspective out there that people
can have and all the other ones are false but
rather look at reality as though there is no reality
there's only perspectives and get curious and open enough to
want to explore different perspectives explore perspectives just for the
sake of exploring perspectives and your life will go much
better than if you do what 99% of people do
which is just defend their own perspective trying to trick
themselves into thinking that it's the objective ultimate truth when
it isn't really appreciate and fall in love with the
idea that there is no reality outside of one's perspective
of it this is not a problem this is not
a bug this is a feature this is the beauty
of reality is that it's not limited to being a
specific way it's not limited to being physical in fact
physicality is just one perspective upon reality the problem is
that these perspectives we tend to get locked into them
and we tend to want to believe that the perspective
our one perspective is how reality is and that turns
out to be very limiting see so rather than for
example this is an analogy I used in part one
where I talked about the operating system like you could
be running a Linux operating system you can be running
the Mac OS you can be running Windows or whatever
else is out there actually there's there's a lot more
than just three of them for the purposes of or
analogizing here rather than having your mind stuck in one
operating system what you want to do is you want
to jailbreak your mind free it up so that your
mind can operate on any operating system in a sense
you want to create sort of a meta Universal operating
system which is able to deal with applications from any
of the other operating systems then you're free you're not
limited or bound to one perspective to one paradigm and
this makes your mind the most flexible the most creative
and also you're able to appreciate the full diversity that
constitutes life you see because when you're stuck in one
perspective that's such a narrow sliver of reality you're missing
out on so much of the beauty and the diversity
that's that's there you're missing out on it think of
all the software that a Mac OS user can't use
or experience because they're stuck with mac OS or think
of the software that is available on the Mac that
you don't get access to on a PC but what
if you weren't limited by any of those constraints you
could just use any software at any time see that
would be the ideal situation but the difficulty of achieving
that in your life is that you have to be
willing to detach from your own perspective you have to
be willing to question your own mind at the core
the kernel level and let go of those kernels that
are grounding your sense of reality and that's scary that's
difficult that's emotionally challenging to let go of those things
because that's what anchors your entire sense of identity in
life so I recommend you take that on as a
project to explore more and more perspectives without getting attached
to any particular one that's gonna enrich your life so
much that's gonna deepen your ability to love and to
understand it's gonna make you more creative it's gonna make
you more flexible it's gonna make you less arrogant less
selfish and as one of the final points here I
want to stress that there's more happening in life than
meets the eye ordinarily if you just kind of look
around at people it just seems like well I'm a
biological animal that was born into this reality and there's
other biological animals and I can interact with them I
can go to work I can make a living I
can pamper myself with creature comforts like houses and cars
and other things like this and I can make myself
happy and that's basically what life is all about and
that's it right no that's that's that's an extremely limited
version of life life can be so much more than
that but to discover that you're gonna have to go
beyond materialism beyond what culture teaches you beyond what science
teaches you beyond what your family and your parents and
your teachers have modeled for you role modeled for you
you have to go beyond all of that you're gonna
have to go deep inside you have to really deconstruct
your own mind and you're gonna have to you're gonna
have to push yourself to lead a life that is
not the ordinary get up go to work see your
family and do it all over again the next day
sort of life something much more profound is happening here
then simply atoms bouncing around in space or physical objects
existing or evolution unfolding or animals on some planet doing
some stuff these are all very crude conceptions of life
now here let me recap for you really fast the
core values that are necessary the core principles that you
need to follow to live the good life creativity heart
love intuition independence of mind clarity of mind lifelong learning
leading authenticity radical open-mindedness passion vision ambition purpose spirituality fearlessness
truth raising your consciousness work ethic focus the ability to
concentrate your mind wisdom service to others selflessness solitude and
self-reflection questioning questioning everything curiosity and going beyond materialism and
survival that in a nutshell is the foundation of what
you need to live the ultimate life and then you
got to follow up every single day every single week
every single month every single year for decades upon all
of these values and principles you got a hammer on
them you got to contemplate them think think about them
deepen them because it's not just a matter of oh
and my passion or am I not am i loving
or am I not am i authentic or am I
not or like am i conscious or am I not
know there's there's degrees enormous degrees and ranges and multiple
dimensions to all of this so what you do is
if all of this sounds good to you you commit
to following up on it every single day and you
keep reminding yourself that this is what you're doing in
this life and then this is the the backbone of
your whole life and everything else is tertiary all the
entertainment and socializing and games and fun and all this
you can have all that and you can still enjoy
life what I'm saying here is not antithetical to the
enjoyment of life it actually is the highest enjoyment of
life possible but it also takes deliberate work and constantly
reminding yourself because you're going to forget and you're gonna
fall back down into complacency the fundamentals of life are
pretty simple as I've laid them out here but executing
on them is difficult because it takes commitment and you
have to keep doing it day after day after day
after day year after year after year after year and
not get distracted by all sorts of silliness that is
happening around you in society he takes a vision he
takes courage it takes the willingness to go it alone
because your friends and your family are not gonna join
you on this journey your spouse is probably not gonna
join you on this journey your children will probably not
join you on this journey this is a rare journey
that is done by one in a million people if
not less of course you can find like-minded friends and
people but if you want to go all the way
to superhuman levels of potential don't expect anyone to come
along with you on that journey you're gonna do it
all alone or you're not gonna do it at all
so how much are you willing to invest in your
life that is the ultimate question how much do you
want out of life what are you willing to settle
for or are you not going to settle for anything
short of superhuman are you going to honor your life
and acknowledge the miracle that it is by working to
actualize your full superhuman potential are you willing to sacrifice
and to work and to pay the price for that
too in in yourself every single day to push your
comfort zone to ascend every stage that we have mapped
and we know that humans are capable of ascending up
are you willing to go to the very top your
biggest obstacles here will be distractions complacency laziness and simply
the fact that nobody else around you is doing it
and you're gonna feel weird and they're gonna may say
you and they're gonna discourage you and they're gonna try
to drag you down like crabs in a bucket when
one of the crabs tries to crawl out of the
bucket the rest of the crabs pull him down so
you're gonna need to have a deep commitment to this
process a very long time horizon a deep motivating vision
and you're gonna have to have confidence in yourself that
this is the kind of life that you want to
live you don't need to have these things at the
outset out the outset most likely you're gonna be confused
uncertain lacking confidence insecure needy broke desperate I've been there
I've been there that's where I started that's where I
started my process that's in a sense where all of
us start we start in ignorance even worse than ignorance
we start with a bunch of brainwashing from ignorant people
that have raised us and dysfunctional people who have been
bad role models and have skewed our idea of what
is possible for a human being to become it's okay
that you're confused and lost and ignorant and you don't
you don't know everything you don't know how you're gonna
get there it's okay to be insecure to doubt yourself
all of that is totally normal especially if you're young
if you're in your 20s totally normal but the one
thing you need is you need that desire and ambition
and passion to live an extraordinary life as long as
you have that despite all that other stuff you will
overcome it it'll take years but it doesn't matter because
if your desire is strong enough it doesn't matter to
you that something takes two years or even decades and
it's not about reaching someone ultimate peak in life but
then you reach that and then all that's it it
was all worth it and everything else was just some
grind to get there that's not it the journey is
of course just as important as the destination the destination
will be awesome but also enjoy the journey savor it
this is life it's a miracle it's a privilege to
be a part of it and working on improving your
life is not a chore or some homework assignment that
I'm forcing you to do it should be the very
thing that you're passionate about for its own sake not
to get to someplace where everything is perfect but the
process of it is exciting you're learning new stuff you're
facing challenges you're being creative you're discovering new possibilities you're
on an adventure what more could you want from life
you have a better idea of how to live if
you do then do that again don't take anything I
say here as a dog mom or as some blind
belief but test it out in your life and see
if these principles and these values and these tips that
I've given you if they actually work and if they
work and they're helpful then use them and those that
don't fit you then throw those away alright that's it
I'm done here please click that like button for me
come check out actualize that org that's my website you'll
find my blog you'll find the forum you'll find the
book list a lot of resources that will help you
on this journey and the life purpose course the life
purpose course will pick up right where we sort of
left off here and we'll take you even deeper into
this process of self-discovery where it shows you how to
discover your top values how to customize this whole process
to your own personality your own strengths and then how
to actually start taking action on it and developing a
tangible career out of your passion so if you found
value out of these two parts here out of this
two part series then I highly recommend you check out
the life purpose course which you can find it actualized
org and if you'd like you can support me on
patreon at patreon.com slash actualized and that's it that's your
life advice there will not be a part 3 I
feel good in terms of everything we covered in these
two parts to me this is the foundation I don't
want to over complicate it really if you think about
it on the one hand you could say well but
Leo you've spent two hours in this episode and then
almost two and a half hours in the previous episode
seems like it's almost like four or five hours worth
of material so it you did over complicate it's so
complicated no it's really if you go through this if
you take notes on it watch it a few times
it's not that complicated I mean relative to the fact
that we are talking about your entire [ __ ]
life relative to figuring out your entire [ __ ]
life what I've laid out here in four hours is
not complicated right algebra is more complicated than the stuff
I'm talking about here and you spent thousands of hours
learning mathematics throughout 12 grades of school and all I'm
asking here is is four hours for a plan for
your entire life it's not too much to ask it's
not too much to ask to what to ask you
to rewatch this a few times understand the value of
this sometimes people criticize me for olio your videos are
so long why don't you just condense them because by
giving you short 10-minute videos which I could do but
I don't want to do I would actually be wasting
more of your time if all you're watching is these
short little 10 minute videos here and there about how
to improve your life you're never gonna get to the
to the real stuff that's gonna transform your life you're
gonna get some frivolous surface-level [ __ ] which is
gonna leave you unsatisfied and you're gonna be chasing your
tail running in circles alright the videos are long because
yes it's a few hour investment but this few our
investment recognize how much it's giving you recognize how much
perspective it's giving you recognize how much different stuff were
integrating and the nuance we'll bring into this and all
the examples this is this is giving you such a
deep understanding of what's being talked about here that any
10 or 15 minute video could do see so actually
you're saving yourself time by watching these longer videos because
then you actually understand think of how much time you
waste when you misunderstand something and you go off and
you do foolish things and you fall into various traps
because the thing isn't properly explained to you you could
easily lose years of your life doing that so don't
don't take this material for granted keep reminding yourself that
you've discovered a gold mined here not because I'm some
important person but simply because this is rare material and
it's gonna change your whole life if you follow up
on it it's not gonna change your whole life if
you just watch it that's not enough but at some
point into watching it you're gonna reach a point where
it clicks for you and you're gonna say oh oh
oh oh I started this process thinking that I'll just
watch these videos and my whole life will become as
Leo says but now I realize oh I'm gonna have
to work for it oh no I'm gonna fit work
my ass off art oh no oh no I didn't
think it would be that hard I thought I could
just watch I thought I could just listen to this
while I'm cooking dinner or something and I if I
listened long enough while I'm cooking dinner then my life
would be all actualized and and good no it won't
be but at some point it will click for you
that you have to do the work and you will
be grudgingly start doing the work and you'll whine and
your [ __ ] in your moan and you'll procrastinate
and all of this you'll play all these [ __
] games but eventually you will put yourself on track
and you'll build slowly build momentum and build momentum and
eventually 5 10 20 years later that's when all of
this all of these seeds will will flower and that's
when you'll really understand why I was pressing you so
adamantly to be serious about this work then you'll understand
and that will be my reward for doing this work
you see I'm not doing this work because I get
paid money for it I mean I do get paid
money for it and I can't complain it's not it's
not bad money it's pretty good money but that's not
why I do this work I do this work so
that 20 years from now you can say to yourself
leo holy [ __ ] Wow I could have never
known it was so good why didn't you tell me
it's so good and then you realize Leo you couldn't
have told me I would have believed and you see
that's my reward and I don't even need you to
say that I know that those of you who will
go through it and we'll get there will realize that
and that's my reward you
