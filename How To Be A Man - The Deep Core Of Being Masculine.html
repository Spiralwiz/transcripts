hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to tell you how to be a
man okay let's talk about how to make you into
a man how to be a man I love this
topic I'm so excited about this topic I've been waiting
to talk about this and I want to shoot more
videos just about what it takes to be masculine also
what it takes to be feminine and the interaction between
the two I just love studying female and male psychology
is so fascinating to me ever since I got into
pickup and I really started to dig my way out
of a deep hole that I dug myself into through
my whole life where I had no success with relationships
more sex basically I committed to digging myself out of
that hole committed to studying a lot of material about
the dynamics and what it takes to attract the opposite
sex how that actually works not just the myths not
just the popular cultural stereotypes but actually how it works
and practicing it in the field talking to thousands and
thousands of women it's ridiculous the the amount of development
that I got from that personally has been amazing it's
been one of the most rewarding things that I've done
and I think one of the best things for my
own masculinity because I learned so much about what takes
to be a man and there are actually very very
clear principles of what it means to be masculine and
when you become more in touch with your masculinity as
a guy it's amazing you start to feel like you're
really yourself you start to feel authentic the way you
you know you want to feel you stop feeling shy
and insecure and and you stop being a [ __
] and you start actually taking the bull by the
horns and it feels amazing this is what your life
as a man should be so if you haven't yet
tapped into this if you're still young if you're going
through high school or college especially wow and like if
you're kind of in your early 20s or mid 20s
this is the perfect opportunity for you to really tap
into masculinity this is such an amazing idea all right
so what does it really mean to be a man
and if you really want to know a lot of
this information I take from David data's excellent book way
of the superior man where he goes really deep some
like super deep amazing ideas about masculinity he's he's really
the Guru on that he's the expert so I learned
a lot of information from him but also a lot
of this stuff comes from my own experience looking at
guys who are really really successful with women who are
really attractive to women and analyzing them and picking them
apart my own mind and studying them and then taking
on those characteristics myself and then testing it out and
saying how the women in my life have been reacting
to it wow there's some really powerful ideas here so
what does it mean to be a man well my
man is 100% authentic you have to be very honest
as a man you have to be real you have
to have nothing to hide you have to be totally
open be open you have to be open about all
your problems all your all your insecurities all your foils
you have to be very open about it you can't
hide stuff it can't be in a relationship hiding stuff
hiding skeletons it can't be in a conversation trying to
not rub somebody the wrong way trying to be too
polite no a real man is authentic he's not afraid
to express himself in fact that's what he's doing his
whole life his whole life is about self-expression that's what
makes him a man that's what he loves this is
what he enjoys to do this is what masculine energy
is it's about unleashing into the world feminine energy is
about receiving and being and being kind of being going
with the flow masculine energy is about enforcing yourself on
the world and we're going to get into that little
bit deeper in a few minutes here towards the end
of this video so it's about having nothing to hide
it's also about being you might say icy icy or
otherwise emotionally stable unreactive grounded a man is grounded right
he is the man he knows what his values are
he knows what his principles are and he lives by
principles he has things that are important to him things
that he will never sacrifice for the sake of a
quick little you know reward here a quick little reward
here a quick little hit of pleasure he's got principles
that he's living by he he values he values maybe
honesty or he values creativity or values truth there's something
in there that is grounding him it's making them solid
he's not wishy-washy he's not jumping up and down he's
not always afraid and anxious and worrying what people think
about him that's how a woman behaves that's not how
a man behaves and a woman that's the most repellent
thing to a woman is if you start to behave
like a woman if you are reactive if you are
indecisive if you are not icy she is not going
to be attracted to you not if she's very feminine
a very feminine woman is going to want a very
masculine man who's completely rounded because what he does is
he grounds her and he allows her to be girly
he allows her to be emotional and her emotions can't
penetrate into him it's like it's like he's a pillar
and no matter what the wind does you know a
hurricane can come by and this pillar this concrete pillar
is just like grounded a thousand feet into the earth
and it's not moving it's not budging nothing's going to
move it that's what a real man is to do
that you have to develop a really strong sense of
identity that's why women will always be attracted to the
men who have the strongest connection with who they really
are who really understand their identity that's why we even
are attracted to more older men because older men they're
more mature and they have a deeper sense of identity
and younger man they haven't really discovered who they are
yet and so women tend to go for the ones
that have and those just naturally tell you a little
bit older that's why women generally like to date in
in the you know guys who are like five or
ten years older than they are that's how that can
be explained so another thing that a really real man
is is that he's happy by himself he doesn't need
women he doesn't need the approval of anybody he can
be happy just how he is he constructs an awesome
life for him and he's very independent he's stable and
then if if a woman comes into his life great
and if he's got friends that come into his life
great but he doesn't need them he's not dependent on
them he's in fact completely outcome independent he doesn't need
anything to go his way he doesn't need a woman
to be in his life if a woman is in
his life he might be happy with her and if
she decides to leave he's totally happy with that too
he's not attached to her he doesn't cling to her
that's what a masculine man does because he's confident he
knows who he is he's happy in himself why would
he need a woman to be there why would he
need some particular person his life he wouldn't he wouldn't
need that he's really grounding his identity okay the next
point is and this is my favorite is that a
real man is really in tune with his sexuality you
have to really get over this idea that sex is
wrong evil shameful dirty it's complete nonsense when you become
a real man you you you view sex as completely
normal completely healthy in fact beautiful in fact something that
is your gift to give to the world and you
are completely open with your sexuality you are not afraid
to talk about sex you aren't afraid to have amazing
sex you're not afraid to talk dirty to a girl
I'm real man does that because it pleases him not
because he's trying to show off or he's trying to
be dirty but because that's who he is he's masculine
and he wants to [ __ ] the girl and
he wants to [ __ ] the world now I
don't say this facetiously or to be flippant I actually
mean that he wants to [ __ ] the world
this is what masculinity is that it's very core as
a man you want to [ __ ] the world
now let me explain what this is because as you
do one thing you do everything and if you are
not [ __ ] the world then you actually are
not [ __ ] your girl and actually see this
with men is that they don't know how to [
__ ] their girl properly to do this you have
to understand what this means for a man he gets
his deepest pleasure from giving himself to the world he
gives he releases his energy right and this can be
this is mirrored in sex is that the man gives
himself he is the one who's doing the penetrating and
he is the one who is injecting the world with
a seed now this is clear how this applies in
sex that's very literal but it actually also applies in
the real world in life outside the bedroom and it's
actually even more important here because what this means to
[ __ ] the world is that you're penetrating the
world with your personality this means you're penetrating the world
with your authentic self with who you are when you
do that you can't be shy you can't be timid
you can't be fearful right and this means that to
penetrate the world that means you're sharing your gifts your
life is about giving your life is about creating it's
about doing doing what's authentic to you not caring about
what anybody thinks about you not letting any obstacle get
in your way this is how a real man behaves
and when he's out there and he's doing it in
the real world then he can really do it in
the bedroom too in the real world you should be
penetrating into it right and that's literally how it feels
I don't know maybe you felt this if you've accomplished
something great at work or you've created some sort of
project something creative maybe you like you wrote a book
or you you wrote some sort of awesome report you
created a website where you can post some awesome piece
of music as a man when you do that you
feel like yeah like that's that's it like right I
[ __ ] the world I penetrated the world literally
and I like I gave it my seed that is
my seed that I inseminated into the world it was
something that wasn't there and now I gave I gave
that life as a man we can't have a child
directly we can have a child through the woman but
we don't actually give birth to a child so for
us the creative process is even more important than it
is for a woman because for a woman she can
identify with the creative process of actually creating a baby
a man can't do that so for him his purpose
in life his mission his fulfillment comes from creating in
the world that's why men are tinker's that's why we're
engineers that's why we love to go out there and
build stuff and do stuff and we like to create
stuff physically but we also like to create intellectual stuff
right we like to analyze and we'd like to synthesize
that information that's what you should be doing if you're
not doing this then you're not tapping into your full
masculinity and really you're unsatisfied in life at the very
deep level so what a man has is he has
a life purpose the life purpose stuff that I talked
about so passionately in all my videos well this is
especially important for you if you are a man I
think it's important for women to and they have to
reconcile how the masculine energies with life purpose fit in
with their feminine energies there's more of a challenge there
but with men it's completely clear you need to be
so focused on your life purpose your life purpose needs
to be priority number one the woman in your life
is not priority number one never make your woman priority
number one if you do she will leave you because
she'll sense that your priority is her and she doesn't
like that what she likes is she likes that you
have a purpose you have a sense of direction and
she's tagging along and she's there for the riot and
she's supporting you as the girl in your life but
she is not your purpose so your purpose should be
something outside of her your purpose should be your work
your career what are you doing what's the impact you're
having on the world how are you penetrating the world
because if you can penetrate the world if you can
go out there you can kill it in your career
then when you coming back into the bedroom you can
kill it there and that's what's going to make her
happy and she's going to be happy that you're out
there and doing stuff that's good for the world too
so it really it just it all comes together really
really nicely this is the essence of it life purpose
sense of direction this is the essence of masculinity and
to have a life purpose is going to all these
ideas or they're all dovetailing because to have a life
purpose to be on track with it to be really
killing it in your career you're gonna have to be
very confident you're going to have to start to throw
away all those fears that you have all those anxieties
all those girly qualities about you that are making you
a [ __ ] that's not allowing you to go
out there and bust through the obstacles in the real
world when you throw those away you cast those aside
and you also tap into who you really are and
because you're on your life purpose you have identified it
so you've done some work on your personality you know
who you are you're grounded now you're icy right and
now you can be that pillar you can be that
pillar you know who you are so you can be
authentic you can be authentic in your conversations you don't
need anyone to be in your life and that's extremely
attractive to the opposite sex you're going to get so
many women when you can create your life to to
embody everything and I'm telling you here some of this
stuff is kind of abstract but also not I mean
you can see how you can start to develop this
up it's going to take you some time if you
have been a [ __ ] your whole life if
you have not developed life purpose if you don't know
who you are if you are shy if you're introverted
if you don't know how to have a conversation if
you don't know how to have amazing ridiculous sex if
you don't know how to penetrate the world then you
this is probably new free it's probably a bit of
a shock and you're like wow I'm I'm far away
don't get discouraged you might be far away right now
especially if you're young it's kind of normal right it
takes a guy really some time to develop this I
would say that the man's the man's mission or what
the man is doing from his early 20s to his
late 30s is he's discovering his identity he's discovering who
he really is and what he wants to do in
the world how he wants to penetrate the world and
when he finally discovers that and he gets on board
then he becomes a real man and then women flock
to him right you might think that well I'm 20
years old I should already have that figured out no
not really I think most most guys it takes them
longer takes them longer to figure it out just because
you're a man physically does not make you a man
psychologically does not make you truly masculine you can be
a physical man but you can still be a boy
inside you can be immature you could not know who
you are you can be living somebody else's values you
can be shaky you can be fearful you can be
anxious you can be emotional you can get angry all
the time in fact a lot of guys do do
that you can not know how to have sex you
can be working some stupid lame job and not have
anything that you're really creating it's powerful in your life
and it takes a guy about 10 years starting from
his 20s to really develop it I really encourage you
to to take this very seriously enjoy be very conscious
about how you go about putting yourself together as man
when you do this Wow so much is going to
happen for you the biggest things are going to feel
fulfilled not only you're doing this to be attractive to
the opposite sex really you're doing it for yourself a
man doesn't do anything for anybody else but himself you're
doing this because you love being masculine it feels amazing
when you tap into this Wow it's [ __ ]
awesome so I really encourage you to to take all
this information to heart and start finding ways to apply
it here a couple of things that I'm going to
give you that are going to practically drill this into
your mind things that you can do to become more
of a man number one have sex with lots of
girls I think this is mandatory for men this is
how we are biologically wired even though society does not
like to admit this girls don't like us to talk
about it we want to be monogamous and this and
that would be in a relationship and get married look
the bottom line is is that a man is like
the lion in the pride this is the way nature
set it up I'm sorry to break it to you
girls and guys but this is how it is you
can talk about marriages and all this all you want
and I think there's nothing wrong with marriage you're something
wrong with monogamous relationships but as a man especially a
young man you need to go out there and you
need to explore the field you have sex with lots
of girls this is what makes you a man this
is how you learn about sexuality this is how you
learn about being I see this is how you learn
about being unreactive this is how you learn to tolerate
all the emotions that women are throwing at you it's
how you learn to flirt how you learn to be
confident there's so much stuff that you learn by being
with women and the more of them you can be
with the better that doesn't mean you have to be
[ __ ] your whole life but it does mean
that it's good right it's much better to go out
there and have sex with 20 or 30 girls then
have sex with two of them if you have sex
with two girls your whole life you're going to be
a [ __ ] I can pretty much guarantee it
it's gonna be hard for you to really be masculine
if you go out and have sex with 30 or
100 girls it's almost gonna be possible for you not
to be masculine you're just gonna have to learn to
even to accomplish that you're gonna have to already build
your masculinity so much so you have to go out
there and do that just do it stop making excuses
and stop saying that as baddest or evil or something's
wrong with it it's not wrong this is this is
what it takes to become a man women are attracted
to this even though they don't like to admit it
they always want to say well I want the guy
to be just my guy fine but in the end
they're attracted to a guy who is icy unreactive emotionally
stable who's authentic and real and confident extremely sexual extremely
open how do you think a guy guess like that
you think a guy is born like that [ __
] no to be that way you need to go
out there and explore the world you need to [
__ ] a lot of women now I get that
way and the fact is that women will always have
sex with a guy who has the sex with most
women the more women you get it's like a snowball
effect you just have more and more sex with women
and then becomes easier and easier to have sex with
more women because you get so grounded that women just
are magnetically drawn to you it's it's obnoxious it's frankly
obnoxious some of the things that I have seen in
the field from some of the people I've seen it's
in fact it can be so obnoxious it can be
so effective that the person could actually stop to develop
himself and he just becomes he becomes so attractive with
women that it's almost like he he gets all the
validation he wants and he stops growing as a true
man he really stays immature but he becomes so attractive
it's obnoxious so go out and explore the field a
little bit so your royal oats as they say okay
next is I want you to have a strong career
and a strong sense of purpose in your life if
you don't know what your life purpose is man I
would say that's even more important discover what your life
purpose is have that nailed down I don't care what
it takes if it takes you 10 years to figure
it out figure it out if it takes you hours
and hours of work and money and toil and traveling
the world do it find out what your life purpose
is commit to it and stay on track and never
fall off because as soon as you fall off you
lose your masculinity you lose your power you lose way
too much it's not worth it your life purpose is
priority number one women are not priority number one they're
priority number 3 or 5 or 10 not 1 okay
and the third thing that I'm going to give you
is I want you to start working out of your
comfort zone as a man you cannot be surrounding yourself
in a bubble of comfort you have to be out
there doing new stuff that means if you're not comfortable
going to the gym start going to the gym if
you're not comfortable eating Korean food go eat Korean food
if you're not comfortable traveling overseas go travel overseas to
some dangerous country if you're not comfortable chatting up a
girl in a club go to a club and chat
up more girls if you're not comfortable reading a book
go read a book you know do the things that
are pushing your comfort zone that are scaring you because
what they're going to do is they're going to they're
going to expand your tolerance level they're going to grow
you as a human being personal growth I mean a
woman can do this too and she'll get personal growth
everybody gets personal growth by pushing their comfort zone but
for a man this is especially important because you can't
be fearful it can't be fearful you have to be
confident and confidence is something that you ultimately develop over
the long run by exploring exploring life it can't be
just limited to this one little domain in life open
yourself up more try more stuff explore travel work different
jobs you know have a diversity of friends study different
material have different types of girlfriends so that you can
learn from them all then you become a real man
and then you can kind of narrow down and say
okay I want to do this but at the beginning
you got to kind of explore so those are the
the key points about how to become a man this
is Wow if I had this information just two years
ago it would have transformed my life so I had
to go and discover this thing the really hard way
so I'm distilling a lot of golden nuggets for you
