            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/iaV6S45AD1w' target='_blank'>Why Rationality Is WRONG! - A Critique Of Rationalism</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Rationalism Misunderstood</b>: Rationality is viewed as a human feature, not a universal one. It is contingent on having a mind and brain. Yet, many assume that the universe behaves rationally just as human minds do. This assumption has not been proven and it is possible that the universe operates a-rationally (neither irrationally nor rationally). Thus, rationality seems to be a projection onto the universe rather than an inherent property of it. 
</li><li><b>The Existence-Rationality Dichotomy</b>: Existence itself exists a-rationally, meaning it is not based on or concerned with rationality or logic. The only reason rationality and logic even come into play is because they are emergent properties of an a-rational universe. The relationship between existence and rationality is unbalanced. Existence can occur without logic or rationality, but vice versa is impossible. 
</li><li><b>The Irrelevance of Rationality to Empirical Facts</b>: Empirical facts do not rely on rationality or logic to exist. These facts, such as snow being white or the existence of the sun, are independent of argumentation or reasoning. They exist no matter what logic or rationality is applied, and facts such as these require no rational justification. 
</li><li><b>Misplaced Emphasis on Rationality</b>: Due to a societal shift from religious to materialistic and rational thinking, there has been a misaligned focus on rationality. This has created a blind spot in the understanding of reality, failing to acknowledge that there is more to reality than rationality and logic. This blind spot is further established by the rejection of contradictory thought in favor of agreement with existing rational views.
</li><li><b>The Flaws in 'Navie realism' and Rationalist Perspective</b>: Foundational to many rationalists' beliefs, naive realism operates on the assumption that an objective world exists independent of humans and their subjective experiences. Essentially, it presumes that the physical world operates under rational, scientific laws even if humans weren't there to perceive it. This viewpoint can be viewed as limiting, and fails to consider the a-rational nature of reality and the significant role of human cognition.
</li><li><b>Empirical Reality and Emotional Experience</b>: While rationalists may argue that spontaneous and raw emotional experiences are subjective and unreliable, they fail to recognize the empirical reality of experiencing these moments. These emotional experiences occur in real-time and their existence cannot be disapproved by logic or rational thinking. This emphasizes the existence's ability to operate without rationality. 
</li><li><b>Rationality as a Human Feature</b>: Rationality is perceived to be a distinguishing feature of humans. It is seen as a tool exclusive to humans and is used to perceive, interpret, and predict the world around us based on logical principles. This perspective often overlooks the possibility of the universe operating a-rationally.
</li><li><b>Existence Does not Depend on Logic</b>: Existence does not require logical justifications to exist. Pure raw empirical facts, like the existence of the sun or the whiteness of snow, are not subject to logical justification. Logic and rational thought are secondary properties that depend on the basic state of existence.
</li><li><b>Empirical Facts and Rationality</b>: Empirical facts are not rational, they exist outside, independent of rational thought. Rationality is a process we engage in to interpret these facts. Leo warns against the assumption that interpreting empirical facts means uncovering deep existential truths. In essence, he identifies these interpretations as human projections, models constructed from a series of mental labels and images, not the actual existential clues. He criticizes rationalists for overestimating the significance of these mental constructs and forgetting that they are essentially construction tools for creating elaborate systems of understanding but do not truly represent the core reality.
</li><li><b>Concepts and Projection</b>: There is a distinct difference between mental labels and the actual things they represent. This distinction can be obscured when numerous symbols are used in conjunction to create models, theories, concepts, and approximations. These constructs can create an overlay of 'virtual reality' on actual reality leading to the mistaken belief that this conceptual matrix is in fact, the real world. Leo stresses the importance of realizing that these constructs are a projection of our mind.
</li><li><b>The Map is not the Territory</b>: It's crucial to understand, according to Alfred Korzybski, that 'the map is not the territory'- our labels, symbols, and constructs might aid in understanding reality to some degree, but they are not the reality itself. As we create and rely on these symbolic constructs, we risk creating a labyrinth of virtual reality that we mistake for the real world. This mistake can lead to conflicts, contradictions, and misunderstandings of reality and it cuts across different aspects of life such as relationships, politics, parenting, etc.
</li><li><b>Clarity on Thought and Awareness</b>: Rationalists tend to mix up thought and awareness. Thought comprises of internal mental words and images that pertain to symbols. Awareness, on the other hand, is not dependent on thought but exists separate from it. Rationalists often overlook this distinction and assume they can solely use rational thought to understand everything, disregarding the importance and separate existence of awareness. 
</li><li><b>The Trap of Rational Constructs</b>: Rational constructs, such as the concept of gravity or the law of energy conservation, should not be mistaken as real phenomena. They are useful tools, but claiming their actual existence is inaccurate. The fixation on such constructs can limit understanding of reality which is more about awareness and less about mental labeling. 
</li><li><b>Awareness is Primary to Thought</b>: Awareness exists independently and is primary to thought. However, rationalists fail to understand this because of their fixation on mental constructs and concepts. Successful thinking and the development of mental models is highly praised in our society, and as a result, the projection of human constructs onto reality and the overestimation of these constructs leads to the misunderstanding of the actual existence.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Awareness</b>: Leo Gura explains that awareness is the foundation upon which thoughts and rationality operate. He argues that while our thinking skills can be developed through education and training, the development of awareness, which he describes as the master, involves a different method  essentially silencing the mind. 
</li><li><b>Increasing awareness comparable to a microscope</b>: Gura compares increasing awareness to increasing the resolving power of a microscope, providing greater detail and depth to our understanding. This level of awareness, he notes, allows us to see beyond the content of our thoughts and recognize the larger context within which they arise.
</li><li><b>Awareness vs. Thought</b>: He asserts that most rational thinkers make the mistake of over-valuing thought and under-estimating the importance of awareness, leading to a limited understanding of reality. Gura also explains how increasing awareness can help one see the difference between the concepts that our thoughts represent, and the concepts as they actually exist. 
</li><li><b>Common Fallback of Rationalists</b>: Gura observes that rational thinkers often critique his ideas based on thoughts and rationality without recognizing the higher level of awareness from which he is speaking. He also distinguishes between irrational thinking (dumb thinking) and being a-rational (non-rational), and criticizes rational thinkers for failing to make this crucial distinction. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the Premises of Rationality</b>: Gura challenges the rationalist's faith in logic to prove things, arguing that logic is merely a system for shuffling and manipulating symbols. He argues that the validity of logical conclusions depends on the premises, which are often taken on faith and can indeed be incorrect. He claims that even the laws of rationality that rational thinkers rely on are grounded in irrational premises. 
</li><li><b>Overvaluing Reason in Everyday Life</b>: Finally, Leo Gura criticizes the overemphasis on the importance of reason in daily life. He argues that while reason may serve a purpose, its value tends to be exaggerated, leading to an over-reliance on thought and underappreciation of awareness and emotion.
</li><li><b>The Dependency on Emotion</b>: Leo Gura argues that logic and reasoning are not primary motivators of behavior. He explains that emotions inform around 99% of behaviors, making life much more grounded in emotions than rationality. This includes decisions such as getting married, which while may be deliberated on logically and rationally, is essentially an emotionally driven choice. Leo points out that rationality does not hold a significant sway on actual life results.
</li><li><b>Rational People's Emotional Repression</b>: Gura observes that highly logical and rational people often display a disconnection from their body and a repression or avoidance of their emotions. They tend to reject the necessity of connecting with and understanding their emotions, regarding it as superfluous to rational reasoning. However, he asserts that by connecting with one's body and emotions, one becomes a more well-rounded individual.
</li><li><b>Irony of Rationalism</b>: Pointing out an irony, Gura says that individuals who are staunchly rational can become very emotionally invested in their rational worldviews. He elaborates that individuals who are hyper-rational tend to exhibit an emotional reaction against any ideas they perceive as irrational or a-rational. He attributes this to the ego's role in shaping a rational worldview, and defense mechanisms triggered by cognitive dissonance when this worldview is challenged.
</li><li><b>Rationalism and Living Life</b>: According to Gura, rationalists tend to overlook the impact of psychology on living life. He asserts that rationalists find it challenging to master their personal lives, as this would require managing emotions and consciousnessareas that are often neglected or undervalued by them. He notes that despite excelling in their professional fields, rationalists often face difficulties in personal life areas like relationships, money, health, empathy, and self-awareness.
</li><li><b>From Rationality to Post-rationalism</b>: Gura explains that humanity has progressed from pre-rationalism (belief-based and traditional) to rationalism and now needs to move toward post-rationalism. He cautions against confusing post-rationalism with pre-rationalism, a common mistake made by rationalists threatened by the concept of post-rationalism. This transition entails recognizing and working on one's emotional life and embodiment alongside rational thinking. 
</li><li><b>Balance between Rationality and Emotion</b>: Leo Gura recommends striking a balance between rational thinking and emotional awareness. He emphasizes that rationality alone is insufficient for life mastery and criticizes rationalists for prioritizing logic and reason while ignoring or denying their emotional realities. He advocates the integration of emotional intelligence, body connection, and awareness to achieve personal growth and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Importance of studying and applying practical psychology in one's life</b>: In this section, Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of not just understanding, but genuinely embodying concepts from fields such as epistemology, the philosophy of science, non-duality, psychology, and meditation. He specifically challenges rationalists, who often engage with him in debates about these subjects, to spend a decade engaged in these areas of study, to experience them in a practical and applied way rather than just theorizing.
</li><li><b>The limitations of the rational mind</b>: Gura argues that rationalists have been indoctrinated with rationalism in the same way that religious followers are indoctrinated with their beliefs. He likens the process to living in the Matrix, asserting that understanding the laws of a limiting construct does not equate to understanding that the construct itself is an illusory prison. Gura states that heightened awareness transcends this construct and thus, the real task should be to increase one's level of awareness.
</li><li><b>The issue of overemphasis on thinking</b>: Gura puts forward a critique of the overemphasis on thinking, which he refers to as the 'prison of the mind.' He argues that ultimate understanding can't be reached through thinking alone, and suggests that rationalists are involved in a circular logic pattern, with each thinking process reinforcing the previous, without establishing any concrete reality.
</li><li><b>Questioning the problem of contradiction</b>: Gura brings forward a key question that challenges the fundamentals of rationalism: why is contradiction a problem? He argues that the reflex to erase or resolve contradictions is a manifestation of the ego, the 'dogmatic resistance' driven by our fear of the unfamiliar. He proposes that accepting contradictions could lead to a radical shift in understanding, which may potentially lead to a higher level of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Concept of post-rationalism</b>: Lastly, Gura introduces the concept of post-rationalism, a transcendent state in which rationalism is understood as a limited construct, and 'problems' like contradictions are no longer perceived as hurdles to be overcome. He identifies this perspective as the path to enlightenment, where thoughts and self are recognized as illusions, and external reality is only a construct of the conceptualizing mind.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Non-Contradiction</b>: Leo Gura challenges the idea of non-contradiction, arguing that contradictions don't exist in reality, but only in the mind due to the complex symbols and language we use. A contradiction does not affect reality's state, it's simply a part of the language game and symbolism we've created.
</li><li><b>Rationalism vs Religious Fundamentalism</b>: Gura draws a parallel between rationalism and religious fundamentalism - where fundamentalists defend their faith in God, rationalists ardently protect the law of non-contradiction and their belief that models can truthfully represent reality. He warns of the danger when models of reality become so advanced that they're mistaken for reality itself.
</li><li><b>The Problem with Models</b>: Leo posits that just because a model of reality is accurate and can be reproduced, it doesn't mean that it is absolutely true. The most accurate representation of reality is reality itself. Models are simply useful tools that provide simplified versions of reality for practical human use.
</li><li><b>The Paradox of Rationality and Awareness</b>: Leo reiterates the importance of building awareness to complement rational thinking. He acknowledges that while he uses rational language to communicate, this does not mean he believes in the ultimate importance of rationality. Instead, he emphasizes the significance of developing self-awareness and not relying solely on thinking.
</li><li><b>Awareness Beyond The 'Matrix'</b>: Gura uses the analogy of the 'matrix' to explain the concept of communicating within the constraints of rational language and the existing model of reality that most people understand. He suggests that by reading between the lines of his discourse, people can intuit there is an existence beyond the 'matrix', emphasizing that moving from rationality to post-rationality involves increasing self-awareness and engaging with spirituality.
</li><li><b>Transition from Rational to Post-Rational</b>: Leo Gura discusses his personal transition from being a rationalist to adopting a post-rationalist approach. Despite sounding like a step back, Gura emphasizes it's not an abandonment of rationality but transcending it. He explains it doesn't turn one irrational; he still considers himself a rational person who can engage very rationally with others but is not attached to it.
</li><li><b>Link Between Rationalism and Quality of Life</b>: Gura emphasizes the practical implications of adopting a post-rational mindset, explaining that being overly attached to rational thoughts can impact the quality of life, including relationships, emotions, career, and health. He encourages letting go of rigid, dogmatic thinking to improve life quality.
</li><li><b>Post-Rational Approach for Personal Development</b>: Gura suggests that transcending the rational perspective can lead to a richer, more fulfilling life tapping into emotions, creativity, and achieving mastery over emotions. He encourages people to be open-minded towards new learning opportunities for self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Importance of Empirical Observation in True Science</b>: Gura promotes staying true to empirical facts and adopting a skeptical attitude as crucial elements of true scientific method. He criticizes the focus on theory-building at the expense of empirical observations and suggests that staying true to empirical facts can lead to enlightenment and personal mastery.
</li><li><b>Direction for Modern Society</b>: Gura warns of the potential dangers of excessive rationalism, materialism, and scientism to the future of society, even suggesting it might lead to the extinction of the human race. He suggests society move beyond these extremes to a higher level of empathy, relationships, compassion, and higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Integration of Science and Humanity</b>: Gura urges for a more humane approach to science, arguing that current science tends to be cold, heartless, and manipulated by corporations. He advocates for integrating science with humanity to form a more inclusive, compassionate approach.
</li><li><b>Invitation for Personal Growth Journey</b>: Gura encourages viewers to engage with his content, suggesting it could lead to breaking old paradigms and embracing a happier, more fulfilling life. His commitment is to reach the most advanced stage of personal growth and bring viewers along for the journey.
