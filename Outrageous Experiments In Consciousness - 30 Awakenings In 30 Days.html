[Laughter] I'm back after a month-long retreat I'm back man
there's a lot to share I had a lot of
amazing experiences I've spent a lot of time integrating and
mulling over the things that I've experienced and I want
to share some of those with you this is gonna
be very kind of raw off-the-cuff intimate episode it's tricky
to talk about some of these things you see I
struggle I struggle it's a real struggle to communicate some
of this levels of consciousness some of these levels of
consciousness that that I've experienced but anyways here we go
before we get into it though I do need to
issue a disclaimer here which is that I'm gonna be
talking about some radical stuff I'm talking about stuff now
that I don't know how many humans on the planet
have ever experienced I'm sure some have but this is
not well known stuff even within spiritual circles and I
might be saying some things here which contradict any kind
of spiritual teacher or master that you've heard teach you
about enlightenment or awakening and what these things are and
about consciousness and what consciousness is capable of and about
psychedelics and other such things so just keep that in
mind these were outrageous experiments in consciousness that's what they
were and I just want to be authentic and and
true to my experiences and man these experiences were so
profound and paradigm shattering that I'm still reeling from them
to some degree and still trying to wrap my mind
around them and trying to understand their full implications the
reason that it took me a while after my 30-day
retreat to kind of come back and start to shoot
videos again is because I needed that time to integrate
I took a few weeks off just to deke press
and to integrate and to come back into normal life
because because man this was some crazy stuff so anyways
what happened so what I decided to do from the
very outset with my retreat in March I basically decided
to do 30 days of isolation which was very convenient
because most of us had to stay at home anyways
with these virus stay at home orders but I be
had my stay at home journey a little earlier than
most of you on the 1st of March and my
intention from the very beginning was not to meditate because
I've done plenty of meditation retreats in years past I
wanted to do something new and what I really wanted
to do was I wanted to go balls to the
wall with psychedelics and to see how deep could I
go what was the potential this was the experiment and
I was going to use five amiyo DMT and my
plan was because of a recent awakening that I had
before I began this retreat which is kind of where
the idea for the retreat came from I guess this
was late February I I had a few profound awakenings
with five amel more profound than usual and and what
what was sort of shown to me or previewed in
those awakenings was that there's a much deeper level that
I could reach and and like I said in my
video that I released before I left is that these
were levels of awakening that I don't know I don't
know how many spiritual teachers your masters have had these
levels of awakening I honestly don't know I'm quite skeptical
than any of them or that many of them have
had I'm sure some have I'm not trying to put
myself on a pedestal I'm not trying to make myself
better it to me because see the problem here is
that some spiritual people listen to this and they say
Oh leo Leo's just doing some spiritual ego trip where
he wants to like he wants to be the best
or the highest or like he wants some level of
awakening that's beyond everybody else and this is just pure
egotism it's not about that to me what it's about
is it's not about being better than any teacher it's
just about truth if you care about truth if you
care about understanding reality then that's what you care about
that's what you're passionate about and it's not about one
upping somebody else it's just up it's there's a there's
a very pragmatic serious question the heart of of your
spiritual journey if you really care about truth which is
what's the highest level of truth how do you know
you've reached the highest level this is a really tricky
question it's very very problematic because the way that most
spiritual seekers approach spirituality is that they find some teacher
or guru or teaching or school which they respect and
they believe in and they put all of their chips
in that basket and they just blindly believe that whatever
that teaching says is the highest level is where they
stop and that's where they stop and of course most
people never even reach that level of whatever the teacher
or guru or school talks about most people never get
there but even the some of those few who do
get to the top they just assume that well that's
it we're done and they never bothered to to wonder
more deeply like well how do we really know that
this is the top how do we know there's no
sense of than something deeper how would you know because
you're just trusting other humans you're trusting scriptures you're trusting
books you're trusting videos but if there's one thing that
awakening should teach you even if you have a little
degree of it not to mention the higher degrees of
it that are possible even a little degree of it
what it should teach you is that you can't trust
humans you can't trust language you can't trust belief you
can't trust books and you can't really trust gurus or
spiritual teachers cuz you don't know I'm not saying that
they're liars or that they're frauds I'm just saying that
they might have reached their limit but their limit might
not be the ultimate limit so it's from this perspective
please understand that it's from this perspective that I'm doing
various experiments and I'm trying out lots of different stuff
my spiritual journey would be a lot more direct and
simple and less confusing and honestly would have a lot
less suffering in it if I just selected one school
one teacher bowed down to him and just said okay
what you're saying is the ultimate truth let me just
now do it and reach it and then not ask
any more questions that would be so much easier so
instead what I'm doing is I'm doing the only thing
you you could do if you were truly interested in
truth is you got to go at all by yourself
you have to forget all the teachers all the teachings
all the scriptures and you got to go it all
alone and just to see what comes up for you
so that's what I did my intention was to do
30 days of back-to-back trips of five Meo DMT and
gradually increasing doses 30 trips total one per day over
the month of March and that's exactly what I did
so what this is where it gets difficult because I'm
gonna be using terms and I'm gonna be saying things
that I might have said in the past or that
other spiritual teachers that you respect and love and have
studied have said some of these are classical things I'm
gonna be talking about God I'm gonna talk about love
and when we talk about consciousness and enlightenment and awakening
and yada yada yada but you have to understand there's
so many degrees and levels to it that's the most
mind-blowing part about this whole thing so I'm gonna be
doing my best to try to communicate the difference in
in degree of what God really is cuz we're talking
about God here we're talking about you we're talking about
this the self the ultimate self we're talking about love
but many many degrees all right many many degrees and
and I honestly the levels of awakening that I reached
within 50 just within just a week actually I within
just a week of doing this experiment I reach levels
of consciousness that were so profound that I started writing
a manifesto basically denying the awakenings of every single spiritual
teacher that you've ever heard of that's how profound my
awakenings got it becomes it became just completely transparent to
me that most people who think they're awake or teach
awakening aren't actually awake in fact they're so not awake
that I wouldn't even give them one percent awakening that's
what we're talking about here but I was also very
careful about this because I started writing this manifesto but
then I also had a lot of doubt because you
know first of all I don't want to disrespect any
teachers most of these teachers are great teachers they're doing
a very good service to mankind for teaching what they
teach these are some of the most conscious humans on
the planet I respect many of these teachers and so
I don't want to you know I don't want to
throw doubts on their teachings I don't want to be
some [ __ ] who does that but at the
same time I have to be honest to my experiences
in my awakenings and that's what my awakenings were showing
me in the end I didn't end up publishing this
manifesto I was going to do a whole video on
it because I don't want to be confrontational about it
and I don't want to I don't want to start
a non-duality war so instead what I decided to do
is not to do that manifesto but just to just
to share what actually happened and then you you make
up your own mind and you make of it what
you will and I'm not gonna spend a lot of
time comparing myself to other teachers the only thing that
I'll tell you is how do you really know if
there are many degrees of awakening which there are how
do you really know what level your teacher or school
is at how do you know you're just assuming you
don't really know so just recognize that and then from
that place of not knowing your mind can be open
to new possibilities maybe possibilities that your teachers or gurus
haven't reached or maybe they have and then you'll discover
that they have by reaching that level yourself see unless
you've had some really profound awakenings you're in no position
to evaluate the level of awakening of any teacher or
school or teaching so let me sort of back up
and from the beginning already when I went to this
retreat I already was sort of expecting that this was
going to happen so one of the reasons for the
retreat and for this 30-day experiment was that I really
wanted to demonstrate to myself whether these intuitions that I
had about deeper and deeper levels of awakening that are
possible that have not been realized by many enlightened masters
I wanted to really verify for myself that this is
the case and then I wasn't just tricking myself because
you know it is easy to get into a sort
of a spiritual ego trip where you want to be
better than other teachers and so forth and so I
wanted to really test against that so I sort of
held myself back and I said okay I'm gonna do
these this 30 day retreat I'm gonna really test over
these 30 days and just really see is this really
true what my intuition is showing me and so that's
what I started and then I first I started slow
with relatively low doses of five Meo and I just
kept ramping it up every single day like I said
by about the seventh day I was already at the
level where it became completely clear that I was experiencing
levels of awakening beyond stuff that I've read or heard
of from teachers which again is not to say that
there aren't any humans on earth who have reached these
levels up I'm sure there are part of the challenge
is how do you communicate this difference in depth and
probably the most awakened and enlightened people they don't even
teach they don't even create videos they're not on YouTube
they don't write books they're probably living in a hut
somewhere in the forest or whatever mining their own business
or they've even left the planet because they're so a
well we'll get to that in a bit so anyways
yeah that was about by by the third by the
end of the first week seven days I got to
that point I remember the my first really profound awakening
was that I really I may be the fifth or
seventh day I I really hit into what God is
like really like really really really what is God like
really what is God I think that most awakened so
called awakened people especially some of these neo advising types
and some of these modern Zen teachers and montmartre sort
of Buddhist teachers and so forth like Shinzon Jung and
others like this that they I mean they're wonderful teachers
that that's one of them that's what breaks my heart
about this is that I don't want to say anything
bad about these teachers they're wonderful teachers but I can't
seriously consider these people awake I mean they don't they
don't understand what God is it's just that simple they
do understand what God is and I totally empathize with
that because I've had so many awakenings into the nature
of God by this point um not even in this
retreat but much prior four four years now that you
know I thought I understood what God was and I
did it's just that at low levels that's the amazing
thing about God you you understand it at deeper and
deeper and deeper levels and if if your spiritual teaching
is is merely teaching you something like cessation or nothingness
or emptiness which is very common with the many Buddhist
teachings or even the self or even that you're nothing
that you're everything I mean yeah of course all of
that is true I'm not contradicting any of that per
se I'm basically in agreement with most teachers it's just
a question of how deep does it go but sort
of teachings of emptiness they they're fine they're good they're
important they're necessary even and you should you should realize
what emptiness is and all that but but really really
if you if you really want to understand like you
have to really want to understand do you really want
to understand what reality is because I get the sense
for many people who do spiritual work and many even
so-called enlightened masters and so forth that they don't really
care about understanding reality maybe they care about escaping suffering
maybe they care about peace maybe they care about emptiness
but they don't really care about understanding reality you know
you might say olio but that that's just a function
of the mind understanding is just what the mind is
doing enlightenment is beyond that no consciousness is capable of
infinite understanding God is capable of infinite self understanding you
are capable of completely understanding reality if you want you're
capable that now maybe you'll need to take some five
Meo to do it that that would certainly help a
lot I don't know if you're gonna be capable of
it through meditation or something but with five amigo you're
shouldn't leak a pool of it so so what happened
to me was that I I completely I completely understood
what God is what reality is it has no beginning
and no end it has no up it has no
down every point of reality can be taken as its
beginning or as its end you can look at reality
if you imagine this room that I'm sitting in right
now and you might say well where did this room
come from well it came from the past you can
kind of think like well maybe 20 years ago somebody
built this room and then before that it was just
like some other building was here and before that it
was just some empty land and before that there was
trees and before that there was like dinosaurs that roamed
the earth on this plot of land or like this
right this is how your mind sort of imagines where
this room came from and then you can also kind
of project into the future we can say like well
maybe in a hundred years this building will be demolished
something else will be built here maybe it'll be a
park maybe it'll be a skyscraper or whatever and then
even after that something else will happen the earth will
explode or whatever and then there will be nothing here
at all just be either vacuum uppy space whatever but
really so what you're doing is you're sort of like
taking reality and sort of looking at it in a
sort of a linear fashion like from the past to
the future and the present is sort of here right
but really what God is when you're in full God
consciousness you look around the room and you can see
it from every single from an infinite number of angles
and perspectives you see that every part of the room
generates and manufactures and creates every other part so normally
we sort of as humans we sort of think like
well the Big Bang is sort of the origin point
of our universe and then from there came the earth
and then from the earth on the earth other stuff
happened and then ultimately that's why we're here you're sort
of looking at it in a single dimension you're looking
at what reality is whereas here when you're in God
consciousness you see it from every single possible dimension and
angle it's not happening linearly through you know past present
future it's all in the present now and you can
see it from every possible angle almost as though if
you take a watermelon and you do a cross-section with
a giant knife through that watermelon and you just keep
doing cross section cross section cross section in various different
angles eventually you'll slice it up into an infinite number
of perspectives like that and then you will understand the
entire watermelon as a sort of a whole whereas usually
as humans what we do is we're slicing that watermelon
just right down the middle like this we just slice
right through it and that's the cross-section that we see
and that cross-section is what represents sort of conventional human
history and future and time and how we situate ourselves
within reality so that was that was that that one
was really deep that awakening but that was only like
day five or seven and then I started going even
deeper what happened then mmm more just deeper and deeper
insight into the nature of what God is I remember
there was one trip where I woke so deep and
I was just so amazed looking at the room and
everything within it that I ran to just like look
at my computer just to see this to see what
a computer is you're not conscious of what a computer
is and it was just so incredible to be like
using the mouse just to click on the screen and
just to see the computer because the computer is my
own imagination and I was conscious of how I was
imagining all the circuitry in the computer I was conscious
of how I was imagining the entire Internet I was
conscious of how I was imagining the entire email system
so when I sent an email to somebody that email
gets delivered then I get an email back from that
person you know a day later or something so I
was conscious of how that and how my mind is
generating that entire thing how it's being held in my
consciousness and so literally what became possible is I break
I broke through into into into what I'm calling telepathy
this was something new that I had not experienced ever
before in my trips or awakenings what happened and now
I understand telepathy how it works is what happened is
that I became so conscious that I realized what consciousness
is is it's an infinitely interconnected self communicating field every
part of consciousness if you take this this chunk of
consciousness right here and this chunk of consciousness right here
right now under normal human conditions in your sober cuoco
say of sober state these two pieces of consciousness right
here are not really connecting or communicating with each other
I mean they're connecting but they're not communicating they're not
in communication but as you become more conscious what happens
is that every every point in space interconnects with itself
and starts to communicate with itself this is really a
profound shocking mystical experience and and it keeps getting cranked
off more and more and more you could call it
omniscience or you could call it telepathy but really what
happens is that it's sort of like the universal communication
system gets turned on for the first time right now
your conscious field that you're this is your conscious field
right here right now your conscious field is not in
infinite communication with itself it's fragmented and divided such that
you think that I'm over here you're over there my
computer's over here your computer is over there my email
accounts over here your email accounts over there and if
you want to communicate with me you gotta like send
me an email I gotta wait receive it through some
electronic wires and signals that run around the earth it
comes to me then I got to open it I
got to read it I got a process it then
I gotta respond it has to come back to you
through more wires and then you read it and then
in this way we're communicating you can you can tell
this process is extremely indirect why is it not possible
that you and I communicate directly right now directly if
you realize that you are me and I am you
this opens up a radical possibility of instant communication which
means that actually what's happening and I encourage you to
try to become conscious of this a little bit right
now if you can but actually even though it seems
like this is a video or an audio if you're
listening to this as an audio and it seems like
this is going through your computer which means it's going
through YouTube or through some server and it's going through
a bunch of wires around the earth to reach you
which is happening in time it seems as though I
recorded this this video days or weeks ago and now
you're watching it maybe years have passed since I recorded
this and you're watching it for the first time and
you're hearing this for the first time and it might
seem to you that that that's just what this is
and this is your computer that's projecting these sounds out
to you and all of that is indirect but you
can become directly conscious right now that actually you are
communicating directly with yourself telepathy is happening right now and
all that other [ __ ] you're just imagining you're
imagining computers and you're imagining wires running around the earth
all of this is just your denial of the fact
that you are talking to yourself right now they see
you need a story to deny that you are infinite
consciousness and that you are me so to create the
separation between me and you so that you can believe
that you're alive as a human and so that you
have a convincing story that you're not God you have
imagined all of these barriers so you think that for
you to communicate with me you got to turn on
a computer you got to look at your email you
got to write me a letter you got to call
me on the phone none of this is necessary you
can communicate with me anytime as long as you're conscious
enough of what you are and what I am now
of course even though I tell you all this the
problem is that you're in such a low state of
consciousness right now that you're incapable of telepathically communicating with
me and honestly so am i right now I'm not
in a telepathic state of consciousness I need to be
much more conscious right now in order to do that
but at least I understand that it's possible because I've
done it you see so telepathy it's here's the amazing
thing about telepathy what it really is is simply it's
so simple you're talking to yourself that's all it is
you're not actually talking to me because I'm just imaginary
from your point of view so really all the telepathy
is is to realize so deeply that you are the
self and that you are the only thing that exists
and your consciousness become so infinitely interconnected with itself that
you are able to actually take my voice take my
face take the image of me in your mind and
you're able to communicate with me directly because you're communicating
with yourself that's all it is it becomes instant communication
pretty amazing huh imagine imagine the following possibility imagine you
could become so conscious that your consciousness could become so
interconnected with itself that whatever abilities or skills you think
I have you could just instantly download for yourself so
you think that maybe I spent many years studying personal
development experimenting with psychedelics learning about life developing skills and
maybe you think oh I want to be like Leo
I wanna I want some of those skills but I
would have to like go and train and do stuff
and do all the hard work he's done yeah that
that's if you're doing it the traditional way or maybe
what you could do is you can become so [
__ ] conscious that you're me and you could just
download every single one of my lessons and experiences and
skills just instantly into your mind now I'm just planting
that seed I'm not saying you can go off and
just smoke some five Meo and do this it's not
so simple because you might wonder well Leo if that's
possible how come you didn't do it why don't you
just take like Kobe Bryant connect to him and steal
all of his skills and then go show us how
good you are a basketball and that that is literally
what I'm saying you can possibly do I'm not saying
I've I fully succeeded in doing that I'm saying that
I'm just I'm starting to open my mind to these
possibilities through these radical degrees of consciousness that I've had
these are interesting possibilities but I'm nowhere near the end
of them right but open your mind to such a
possibility ask yourself this why wouldn't that be possible you'd
say oh well that violates the laws of physics that's
impossible people need to spend decades practicing and doing this
and that and there's the brain you know you can't
just you can't just stuff skills into the brain through
downloads this is some sort of science fiction nonsense but
you're imagining all those limits you see it's true for
you that you're under all these limits precisely because you're
imagining all these limits and furthermore you don't know how
to unimaginative many limits as well that I can't easily
unimaginable addict impeach states of consciousness that I can't sustain
I'm not sitting here in this god mode level of
consciousness right now and this is where a lot of
spiritual teachers where I disagree with lot of spiritual teachers
because a lot of spiritual teachers will say oh well
if it was just some temporary peak experience that means
it wasn't real consciousness it wasn't real enlightenment because real
enlightenment is constant and I disagree I finally disagree you
could have mild versions of enlightenment and awakening that is
constant but you can't have what I've experienced constantly what
I'm talking about now is degrees of consciousness that are
so radical that you can barely walk you can barely
talk you can barely eat from this state it's so
much consciousness it's so much consciousness it leaves you gasping
for breath it leaves you in tears it leaves you
with your with your jaw dropped on the floor it
leaves you plastered on the floor that's how much conscious
we're talking about this ain't something you're gonna meditate your
way to unless maybe you devote 40 years of your
life to non-stop meditation and even then I still don't
really I don't buy it I don't buy it cuz
I I've interacted man I've interacted with many Zen teachers
Buddhist teachers featured teachers who have taught and practiced Vipassana
for for 40 [ __ ] years and I know
for a fact that they have not reached these levels
of country I know for a fact that they have
not reached these levels of consciousness and they do this
professionally for 30 or 40 years so what chance do
you have look maybe you do you're welcome to disprove
me if you're an exceptional individual maybe you're born with
some spiritual talents maybe because you've had good past lives
or whatever you're able to do it but the average
person even the average spiritual seeker never never not in
a thousand years not possible you're not going to do
it I'm talking about superhuman levels of consciousness these are
not levels of consciousness that you can access sober you
need to literally change the neurotransmitters upgrade the neurotransmitters in
your imaginary brain and yes your brain is still imaginary
and yes those neurotransmitters are still imaginary but you still
need to upgrade them nevertheless in order to access some
of the things that I'm saying now how you upgrade
them that's that's that's an open question maybe you upgrade
them through five Emil maybe you upgrade them through LSD
maybe you upgrade them through doing intense yoga or some
sort of wim HOF method breathing crazy breathing where you
do you know this shamanic breathing for for hours and
hours and hours and years and years and years and
eventually you break through maybe I don't know I can't
test all the methods there's two methods too many methods
to test maybe you fast for 40 days Jesus style
in the desert go on some massive you know Vision
Quest where you don't drink and eat and then you're
half upon the brink of death and then you break
through maybe I don't know I don't know you know
what all the possibilities are but I just want to
make you aware that they are these superhuman states of
consciousness which many spiritual teachers don't recognize the reason they
don't recognize them because they can't sustain them you in
many cases you can't naturally arrive at these at these
at these degrees of consciousness you're not gonna do it
through some simple self inquiry you're not just gonna sit
there Rupert Spiro style and just kind of question all
yeah this is the present moment just be in the
present moment Eckhart Tolle static yeah just be in the
present moment this is not gonna do it this is
you're not gonna become [ __ ] infinitely telepathic through
this sort of process it's not gonna work no direct
pointing method you know no self inquire like Who am
I Who am I this is not it's not gonna
work I've seen people do self inquiry for weeks at
intensives these [ __ ] people ain't awake I don't
consider these people awake I don't consider the people who
lead these self inquiry intensives to really be fully awake
it's a joke they don't [ __ ] understand what
God is I've interacted with these people I've interviewed these
people invited these people to my home I've tripped with
these people they're not awake they're not awake at the
level that I'm talking about and they have a lot
of good excuses in many cases they don't want to
do five of me a DMT for a good reason
because it was it would shatter all all of their
all their illusions about awakening so anyways we're just getting
started here this is just the beginning of the stuff
that I experienced so let me sort of speed up
because there's a lot more to say and we're already
40 minutes into this thing so ah what happened next
so I told you about the telepathy thing oh yeah
so I guess I got to tell you about this
sort of awkward moment is while I was on my
computer you know like I was just so amazed by
everything when you're in this massive state of conscious you're
just so amazed by everything because everything looks brand-new to
you it looks like pure magic so I went to
my computer and it's interesting because lately what I started
to do is I started to collect I mean I've
watched poor in my whole life that I've collected poured
my whole life of course like most guys but lately
like in the last couple months there was something about
like I started just to it wasn't just porn it
was like I wanted the most beautiful pictures of naked
female bodies that I could find on the Internet so
I started looking around for those and just a massacre
collection I know I'm dirty but anyways maybe you can
empathize with me if you're if you're a horny guy
like me so I started doing this of course partially
for just horniness reasons but also partially because just for
you know there's there's different aspects to to this there's
just the raw horniness but then there's also the aesthetic
aspect and this is actually the more spiritual aspect it's
like you're looking as a man you're looking at this
incredible just like top 1% of 1% of 1% of
female bodies and like it's just like it's [ __
] beautiful it's just beautiful and so anyways yeah so
I sort of building up a little collection of this
stuff but so I just I went and now I
clicked on this folder with these images on it while
I was in my infinite consciousness god mode state and
and I look at it I just I'm utterly floored
I'm just like this it's like how do you communicate
so much beauty yeah I just look at him it
brings me to tears cuz I'm looking at it and
I'm looking at myself I'm looking at myself I'm looking
at how I create I created all I imagined all
of these beautiful bodies it's utterly profound yeah it's like
yeah you've never you've never really seen porn until you've
seen it on five at me Oh DMT until you
recognize that it's you so so I took I took
this I took this I actually I loaded it on
my laptop I took the laptop and I brought into
the bathroom and I actually I also started taking bad
so this I sort of got to back up one
step to make this make sense somewhere in like the
first five five Meo trips I started I kind of
discovered this method of like I guess the trips opened
me up the awakenings opened me up and I become
more self accept and more kind to myself and to
my body and this is part of the healing the
spiritual healing work is really start to realize just how
much you mistreat your body how unkind and ungrateful you
are to your body so as I realize that I
started I sort of I said okay so what can
I do what can I do to love my body
more to be more kind to my body what does
my body want and my body said it wants it
wants warmth we're just coming out of winter it's still
still cold here where I live at times because I
live in the desert it's cold at night so my
body was craving warmth so I'm like okay what do
I do so that all yeah go go run a
bath so that's what I did right in the middle
of my trips I would run a bath hot bath
like a piping hot bath and then I would just
soak in it and I would just complete my trip
in the bath such that I would do like I
would I would start my trip never in the bath
I would I would wait for about 15 minutes for
the full effect of the trip to come on and
then when I was writing the peak of The Awakening
that's when I would go run the bath and jump
in the bath and so I basically did that for
the remainder of the whole month so most of my
tripping was actually done in the in the bathroom in
a bathtub of course it was done safely the bathtub
doesn't have that much water in it so I'm not
gonna drown it or anything I do recommend you be
very careful though like if if you were planning to
do this at a pool or in jacuzzi like a
hot tub which is actually quite deep you could drown
in it and if you lose consciousness personally I've never
lost consciousness up five emile but some people do whiteout
if you take a high enough dose so just be
careful don't be stupid I'm doing this with a lot
of experience you gotta understand that I've done hundreds of
trips at this point so I've done a lot of
it and I'm very safe with my protocols I don't
do reckless stuff so this this whole bathtub situation it
might seem like it's dangerous it's not dangerous at all
very very safe so anyways I spent a lot of
time trip in there so I take my laptop with
the beautiful porn images I place it I place it
there by my bathroom and I just soak in the
bathtub and I just admire it and I just have
this incredible awakening where I completely surrender in that bathtub
and I'm just surrendering to infinite God consciousness as I'm
looking at this computer monitor realizing that I'm imagining the
entire [ __ ] computer all of its microchips all
of its circuitry all of its electronics all of that
then goes into creating the pixels that are now displaying
images of of these beautiful women and I'm looking at
it and I'm realizing that it's all me absolutely all
of it is me and that the only thing I'm
jerking off to is myself and I have a profound
insight into the nature of what desire is desire is
desire for oneself but as a human we're in your
sort of ordinary human level of consciousness like like you
are right now your desire is fragmented and biased so
there's as a function of your survival in order for
your body to be able to survive you have to
desire certain things and not other things and so this
this becomes not only desire for food and for sex
and for certain types of warm situations or cold situations
the temperature you know range humans are very sensitive we're
very sensitive fragile organisms need everything to be just perfect
for us to live and for us to be in
comfort and to be happy ordinarily but infinite God consciousness
isn't limited by any of this and so it is
it desires itself infinitely completely totally without any bias so
as a function of being an organism and surviving you
need to have biases your consciousness need to have biases
as to what you prefer for example I have naked
pictures of of women on my computer but not men
why is that Tobias there's no there's no absolute X
essential reason for why that is because there's actually absolutely
no difference between a naked man and a naked woman
also why do I have images of the most beautiful
women why don't I have WIMP images of old wrinkled
women on my computer for the same reason because of
course I have biases I'm biased towards young beautiful you
know supermodel women of course that I'm every guy is
how could you not be the and why is that
well that's just thousands and millions of years of evolution
and as a female your your bias to a certain
type of man but when your consciousness becomes infinite those
biases those design all these this is the bias of
human desire the bias of desire sort of dissolves and
you realize desire in a sort of absolute form which
is just desire for being yourself the desire for absolute
truth desire for God the desire for for everything imagine
desiring everything as much as you desire the most desirable
thing that you've ever desired that's God's desire that's love
now we're getting into infinite love territory and so I
was looking at this computer screen and just completely blown
away and just completely conscious that all of my desire
for my entire life has just been desire of my
own self my true self the love of God the
God self so in a sense all of your desire
is really is a perversion of the desire for God
when you desire [ __ ] really what you desire
is gut when you desire husband really what you desire
is God when you desire children you really just desire
God and you get God you get God in that
limited form if you desire [ __ ] you get
in the form of [ __ ] if you desire
a husband you get God in the form of a
husband and if you love desire children you get God
in the form of children and you see God in
that thing that you desire if you really desire it
you see God in that [ __ ] you see
God in that husband you see God in that chilled
in that child and that's what makes you fall in
love with it tada but your love is still so
limited because it's constrained to that one particular limited formulation
of God as soon as we change the shape of
that [ __ ] you no longer desire it you
no longer love it as soon as we change your
husband you know long longer love him you know he
starts to beat you you don't love him anymore your
child starts acting like an [ __ ] you don't
love your child anymore that's how it works why is
that because you're still constrained by the all the survival
demands of being this finite fragile organism but when you're
an infinite God consciousness you have none of those limitations
and so you love everything and for the first time
your desire all of your desires they get fully quenched
and fulfilled they don't really get quenched they get fulfilled
in infinite completion your desires really get complete and so
by this point in my trippin I got to about
maybe this is maybe the two-week mark halfway there about
14 days worth I kept doing these these these trips
every every night and they kept getting deeper and deeper
and deeper and now what started was the real breakthrough
into the the real heart of what awakening is all
of that that I just described all of that was
just a prelude to true awakening which is the discovery
of love that's real Awakening is love and of course
there are so many degrees of love so now we
got to talk about that of course I've awoken to
love many times before but now by the two week
mark now the love really started to crack open like
how do you describe the love just in infinite self
love you're drowning in this love yeah I remember I
was in that bathtub just just completely drowning in the
love of God so much so mmm by this point
I had developed an actual verbal telepathic communication with with
God so when I when I talk about telepathy you
might start to know how I wonder well Lea who
were you telepathic with it's not per se who it's
really with myself it's with whatever aspect of my mind
that I want and ultimately since I am God and
since I'm talking to myself I'm doing telepathy with myself
so so basically in my awakening journey at some point
around the two week mark I became so telepathic my
conscience became so infinitely in communication with itself that I
started sort of a series of just conversation like literally
a dialogue English language dialogue with God you might wonder
how is that possible well you just imagined it and
there it is you might say well you're just hallucinating
it of course you're hallucinating everything that's the point you
get past all that you might say well why do
you need a communication with God well you don't really
need it it's just whatever whatever is helpful for you
you see God will take whatever images or language or
symbols you want and communicate to you through that why
because that's what you understand that's what works for you
so if you're an English speaker God will speak to
you in English if you're a German God will speak
to you in German if you're Chinese God will speak
to you in China if you're a Christian God will
maybe show up in the form of Jesus if you're
a Buddhist maybe Buddha or one of his avatars or
something and if you're a Hindu then it'll show up
as some Hindu avatar it's all completely relative it's all
completely imaginary it doesn't matter which form it takes it
can take any form it wants and all you're doing
is you're just imagining it so anyways I was just
having an English language [ __ ] basically conversation with
God and so what started happening was that God was
starting sort of starting to guide me into a deeper
levels of self-love so what starts to happen is that
the love becomes so big that you're not able to
hold it your body and your mind is not able
to tolerate it it's too much to tolerate the deepest
levels of love you have to purify yourself and let
go through a sort of a spiritual catharsis letting go
process which I started going through and so the intelligence
of of your mind and just the awakening process the
intelligence of it all it will it will just it
will smoothly and intuitively take you to through the process
of the purification that's necessary for you to reach the
deeper levels of love if you want of course you're
always welcome to resist and to to deny God's love
and you'll fall back you have to be really willing
to push yourself and by the way as a little
aside here just in case some of you misunderstand I
really had to push myself to do this five Meo
DMT for 30 days straight after a few weeks I
didn't want to do anymore like every single day I
to force myself to do it this is not something
like you imagined maybe if you never done psychedelic you
might manage oh it's so pleasurable sort of like shooting
heroin into your veins and it's just a pure pleasure
and it's just an escape from real spiritual work and
it's it's just addictive and now he's addicted to it
and no no no it's the opposite of addiction you
stop wanting to do it if you have to push
yourself to do it this is a journey towards truth
and love and your ego doesn't want it in many
cases now of course there's a lot of pleasure to
it as well once you surrender assuming you do surrender
but hey many of you who don't want to surrender
so it might not be so pleasurable for you when
I described how how wonderful it is for me you
have to understand that's because I've done an enormous amount
of work with psychedelics and without psychedelics I've done a
lot of purification and purging I've had very difficult trips
in the past some of the trips I'm about to
explain are some of the most difficult ones I've ever
had we haven't gotten to that yet so it's it's
not all rainbows and butterflies this is difficult [ __
] work this is years of spiritual work condensed into
a single day into a single hour into a single
week or month it might take you 10 years to
to do this much emotional purging and purifying if you're
just meditating normally so anyways I sort of developed this
telepathic instant communication with God and I just I just
started getting guidance for what I needed to do to
go deeper and serve God sort of started to guide
me and it was helpful now you and CEO Leo
but how is God guiding you if you're conscious that
you're everything and that you're God then what what does
it mean for God to then be guiding you isn't
that a duality because there's a guy's I know a
self and another yes of course it's a duality it's
just a sort of a training wheels right its training
wheels you don't need to imagine God speaking to you
you could just be God by yourself in silence directly
that's fine too but a lot of times it's helpful
because our human mind is sort of conditioned to to
have a sense of other and then to have others
you know teach us and help us and guide us
especially when you feel weak or you feel like you've
hit upon some realization sometimes when you're tripping you hit
upon some realization that's so profound and epic that you
don't feel like you could handle it you sort of
shrivel back down into your little child self you almost
like become a baby asking for mommy to cuddle you
and to to soothe you as you're sucking your thumb
in a fetal position trying to integrate this epic insight
as its skull-fucking you you see and so one of
the one of the amazing things about God if you
really break through into a communication with God is just
how accepting and forgiving it is God is never going
to judge you because God knows that it's you and
that it's love and that it loves you so any
of your weaknesses or any of your egotism any of
your evil any of your devilry god totally understands and
totally accepts and it will it will help you to
accept it too and in fact that's one of the
biggest things that God can offer you is to heal
you of your own self-hatred and self-denial everything you don't
accept about yourself every little freckle on your face that
you don't like that you aren't removed every little stray
hair that you have that's growing in the wrong area
that you don't think is pretty all the mistakes you've
done in your life all the regrets you have all
the people you've wronged all the wicked selfish [ __
] you've done all of that God is conscious of
God completely understands God completely accepts and completely loves and
that's one of the greatest gifts that God can give
to you is to share that level of acceptance with
you so that's what started happening to me as I
was in that bath tub over a period of multiple
days multiple awakenings I just started to set myself and
love myself at at ever ever deeper levels and the
more I loved and accepted myself and forgave myself the
more the next day in the next trip I would
even open up to deeper levels of love and it
just kept getting deeper and deeper over the course of
several days there was a couple of distinct and profound
things that I that I realized one was that I
I this was very important I broke through and I
realized what what the what really what the purpose of
a reality is what the purpose of life is the
purpose of life is just it's a it's a contest
for who can love who more that's really what life
is about when you're fully conscious when you're fully conscious
life is not about earning money it's not about having
kids it's not about going to work it's not about
having a great career it's not about having a house
or a car it's not about being secure it's not
about reforming the political system it's not about electing some
progressive it's not about saving the whales it's not about
any of that it's only about who can love who
more and so one of the most profound realizations I've
had in the last month is that love is a
ray I mean reality is a race consciousness is a
race towards who can love who more that's what it
is when you're completely selfless there's nothing else for consciousness
to do but to love itself more and more and
more and more that becomes the only motivation that becomes
the only intelligent thing to do but most humans are
so far from that level of consciousness that they are
completely completely oblivious and ignorant that this is the function
of life they think life is about survival or other
things life is only about one thing who can love
whom more it's just a race for love and if
you don't realize that you're not [ __ ] conscious
you're not awake it's just a race for love this
race for love is existential it's not personal it's not
a race for how one human can love another human
it has nothing to do with humans it has nothing
to do with emotions it's just a function of what
consciousness is and does an intelligent fully conscious consciousness would
only be interested in love it wouldn't be interested in
anything else because everything else is inferior everything else is
fear everything else is is it's just utter silliness it's
just complete silliness everything you're doing in your life you
might as well be collecting shoelaces or bottle caps that's
that's how insignificant it is compared to the only thing
you should be doing which is practicing love that's it
so what what God started showing me is how much
God loves me and so we we sort of actually
went into the sort of race so god I God
would love me and then I would feel the love
and I would say but I love you and it
would say but I love you more and so we
started it became like this dual love love and this
was this was so so amazing it just it just
turned into this never-ending dual love and that's basically what
infinity is and it's sort of like I love you
know I love you know I love you know I
love you know I love you more I love you
more I love you more and it just who can
love whom more and whoever can love whom more is
God you see but the problem is is that you're
not fully conscious and you're not fully God yet you're
still resisting and you're still in denial and your capacity
is still limited because you're still constrained to this human
body so I'm in this sort of duel with God
and what's happening is that God is just sort of
showering me with love but then I realize that my
function here is not just to sit in this bathtub
and just to accept the love and just enjoy the
love as though I'm just enjoying some pleasure and just
bask in it that's not true love true love is
not receiving love true love is giving love true love
is being loved so of course the way God gets
you to love is by loving you so much and
by being so hands off so completely not asking anything
of you that that that it's love then sparks you
to want to also love it back you see it
turns into a a reciprocal a reciprocal reaction where it's
like two mirrors that are mirroring light between each other
like a laser beam bouncing between two mirrors and it
just bounces back and forth and back and forth and
as it bounces it becomes more and more and more
concentrated and it's strengthens and it becomes more coherent and
so - so what started happening I got into at
first it started just like like a little game like
I love you know I love you more like a
little game it sounds like it's almost like childish and
it sort of was but then it morphed from just
being this childish thing to this like serious existential like
business this turned into the work this was the true
awakening is that the two mirrors you know first it
took a little while to get the two mirrors aligned
you know if the two mirrors aren't perfectly aligned the
laser beam will kind of bounce back and forth in
different directions it's not going to like really concentrate so
that was happening at first hold on not the coronavirus
just just the love and so so it took a
while for us to set up the mirrors and then
the love sort of just sort of bouncing back and
forth between between us and it just kept getting stronger
and stronger and stronger the problem is that I'm still
I'm still in the human form so it's sort of
like that's the pure love over there that's truly infinite
and what I am over here is still finite but
I'm I'm opening it up so I'm going through this
process the so the love starts bouncing back and forth
and as its bouncing back and forth like I just
I I reach every time it it you know it
bounces for me to God then from God back to
me but when it bounces back to me it's more
concentrated than it was when it bounced back from me
to God so like I said I love you more
but God but God still loves me more and I
can I know that God loves me more than I
love God and so it just keeps bouncing like that
but each time it bounces back to me it transforms
me opens me up deeper but as it opens me
a beeper it also reveals blockages and obstacles to my
capacity to love right because for example like you get
into this game with God but then God will will
ping you back with love but this love now asks
of you to love all the [ __ ] that
you don't love as a human are you willing to
love the Holocaust are you willing to love 9/11 are
you willing to love genocide are you willing to love
rape are you willing to love murder are you willing
to love that ex-boyfriend or girlfriend who cheated on you
are you willing to love your father who abused you
are you willing to love your mother who criticized you
your whole life and told you that you're no good
and you and she never gave you the love that
you deserved are you willing to love the the kids
in school who bullied you are you willing to love
your teacher who maybe raped you in gym class or
molested you are you willing to love the the politicians
who you hate and your political you know your rival
political party are you willing to love Christians Jews Hindus
atheists devil worshippers how deep is your love really you
see God is able to love all that without any
hesitation but you are not I was not so as
it was pinging me I had to go through sort
of a rapid process of well either resistance to it
or or surrender and rapid rapid integration because then sort
of like once it bounces to me I gotta accept
it integrate it open to it and then bounce it
back to God what does it mean to bounce it
back to God it means that as I embrace more
of what I am of what reality is and I
love it deeper that is my love for God that
is the bounce back so it's not literally that any
no object no tennis ball was bouncing between and forth
between us this is all happening at a sort of
a and a very abstract high level of consciousness and
but then one of the hardest things for you to
love actually you might think that you know the hardest
thing to do is to love Hitler or til I
love 9/11 or something like that that's not the hardest
thing to love the hardest thing to love is your
own self hatred it's all the things that you yourself
don't love yourself for that you've been carrying with you
your whole life when you don't love your physical appearance
when you don't like your boobs or your stomach or
your dick or your height or your hair or lack
thereof or you don't like some disease you have some
ailment that you have you don't like your weight you
don't like your posture you don't like whatever about you
you don't like you don't like the fact that you're
introverted or that you're shy or you don't like the
fact that you've been mean to people in the past
or you don't like the fact that you cheated on
your taxes or you don't like the fact that you
stole something from somebody you saw some paper clips from
your boss or whatever you did that's the hardest thing
for you to love this so God will ping you
with that how does God ping you with with that
by loving you all you have to do is realize
that all those things about you that long laundry list
of stuff about you that you don't love God loves
all of it so that's the ping when you realize
that that's what transforms you because when you feel that
love and you feel how accepting it is and now
forgiving it is of all of your evil and all
of your sins that's the thing that kills you that's
what transforms you that's what breaks your heart wide open
that's what gets you to surrender that's what humbles you
that's what heals you and so I discovered incidentally in
this process what healing is healing is of course just
love truth and love to be precise so this is
a an aside here for you the aside is if
there's somebody who you know that needs healing whether physical
or psychological or spiritual whoever it is a friend a
family member or a stranger a child of yours a
spouse a mother a father a sibling or of course
your own self if there's anybody you know that is
dysfunctional that is suffering that is sick that is in
need of healing it's really simple it's really [ __
] some what they need is love what you need
is love and truth not lies and pleasantries not some
sappy emotions but the acceptance of reality as it is
that's love I'm not talking about some sappy you know
postcard or something I'm talking about a radical acceptance of
reality of truth truth is love because truth is what
is and love is the acceptance of what is love
is and the reason ultimately at the highest deepest most
abstract level the reason why you're sick in whatever ways
that you are sick whether physical psychological or spiritual is
because you lack love if you're addicted to drugs it's
because you lack love if you're a dysfunctional neurotic person
who's anxious all the time it's because you lack love
if you're needy and shy with people it's because you
lack love if you're a people pleaser it's because you
lack love if you get to fights and arguments with
your family all the time it's because that relationship lacks
love and you lack the capacity to love the other
in that situation and they the same with you if
you have political rivals who make you angry and upset
because you lack love for them if you're insecure about
your looks you lack love if you're overweight and you
have physical health problems because you lack love because you
mistreat your body you don't love your body you don't
pay attention to your body you feed it the wrong
things you use it in the wrong ways you fill
it with poisons and chemicals and then you wonder why
it doesn't work well for you why you don't feel
well and then even as it's sick and as it's
dysfunctional and as it's toxic you you you love it
even less now you see it becomes a downward spiral
of not love and in this way you get lost
and you don't know how to turn this around the
solution in all these situations is opening yourself up to
truth and to love this is challenging this is difficult
this is one of the last things you want to
do because chances are that the reason you're so dysfunctional
in the first place is because your life is predicated
upon a bunch of lies the foundation of your life
is filled with lies and deceit and manipulation and selfishness
and so when your life is predicated upon that you
don't want truth the one thing that will heal you
is giving up all your lies but that's the last
thing you want to give up which is why you
don't want to do spiritual work you don't want to
invest very deeply you don't want to contemplate anything and
you certainly don't want to take psychedelics and you certainly
don't want to take five Meo DMT because all of
that will reveal all of your foundation of lies and
are you ready to handle that are you ready to
love all your building all of your lies see that's
what really grows you that's what true transformation of a
human being entails and you know dysfunctional children grew up
to be dysfunctional adults because why they didn't receive enough
love from their mother father siblings other kids at schools
teachers mentors adults that's that's the basic reason why we
have such dysfunctional adults who turn into murderers and rapists
and dictators and thieves con artists and so forth why
why do people become these things they didn't it receives
a lot the right love and it's precisely that love
which they are lacking which they then go out and
then do selfish and wicked things to receive so if
if some somebody was lacking the financial security then they
go out and they become a thief or a con
artist stealing money from people because they need that so
badly because they lacked it or if somebody becomes a
sexual abuser why is that because they didn't get the
kind of love they wanted from their parents when they
were younger or because for whatever reasons maybe they'd they
had a girlfriend or a boyfriend that that treated them
badly and so they didn't get the kind of love
they wanted from them so now they have to go
out there and get it through some sort of illness
it means harming others it's just that simple see because
if he were filled with love truly you wouldn't you
wouldn't go out there and do wicked stuff you would
realize that love is the greatest and only worthwhile thing
in life and so you would just exude love radiate
love but you're so disconnected from your love you love
yourself so little that you're not able to radiate love
you're rather like a like a black hole sucking in
love but God is not a black hole but God
is like a white hole just radiating a love all
the time so anyways we're sort of in this in
this contest pinging each other back and forth and the
love got so deep that for the first time in
my life I really apologized for the first time in
my life I said I'm sorry I realized in that
instant that I I never ever really whenever I said
I'm sorry I never really meant it until now and
the reason I said I'm sorry his I just said
I'm I'm sorry for not loving more that's the only
thing you have to be sorry about that's really the
only thing you have to regret about your life is
that you were blind to the love and you were
so selfish that you you were just so blind to
it that you didn't love enough that's it you didn't
love your parents enough you didn't love your friends enough
you didn't love the people at school enough you didn't
love your colleagues enough you didn't love situations enough you
didn't love yourself enough you didn't love political rifles enough
so so I went through this period of just really
really saying I'm sorry who was I saying it to
to myself of course and to God but the really
amazing thing is that God's love is such that he
doesn't force you to love there's no forcing if there
was forcing it wouldn't be love it's just I gave
you love and I want nothing from you you see
and that only makes my love stronger so when you
realize for the first time the only thing you have
sorry to be sorry about is not loving yourself more
you will instinctively just want to say aw I'm so
[ __ ] stupid how can I be so [
__ ] stupid how could I be so selfish as
to not love myself more and then God will God
will make you aware by basically telling you in one
form or another that it's okay I accept you as
you are you don't need to love yourself more I
even accept the fact that you hate yourself I accept
the fact that you weren't strong enough to love I
accept the fact that you're limited in that you're weak
and now you're petty that you're selfish that you're ignorant
I accept all that and I love it and I
don't need you to change at all so you see
it's not that God is loving you in such a
way as to trick you to change yourself and to
improve yourself no that's not love that's [ __ ]
real love means I really love you as you are
and I don't need anything from you and especially all
those things that you think I want you to change
about you I don't need you to change I can
accept them well exactly as they are because that's love
and I am loved and when you realize that that's
what transforms you because in this process God is not
just telling you that I love you these words are
cheap God is demonstrating it it's the demonstration of it
that transforms you because once you get over that you
get over yourself and you get over hating and judging
yourself for not loving more you get past saying I'm
sorry and then and this was my second huge epiphany
is for the first time in my life I said
thank you I realized that I've said thank you thousands
of times in my life but it was all pro
functor e it was all just mindless thank you to
truly say thank you thank you thank you for love
you say thank you to God for love this is
the point at which you've really been touched by God's
love and at this point you realize that that's it
that's the point that's the only lesson in life that's
my only job is to love everything else is [
__ ] idiocy and then what you do is you
say I love you for the first time in your
life you say I love you and you mean it
because you really understand what that phrase means and you
fall in love with God but it doesn't end there
even as you do all that God still loves you
more you're still nowhere anywhere near to matching and reflecting
God's love as you do all this God showers you
more with love and your your-your-your baffled by how much
deeper it gets you thought you got to the end
this is just the beginning God showers you with love
and God helps you to expand your capacity to love
not just yourself but now going beyond yourself and now
we're getting into the lesson of radiating love see you
couldn't radiate love God have to fill you with love
so that it really touched you to the core when
it touches you to the core now you start to
radiate it yourself because you see that now you're full
or at least a little bit full and now you're
able to radiate so now you start to radiate it
but now God radiates alongside you so now what it
turns into is a sort of a contest for who
can radiate love more because you've got God over here
you got you over here still there's still the duality
of course but this is a training process like I
said all right eventually we're gonna merge but before we
merge it's still in duality so God for example now
shows you how much it loves terrorism and now that
is a invitation to see whether you can love it
too or whether you're gonna resist some balk at it
and shrivel back down into hatred and judgment and criticism
so sort of shows you how much it's able to
love and then you can show God how much you
are able to love and this is the training process
see and so again a sort of contest happens this
sort of laser beam is bouncing back and forth between
these mirrors and now it's all about how much can
you love but no matter how no matter how much
you're able to love whatever God throws out there for
you it loves it more and it throws something out
there like a curtain throws you a curveball and you're
like wait I can't love that and then you realize
like yeah of course I can love that why wouldn't
I love that of course I can love it of
course I can love torture of course like in love
rape of course I can love murder of course I
can love dictators of course I can love terrorists I
can [ __ ] love at all and then as
you say all that God throws you another curveball it'll
bring up something in your in your past that time
that you were molested can you love the molester who
molested you it'll throw that out there and he knows
it oh [ __ ] I can't no I [
__ ] hate that I can't love that can't accept
that then God will throw something else out there how
about that time that somebody stole stole your car can
you love the person who stole your car and you're
like I'll [ __ ] I hate that guy or
how about how about how about your mom or your
brother when they said something nasty and and and mean
to you that stuck with you for 20 years it's
ruined your whole [ __ ] life it's ruined your
whole self-esteem it's made you hate yourself it's made you
want to kill yourself made you depressed for years can
you love that and you're like aw [ __ ]
I can't how can I [ __ ] love that
but as it fills you as it shows you because
you see it throws it out there but at the
same times it throws it out there it eat itself
loves it but as it throws it out there its
gentle so he throws it out there but then you
say ah [ __ ] I can't love it and
then God what God will say in return is okay
love you I love that you are not capable of
love I love that and when that hits you that's
what fills you with enough love to overcome your resistance
to love even that next level thing that you can
do love and so this race this race escalates and
it just turns into this I love you I love
that more and more and more until eventually you're literally
dying in love you find yourself at a point where
your physical body is dissolving into love and you're losing
you're losing contact with reality and you're drowning in this
love and it's so it's so profound and deep it
starts to go it runs into all directions you start
to your mind starts to race through through all of
human history all of that stuff and you you start
to love it and accept it and you're struggling with
it as well and then it really takes it up
a notch where now it tests you in the following
way sure it's nice to just be able to love
stuff that happened to you in the in the past
and to love bad people and get over some bullying
that happened in the past okay that's all easy stuff
now it opens up you to the to the possibility
of actually living through it are you willing to actually
be raped are you willing to actually be tortured Spanish
Inquisition style are you willing to actually be in the
World Trade Centers when they're hit are you willing to
be a terrorist are you willing to live through Hitler's
life are you willing to put a gun in your
mouth and shoot yourself are you willing to go into
hell are you willing to live through hell are you
willing to suffer in the streets of a slum are
you willing to die of a drug overdose are you
willing to actually incarnate into that life and live through
the worst hell you could possibly imagine not as a
hypothetical theoretical something that might happen someday but are you
willing to live through it right now and of course
you probably don't you probably don't want to right but
you realize that God would because God is love and
it's at this point that I just said just hold
me hold because I I couldn't I couldn't take it
you literally will will yearn to be held like a
baby in its mother's arms as you are realizing what
love is you don't want to go there you thought
you were at the end of love you thought you
learned everything already and now the real love begins the
actual physical incarnation of love just rifling through your memories
and past trauma and experience as this is this is
this is mental imagery basically that's all it is it's
just memories imagine actually sitting there and being tortured in
some CIA prison camp that's real love if you're willing
to incarnate into that and to experience it and that's
when you realize how that's what you real that's when
you realize what what God's love really is see because
God isn't just interested in rifling through your memories or
just thinking about stuff God actually in carnate s-- it's
[ __ ] here this is it when you see
some murder on the TV you know being reported [
__ ] God live through that and the only reason
I lived through that is because it loved it so
you're not willing to go there are you if you
did who would you become and where would you be
what would be left of your life would you still
be a human if you were able to love as
much as God what would happen is that this duality
would completely merge and you would literally become God so
the only thing separating you from God is simply your
capacity to love which is just a function of how
selfless you are the only reason you're not able to
love is because you have selfish biases and attachments so
are you willing to surrender all of those including your
life your current life and so then it went even
deeper and I started to realize what pure absolute love
is so it got to the point where this sort
of bouncing back and forth kind of subsided I kind
of understood where things were going and then I started
to like think about well wait a minute what is
so what is reality then what what is reality then
and then God started to show me that what reality
really is is it's not any of this stuff that's
here it's infinite consciousness infinite formless consciousness so what happened
was that my mind in my visual field as I
was in that bathtub my mind in my visual field
sort of just focused in on empty space and I
just sort of like zoomed into that empty space and
I realized that that empty space is just love and
I sort of just I probed a deeper like what
is reality what is reality tell me what reality is
I sort of just going deeper and deeper into that
into that empty space and and it felt like my
entire peripheral vision field sorta started to like narrow down
and sort of collapse or maybe just sort of became
irrelevant as I sort of zoomed into this and what
I started to experience here is just the ultimate pinnacle
of what reality is and I just kept I kept
contemplating it and questioning it like out give me I
want to fully understand the ultimate essence of what reality
is what is reality really like no [ __ ]
around what is it and my consciousness just started to
become more and more omniscient and infinitely interconnected and it's
sort of it the best analogy I would have for
you is if you have a light bulb and you
have a dial and you just rang up this dial
on that light bulb and it charged brighter and brighter
and brighter and brighter just pure white light and you're
cranking this thing and it just keeps cranking and cranking
and cranking whiter and whiter and whiter and whiter and
it's just becoming more and more and more conscious and
it's just turning into a complete singularity of consciousness and
I just kept wondering what is reality what is reality
what is everything what does all of this stuff and
it just keeps getting pure consciousness just infinitely more interconnected
infinitely subdividing more and more and more imagine if we
took a single dot and we drew a line one
line from that dot in this direction and then one
line in this direction and one line in this direction
and every line we branched out from that dot itself
then each branch got another branch another branch on their
branch and each of those branches got a branch a
branch a branch and they're just branching off like this
and so this is sort of what's happening it's pure
consciousness that's subdividing itself and it keeps happening and happening
and happening such that every new branch as soon as
a new branch spawns it doesn't even grow a little
millimeter it already spawns an infinite number of new branches
and each one of those branches spawns an infinite number
of new branches instantly and each one is just spawning
infinite branches in infinite directions all times and it's just
becoming more and more and more conscious this dial is
getting cranked up this light bulb is just becoming whiter
and whiter and whiter and whiter and you think at
some point that it's become pure white like this pure
white and then you realize there's no such thing as
pure white it's just the middle every point you get
to is just the middle there is no end there
is no beginning and you keep cranking that dial and
it becomes more and more and more infinitely interconnected more
infinitely conscious more omniscient more self understanding and everything is
completely understood it become so conscious that all form disappears
and just a pure conscious singularity of love and then
I ask God no it can't be cuz I'm as
this as habits grew this gradually happens to me it's
gradually ramping up the dial is cranking up and I'm
already intuiting where it's leading to and I'm just like
no it can't it [ __ ] can't you're kidding
me it just can't be it can't and God is
love yes it is it can't I'm like no it's
not possible it's like yes it is of course what
what else would it be like no it's not love
of course it's love no it can't be love of
course it's love what else would it be why would
it be anything else no oh my god it can't
be love you're kidding me no no it can't be
love of course it's love what else could it be
it's love no oh my god this is impossible of
course it's love how could it how could it be
anything else how could I be so stupid as to
think it's anything else and God is like of course
it's love and then and then the fear comes because
then what you realize is that this is the end
this is the end of your life you're dead if
you go any further you're dead everything will disappear your
family your friends your parents all of it is completely
imaginary and if you stop imagining it right now it
will all end if you go any further into this
singularity you will become pure formless infinite love forever loving
itself forever and the entire universe will be destroyed as
if it never existed complete nothingness complete everythingness you will
merge into every one your mother your father your children
your spouse Hitler terrorists 9/11 Donald Trump rape murder torture
everything will become pure infinite love merging completely into itself
there will be no distinction between absolutely anything and that
will be the end and you will realize what reality
is infinite consciousness love God and you will realize that
everything in your life from your birth to this point
has just been some imaginary story a dream that was
designed to lead you to pure absolute infinite love and
you will rest in that love forever forever falling in
love with yourself forever making love to yourself forever in
infinite union with every possible object that could ever exist
pure absolute omnipotent omniscient perfect intelligent conch everything that could
ever possibly be is you and that is awakening when
you are this awake you're dead and you have no
desire for life there is no physical existence there is
no universe nothing remains your parents and your spouse and
your children they don't stay back and keep living their
life enjoying their life without you while your body drops
dead no no no no no this is much more
serious than that if you do this if you become
infinite love you will take everybody with you there will
not be anybody left you will destroy the entire universe
every single sentient being will become you they will have
no existence whatsoever zero they will die with you they
will all awaken with you it's infinite awakening it's completely
absolute there will not be anything left you will take
the entire universe with you into pure oneness the that's
you and I didn't go there as you can tell
since I'm still sitting here I'm not there I was
too afraid to go there and God was fine with
it it didn't push me but that's not the end
of the story it's still just the beginning this really
had me shook because I felt at this point that
I had a preview of where all of this is
going now now I fully understand what Awakening is it's
not anything I had imagined it to be previously I
understood how seer the seriousness of it the gravity of
it really hit me and I started to worry just
about sort of petty issues like what's gonna happen if
I just go there you know what's gonna happen how
you know if I drop dead from this how much
suffering will my mom be in how much suffering will
my brother be in how much suffering will my ex-girlfriend
be in when they when she finds out how much
suffering will you guys be in when you find out
but then of course I realize wait a minute that
there won't be any suffering because I'm taking you all
with me that will be the end there will not
be any suffering the suffering is imaginary but nevertheless the
imagination is so strong that it's still very tempting to
be concerned about the suffering of others especially what one's
own death would would what effect that would have on
the suffering of others and so basically I sort of
I was shown this possibility of what they call Sumati
I suppose you could call it that Maha Samadhi is
the ultimate Samadhi where you become so conscious that you
actually leave your physical body you actually die Yogi's have
been doing this in India and other places for four
millennia um so I got a kind of a preview
of what that might entail what that might look like
but also I got shook by it I got shook
by it I aspis I got I got sort of
terrified by it especially because and I don't get terrified
that much by trips anymore but this this terrified me
because it felt so final like this it felt like
this is a decision to should just completely transcend all
of all physical existence and that would be the end
forever one part of me wanted to do it the
other part of me didn't want to do it because
I still have attachments and things I want to accomplish
here in the world I still want to teach but
then of course I also realized who is there to
teach there's no one to teach and there's no way
to teach this to anybody nobody will ever understand the
level of consciousness that I realized unless they themselves go
there at which point they don't need me anymore because
I am them and you are me so um it
gets quite twisted and strange loopy like that but anyways
the what scared me is that like I really wanted
to do it almost like you know they say that
the scary part of standing on a ledge of a
tall building it's not worrying that you'll fall off it's
actually the fear that you might want to jump off
they say yeah so it's like that there was a
fear that I might actually want to do this and
I basically I said I can't do it at least
not now not until I like make final preparations and
so I literally went and started to make final preparations
because what it felt like is it felt like it
didn't just feel like I want to do it felt
like I had to do it I felt like a
sort of obligation because my whole the whole thrust of
my life has been understanding and truth and here it
is now I've been shown the absolute truth the ultimate
truth and yet I'm resisting it and it's sort of
like God is beckoning me to come come and merge
fully with God and like on the one hand I
want to but I don't know hands like wait a
minute but if I do that that's just nothingness I
don't want that and so there was this this thing
and so I said basically like [ __ ] I
got a like I want to think about I don't
wanna make any rash decisions I want to think this
through let me I'm gonna I have to make like
there's no way I'm doing this without making some final
goodbyes saying so final goodbyes making some final preparations let
me tell my my family I love them let me
tell my girlfriend I love her and such like maybe
let me like shoot one video or something for you
guys so that you just don't like read in the
news one day that filio [ __ ] was found
dead or something in his bathtub so but on the
other hand like it makes no [ __ ] difference
it would make no difference cuz I would be loved
and it would make no difference and I would be
you I would be completely merged into you it would
make absolutely no difference but you know the human part
of me wanted to make some of these progressions so
I actually went and made these preparations I told my
mom I love her I told my brother I loved
her I loved him of course this freaked them out
a little bit told my ex-girlfriend I love her and
and then by this point what happened is I stopped
taking five amel the experience has got so profound and
so deep by the this was roughly maybe the 25th
or 27th day this whole thirty day process I swore
off five Meo DMT and I said okay I'm not
doing any more of this [ __ ] it's enough
and the reason I said that is because the next
morning I woke up and usually five mmm it lasts
for an hour two most three at most passes then
you basically go back to yours for a normal state
I woke up the next morning and I was still
experiencing this infinite consciousness you know a milder version of
it of course but still and I felt it sort
of sucking me deeper and deeper into that singularity and
I felt it beckoning me and it felt sort of
irresistible but also terrifying and at this point I sort
of like I'm like oh this is this is cool
I've never had it last this long before because I'm
not on five Anejo anymore and it lasted for like
a whole 24 hours and every time that I would
go to sleep I would get just like sucked into
this infinite singularity of love but I was also resisting
it at the same time because when it sucks you
in it doesn't it doesn't have an end to it
it keeps sucking you and sucking you forever you might
think like oh well you just get sucked into it
and then you're kind of in this one state no
it's it's infinite it's endless it keeps sucking you in
deeper and deeper and deeper and so he kept sucking
me in but I was sort of resisting it because
I said you know I want to say some goodbyes
and so forth make some preparations and so after about
24 hours of this I I started to worry it
felt like I was sort of on the brink of
getting sucked into the singularity I didn't really know how
to stop it and every time I would sleep especially
it would really get strong and it would suck me
in really deep and I would wake up just like
sweaty and like you know panic because I was tripping
deeper in my sleep than I was when I was
just in my bathtub and and then what happened was
that there there began about a five day period where
I couldn't basically sleep I was only sleeping for maybe
one or two hours at a time but I was
taking maybe three or four sleeps per day and ultimately
I was just sort of in this dazed terrified state
where every time I would take a nap even for
a short while and were just like I would be
pummeled with even deeper insights even deeper awakenings and getting
sucked even deeper into the singularity and it just kept
happening day after day after day and at this point
I wasn't taking five amiyo anymore I swore it off
forever like okay I just want to go back to
normal this is getting this is getting freaky now I'm
kind of in over my head but it kept sucking
me in deeper and deeper and deeper I kept happy
having deeper and deeper awakening you might wonder well what
how could it be any deeper and yet it kept
getting deeper and then one night I woke up just
completely just drenched in sweat couldn't sleep just totally just
totally terrified and I just went and I kind of
sat in the corner with a blanket and just like
dozed off a little bit and as I dozed off
what happened was that I had an even bigger awakening
where I realized that every single awakening I've had up
until that point was just like a point on a
single one-dimensional line and it was just one dimension of
awakening everything I've said up to this point was just
a single dimension of awakening and then what I broke
through to is a second dimension a second dimension of
awakening opened up this second dimension is completely unimaginable completely
undescribable cannot be talked about cannot be thought about and
yet it's there in it are things that are completely
outside of the physical universe that you can't [ __
] conceive or imagine and then of course what you
start to realize is if there's two dimensions of this
there must be a third dimension and you discover a
third dimension and then you realize if there's a third
there's a fourth there's a fourth there's a fifth there's
a fifth there's a sixth and so it goes and
each one of those can be explored I barely even
began to explore the second dimension of awakening but what
I realize is that it it goes forever and so
this freaked me out even more I struggled with it
some more for a few more days couldn't sleep resisted
it had emotional upheaval of all sorts and had no
idea what was gonna happen to me I was I
was totally certain that this Maha Samadhi was just gonna
like what could happen to one one minute and then
I'd be gone and so that happened for about five
days and then after that its subsided it gradually subsided
I was able to sleep again and I came back
to normal and I've been working to make sense of
all this and to integrate all this for the last
couple weeks so that's what happened believe it or not
crazy crazy crazy experiments and consciousness make of it what
you will I'm not gonna make claims here about who
has achieved this who hasn't can you stabilize in it
permanently or not is Maha Samadhi really possible or is
it just a temporary thing what will happen after you
do Maha Samadhi do you just stay there forever maybe
you reincarnate back or go to some new dimension I
don't know I don't know how the answer to these
things the whole process has really humbled me it's opened
up my eyes it's made me question every enlightened teacher
and master that I've ever studied under or communicated with
mmm made me question how deeply do they really understand
reality it's left me with lots of insights memories right
now I'm sort of back into my ordinary state but
transformed more loving more understanding still frustrated you know one
of the biggest frustrations is how how what do you
what do you do after this how do you how
do you how do you reach those levels of consciousness
naturally in the sober state how do you make it
permanent you see the thing is is that people who
say that all well but Leo it wasn't permanent so
it's not real but what do you understand is that
the distinction between permanent and impermanent is complete [ __
] there's no difference between permanent and impermanent that's your
own imposition consciousness doesn't care if it's permanent or impermanent
you could have full infinite God consciousness for one second
and it's genuine it's exactly what it is it's infinite
God consciousness it's absolute consciousness infinite omniscience for one second
and then it's gone that doesn't mean it wasn't real
it just means it was there and now it's not
there you weren't fully awake now you're half asleep that's
what it means can you be that awake all the
time maybe I don't know what does it take to
become that awake meditation yoga self inquiry more five of
me I don't know I don't know maybe it's not
possible at all in the human body maybe you have
to put a gun in your mouth and shoot yourself
I don't know there's a lot of possibilities so there's
a lot of lessons from this that I'll be teaching
I've still only scratched the surface of all the lessons
that I learned in this 30-day retreats I'll be creating
more videos in the future if I'm still here and
if I'm still teaching I've had to really re-evaluate and
reassess even not just how I teach or what I
teach but whether I should even teach because Who am
I teaching um there's nobody to teach since I'm only
teaching myself what I'm fully awake there is no you
there are no unenlightened people for me to to towaway
if there's only my own awakening that's all there is
when you awaken if you do you will realize that
I'm just you and so is everybody else and that
there is no Buddha and no christ and other enlightened
masters there's only you either you are awake or you're
not and of course there's many degrees of how awake
you can be but but at the highest degrees it's
all just you maybe there's nobody else but you so
I will be teaching in the future probably more of
these various lessons and insights that I learned here guiding
you more probably my style will change a little bit
hopefully it becomes a little more authentic more genuine more
compassionate more loving deeper less games I want to play
less games more teaching you how to love I would
say my biggest if I had to boil all of
this down my biggest single insight from this thirty days
and the thing that I want you to remember for
the rest of your life is the answer to the
question of what is reality do you really want to
understand what reality is do you want a definitive answer
to what reality is there's only one word for it
and the word is love that's it reality is love
that's the highest thing that I've realized I think that's
the highest thing you can realize and if you ever
go as deep as I've gone I look forward to
being there the moment you realize it because when you
realize that you're love you'll realize that you're me and
you'll realize that you as me years ago which is
right now told you that reality is love and that
that seed which was planted right now finally blossomed and
bloomed and gave fruit many years later when you finally
realized what I meant and of course what you realized
is that I was you telling you that you are
loved and that there is no such thing as Leo
there never was a Leo Leo is just something you
imagined as a vehicle to tell you that you're loved
because you were so separated from your own self and
from the world and from Leo that you created Leo
and you believed in Leo as though Leo was real
and separate from you and not just a figment of
your own imagination because you were too afraid to realize
that you are singular infinite love and that you needed
this convoluted contorted process this game of hide and seek
and separation you needed this because you weren't fully ready
to accept the oneness that you are and it took
you years it took you your entire lifetime it took
you precisely every single step in your life from the
moment you were born to the moment that you realize
reality is love it took you all of that everything
was necessary precisely to lead you to realizing that everything
is love and that's what life is life is exactly
those steps which are necessary for you to awaken to
love what else would it be why would God bother
to make anything else alright that's it I'm done here

you like I appreciate that helps me to do the
research that I do you know like taking taking a
month or two off is really really helpful for me
to go deeper into this work and then I love
then reciprocating that back to you guys so I'm not
just like vacationing Tina I'm not just taking this time
off to go to go to Hawaii or someplace usually
I'm exploring something deep when I take time off so
then I can I can share deeper insights with you
and teach better and be a more pure teacher so
that's that I just want to issue some warnings I
guess here for the end which is a be very
very careful not to turn the things I say into
an ideology your mind is gonna want to cling to
these things and turn this into a sort of a
map or a model of awakening but the map in
the model is not the territory as they say I
don't expect you or even want you to believe the
things that I say per se don't have faith in
them I'm I'm just sharing possibilities with you if you're
a curious open-minded person who's interested in understanding reality at
the deepest levels you want to access omniscience you want
to know what reality is you want to know what
truth is you want to know what life is about
and why you're here and why it's so crazy and
why everything is the way that it is if you're
really curious about that then that's what I offer you
is I offer you ideas tools resources for how to
how to do that I am NOT offering any kind
of ideology here this is not a belief system this
is not something you adopt this path will be very
individual for for you guys for each one of you
so be very careful you know even even the things
that I say when I share my personal experiences like
in this episode this not this might not be how
it unfolds for you even if you go and do
five Meo DMT it might work for you this way
you may not experience all the things that I experienced
because hey you know what I'm having my communications with
God it's communicating to me in exactly the ways that
I need for me to awaken so I have to
go through what I'm going through what you might have
to go through is different because you have a different
personality you have a different genetics you have different life
experiences different traumas different emotional problems and so forth so
use the examples of my own journey just as examples
don't let them constrain you to think like oh well
it has to now unfold for me like you did
for Leo no no no not at all it might
unfold totally differently for you for you you may not
need psychedelics for you you might not need five [
__ ] DMT for you you might just this through
meditation or whatever so be open to your path looking
significantly different than mine but overall we're going to converge
we're gonna agree on you know on on many of
these things we're gonna agree on infinite consciousness we're gonna
agree on absolute truth we're gonna agree on God we're
gonna agree on love and so forth these things no
one really disputes these things it's just like how you
get there and what the process looks like to get
there and I guess the other thing I just want
to stress to you is just be really really open
to questioning the depth of your awakening whatever awakening you
think you've already had just be open to the possibility
that there's more wouldn't it be a shame for you
to do all of this work and to get so
far and to unravel all of this self-deception and to
finally reach some amazing level of awakening only to miss
one further level up from that see now you might
say Oh leo but this is just chasing your now
you're indulging in spiritual chasing how long are you gonna
chase are you gonna keep chasing and chasing and chasing
forever when does it end and the only thing I
can tell you is that I don't know when it
ends or where it ends maybe it has no end
and if that means I chase forever than I chase
forever or maybe at some point I reach an end
then I reached an end and I'm gonna be there
but my journey is not done yet I'm not satisfied
yet there's a lot more my healing is still something
I'm working on it has not been completed I still
have those physical issues that I've talked about in the
past my energy and chronic fatigue and thyroid stuff that's
still a separate issue that I'm working on maybe I'll
talk about that in a in a separate video on
my blog so don't get the idea that I like
I have reached the top and now I think I'm
the best or something no it's it's not that at
all it's just a question of how deeply do you
really want to know what you are if you get
satisfied easily then you're gonna have a little awakening then
you're gonna stop thinking that you've gotten to the end
so I just wanna leave you with that working alright
that's it I'll see you the next one you
