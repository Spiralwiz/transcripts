Hey, what's up? This is Leo here for actualised.org. And
today I want to cover the topic of vacations, and
how sometimes taking a vacation is really the answer to
all of life's problems, vacations and also breaks because the
two are basically one in the same, just with different
durations. Now, I have a question for you. Are you
a high achiever? Do you consider yourself a high achiever?
And if so, how much time? Are you putting into
work? Let's say, are you putting in over 40 hours
a week? Are you putting in 50 hours? Are you
putting in 60 hours, maybe 80 hours? Well, what was
the last time you took a vacation from all that,
and just took a nice long break. Being a high
achiever, myself, or at least how I think of myself
as one, I've really found that being able to use
your time off in a strategic way, whether it's vacation
or break throughout the day, is really important to towards
getting maximum performance out of yourself. Because, well, frankly, if
you're working those 80 hours a week, you're not going
to be able to sustain that forever. And even if
you could, the performance that you're getting out of yourself,
is not what it could be if you reduce the
amount of hours and spent more of that time doing
stuff that rejuvenated your mind and your body. So that's
where vacations come into play. In fact, the reason I
came up with this topic is that the last few
weeks, I spent really hammering down on on this website.
So I was really doing a lot of work on
actualized.org writing articles and shooting video, and spending a lot
of time doing coding and etc, etc, doing some research.
And basically, I was cooped up in my, in my
house doing all that. And I wouldn't even go out
to see the daylight until I would only go outside
when when it was already dark. And so a few
weeks of doing that. And here's what I found is
I found that actually I was fairly productive, I got
a lot of stuff done, I got a love spent
on the site, I got my business, my business developing
along the lines that I want it to. But I
also started to just get this bad sense, this sense
of boredom, the sense that I was kind of everything
that I was excited about before, like writing articles, doing
research, setting up my site, this is all stuff that
I should love to do. After a few weeks of
that it's nonstop hammering it hammering in and out is
that I started to realize that I'm losing that juice
that I have for it. And I'm not as motivated
to get engaged. I'm not coming up with those creative
ideas. And I just plain old feel bad about myself,
I feel like my life is out of out of
whack because I'm spending too much of it with my
eyes staring into a computer screen. And so when I
when I it took me, you know, I was doing
this for a couple of weeks. And it took me
a while to really even realize what the issue was.
An issue was that I just didn't give myself any
breaks. And I was just kind of so involved. So
in the flow in the moment doing this stuff, day
after a day that the days blend together two weeks
blend together. And so that's classic work haul syndrome, right.
And what I decided to do, and this is something
that I came up with, because I've done it in
the past, unconsciously now I'm a little bit more aware
of how to do it is I just, I plan
myself, I basically force myself against my will to take
a break over the weekend. So last few weeks, I
haven't been working weekends. Rather, I have been working weekends,
and weekdays and weekends. So it just like everything blends
together and there's no break. And I got started getting
so bored that I just told myself, you know what,
this upcoming Saturday, and upcoming Sunday, I'm going to spend
those days doing anything but work anything but sitting at
the computer anything but reading a book, anything but doing
some sort of research or shooting a video, or any
any kind of web development coding that I was put
on the site. And I said that I'm just going
to take my mind off of it. Not only am
I not going to sit down and do that stuff,
I'm also going to take my mind off of it
and just think about other things. I'm going to think
about, well really anything other than the work. And what
I found was that it's actually doing this is challenging.
If you're an overachiever type of person, like a type
A personality, then you tend to want to always be
on the go doing stuff. And you don't really care
about taking breaks. Maybe you even pride yourself in that
and that you can outwork other people around you. I
think that's well and good that can be a strength
can also be a weakness, because well, you drain yourself.
And the question is How sustainable is that over the
long term? So what I did here is actually I
just I created like a little mini vacation For myself
over over the weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and what
I decided to do is just to go shopping and
just go clothes shopping, that some shopping is something that
I enjoy. I'm not saying that that's what your vacation
should be like. But for me, it was great because
it took my mind totally off of work, and allowed
me to just look at something else, you know, I
was looking at clothes I wanted to buy, because I
didn't want to buy just walking around and joining the
malls, and etc, etc. What I actually found was that
doing that for, for that first Saturday was was fairly
easy. I've done this, I've used this kind of strategy
in the past, and it was fairly easy to start
to just take my mind off work. But then what
I found was that after that, for Saturday, actually got
the benefit that I was seeking is I got a
little bit of refreshment. So my mind felt clear the
next day. And I felt I felt eager to jump
back in. In fact, I was driving when I was
driving back home from the mall in my car, I
had some some some new, like creative ideas sort of
popping up for me of kind of what kind of
video topics I want to shoot next kind of articles,
I want to write maybe some other ideas for how
to how to develop the site. And so that was
great. It was like my creativity was coming back to
me after being all sucked out from the few weeks
of work prior to that. And what I found was
that when I got home later that night, or Saturday
night is that I was actually very eager, then to
jump back into work, right? And it's again, it's that
it's that high achiever tendency, is that okay? I feel
a little bit refreshed, I can work now jump back
in. But then I kind of held myself back. And
I said, No, I'm gonna give it the full two
days. I don't want to cut this this vacation short.
And so what I did is this the next Sunday,
the following Sunday is that I went and I also
did shopping, did some other stuff, ran some errands, just
totally took my mind off of work, didn't even think
about it while I was doing that other stuff. And
what ended up happening was that by Monday, I was
back back at work. And I found that my productivity
and increased my my mind was sharper, everything was effortless
to what started happening, the previous week was that started,
stuff started to become grindy, I started to develop some
resistance around doing some of the stuff that I really
should enjoy doing. And, and here, I came back on
Monday and stuff just just flowed for me. So this
is this is a little mini vacation example that I
set up for myself. Now when I say vacation, people
usually think extravagant stuff, right? Going to the Caribbean going
on a cruise, you know, taking an airplane fly, doing
travel, that kind of stuff going to the lake. That's
all great that can qualify as vacation. But that stuff
is also tends to be expensive has to be stuff
that you can't do very consistently, it's something you have
to really plan out, you make drawn out plans for
that stuff. Well, that's not really what a vacation is.
That's kind of what a vacation is in our popular
culture. But what I tend to my definition of a
vacation is just simply an activity, a goalless activity that
takes your mind off of whatever goal directed activity you
typically do. So obviously, this applies to your, your, your
breadwinning job, whatever that is your nine to five, whatever
you're doing, or your the business that you're running or
the career that you have. So of course to vacation
off of that. But vacations can also apply to other
things. For example, maybe you're you're observing a strict diet,
and you're really diligent on that and you're working on
your on your on your diet, and your nutrition. So
potentially, you might want to take a vacation from that
because there's tendency to burn out from from doing that
much goal directed activity. Beyond Diet, Fitness also comes into
play there the to really go hand in hand. So
Jim, if you're always hitting the gym, non stop, and
you're doing that for for weeks and months on end,
then you can tend to burn out on that stuff
and also something that might warrant taking a vacation from
beyond that anything else any types of maybe hobbies, that
you're really seriously involved in any kind of training that
you're doing school any any of those kinds of activities
where you're pursuing a goal, and you're pursuing some sort
of some sort of you have some sort of mission
there some sort. There's some sort of metrics for success
and you're working towards it, they're stuck you got to
do whereas the alternate activity to that is goalless activity.
So a goal is activity is just sitting around and
lounging by the pool or reading a book just because
you enjoy the book and it's it's fun for you
not because you're reading the book to get information or
to learn something. Other goals activities, I mean hanging with
friends, socializing Watching movies, go into clubs and eat that
kind of like fun recreational stuff that that is typical
going fishing. So all that is goalless. And all of
that is great. And I think there needs to be
a balance in your life between goal directed activity and
goalless activities. And that really brings me to the point
of entertainment. Because I think that we live in a
really entertainment, entertainment driven culture, we have a lot of,
you know, movies, music books, if you think about it,
a lot of the most valuable stuff that we have
in society is really forms of entertainment ways to take
our minds off of work. And we tend to think
that well, there there, there's several opinions about this. Some
people kind of the party animal stereotype loves entertainment, they
just crave that and they want more and more and
more, they can't get enough. Other people will maybe probably
if you're watching this, this, this video and it's resonating
with you, then you tend to be a high achiever,
and you tend to actually love to do your work.
And you tend to want to work more and more
and more maybe to the point where you don't take
any time off. And you don't really look at entertainment
as something that's beneficial to you, and you tend to
see it as something that's frivolous. And there's several ways
you can view entertainment. One is you can see entertainment
as this frivolous thing that's taking time away from your
work, like, you know, maybe you're you're thinking, if I
could just put in, if I could just get six
hours of sleep, feel well rested and spend the rest
of that time doing straight up work, then I would,
that would be my perfect my perfect day, my perfect
week. So that's, that's one way. The second way is
to see entertainment as a means to an end, entertainment
is really a way to take your mind off of
work and get your mind refreshed and rejuvenated. And so
it actually serves a useful purpose. It's not just frivolous.
And that's definitely what I'm what I'm kind of pushing
for in this in this video. And then the sight
of the third point is almost like looking at entertainment
as as an end in itself. So whereas looking at
entertainment as as a way to rejuvenate your mind for
work, that's great. That's like an that's entertainment as a
means to an end. So it's a means to get
more work out of yourself. Whereas if you're looking at
entertainment as an end in itself, well, then you just
love entertainment. And for you. Spending time doing entertainment is
is kind of the joy in life is the point
in life. Actually, I got the sun in my eyes
here. So I'm going to move this just a little
bit right there perfect, trying to keep myself out of
the sun. So an argument can be made that really
life is about goalless. directionless activity. And that work is
not the point of life, that play is the point
of life. And that work is a way to allow
you to have time to play. And so some people
definitely come from that mindset, probably that kind of party
animal stereotype. But I think there's something inherently true about
that. In fact, they they did studies on on hunter
gatherer tribes modern, some other modern hunter gatherer tribes. And
then they applied their findings to hunter gatherer tribes that
we were all part of, you know, 10,000 years ago.
But basically, in counter intuitively, or intuitively, we think that
hunter gatherer tribes, they had a hard life, right, they
had to go out and hunt for animals gather food,
they didn't have agriculture didn't have a lot of technology.
So they spent most of the day working their ass
off building shelters, save surviving from predators and, and gathering
food. In fact, what they did is when they did
these, some of these studies in Africa, they found that
African hunter gatherer tribes, they don't spend that much time
working, they spent most of their time doing leisure activity,
they spend it lounging around and grooming each other and
dancing and singing, and just enjoying life and socializing. And
that that is the bulk of their day. It's not
work, they might work for four hours every day, and
the rest of it they spend off and when they're
doing that, what do you think they're doing? They're not
thinking about work, they're just off enjoying themselves and enjoying
the fruits of their labor, so to speak, without worrying
about all the stress that comes with with modern day
type of work that we have. And so given that,
you know, it's it's very, it's actually the truth. It's
kind of counterintuitive because it seems like now in modern
society in America Do we spend way more time working
than kind of our biology was designed for, you know,
are you working a 40 hour a week, that's a
typical week and 40 hours is still way more than
than a hunter gatherer would spend working. And if you're
working more than 40 hours, well, then you might really
be hurting yourself long term, both kind of mentally and
spiritually, and even physically, because that stress will eat away
at you in all in all sorts of ways. And
ultimately, what it does is it tends to backfire. So
if you're very gung ho about being super productive, and
ambitious, and achievement oriented, results oriented, I'm all for that,
that's definitely me. I think what I've started to find
in my life is that it tends to backfire. That
kind of mindset tends to backfire on you, if you
if you stick too closely to it, and that a
much more productive and healthy and more enjoyable way to
live, is to get nice vacation time in alongside your
work. And I think what that does is that it
rejuvenates your mind sets you up to work harder. So
instead of spending the weekend doing extra work, what you
do is you take the weekend off, enjoy yourself, don't
think about work, go party, or whatever you enjoy doing,
and then come back on Monday, and on Monday, now
you're refreshed, you're creative. Whereas if you work the whole
weekend, what would happen is you'd come back on Monday,
and you'd be drained. And you'd have a whole week
to slog through, and you would start to lose your
your your ambition and your motivation for the stuff that
you hopefully love to do, which is if you set
up your work right, then you love to do what
you're working on what brings you money. So why do
people overwork this, this is something I've been thinking about,
I've been thinking about why I overwork sometimes when I
have that tendency, there's definitely I think that aspect of
being achievement oriented and results oriented and wanting results faster.
So a certain amount of impatience, they're wanting it to
come faster. Therefore, you think that if you work more
stuff will come faster to you. I think that's one
part of it. I think another major part of it
ultimately is that it boils down to fear. You fear
that if you don't work hard, something bad is going
to happen to you. You fear that you're not going
to be able to make ends meet. You fear that
you're not going to send your kids to college, you
fear that you're not going to have that fancy car
to attract the kind of person you want to attract
in your life, you fear that you're not going to
be successful, you're not going to have the fame that
you want in life, you fear that you're not gonna
be able to retire. So any number of these you
feel that you're not going to be significant. Maybe you
fear that you're not going to have the fame that
you want the prestige, accolades of other people, other people's
praise, maybe other people's love, even you might contribute to
how much you're working. And so I think that's a
dangerous place to come from, I think working from a
position of fear is, is where most of us tend
to start. But as we develop more and more, and
as we grow, and as your personality matures, as as
you improve, overall, as your life improves, what you're gonna
find is that fear is something you want to move
away from as a motivational source. And you want to
move towards more of a positive rather than a negative
driver in your life. And here's, I've been thinking about
this, and I've really kind of came up with this
idea, call what I call the ladder of progress, which
is a couple of steps that you go through as
you're progressing in anything that you're doing in your life,
whether it's your career, or going to the gym, or
sticking to a diet, anything like that. And what I
think of when I think about line of progress is
that usually start from from a position of scarcity, right?
So let's say, well, let's say you want to improve
your nutrition, usually what happens is that when you start,
you're you're, you're basically at the bottom of this ladder
of progression, you're eating horrible foods, you're eating junk food,
drinking sodas, a lot of sugar, processed foods, that kind
of stuff. So when you start there, and at first,
you're just kind of satisfied with that, because that's all
you know, then you probably are gonna get a little
bit of awareness around it, you're gonna read a book,
some people are going to tell you maybe your health
is gonna start to diminish as a result of your
diet. And you're gonna start to basically you're gonna tell
yourself, Okay, I gotta, I gotta do something about this.
And so what you do is you tell yourself that
you're gonna eat healthy from now on, and you do
it an economy, you don't have a lot of information
about you've ever tried it before. So you're gonna give
it your best shot, and you're gonna do it kind
of half assed way you're not going to be very
disciplined about it. You have to be very informed. And
what's going to happen is, you will use a certain
a certain amount of discipline to get stuff done. But
ultimately, you're going to be too lacs about it. And
you're going to fall back. So you're gonna advance a
little bit for a certain amount of time, and then
you're going to fall back, you're gonna backslide, because you
weren't very disciplined about it, you weren't consistent, and you
didn't appreciate the challenges that were involved. And probably you
didn't have all the information that you wanted to have.
And then, and then so you fall back. And then
then maybe you try again, like a few months later,
you try again. And then again, maybe you fall back.
And so what happens is, you do that for a
while and you get tired, you get frustrated with this,
with this yo yo effect of going up and down.
And you say to yourself one day, okay, this is
it, I've had enough of this, yo, yo, I'm gonna
get very serious about this, I'm gonna apply a lot
of discipline and get this stuff handled. And so what
you do is you Sure enough, you get very motivated
every discipline on yourself, use a lot of harsh discipline,
a lot of ultimatums and, and a lot of fear
behind it. And what you do is you basically fear
yourself into a lot of disciplined action, and therefore you
get some some decent results, you start really monitoring your
your intake of foods, and you start, you start doing
good. And then you keep at that, so you've gone
up, you've gone up on that progress chart, and you
keep doing that you're getting decent results, but it's feeling
frustrating. And everything is very effortful, everything is labored, everything's
grinding, and you're starting to develop some anger and animosity
towards the fact that you have to do it this
way. And then other people around you are, are, are
eating whatever they want to eat. And ultimately, what happens
is that your willpower breaks, your willpower will break down,
and you will backslide again, and in fact, maybe this
time, the backslide will be even worse, because what happened
is that you applied so much discipline, and then you
hate to see yourself fail at that. And eventually, your
willpower will break, you're gonna have weaknesses in your willpower,
so maybe it means that you're gonna go for that
ice Greenland tonight, or whatever it might be, and you're
gonna fall off track again. And, and then you're gonna
get even more frustrated, because you think that you're not
capable of, of advancing and progressing. And so what happens
then, is that you get even more disciplined, and you
really get harsh on yourself. And you basically whip yourself
into into shape, and you put a lot of fear
behind it, and you get more results. And as you
do that, you're getting results. But also, you're building up
this, this latent fear. It's like this pool of fear
that builds up underneath all of your results. And it's
telling you that as soon as you let go of
the reins, everything's going to fall to pieces. And the
scary thing about that is that in, in some cases,
it's illusory. But in some other cases, it's actually true.
If you do let go of the reins, if those
reins holding onto them. So tight was critical to your
success, letting go of the might lead all that to
unravel. And so that fear might be legitimate. And what
happens is that with, with that fear in place, you
really, don't allow yourself to kind of relax, let things
breathe, and take on a more easy discipline. And eventually,
you you burn yourself out and you backslide again, and
after doing this for a while, you're gonna start to
realize that that's not the best way to do it.
That kind of harsh discipline, what you want instead is
you want to, to let things breathe, and you want
to take sort of a moderate, a moderate, steady, consistent
approach, we're gonna find out after you do a bunch
of that, yo, yo, you're gonna get so tired of
it, they're gonna say to yourself, you know, what I'm
really, I'm tired of this, the short term results, what
I want is I want to make changes that that
last, I want to make changes that are permanent, and
that stick. And I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit
of short term productivity, to get that. So if I,
if I'm going to start my diet, maybe I'm not
going to be so strict on it, you know, maybe
I don't have to be perfect every day, maybe I
can be just decent, every, you know, every other day.
And that will be a good way to start to
start the process. And then from there, you tell yourself,
well, I'll build on that. Let's see how that goes.
And then that goes, well, I'll just build on it
and just keep going like that. That kind of approach
that kind of more soft discipline that you take, I
find it's it's much more of a mature kind of
enlightened way to go about progressing in anything, whether it's
fitness nutrition, or, or your career or anything that you're
trying to get good at, you're trying to progress in
your life. And so essentially what you do is you
you start to develop a, a very even keeled grounded
sort of motivation. And that motivation is grounded in what
you want to do not what is scaring the bejesus
out of you, which is, you know, fear of fear
of failure or fear of not being successful or not
being loved or fear of not getting approval from your
parents, you know, whatever, whatever that fear is right now
that might be motivating you to do what you're doing.
You want to try to shift away from that into
something that's more positive, the reason why you're doing it
for yourself, not for anybody else. And that reason should
be because you enjoy doing what you're doing. And somehow
it's improving your health or it's improving your life. Ultimately,
what you find is even that soft kind of discipline,
if you do it long enough, it starts to turn
into I think, when you really develop mastery for something,
it starts to turn into almost this unconscious. This unconscious
behavior habit, that that you start to form. Although I
would say that it's more long term than a habit,
a habit might take 30 or 60 days to develop
this thing might take years to develop is this kind
of just unconscious mastery of what your what you're going
after. So that nutrition is just automatic for you. It's
not even something that you have to discipline yourself about,
not even in in an easy way, it's just something
that you naturally do, because you've basically integrated it into
your, into your head. So that's those are, that's kind
of the seven step progress ladder that I kind of
came up with, there's more details on that and in
the article below. And I find that that's very true
for anything that I'm kind of progressing at, I think
it's a good gauge to see where you're at and
in whatever you're trying to, to master. This is the
what step of that ladder you're at, are you at
that initial step where you're just kind of totally undisciplined.
If you are, you're probably not even watching this, or
get one of those higher steps, maybe you're at that
step where you're using a lot of fear to motivate
yourself. And now you have some awareness around it. So
now you can kind of start to shift yourself away
from it. The next thing I wanted to talk about
is brakes. So, vacations we defined as anything that takes
your mind off of goal directed activity. And I tend
typically think of a vacation as like, at least a
couple of days, maybe a weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday type
of deal. Breaks are also important, and also a great
way to increase your productivity at work. And to me
a break is identical to a vacation other than that
it's just shorter break is something that lasts, you know,
five to 60 minutes. And my question for you is,
if you're if you're working hard, how many times during
the day, do you take a break while you're working?
And how long are those breaks? Are they like five
minute breaks? 10 minute breaks, 15 minute breaks? And what
are you doing during those breaks? Are you maximizing that
break time to rejuvenate your mind so that you can
work harder when you get back? Or are you wasting
essentially wasting that break by thinking about work while you're
while you're breaking or doing something else that's not, it's
not as refreshing as it could be? Or are you
not even taking breaks at all, which is definitely something
that I have a tendency to do is it's hard
for me to just stop while I'm in the flow
of doing something and taking a break. And then there's
also this problem of when you take a break, trying
to keep that break to to that 15 minutes that
you want it to be rather than having it bleed
out into an hour and lead to slacking off of
the tasks that you need to do. So breaks, I
think are critical if you want to start optimizing your
schedule. In fact, what I'm talking about here is setting
up a daily schedule for yourself that involves the right
proportion of work and play. So that you are getting
maximal rejuvenation so that your work can be boosted. And
counterintuitively, the work is not boosted by just putting in
more hours, what we want to talk about is putting
in quality hours versus just pure hours, because you can
put in 80 hours a week, but is that going
to lead to the same kind of results that you'll
get if you put in a high quality 40 hours
a week, and and then also spend that other 40
hours now having fun, and doing stuff that you really,
really enjoy. So if you can manage that 40 hours
of work and 40 hours of play, I think it's
gonna be much better scenario than if you just put
it all at hours into pure work. And one great
technique that I found for setting up your day schedule
from from Eben Pagan actually is that you want to
work in about one and a half hour to two
hour blocks of time where you can totally focus on
whatever you need to focus on and you're working really
hard, you're working diligently and then you take a break,
you take like a 15 to 30 minute break. Maybe
you grab some food, whatever the idea, though, is when
you're taking that break, totally take your mind off of
whatever you were working on. So you're getting, you're getting
some new stimulation and you're getting refreshed. And then you
go back in and you do another stretch of an
hour and a half, maybe two hours where you work
real hard and then you take another break and During
the day, you only put in maybe two or three
of these two hour segments. So ultimately you're you're only
doing about four to six hours of true work the
rest of it, you're taking time off in a strategic
way, and then enjoying all that time that you actually
saved for yourself, you, you take that later in the
day and do whatever you want with it. So I
find that this is a good approach. Because if you
just if you create your own schedule for yourself, and
you set your schedule from, say, nine to five, and
this will mostly apply to let's say, a business owner,
obviously, if you're working a nine to five for somebody
else, then you have set hours. But if you're, if
you're managing your own time, if you have that luxury,
then just setting an hour, setting a schedule, like nine
to five is when you're working, might not be ideal,
because those eight hours, very few people can actually manage
to put in eight hours of solid, high quality work
throughout the day. This is kind of a misconception, you
know, when when when people tell you that they're working
eight hours a day, how many of that time were
they actually spending doing productive activity, how much of that
time are they wasting, looking at Facebook, talking with friends,
just doodling or whatever, whatever it is that they do,
or just like staring at a blank computer screen. If
you're working for yourself, all you ultimately care about is
the productivity, you don't care how many hours are put
in, per se. So if you can minimize your time
and keep the productivity the same, why not do that,
right, you're gonna save yourself a lot of hassle, you
can feel better. And not only that, you're actually going
to get more productivity out of it. Because that extra
time that you save, you can spend that time having
fun enjoying yourself, and then that's going to put you
in a in a more resourceful state when you come
back the next week, or the next day. So that
two hour skills is something I've I've toyed with and
I found that it works pretty well. Sometimes I just
put in two, two hour work segments per week, per
day. So that's like four hours of total work, sometimes
I'll put in three of those. And I find when
I do that, I really tell myself I put limits,
I put I say that I'm gonna, I'm going to
focus for about two hours, that allows me to put
all my attention to that one task for a couple
of hours, and get much better productivity ultimately get better
results better, better output, than if I just sat for
eight hours straight and had to work because honestly, what,
you can't work very diligently for eight hours straight, you're
going to just lose energy and you're gonna need breaks.
Speaking of which, this point is, is really underlined in,
in a book called The Talent Code, which talks about
how to develop mastery of things and how to become
very talented how to become world class. And what the
author did was he looked at various world class athletes
and other professionals, and looked at how they become good
in the process of that. And one of the things
that that he really stresses is this idea that all
all very excellent people, all very productive people. All very
talented people tend to do deep practice, which means that
they do very, very focused intensive sessions of practicing whatever
they want to get good at, whether it's a sport,
a hobby, a musical instrument, their career acting, you know,
whatever it might be. And so this idea of deep
practice is great, I'm going to cover in other topics.
But what I really wanted to say about it here
was that with deep practice, what what this author mentioned
in the Talent Code was that even the people that
are the best at what they do in the world,
like world class, tennis champions, and chess players, and musicians,
they can only sustain a limited amount of deliberate practice
per day. And that comes out to like three to
five hours total. And even in those those three to
five hours, very rarely does an expert is an expert
able to sustain more than one or two hours of,
of deliberate practice in one chunk of time. So what
that tells you is it kind of proves the point
that it's very hard to get eight hours of solid
productivity out yourself, it's much better to be honest with
yourself, you know what, I don't need to bind to
this notion that I need to be working eight hours
a day, I'll buy into the notion instead that I'm
going to work efficiently and productively in shorter blocks of
time. And then I'm going to use the rest of
it to enjoy myself. And that that is going to
lead to the best possible outcome. And so that's the
way that I encourage you to structure your schedule structure
your day, I encourage you to take breaks regularly take
1015 minute breaks so that you're you're refreshing your mind,
spend that time doing something that really takes your mind
off the work. And of course, I encourage you to
take vacations. If you've ever taken a vacation. Has that
ever happened to you where you take a vacation? After
like maybe you've worked for two or three years and
you've never taken any breaks? And then you take a
vacation then you come back to work the next week
and you're you feel so rejuvenated. So refreshed, you feel
creative, you feel more alive, you feel good in your
body, you don't feel frustrated, nothing seems effort, effortful, everything
flows for you. It's kind of a shocking feeling to
feel that because what happens is it's like, set like
that old example of the boy of boiling a frog.
If you just take a frog, and you put it
in some in some cold water, and then you, you
put that in a pan and you put that fan
in into onto a stove and you just slowly bring
up the temperature, that frog is not even going to
register that the water is starting to boil, and basically,
the fog is gonna boil in and cook cook itself
to death. Because the change is so gradual that the
frog doesn't notice. Well, the same thing has to happen
if you're working a lot. If you've been working for,
for a year or two, basically, what's gonna happen is
your body and your mind is going to forget what
it feels like to to be creative, it's going to
forget what it feels like to be refreshed, it's going
to forget to it's gonna forget what it feels like
to be motivated and energized and positive. At what you're
doing and it's for, you're gonna forget what it feels
like to be truly productive with with every minute of
your time. And so taking that break, when you take
that vacation, it's gonna it's gonna give you a kind
of a shock to the system is gonna say, you're
gonna save yourself, oh, man, wow, this is what it
was. This is what it felt like, but I totally
forgot that I could even feel this good. And so
if you if you resonate with that experience, then I
think you can, you can have kind of a palpable
understanding of why vacations and breaks are so important. If
you care about your productivity, and your lifelong health and
your happiness.
