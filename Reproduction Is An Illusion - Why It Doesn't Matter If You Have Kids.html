[Music] well I lied looks like you're gonna get a
second video before the decade is over and this one
is going to be about how reproduction is a fiction
I'm gonna explain that to you how can reproduction be
a fiction and this is going to be one of
those episodes that deals with some of the radical consequences
of non-duality which i've touched upon in the past and
I'll have an episode in the future which is going
to be a long laundry list of the many radical
consequences and implications of non-duality it's funny because in a
certain sense you can have an awakening to the truth
of what you are but then separate from that is
all of the fallout and all of the consequences which
can take you years to fully flesh out and realize
what those are for life and so many people who
even are doing spiritual work and really do have a
few awakenings still they don't realize all the ramifications and
the ramifications are so radical that if most people were
told these ramifications by a spiritual teacher upfront they would
never pursue spirituality and they would certainly think that it's
nonsense because the consequences are so radical and so outrageous
and they sound so absurd and so impossible that it
sounds like a fiction and yet the opposite is the
case so anyways how is reproduction of a fiction well
first of all we have to distinguish between sex and
reproduction so I'm not gonna be talking about sex per
se I'm talking about biological reproduction here in this episode
but of course if we're gonna be talking about sex
which I could talk about in the future in a
separate episode of course one of the radical consequences of
non-duality is that all sex is sex with yourself there's
no other for you to have sex with because non-duality
means oneness one mean oneness means there's one thing there's
only the so who's having sex the universe is having
sex with itself you are the entire universe therefore you
are always having sex with yourself whether you're using a
hand or a vagina or a penis or a mouth
or an anus to do it doesn't matter and who's
you're using also doesn't matter now I mean in the
absolute sense in the relative sense it matters a lot
because there are certain parts of the body with certain
people that you can use which will get you into
trouble so you do have to be careful about that
this is not this is not a license to go
rape this is just how it looks like from the
absolute perspective but anyways let's get to reproduction so biological
reproduction there's this idea that our culture in grains in
our minds and for a good reason which we'll get
into in a minute that it's important for you to
reproduce this is part of the myth and the religion
of scientific materialism see materialism is not merely in there's
a lot to materialism it's not merely that there is
a material reality yes that's that's the thought fundamental foundation
of scientific materialism but there's of course also other corollaries
that come along with the materialist religion and one of
those is that you're a biological organism and that one
of your most important functions in life is to reproduce
and this idea gets so ingrained in our minds by
our parents by society by our religion even by science
that we really start to believe in this myth that
oh if I don't reproduce myself biologically then somehow something
is gonna be lost it's gonna be bad this is
something negative see but of course reproduction is a relative
notion and here we're bringing in the concept of relativity
this is a powerful concept that I talked about in
my episode called understanding relativism part 1 and part 2
I haven't released yet but I will in the future
it's such an important topic so hang on for that
coming soon you need to understand that episode before you
can truly understand what I'm about to tell you so
relativity is a fundamental feature of reality and of consciousness
everything is relative to one's vantage point in one's perspective
and in this case we're applying relativism to the notion
of biological reproduction itself see most people hold and this
is part of the myth of scientific materialism is people
hold that reproduction is a brute objective physical fact and
either you have reproduced or you haven't reproduced and there's
only one way you can reproduce which is genetically by
having children and if you don't do that then it's
not reproduction and then your genes die and then that
branch of the family tree is killed and all of
your genetic pool is basically lost or some some narrative
like this see and it sounds it sounds legit how
else could it be you might wonder I mean isn't
this a physical fact that this is how we reproduce
but of course reproduction is relative to how you define
the self which is the core question of life and
the core question of spiritual work is what are you
what is the self if you believe the self is
a biological entity this body sitting here or that body
sitting over there and you believe that it's biological then
yeah you're limited to that paradigm of reproduction but that's
not because it is that way objectively that's because you
think of it that way subjectively you see there are
other ways to think about reproduction and in fact so
here's one of the other radical consequences of oneness and
non-duality is that if there is only one thing in
the universe namely the universe itself and if you are
the entire universe then every movement of the universe is
its own reproduction not merely you squirting some sperm into
some hole or you receiving some sperm into some hole
not merely that those are very limited actions of the
universe which you have labeled reproduction because you're so attached
to that hole whether it's yours or not yours you're
either chasing it or you're chasing for someone to enter
it right but but that's a very very limited paradigm
to limit the universe's reproduction just to that the universe
is reproducing in an infinite variety of ways literally infinite
infinite reproduction that's how we could think of the whole
universe everything that's happening is the universe reproducing itself especially
if we're considering the actions of organic life-forms and humans
specifically and the work that humans do see reproduction is
not limited to genetics at all this is far too
narrow a paradigm you are reproducing yourself as you're living
your life by interacting with other human beings in fact
you can reproduce yourself more effectively through your impact on
culture and on society and on people then you can
biologically for example who remembers these days the children of
Shakespeare do you know who the children of Shakespeare were
do you know who his grandchildren were how many generations
ago was that 20 50 100 generations ago that Shakespeare
was alive yet we know about Shakespeare today why not
through his children those have long been forgotten and that
gene pool has been completely diluted by this point such
that there's nothing recognizable left of Shakespeare if you looked
at the great great great great great granddaughter of Shakespeare
if one even existed she would bear very little resemblance
physically biologically genetically to Shakespeare because of so much intermixing
of the gene pool she wouldn't look like him so
what has really been passed on what has really been
retained Shakespeare reproduce himself through his plays through his written
work and that reproduction has been so successful that here
we are some five hundred years later and everybody in
the world who's a little bit educated knows Shakespeare how's
that for reproduction and mankind will still probably know Shakespeare
2,000 years from now if we're still alive how amazing
is that but by that point all of his genes
will have been smeared through the entire human species and
nothing will be recognizable of it you see now you
say well yeah Leo sure of course but here Leo
aren't you using the notion of reproduction very loosely and
metaphorically and kind of poetically sure we could sort of
say in a poetic manner that Shakespeare reproduced himself through
his plays but he didn't really that's like a fiction
that's like a a trick of the mind what's real
reproduction is the genetic physical biological reproduction and what I'm
telling you is that no your insistence that biological physical
genetic reproduction is the one true production that is the
fiction that you have to understand see why are you
selecting that above all the other ways that one could
reproduce as the one true one only because that's a
self biased position that you have and you're not appreciating
the relativity of reality what relativity here means is that
there is no one true way to reproduce because all
of them all actions of the entire universe are reproduction
in different ways with different consequences of course there's different
consequences I'm not saying that Shakespeare reproducing himself through his
written works has the exact same consequences as as you
reproducing yourself genetically yes there's different consequences but also consider
that genetic reproduction might not be the most important kind
of reproduction what you count as important or significant or
meaningful that's your projection onto reality that's not inherent to
reality if you think that genetic reproduction is the most
important kind of reproduction that's your subjective opinion that's not
a biological fact you see biology tells you how reproduction
works on the genetic level as far as that goes
there's no problem it's pretty accurate and good that science
is good the problem is when people add on top
of the science see it's not enough the religion of
materialism isn't merely strict science its science in addition to
a bunch of other extra projections and extrapolations and conclusions
and interpretations which are extremely selfish and self biased and
coming from a human perspective they're not objectively true in
any sense see so the idea that you you have
to that it's important for you to reproduce yourself genetically
this is untrue that's relative it's important if for example
you have a certain agenda if one of your agendas
is that it's important for you to you know pass
on your genes you're certain if that's a story you
have in your mind and you think that that's important
then it becomes important for you but it's not objectively
important and it might be more important that you reproduce
yourself in other ways of course you can do both
you can reproduce yourself biologically and socially culturally and in
many other ways so you don't have to limit yourself
to one I'm not I'm not here advocating against reproducing
children if you want children have children I'm not justifying
any actions here I'm just trying to get you to
see the relativity of of what reproduction is and also
I'm try to get you to think outside the box
I'm trying to free you actually from this restraint that
you have in your mind because I sense that a
lot of people don't want children these days but they
feel kind of bad and guilty and obligated to have
children because in their mind there's this there's this myth
which they think is real they think is scrout in
science and biology there's this myth that you must reproduce
or something important is going to be lost there's even
some men or some women in the world who are
unable to reproduce you know for whatever reasons because they
have a disease or a disorder of some kind they're
not able to have children and then they feel bad
and guilty about it for decades they beat themselves up
because they think oh well how terrible my life is
that I wasn't able to make children it seems like
my entire family lineage has been lost and now I
can't have a meaningful life anymore especially spotlight hammock stage
blue people they tend to view reproduction as a-- as
it almost moral imperative that's why a lot of religiously
conservative people don't use contraceptives they're against condoms they're against
teaching sex-education they're against birth control they're against of course
abortion for that reason but also for other additional reasons
and abortion is a complicated topic which I don't want
to get into here so that's not the only reason
that people are against abortion but it's one of the
reasons because sort of coming from that religious conservative traditional
worldview your lineage and your tradition your family tradition is
very important so the idea of passing on your lineage
via your genes but also via teaching your children the
right morals the right religion and all this this becomes
a huge obsession for many stage Bleu people which is
over half the world over the half the world's population
is obsessed with this idea of family lineage as though
it's not a fiction your family lineage is a total
fiction and besides which what exactly are you passing on
let's get very technical and scientific because you see stage
Orange Spa the dynamic stage orange folks who are just
one level above stage blue they also they also can
subscribe to this idea of of needing to biological reproduce
because at stage Orange that's sort of the scientific paradigm
and at the scientific materialist paradigm there's this kind of
notion of survival to fittest an evolution which is a
extremely oversimplified and grossly distorted and bastardized notion of what
evolution is but anyways people who start first learn about
evolution they latch on to it and they say oh
evolution so now everything looks like it's all about reproduction
right I've seen men on pickup forums for example justify
you know indiscriminately cheating on on their girlfriends and so
forth with this sort of scientific story of like well
it's survival of the fittest and reproduction and it's you
know it's just in my genes to sew my seeds
around the earth and they think when when they're telling
these stories themselves they think they're actually being scientific it's
a complete bastardization of science because if we get really
technical with the science well there's a couple of points
first of all science never tells you what a thing
is or what a things identity is so going back
to our original point of reproduction being relative to how
you define what a self is see science doesn't tell
you what a self is because there is no self
so of course science can't tell you what a self
is you have to make it up or if you're
doing poor science then you use science to make up
a self of course in this case you're you're bullshitting
yourself but anyways science makes up the self to be
a biological organism that's part of the materialistic scientific paradigm
so that's only one way to define itself you don't
have to define the self that way you could define
yourself as the entire universe you could identify yourself as
the entire human race you could identify yourself as all
living beings on the entire planet or in the entire
universe in which case like if your identity is not
that of an individual human but that of the entire
human race then it doesn't matter to you whether you
reproduce or whether your neighbor reproduces it makes no difference
because your identity is not at that little local level
it's more at a higher more global level but still
limited but if you identify even more broadly with the
entire universe it doesn't matter to you if if humans
reproduce or not it doesn't matter to you if humans
die or not because in the end even if the
human species dies out nothing will be lost the universe
is still going forward evolution is still happening evolution is
not just happening at the genetic level it is not
just happening within the human species it is not just
happening within mammals it is not just happening even within
living things it's always happening at all times it's a
feature of consciousness but that's a deeper point I won't
get into evolution here so part of the problem is
that the materialistic scientific paradigm has a very limited notion
of what evolution is they only look at it genetically
but genetics is just one percent of their leaving out
the other 99% of evolution there's cultural evolution there's um
there's physical evolution there's evolution of consciousness I mean so
much stuff I'll talk about evolution in the future so
anyways so science doesn't tell you what your identity is
it doesn't tell you what you are doesn't tell you
who you are you are doing that and your culture
is doing that for you and of course science is
part of your culture so my point is that you
can change your identity and and then reproduction will change
for you so if you want to get very technical
about the science point number one is that science doesn't
actually tell you what you are therefore it cannot tell
you what you need to do to reproduce because that
depends on how you think you are what you think
you are who you think you are see so if
you change your definition of yourself then science can give
you new ways to reproduce for example if you start
to include cultural evolution and cultural influence as part of
what you consider reproduction of the self if you start
to consider the reproduction of your mind as more important
than a reproduction of your genes then all the sudden
science can give you a bunch of different methods for
how to reproduce your mind rather than your genes you
can for example write books like Shakespeare did and then
there you go you reproduce yourself even more successfully because
it's actually easier to maintain a book or a DVD
disc than it is to maintain a genetic pool see
genetic pools are very flexible which leads us to point
number two if you want to get really technical with
the science what exactly is being reproduced when you have
children I mean it's not like you're making a clone
of yourself your genes are getting diluted by 50% according
to science maybe even more because there's random mutations and
other kinds of mutations which maybe are not random and
that that's just one generation that's 20 years in 40
years it's going to be diluted by to 25% and
then to 12% and so on and down the line
and within a few generations basically you're down to single
digits so what really is left of of your original
gene pool and why is this why do you think
that your genes are somehow special or important can you
see the absurdity of that the position that somehow your
genes are important and need to be passed down into
the future can you see how absurdly self bias and
narcissistic this is to actually subscribe to this idea the
idea that your family lineage is somehow special and important
and better than other families you think your family lineage
deserves to reproduce more than the the gorillas living in
the Amazon or in I mean 90s in the in
the Congo I meant to say Congo you think your
lineage is more important than gorillas of course not it's
pure selfishness is it's a complete fiction which brings us
to the point now see were we're really now bringing
in the concept of self bias here and also the
concept of survival so go check out my episodes called
understanding self bias and understanding survival part 1 and part
2 those are gonna be critical soaps we're bringing these
core foundational principles here of this work of soft bias
survival and relativity and the fourth one is non duality
and oneness II we're bringing all four of these together
and now we're using that to deconstruct the notion of
reproduction so how is self bias and survival relevant here
well look first of all I want you to admit
to yourself that there's absolutely nothing special whatsoever about your
jeans or your lineage it's as special as any others
your jeans are no more important than that of an
ant or a fly or a worm or a parasite
or a virus no more important so first of all
can you admit that to yourself can you become conscious
of that for you to admit that you will have
to be able to step outside of yourself bias because
your sense of self is distorting your perception of reality
so if you're really attached to your sense of self
your sense of self your identity is going to include
not just your biology it's going to include here for
example your family lineage all the memories you have of
sitting around the coffee table with your parents looking at
photo albums you know some some families are really into
the whole family lineage thing these are the more the
traditional families and then the more modern families not so
much of course still even the modern family you know
has a sense of who your grandparents were but anyways
some people really obsess you know they actually go online
they do the whole genetic testing they do the genealogy
thing where they actually track down their great great great
grandparents where they came from who they were and all
this why is that why are people interested in that
is it important of course not I mean it's really
silly it's silly because if you want to track this
back track it back all the way to the first
life form on this planet track it back to to
microbe I mean that to microbes that is your great-great-great
grandparents so where you're drawing these boundaries between who were
your great-grandparents and who weren't who are your relatives who
aren't and then you know are our monkeys your relatives
are not these are arbitrary boundaries that you're drawing of
course monkeys are your relatives of course worms are your
relatives we're all we're all one we're all coming from
the same place and we're all going to the same
place so where you draw your boundaries is completely subjective
and arbitrary there's nothing scientific about where you're drawing your
boundaries all scientific classification systems by the way the whole
like species and genus and families and all of that
that the branches these are all arbitrary they're not they're
not objective you could redraw all those lines and scientists
dispute they have disputes about which which groups of animals
belong in which category because it's it's relative to how
you want to define things these are not lines that
are drawn within the genetic code you can't open up
some DNA file look at it and then see oh
okay this is this has belonged to the genus of
cats and mammals in this and like know the DNA
doesn't make these distinctions human make these distinctions humans make
these distinctions so anyways I want you to acknowledge to
yourself how self biased the meaning that you're attaching to
your family lineage is and also understand why that is
the reason that you're doing that is because you're a
survival machine and you're unconsciously acting out survival patterns that's
what this principle of survival is about that we're introducing
here so if you study survival very closely then you
realize that your survival machine and you're just unconsciously acting
out these survival patterns one of which is attaching meaning
and importance to your family into your relatives why do
you do this is it because they're actually important in
some objective sense of course not of course not is
there any objective reason why some child in Africa dying
is less important than your mother or father dying or
your child dying of course not if you're totally honest
and you're not self biased about it you'll have to
admit that it doesn't matter which of those dies now
of course you can have personal preferences and so forth
and that's your self bias shining through you might say
well Leo but I don't know that kid in Africa
I mean yeah he's he's important too but he's not
important as my mom is because you know my mom
she raised me and she worked so hard for me
and she did all these beautiful things and she loves
me and she takes care of me and now I
have to give back to her and I feel a
sense of obligation yeah I understand all that of course
I feel that as well you know we're just human
we're survival machines but what I'm telling you is that
is survival instinct you have to care about your relatives
to a certain sense because without that you'd be dead
you couldn't be here otherwise and people who are coming
from very traditional backgrounds spy dynamic stage blue and even
earlier they're extremely family-oriented why is that because at that
level of consciousness and development it's almost impossible to survive
how are you gonna survive in a stage blue or
a stage red country that's at that level of development
how are you gonna survive in Africa or in the
Middle East by yourself you won't it's a family affair
you have to survive as a family or you're going
to die now these days a little bit easier because
we have the internet we have a lot of technology
so these days you probably could survive on your own
in the Middle East and in Africa and certain other
underdeveloped parts of the world by the way when I
say that these parts of the world are underdeveloped I'm
not saying that they're permanently underdeveloped I'm just saying they're
under developer right now I'm not saying they're inferior by
saying they're underdeveloped right so be careful about that because
people could misconstrue what I'm saying here's some sort of
racist argument and some sort of like white supremacist position
that's not at all what I'm talking about there's there's
really no difference between the races but they are at
different levels of growth they're not all equally developed not
all countries and geographies and ethnicities are equally developed so
that's not a moral condemnation that's not a judgment that's
just simply you know there's there's parts of the world
that are very very underdeveloped Africa and the Middle East
are are two of those parts this is not demeaning
them in the future they might become more developed than
Europe and then America great I got no problem with
that so anyways to return back to point what was
I saying yeah so so to survive in these very
undeveloped parts of the world nowadays it's easier to do
it as an individual because we have a lot of
technology that allows to do it for example you can
have a job as a youtuber for example and you
can live in the Middle East and you could make
millions of dollars and in fact there are youtubers like
that and you could leave your family never talk to
them again and you would survive just fine probably still
people would look at you weird if you told them
that you left your family see there would be a
lot of stigma against it why is there this stigma
precisely because it's a survival defense mechanism see people put
that stigma on you for example India is also another
one of these countries and ethnicities this is extremely family-oriented
huge extended families giant weddings and a lot of family
rituals and then you know parents put a lot of
pressure on their children to have families to have kids
and make grandbabies and all this stuff I have I
have some Indian friends so I know how that works
so so what is that that's survival see that's how
people survive that's how those cultures survive see it's not
only about individual reproduction and survival it's also about the
reproduction and survival of that culture for the Hindu culture
to survive it has to maintain those deep family roots
otherwise that that culture is going to get diluted and
it's going to disintegrate which is why if you're Hindu
and you have a Hindu mother and father they pressure
you so much for those you know to start your
own family and all that same thing if you're you
know Middle Eastern a huge importance place their on family
because it's a very harsh environment historically that part of
the world was extremely tribal because it's very difficult to
survive in that harsh desert climate you basically can't do
it on your own you need strong social connections not
just within your family but also within your tribe within
your clan because there's other clans that will kill you
when the geography is so harsh so people were forced
to adopt strong family values not because strong family values
aren't important or good or moral none of this or
true of course there's nothing true about them at all
it's a total fiction but this was a necessary fiction
for you to be here today if you're from that
part of the world and from that ethnicity see so
this is what I mean by survival start to notice
how all of the stuff that you think is so
valuable and important and moral and good and true that
this is all [ __ ] veneer underneath of that
is just pure survival for example if you like your
ethnic cuisine if you're from the Middle East and you
like Middle Eastern cuisine or if you're Indian you like
Indian cuisine or you're German you like German cuisine is
it because the cuisine is actually good no this is
a [ __ ] story tell yourself the reason you
like that cuisine is because you're from that part of
the world your genetics are from that part of the
world and of course you need to like the kind
of foods that are available geographically in that part of
the world it would make no sense for you to
live in some landlocked country which has no seafood and
for you to love seafood when there's no seafood around
say this would be like a head this would be
like a genetic torture for you now I'm not saying
you're limited by your genes I'm not saying that if
you grew up in a landlocked country that you can
never love seafood of course you can learn to love
seafood but that's gonna be somewhat of an acquired taste
for you see your genetics have actually evolved to eat
the kind of foods that your ancestors ate this was
very important for survival so of course if you're Hindu
you love Hindu food of course it's not because it's
the best food it's because that's what you needed to
survive and in a certain sense it's still part of
your survival now today of course you might say well
leo but you know I can survive on any kind
of food I can survive on McDonald's today sure you
can but remember survival is not just biological or physical
survival is mental survival is conceptual survivalists psychological as well
if you grew up eating Indian food spicy food there's
kinds of massage and so forth and various kinds of
nuns and flatbreads and so forth you grew up with
that that's wired into your psyche you have all sorts
of positive memories attached to it maybe your mother fed
you this food that was her way of showing you
love and whatever and maybe your father made you some
special meal on the holidays and that was his way
of showing you love and approval and you know maybe
you never got approval from your father except on the
holidays when he made your favorite meal and shared it
with the family and that's the way you got your
father's approval okay that's that's wired into your psyche because
your psyche needs love and approval from its surroundings from
it's family especially to be able to grow up in
a psychologically healthy way and to be able to survive
effectively you see so in this sense the food played
up a role in that and so of course even
now that food is part of your survival even now
you might you might move from India for example to
the United States you might integrate with the United with
the u.s. culture with American culture but still something something
about you will always bring you back to that old
classic food that you were fed when you were a
child you know there's something about that will warm your
heart is that really because the food is objectively the
best no it's survival your program was survival see so
the key to our work with all the work I
talked about with actualize that org is to be able
to notice our own survival mechanisms how robotic and automatic
they are there's nothing special about them whatsoever also to
notice how self biased we are by self bias what
I mean is that our view of reality is completely
shaped by our sense of self how you define yourself
defines how you see the world see which brings us
back to reproduction so one of the freedoms you get
when you awaken if you awaken very deeply and you
realize oneness very deeply is you're freed of the obligation
to reproduce before you lived your life thinking like well
I should probably have kids because if I don't something
important will be lost after you awaken you realize oh
I'm infinite I'm not this body I'm not this mind
I'm not the psyche I'm not anything at all I'm
everything and nothing and I'm eternal I'm immortal I can't
die even though this body can fall dead and of
course that will very shortly it matters not at all
in fact I don't need to do anything to reproduce
I am automatically infinitely reproducing forever for eternity I don't
even need to write a famous play like Shakespeare did
I don't even need to become a millionaire or a
billionaire or a celebrity I don't need to to make
giant donations to charities so people remembered my name and
put my name on buildings in universities even these things
I'm freed of having to do if I realize that
I'm the entire universe this freedom is very liberating because
now you're truly free to live your life however you
want to live so if you want to have kids
because you genuinely enjoy having kids around and you enjoy
raising them go ahead do it great do it consciously
raise your kill kids consciously have them consciously not accidentally
see you still have that freedom that's not taken away
from you but you do it consciously realizing that your
children are not any more special than your neighbors children
and that makes you more compassionate towards all children in
the world and you can still raise your children while
you have this compassion compassion is not limited in fact
compassion is just love and love is unlimited it's your
true nature is infinite love it's the one unlimited thing
that there is so so you can do that or
you can realize that well since I'm liberated I don't
need to have children because hey I'm gonna be reproducing
anyways through an infinite number of means because I'm the
entire universe and I'm infinite and eternal well why don't
I just write a book that book that I always
wanted right let me just go write that and I'll
reproduce in that way I find out more of an
interesting way to reproduce them by having children maybe I
don't like children or maybe it's not a book maybe
for you it's music you reproduce yourself through music if
not music then through cooking through architecture through film through
public speaking through helping animals now you might wonder leo
how am i reproducing myself if I am helping animals
let's say I start an animal shelter for four abandoned
Kazon dogs how is that reproduction you have to really
think outside the box of what reproduction is okay really
what you're doing when you're reproducing is you're transferring some
amount of spirit or essence or form to some other
part of reality you're sort of infecting one form with
another form and that is literally what you're doing when
you're having sex is you're you're sort of impregnating one
form with another form and then that formed has the
resemblance to the old form but not totally it's not
a perfect copy there's always dilution and change because diversity
is always happening this is for the greater good of
all because otherwise there'd be no point to really to
reproduction to everything everyone would just be a clone which
would be kind of lame so anyways you're doing this
you're transferring form that's what you're doing but transfer the
transfer of form is an abstract notion it's not limited
to genetics you see the transfer form can happen with
ideas for example in my videos with actualize that org
I am transferring my mind and my psyche into you
I'm transferring Mike spirit into you now of course there's
nothing particularly important about my mind or my spirit or
my psyche you know they're all equally good but of
course I have a preference for my own psyche my
own mind and I make selections about what kind of
things I should I think should persist with in reality
what kind of things I should shouldn't so for example
I could be creating videos about white nationalism and how
great Nazism is I could be doing that with my
life but I've decided no I don't like that like
those I do sets of ideas that's not a set
of ideas that I want to reproduce instead I want
to reproduce a set of ideas of like consciousness truth
love helping you understand survival and self bias and the
mind and all this sorts of stuff this is what
I'm interested in so because this I'm transferring this into
you to millions of minds see now the mistake people
make here is they say well yeah Leo sure you're
doing that but it's not true reproduction and what I'm
telling you is that's wrong because there is no true
reproduction it's as true as anything else but even this
I don't need to do if I wanted to I
could just sit and meditate for the rest of my
life not release any more content not write any books
not make any public speeches and I would still reproduce
when you're when you're cut when you're fully awake and
you're fully conscious you can look at every object in
the room and realize that it is your own creation
for example you can look at children strangers on the
airplane I was flying over the holidays there were some
babies and kids in the airplane near me I was
sitting next to a small child probably two years old
thankfully she was quiet she wasn't screaming the whole flight
if you know but I looked at her you can
look at her when you're really conscious you can look
at her and realize that even though that's not my
child in the sense that I didn't impregnate that woman
and have this child but that is my child from
a larger absolute perspective because I am the entire universe
which means I am the mother and father of that
child and I am the child itself there's no boundary
between me and the child you see how this works
changing your identity is a hell of a thing do
not underestimate the significance and the consequences of expanding your
sense of identity when I talk about expanding your sense
of identity I'm not merely talking about doing it in
your mind as a imaginary fictional conceptual thing no no
no what I'm telling you is that to expand your
identity you have to realize that your current biological limited
identity was never real to begin with that's what begins
the process of the expansion of identity you see and
for that you really need to kick this scientific materialists
paradigm that you're operating under because it's not letting you
change your identity because science is under the delusion that
your identity is biological and fixed and material this is
untrue and of course science has never proven it ask
a scientist ask a physicist to prove to you that
you are your body they can't do it not possible
science has never proven it nor will science ever prove
it because identity is a purely subjective and relative thing
how can you prove it it is whatever you believe
it is so if that's the case you might as
well subscribe to a wider identity the wider your identity
the better you off you're gonna be and then your
ultimate identity your awakened identity that isn't a belief that
is absolute truth can't be proven though because it's absolute
absolute is prior to proof so anyways there are many
different ways that you can reproduce once you're liberated you
can do none of them you can do one of
them you can do multiple of them whatever floats your
boat whatever suits you see that's the beauty of liberation
now you can consciously decide what kind of impact you
want to have in the world if you think what
the world needs is more babies with your genes in
them go do that if you think that the world
doesn't need more babies maybe you think the world needs
more love and care and you know what love and
care these are contagious and transferable things so let's go
back to that originally dropped thread I drop the thread
about how is running a shelter for cats and dogs
how is that reproducing yourself well if you're conscious enough
for example to realize that what you are your truest
nature is infinite love and that really what all the
universe is doing is trying to maximize love including by
the way through genetic reproduction if you realize that that
is a form of love and so is everything else
then you can you can also consciously decide on what
kind of impact you want to have in the world
so rather than for example expressing your love through your
children you can express it through starting a shelter for
cats and dogs because you notice that there's maybe a
lack of love for cats and dogs they're abused they're
abandoned they suffer and so forth and you could help
them a lot you know imagine if you save a
hundred thousand cats and dogs over your lifetime imagine what
kind of impact you're having on the larger ecosystem you
see mankind the beauty of mankind and also the the
the horror of mankind is that we are a collective
that's horrible in many ways leads to things like Nazism
and genocide and bigotry and racism and war and so
forth but the upside of it is is that since
we are a collective we can influence each other in
ways that other animals cannot because they don't have a
rich culture for example like you know take dogs dogs
don't really have a giant collective culture so for dogs
there's not much of a way that a dog can
reproduce its own mind other than through [ __ ]
another dog but with humans we have a lot more
options you can start this animal shelter for cats and
dogs and as you help all these animals you might
shoot videos of those animals you might you might create
a documentary about it you might post it on YouTube
people might see it maybe they'll see it on Netflix
millions of people see how you're helping these dogs they
get inspired by the love and the commitment that you
have for these animals and for your life purpose of
helping animals and then that inspires them to go out
and do their own thing maybe if a million people
see your animal shelter maybe 10 of them will start
their own animal shelters so that's 10 more right so
you multiplied by 10 there but even those that don't
start an animal shelter they'll still get inspired and they'll
just go out and and and use that inspiration in
some unique way that's true to them you know like
someone gets inspired not to start an animal shelter because
they're not good at that or maybe they don't even
like animals but they're touched by the spirit of your
work and the love you expressed and they might do
that to create a movie or write a song and
then that song gets streamed online and played by hundreds
of millions of people becomes a hit song and then
that song inspires millions more people to to do whatever
they're gonna do to be nicer to their children and
so forth and so in this sense really you might
say well if you're leo but if I'm not having
sex and reproducing genetically that means I'm not really shaping
human society I'm not helping children but you are by
expressing your love through this animal shuttle thing indirectly it'll
have a cascading effect and you can help millions of
children you could write a children's book that teaches children
how to care for animals for example that's that could
be even more powerful than just having one child who
you don't even raise properly because you're so unconscious and
you raise some dysfunctional child who becomes you know a
rapist or something rather than doing that you could have
a very positive impact on society and on mankind you
just have to start to see this whole thing in
a much bigger picture sort of way you have to
really zoom out and look at what all of mankind
is doing we're all influencing each other this is a
beautiful thing and it's the ugly hellish thing which is
actually great because the only reason it's a hellish and
ugly thing is because we're doing it unconsciously most of
us are so as we become more conscious as we
awaken to our true selves as we really start to
understand what oneness means what love means what reproduction really
means all the different ways we can reproduce we start
thinking outside the box and we start realizing that hey
you know we've already got 7 billion mouths to feed
maybe this planet doesn't need more mouths to feed maybe
what it needs more of is more teachers more doctors
more veterinarians more social workers more conscious politicians more meditation
teachers more yoga classes more or maybe we got enough
of this I kind of figured just kidding you know
there's so many things we need more of specifically what
we need more of is more consciousness more conscious everything
everything is improved by consciousness we need more conscious business
owners more conscious military leaders more conscious presidents more conscious
lovers more conscious parents more conscious children and the beautiful
thing about consciousness is is that it's formless and it
expresses itself and teaches itself in a infinite variety of
ways so consciousness is not limited to reproducing itself through
any one way it reproduces itself in all ways simultaneously
see don't underestimate the impact that you could have on
the world with your consciousness and your life's work you
can have massive impact you might become a teacher and
just a simple ordinary elementary school teacher but the love
that you put into your work working with your kids
could have the difference between raising a child who comes
through your class to be a Hitler or to be
a Mahatma Ghandi or a Buddha that's how much impact
you could have as a teacher see and and all
that's really required there is consciousness in love if you
teach children with consciousness and love and you are able
to embody it and to live those values then a
lot of people who who would have feared in the
direction of becoming a Hitler or some other version of
a devil will go the other way you see which
is why being a teacher is so rewarding which is
of course what I do just not in a classroom
of the conventional type so this is this is the
power of this work as you do this work you
start to really think outside of conventional boxes of what
reproduction is of what sex is of what morality is
of what culture is of what humanity is of what
you as a self are and of course all of
it is tied to you as a self really the
key to that needs to be unlocked is that as
you expand your sense of self all of the possibilities
open up for you and you're freed up to have
a conscious impact you the world whatever you want that
to be and then that leads us right into my
life purpose course go check that out where I talk
for twenty five hours and explain in detail how how
to develop a sense of life purpose the kind of
principles that I followed to create my sense of life
purpose to live a meaningful profound and a rewarding life
with your with your work see because what you put
out into the world then comes back to you as
well the more conscious your work is the the more
conscious you make the world and you are living in
the world so your impact is very important and you
have no choice about making an impact in the world
you're going to make an impact in the world no
matter what the question is will it be a small
impact or a big impact will it be an impact
towards hate judgment and devilry or will it will it
be an impact towards love goodness truth consciousness and all
those sorts of things see my work will outlast your
children if you go have sex with with with somebody
have children with them I guarantee you my impact on
the world will be larger than your impact just by
having that child because your child will die in 80
years but my work will live on for centuries perhaps
for millennia we'll see depends on how good I do
my work I'm still working on it maybe not yet
but we're getting there I'm slowly building up to it
you see so like really what I'm doing with these
videos is rather than ejaculating into some vagina i'm ejaculating
straight into your mind that's what's happening here but you
can't understand that if you're so [ __ ] literal-minded
that the only kind of reproduction you can understand is
the ejaculating a vagina kind see you have to be
wiser you have to be more intelligent than that to
be intelligent means you have to think abstractly about reality
you think so abstractly about reality that you're so open
to thinks taking different forms and when you're that open
then this new possibility opens up to you that oh
yeah ejaculation doesn't need to just happen in a vagina
that's one form of ejaculation a very limited form of
it it can also happen inside a mind which is
what's been happening in all the episodes that I've ever
released it's ejaculation straight into your mind tah-dah happy holidays
and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year there you go
everything explained right so anyways to wrap this up I
hope you can see the power of how we're taking
these fundamental principles and concepts like relativity and oneness non-duality
and survival and self bias and we're using them to
really radically change our understanding of reality in a certain
way nothing has changed you can still go have sex
you can still go eat your food you can still
love your family you can do all those things you
can have children nothing nothing about that has changed but
your relationship to it all has changed significantly which now
opens up new avenues for you and now you don't
feel trapped by life you don't feel like you have
to do what your parents told you you have to
do you don't feel guilty about it you can forge
your own life and if you've decided for yourself that
hey you know yeah I come from a Hindu family
I come from some Hindu tradition we're family as important
but you know what I'm more interested in writing poetry
and that's gonna be how I make my name in
the world and that's how I'm gonna shape the world
and I'm gonna spread love through my poetry and in
this way I'm gonna make it even bigger impact than
if I honor my family by having children then that's
what I'm gonna do and I'm not gonna feel guilty
about it and in fact I'm gonna be thrilled about
it and I'm gonna do it with a passion and
the rest will take care of itself see that kind
of freedom that's what consciousness allows you to do unconsciousness
makes you stuck in various kinds of dead ends you're
stuck in your job you're stuck having to have kids
you're stuck with your spouse or your relationship you're stuck
with your religion you're stuck with some stupid old science
paradigm you're stuck with some old politics so you're stuck
with all this stuff and you don't know how to
change it because all of it ties back to you
if you can change yourself that is the super power
that's the ultimate power that you have by changing yourself
you will then become the most powerful change agent in
the world and then you'll use that to change the
world in positive and conscious ways see but it all
starts with you so start laying that groundwork by working
deeply on yourself spend five or ten years working deeply
on yourself and then you will be in a very
powerful position to affect the world in the right kind
of ways that it needs to be effected and remember
that there's no one right way or best way that
the world needs to be affected what we need is
we need more people waking up and becoming highly conscious
and then affecting the world with a passion in their
unique way in a variety an infinite variety of ways
we need people who are going to be conscious doctors
and teachers and lawyers and politicians and environmentalists and veterinarians
and all this so don't worry about that there is
plenty of Nicias there are plenty of niches open for
all of you guys you don't need to just copy
me it's not as stupid it's like oh well for
me to transfer consciousness and love to others I need
to do exactly what Leo is doing I need to
start a YouTube channel No stop thinking in that stupid
little box what you need to do is find what
you resonate with what you're passionate about something new find
something new don't just copy me don't just copy somebody
else find something new find your thing develop that and
if you want to know how to do that in
detail check out my life purpose course but there you
go that's how reproduction is a fiction all right I'm
done here please click like button for me and you
can support me on patreon at patreon.com slash actualize you
can find the link under the YouTube videos down below
I appreciate those donations and come check out my website
that's actualize that org you'll find the forum my blog
the life purpose course of which I spoke and my
book list and then other stuff that I hope to
release in the future so there you go what do
I want to say to finish this abstraction is a
very powerful principle that we haven't spoken of much I'm
gonna have an episode about it in the future because
it's so powerful one of the biggest problems I see
these days is people get stuck in thinking about reality
in literal ways both religious and scientifically minded people fall
into this trap of literalism they think that things are
literally one way there's only one way to read the
Bible there's only one interpretation of the Quran there's only
one interpretation of science of quantum mechanics or there's only
one interpretation of evolution or there's only one way that
reproduction is and it's only genetic reproduction that's the only
way it is that's literally what it is but that's
not how consciousness works consciousness is highly abstract in fact
the more abstractly you can think and reason the more
conscious and wise you're going to be you need to
be able to think in terms of metaphors analogies you
need to make interconnections between things that are loosely related
you need to be able to zoom out and see
the big picture between things right these sorts of abstract
connections are crucial because otherwise you're going to get straitjacketed
in in your mind you're gonna get stuck I'm thinking
of a thing in a certain literal way without realizing
that all literal ways of looking at the world are
something that you're constructing and creating the world is not
a literal place it's a giant conscious mind and one
of the features of a mind is that it can
think abstractly about things things are not solid and concrete
see they only appear that way the more conscious you
become the more the more you're going to be able
to appreciate and understand what I mean by that but
anyways more than the future Happy New Year and I'll
see you in the next decade you
