            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XdbcsRxDQvM' target='_blank'>What Is Love - Advanced Spiritual Explanation</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding love</b>: Love isn't simplistic or just an emotion, sexual attraction, or seeking approval from others. It's a metaphysical, universal property, more fundamental than mathematical and physical concepts. The universe is argued to be a conscious, intelligent entity capable of expressing love. Leo contends that humans' experience of love is a small part of this universal love. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness and love</b>: Consciousness is a trait of the universe rather than an individual component of humans. When a human feels an emotion such as love, it's argued this reflects the universe's capability to love because humans are part of the universe, not separate entities. Leo encourages the audience to feel and recognize this connection to comprehend love at a metaphysical level.
</li><li><b>Unconditional love</b>: The highest form of love is termed 'infinite love', a love so profound it leaves no room for the concept of evil. This state may only be achievable through a dissolution of the ego and acknowledgment of each moment of creation and its inherent beauty. This unconditional love requires absolute acceptance of everything in existence. The metaphysical connection to the universe and love has the potential to transform individuals lives.
</li><li><b>Love and death</b>: Leo posits that the moment of death, where an individual dissolves into the infinity from which they originated, is a beautiful experience akin to the ultimate expression of love. Leo elaborates that love is about dissolving all boundaries and forming one unity. 
</li><li><b>Connecting love and truth</b>: According to Hinduism, the three facets of the absolute truth are Satchit Ananda - consciousness (truth), intelligence (chit), and love (ananda). These are interconnected, and understanding love in its entirety can profoundly impact an individuals happiness and personal relationships.
</li><li><b>Obstacles to love</b>: Contrary human notions about the nature of love, as propagated by culture and individual egos, are identified as significant hindrances to truly understanding and experiencing love. Overcoming these can lead to a comprehension of love as life-transforming, infinite, and fundamentally integral to the universe. 
</li><li><b>Love's societal misconceptions</b>: Society often simplifies love as a human emotion, related to sex, romance, or approval, which can disrupt an individual's ability to fully grasp the metaphysical concepts of love. There is potential to transform perception and understanding of love by keeping an open mind and challenging the notion that love is subjective and sentimental. 
</li><li><b>Acceptance of love's complexity</b>: Understanding love's complexity may require setting aside preconceived materialistic notions. Leo encourages an acceptance that love's significance and functionality extend way beyond conventional understanding.
</li><li><b>Understanding Life as a Love Simulator</b>: Life can be considered a love simulator where the goal is to become the most loving human being possible. Despite existing hardships such as war, famine, and disease, the ultimate test of love is to learn to love everything, not just that which pleases the ego. The purpose of life is to grow oneself to the highest capacity, overcoming fears and inhibitions to fully surrender to truth and love, thus fulfilling life's mission.
</li><li><b>Developing the Capacity to Love</b>: True fulfilment in life is impossible without love. Love cannot be bought but must be developed. The challenge lies not in loving the easy things, but in loving the hard aspects of life. This capacity for love is not something one can purchase; it requires hard work and development.
</li><li><b>Guided Visualization Exercise</b>: An exercise is conducted, guiding viewers to recall a moment they felt immense love, and then expanding and magnifying that feeling to a universal love for all of existence. This demonstrates that love is something proactively, deliberately and consciously created, not an accidental occurrence.
</li><li><b>Non-judgment and Unconditional Love</b>: One's capacity to love is tested by their ability to love aspects perceived as negative or evil. The true test of love lies in non-judgment and unconditional love towards everything, without exceptions. From the universal perspective, everything within the universe is perfect and loved unconditionally, it is humans who struggle to love without condition or judgement.
</li><li><b>Spirituality as the Art of Love</b>: Spirituality can be defined as the art of love, encompassing practices and concepts which aim to increase one's capacity for love, with the ultimate goal being infinite love. Most people, though, have difficulty with this due to selfishness and fears.
</li><li><b>Conditional vs Unconditional Love</b>: Leo Gura explains that people often equate love with the things that serve their egos, which is conditional love. The ego is a boundary within reality that gives significance to the 'self' and views everything outside this boundary with indifference. The ego is attached to maintaining this boundary out of fear that its dissolution would result in its 'death'. This forms a barrier against love, because the dissolution of these boundaries would lead to the ability to love everything, which is perceived by the ego as a threat.
</li><li><b>Nature of Egotism and Narcissism</b>: Egotism and narcissism act against love as they are centered around fear, hate, judgment, unconsciousness, violence, intolerance, manipulation, tribalism, exploitation, power games, closed-mindedness, and division. These manifestations of the ego are based on partial and discriminate love, and can only be conquered by letting go of attachments to survival instincts and accepting one's true self.  
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of Love through Sexual and Material Desires</b>: Ego-driven desires such as food, sex, survival, status, success, money, addiction, drugs, ideology, politics, religion, and logic can hinder one's capacity to love genuinely. The ego's attachment to these things creates division, preventing one from experiencing and practicing love.
</li><li><b>Understanding Hatred as a Form of Love</b>: Hate is often seen as the opposite of love, but it is in fact a form of love. Hatred is the excessive love of the self that results in hate of the other. This hate is a distortion and misdirection of love. In the same way that water can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, love can exist in different states, such as hate (solid state), familial love (liquid state), and unconditional love (gas state). Just as the different states of water are all fundamentally water, all manifestations of love are fundamentally love, even if they are crude or distorted.
</li><li><b>Projection of Inner Hate onto Others</b>: A person's suppressed hatred of aspects of themselves often gets projected onto others. Aspects of the self that are hard to accept or love are denied and suppressed, manifesting as hatred toward others who exhibit these aspects. Racism, for example, is rooted in the denial of the truth of the absolute unity of existence and insecurities about oneself, resulting in demonization and hatred of another race.
</li><li><b>Loving Every Aspect of One's Self</b>: To truly love, one must start with self-love. However, self-love isn't simply about loving the parts of oneself that are easy to love. It requires acknowledging and accepting even the aspects of the self one finds unattractive or undesirable. By fully embracing every aspect of oneself, one can become more open to others, reducing the ego-driven divisions that inhibit the ability to love unconditionally. 
</li><li><b>Understanding and Confronting Personal Limitations on Love</b>: In order to cultivate a greater capacity for love, it's important to identify the personal limitations or conditions on one's ability to love. Once recognised, these limitations become areas to focus on for growth and self-improvement in order to develop the ability to practice wider, perhaps even unconditional, love.
</li><li><b>Components of love according to the Ego</b>: The ego struggles to fully embrace and express love due to various reasons such as self-defense, survival instincts, improper understandings of love and fear of dilution and transformation. Ego's effort to survive often distorts love, leading to projected hate against other tribes, races, or ideologies. 
</li><li><b>Love from the perspective of Spiral Dynamics</b>: Love evolves through different stages of the spiral, with each stage representing a more complex, inclusive, and sophisticated understanding and expression of love. 
</li><li><b>Stage Purple (tribal stage)</b>: Love is concentrated and serves the tribe; conflicts arise when love or resources are perceived to be under threat from other tribes. 
</li><li><b>Stage Red (narcissistic stage)</b>: Love takes the form of power, conquest, violence, and building empires. This selfish and possessive form of love is destructive, but it can still be seen as a gross version of love. 
</li><li><b>Stage Blue (orthodox religious stage)</b>: Love becomes broader and oriented towards the service of the community, civilization and deities/idols. However, this love is still exclusionary, confined to one's own religion, culture, civilization, or ethnicity.
</li><li><b>Stage Orange (rational and individualistic stage)</b>: Love for rationality, logic, success, fame, sex, fun, individuality, and freedom emerges. This stage exhibits love of personal freedom and material success but lacks thought for collective well-being.
</li><li><b>Stage Green (communal stage)</b>: This stage exhibits love for all people, animals, races, cultures; it values community, environment, social justice, and equality. There is a liberation of femininity and acceptance of self-love.
</li><li><b>Stage Yellow (knowledge-focused stage)</b>: Love for knowledge, diversity, integration, systems thinking, and understanding reality emerge in this stage. Open-mindedness and continual pursuit of understanding becomes vital.
</li><li><b>Stage Turquoise (highest stage)</b>: Represents the deepest and unconditional forms of love. It includes love for all beings, ecosystems, the universe, and a direct understanding of oneself as god. This level of love can embrace and transform evil into love, demonstrating the real power of universal love. 
</li><li><b>Love and one's personal weaknesses</b>: Personal weaknesses such as neediness, superficialness, arrogance, fear, judgmental attitude, etc. hinder one's ability to truly love. Each stage requires personal growth and expansion of the loving capacity to transcend these weaknesses and barriers. 
</li><li><b>Confronting your personal limitations</b>: It is necessary to assess one's shortcomings in truly expressing love. By acknowledging limitations and conditions of one's love, personal growth, transformation and self-actualization can be achieved.
</li><li><b>Understanding Love Through Stages of Consciousness</b>: In the journey towards developing love, a significant transition happens from the 'orange' to the 'green' stage, during which individuals awaken to love and recognize their belonging to a community instead of perceiving themselves as solitary entities. This progresses further at the 'turquoise' stage, where strong potential for community love is realized.
</li><li><b>Practices for Developing Love</b>: A long-term practice to fully understand and experience love requires dissolving the ego and pursuing enlightenment. Other shorter-term practices include moving up through the spiral stages from 'orange' to 'green', 'yellow' to 'turquoise', opening up the heart chakra, and visualizing acts of love regularly. 
</li><li><b>Enhance Love Through Confronting Suffering</b>: Experiencing intentional deep suffering, such as engaging in enduring spiritual practices like solo meditation retreats, can significantly enhance the capacity for love and compassion. Such experiences offer a deeper understanding of the universal suffering faced by mankind.
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can be a powerful tool in the development of love by offering an immediate experience of infinite, divine love, enabling the acceptance of one's self, and leading to a deeper consciousness about one's fears and inadequacies.
</li><li><b>Importance of Truthfulness and Facing Fears</b>: Being truthful and honest in daily activities proves vital to increasing love, as love reflects the flip side of truth. Facing and overcoming fears, particularly the fear of death, opens up the pathway for unconditional love.
</li><li><b>Practices to Increase Love</b>: Certain practices like non-judgement, surrender, kindness, generosity, and vulnerability can significantly enhance one's capacity to love. Being vulnerable, while potentially hindering survival, is necessary for genuine love and requires a conscious surrender of fear.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Nature of Love</b>: The inherent nature of love involves vulnerability, acceptance, expression of emotions, and strength. It requires a deep realization and surrender to accept and love the world as it is, even when one might potentially get hurt physically or emotionally. This simply reflects the real power and courage underlying love.
</li><li><b>The Role of Gender in Love Practices</b>: Love practices may vary between genders. For men, embracing vulnerability and tapping into their feminine side can act as a key to becoming more loving and moving from stage orange to green. Women, on the other hand, have to train themselves to become more feminine and not seek to compete with men in social environments characterized by a stage orange mentality.  
</li><li><b>Embracing the Feminine Side</b>: Embracing the feminine side revolves around expressing your feelings and being vulnerable instead of erecting a facade of invulnerability and stoicism. Being emotional is a powerful way of attracting women since women appreciate emotional men rather than those aloof and stoic.
</li><li><b>Practicing Unconditional Self-Love</b>: Unconditional self-love plays a critical role in allowing oneself to love others. By loving your body and accepting yourself, you lower the hurdles to accept and love others. It is beneficial to practice feeling love, especially during difficult times, countering the primal knee-jerk reactions of lashing out, hating or judging by grounding oneself in the beauty of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Role Models in Love</b>: Individuals aspiring to embrace love can learn from the role models of love such as Mahatma Gandhi, Christ, etc., who showed the power of love by refusing to resort to violence despite being physically hurt. They exemplified the potential of love and its power to overcome hate.
</li><li><b>Societal Perception of Love</b>: Society may not always accept and positively react to expressions of love. Individuals with a low capacity to love may feel uncomfortable witnessing the demonstration of intense love by others. It is crucial to possess the strength and courage to express love freely despite such societal perceptions.
</li><li><b>Confronting Fears and Limitations</b>: In one's journey to love, acknowledging and confronting fears, assessing the limitations and conditions of one's love forms an integral part. These actions help in starting the process of self-actualization and personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Orthodox Religion on Love Perception</b>: Orthodox religions may instill in their followers a misunderstanding about the nature of love, prompting them to view love as an obligation or a rule. However, genuine love arises not from obligation but from a deep desire and understanding.
</li><li><b>Dissolution of Ego</b>: To experience the highest levels of love, like Christ or Gandhi, one must surrender their ego, ideologies, beliefs, and even religion. The persisting presence of ego may only allow one to go so far in their endeavor to love unconditionally. 
</li><li><b>Incorporating Love in Life</b>: A practical approach to love revolves around incorporating love into one's life, actions, and interactions. Practices like purposely filling oneself with love during different situations can enhance the sense of compassion and love towards others. These methods ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of love and its holistic application.
</li><li><b>Understanding full non-duality</b>: Traditional religious practices often fall short in teaching full non-duality, the state of understanding the interconnectedness of all things. This deficiency prevents individuals from truly breaking down the ego and achieving an enlightened state of love akin to that of spiritual leaders like Jesus. 
</li><li><b>Pursuing awakening and love</b>: Balance between pursuing awakening through practices like self-inquiry, yoga, meditation, and contemplation and practicing being more loving on a daily basis is recommended. These efforts synergize and lead to a meaningful and intense experience of love.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing facets of enlightenment</b>: Love is considered a facet of enlightenment, alongside the realization of no self, insights into the ultimate nature of reality, consciousness, God. However, certain simplifications of enlightenment overlook aspects like infinite intelligence, existence of God, and particularly, infinite love. A comprehensive enlightenment experience, thus, includes an insight into infinite love.
</li><li><b>Accepting ignorance and understanding evil</b>: Achieving a truly loving state requires accepting the ignorance of mankind and understanding how evil arises from ignorance. Love includes realizing hatred as a form of love fueled by ignorance. By deeply understanding ignorance and evil, one can avoid personal resentment and attain a mature understanding of love.
</li><li><b>Manifestation of love</b>: Love, although abstract, can be manifested in life purpose, career, relationships, and overall demeanor. It expresses the individual's deep-seated love for reality. By aligning every aspect of life with love, one can significantly improve life quality.
</li><li><b>Overcoming barriers to love</b>: Obstacles such as selfishness, fear, judgment, personal weaknesses, and limitations prevent the manifestation of love. Overcoming these weaknesses on a personal level and societal level (e.g., ideologies, opinions, conflicts) facilitates the expression of love in life.
</li><li><b>Achieving limitless potential of love</b>: Most people tap into only a small fraction of their potential to love. By consistently working on personal growth and aligning life domains to maximize love, individuals can transform the quality of their life and become more loving.
</li><li><b>Developing capacity for love</b>: The ability to love life is dependent on an individual's capacity for love. Increasing this capacity, thus, lies at the core of personal development. This can lead to a substantial improvement in life quality and facilitates the journey towards becoming a continuously loving individual.
</li><li><b>Becoming a More Loving Leader</b>: Leaders who can love greatly become idolized, triggering inspiration that can fuel the formation of entire religions. Conversely, those who cannot love become tyrants and are remembered poorly. Achieving this level of love is rare due to the great personal cost - dropping selfishness, breaking through self-deceptions, fears, ideologies and expanding consciousness.
</li><li><b>Courage to Love</b>: Love demands great courage. Cowards are unable to love deeply, thus leading less fulfilling lives. Developing love requires work, strategic planning, pragmatism, and a strong, clear vision.
</li><li><b>Transformative Love</b>: True commitment to love involves a complete life transformation, requiring strong personal boundaries and the lifting of oneself and those around to experience abundance. Being loving doesn't mean allowing oneself to get abused or walked over. It requires a strong intent and clear purpose in life.
</li><li><b>Mystical Experience of Absolute Love</b>: It's crucial to have a first-hand mystical experience of absolute love. This can be achieved through spiritual practices or psychedelics. This insight leads to more than just a belief about love, but a transformative understanding of it.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Limitations to Love</b>: To enhance your capacity for love, confront your fears and assess their influence on the conditions of your love. Acknowledging personal shortcomings starts the journey of self-actualization and growth.
</li><li><b>Unconditional Love</b>: Monitor yourself and make note of the conditions placed on your love. Assess your fears and their role in preventing you from being more loving. Becoming more loving requires honesty about one's own shortcomings and hardened practices that prevent unconditional love.
</li><li><b>Leveraging Actualize.org Resources</b>: Leo Gura advises viewers to leverage resources on his website, Actualized.org, for personal growth, self-actualization, and assisting in developing a career aligned with deepest passions. He further warns against idolizing him or taking his words at face value, emphasizing the need for independent thinking and personal investigation. 
</li><li><b>Investigating the Topic Independently</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of learning to think independently and investigating the truths he presents for oneself. Direct personal experience is more transformative than simply accepting someone else's insights or proofs.
