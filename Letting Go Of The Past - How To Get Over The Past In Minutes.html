hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to tell you exactly how to let
go of the past okay so how to let go
of the past this is an interesting topic because well
all of us have something in the past every one
of us has something in the past that haunts us
right something in the past that hinders our performance something
in the past we keep going back to something traumatic
something that made us afraid something that really hurt us
something that really made us retreat into our shell and
that thing is just robbing us of energy that thing
is something we keep ruminating over we keep worrying about
it whether it's going to recur again and that's just
robbing us of happiness it's also robbing us of performance
because we're always worried about it and we're always anxious
about it and fearful about it and who wants that
so how do we actually go about letting go of
some of this stuff so that it's never a problem
well the first point I want to make is that
yes it's in fact very possible to let go of
the past I don't care how bad your past is
and I'm talking about very serious pasts so if you
had some serious trauma in your past whether it was
like something as serious as a rape or a death
in the family the breakup of a marriage really the
loss of someone you loved the loss of a business
that you've started that was your baby whatever it is
abuse that you had as a kid growing up health
problems illnesses near-death experiences car accidents I don't care what
it is you can let it all go if you
want to you can so this is just a fact
of human psychology is that it's possible to let it
go you can work to let it go the only
question is whether you will will you work to let
it go and that's something that I want to help
you with today hopefully you can see why you should
you should let it go because the past is only
holding you back a negative experience from the past is
not doing anything positive for you in the moment and
actually one of the reasons that you're holding onto it
still and you're still thinking about it is because you
think that if you do let it go that somehow
your life will worsen somehow you're going to open yourself
up to threats and I can relate with what you're
saying I've been there I still am there in certain
areas of my life about the past I still have
certain hangups but all those hang-ups are hang-ups they're all
robbing me on my performance and at least I recognize
that I've done enough research and work on myself to
know that all past negative experiences are are not something
that I should be thinking about ruminating about holding on
to I want to let go of all of it
so ideally try to let go of all of it
if you take away one thing from this video it's
that you should let go of all the negative stuff
in your past and you can so go out there
and look for the answers I don't give you some
right now so here's the ultimate answer for the past
you got to understand what the past is right the
past you think it's so real you think it's so
vivid that breakup you had it's just horrible that time
you had that near-death experience maybe had some really traumatic
traumatic times real emotional distress I mean I understand it
can feel really painful and yes it can be hard
to like all that stuff but also it can be
very easy to let go of it don't make this
harder on yourself than it should be because here's why
the past the past is a concept it's a conceptualization
it's actually not real it was real at some point
it's not real anymore the future by the way is
not real as well the future is a concept the
only thing that's real is the now right now this
second what I'm saying that's what's real that's actually reality
everything else is not reality everything else is a thought
inside your head which is called the conceptualization so what's
happening here is that you're putting an awful lot of
emotion we'll charge and you're attributing a lot of reality
to something that actually isn't real now this is actually
a an idea that goes much deeper than just letting
go of the past but it's very effective at helping
you let go of the past this idea that the
things that you think are very very real are actually
not all right there in your head there conceptualizations that
problem you think is going to happen tomorrow at work
that's not real that's a conceptualization now you might say
well I'm very sure that something bad is going to
happen at work tomorrow I might get fired tomorrow I
have very good reason to believe that I'll get fired
tomorrow I already got some hints that I'm gonna get
fired and you might make that case and you say
well so I know that the future tomorrow it's going
to be pretty real I'm actually getting a fire tomorrow
no you don't know that that's a conceptualization you don't
know what's gonna happen tomorrow the whole world could end
tomorrow we could have a meteorite impact not only will
you not live till tomorrow there won't be a tomorrow
all right there won't be a job for you to
go to there might not be a building there might
burn down you don't know what's going to happen not
really now that doesn't mean that you dismiss critical thinking
that doesn't mean you dismiss strategy it just means that
understand this is just a fact I'm just telling you
a fact I'm not saying that this is right or
wrong and this should change your actions in any way
just a fact that the future is a concept and
so is the past especially the past what is past
is now just a memory in your head so it's
in there and sometimes those memories get lodged really really
deep it can seep in and the tentacles of that
of that traumatic event can spread literally through your whole
brain that's what's happening is you've got neuron connections and
they're just kind of spreading and you have that experience
you have that memory and now you got want to
get rid of it you want to let it go
so I'm actually going to show you right now how
to let it go you want to know how to
let it go all right so I want you to
to think of something in the past that's really been
bothering you something that is still traumatic something that you
want to let go alright so think about it right
now and just kind of bring it to mind feel
it experience the emotions probably gave me something naked if
so you want to let it go for for the
fact that it's negative and causing you some pain so
you know bring that back up feel it just kind
of let it be there don't don't try to resist
it okay now what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna take you through exercise now you could watch this
through and then rewind the video and then go back
and actually do it or you can just sit back
and do it as I'm talking right now so here's
what I want you to do is I want you
to sit in a chair back upright and I want
you to close your eyes and I'm going to guide
you through a little meditation here and we're just going
to see how you feel and we're going to help
you let go past all right you ready all right
do this now actually do this I'm guiding you I'm
taking the energy to guide you so go do it
I'm not just going to put some effort into this
okay so I want you to sit back and relax
and close your eyes sit back relax back up and
straight close your eyes okay now I want you to
think about your breath think about yourself breathing right now
just feel it feel your breath going in and feel
your breath coming out keep your eyes closed throughout this
exercise so continue to breathe and put your focus on
your breath breathe in nice and deep and slow and
then breathe out nice and slow and just keep all
your awareness on your breath all your awareness is on
your breath and keep breathing at your own pace nice
and slow in and then out I want you to
do is I want you to put all your attention
into your body feel yourself feel your body all the
sensations from your feet through your legs your thighs and
your butt as it's sitting on the cushion of the
chair through your back and up into your shoulders and
up your neck and through your through your head and
your face and then also your arms and your fingertips
so become very aware of whatever you're feeling in your
body right now your breath but then also how everything
feels feel the tips of your toes feel the tips
of your fingers feel your face feel the muscles in
your face and I want you to relax your face
your facial muscles feel the top of your head okay
now as your eyes are closed I want you to
pretend we're going to play a little imagination exercise I
want you to pretend that there is no future you
have no future just the future is completely unknown you're
totally in the present right now you're just totally in
the present and the future doesn't exist for you now
I want you to imagine that the past never happened
there was no past at all you just are right
now and you always were right in the moment right
now what you're feeling in your body the sensations the
perceptions that you're having even the perceptions you're having through
your closed eyelids that is all real that is now
and the thoughts you're having as you're listening to me
that is real that is now out and nothing else
exists and just take that in don't think about it
just be in the moment be totally in the moment
right now listening to my voice and feeling your body
and breathing okay so as soon as you're ready and
you're comfortable go ahead and take a few last deep
breaths and we're going to open your eyes and you're
going to come back and you're going to start looking
at the video again okay good welcome back so how
did that feel that was an experience what was that
an experience of that was an experience of the now
if you did that exercise and you can still go
back into it you can do it again and again
what you'll find is if you really do it any
list I'm telling you is that you get into the
now you get into the moment you get into what
is real and you stop thinking about the future and
you stop thinking about the past and at that moment
the now is what's real for you and everything else
you really feel if everything else is concept right do
you understand now that the rest is concept now you
might say well Leo I understand that I mean I
knew that already I know the past isn't literally real
but it still affects me and I know the future
is not real but I know we'll get into the
future that now will turn into the future at some
point and it will become real and that affects me
as well yes it does so this one exercise it's
not going to fix you forever you're gonna have to
do more work on how to let go of your
past but I just wanted to show you that you
can because one of the things that you have one
of the limiting beliefs you're holding if you're not letting
go of the past is that you're thinking that you
can't you're thinking this is something that's there it's going
to nag at you forever and you're like how do
I get rid of it how do I get rid
of it how do I get rid of it well
you just got rid of it you got rid of
it for two minutes or however long that was that
we were doing that meditation for you got rid of
it this is a big realization half is to understand
that the past only exists because you keep bringing it
back up and you keep bringing it back up and
you keep bringing it back up and you keep bringing
it back up and you keep bringing it back up
and you keep bringing it back up and you keep
bringing it back up when you do that yeah it's
going to stay alive you're literally rehearsing it in your
head you're rehearsing you're passing your head that's keeping it
alive how do you get rid of something you just
let it go don't make it too complicated decide to
let it go and stop thinking about it that's it
that's the bottom line of it you can go and
you can do therapy and you can do introspection and
I encourage you to do introspection I mean learn your
lessons about the past analyze it journal about it think
about it talk with it with about it with a
therapist talk about it with a coach I mean I
talk about stuff like that in my coaching sessions all
the time and I do this kind of work on
myself because it's necessary but realize that you could just
let it go just let it go right now just
decide right now that whatever it is I don't care
how bad it was just let it go and you're
letting it go because you know that the past has
no use to you you can't change the past what's
happened has happened and it might have been bad it
might have been horrible it might still be affecting you
but you can't change it you can't change the past
there's nothing you can do there's nothing you can do
about it stop thinking about it stop worrying about it
you think that worrying about it is somehow what going
to prevent you from making that mistake again no it's
not in fact what's going to happen is it's probably
going to lead to some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy effect
where you actually create that you don't need to be
worrying about it all the time you don't it's not
necessary you probably realize that already you're just not very
explicit about it right this is why once you become
explicit about it tell yourself that you don't need it
anymore it's not serving you it's creating dysfunction maybe it
served you in the past now it's creating dysfunction you
don't need it it's like a fester like a festering
wound you don't need it there anymore and how do
you let go you just let go decide right now
pause this video and say you know what that thing
I'm never going to think about it anymore I'm deciding
to cut it off anytime I get that thought again
just from impulse from habit that I've built up over
the past just cutting it off that's it that's they
let go the past all right and the final point
I'm going to make here is that really to let
go of your past you need to have something that's
going to distract you from going back to it stop
just to really prevent you from going back to it
you need to have something that you're going to be
thinking about something positive something new that you're working towards
so if the problem that you're trying to let go
of is some bad relationship a broken marriage then come
up with the new goal the new vision for you
how are you going to get a new marriage how
are you going to build a new relationship if the
thing you're trying to let go of is the way
that you were abused and the way that you were
raised in this in this bad way then think about
the new vision for yourself who are you going to
become in the next few years how are you going
to grow yourself how are we going to use self-help
and personal development maybe some of the videos that I'm
sharing with you how are we going to use that
to get yourself to a totally new level to transform
yourself see when you have a new project that you're
working on when you have something to look forward to
what's gonna happen you're gonna find it's just you don't
have time to worry about the past personally I don't
think about the past too much why I mean I've
been fortunate and have too many horrible incidents but you
know I've had some stuff in the past that still
bugs me the problem the reason I don't think about
it is because I have too much stuff to do
I have too much spend too much time worrying about
the future I spend too much time planning I spend
too much time doing stuff here and now versus dwelling
on the past don't have time to think about the
past too much and that's what you need design your
life to be like so you don't have time to
just sit and ruminate about all that useless past garbage
