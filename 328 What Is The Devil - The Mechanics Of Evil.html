            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/rVcxIamwO5g' target='_blank'>What Is The Devil - The Mechanics Of Evil</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Devil as a Metaphor for Selfishness, Ignorance, and Unconsciousness</b>: Leo Gura suggests the devil, in this context, represents the self, the ego, and is synonymous with selfishness, ignorance, and unconsciousness. The devil, or self, works through deception and self-deception which brings about its existence and leads to the creation of evil in the world. Gura argues that evil is the embodiment of selfishness. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Non-Duality in Understanding the Self</b>: Non-dualityÂ—the belief in a unified and undivided existence, offers insight into understanding the self. Instead of perceiving the self as a physical object, Gura sees it as a concept, originating from the distinction drawn between self and other. The existence of the self depends on maintaining this boundary. If it gets erased, so does the concept of self.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Subjective Concept</b>: Gura explains evil to be a subjective concept and a mechanism used by the self to maintain its existence. People label things as evil to rationalize the elimination of perceived threats or obstacles to the self without guilt. This concept of evil serves in marginalizing elements that threaten an individual's existence.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Recognizing Evil</b>: Recognizing and understanding evil within oneself can prevent the creation and perpetuation of evil, as misunderstanding evil can lead individuals to create it unknowingly. By labeling things as evil, one essentially projects a concept devoid of self-reflection and continues a cycle of evil creation and preservation.
</li><li><b>Selfishness and Problem of Dichotomy</b>: Gura posits that the desire to eradicate evil is, itself, a manifestation of the self's selfish issues. He presents the necessity of acknowledging one's individual capacity for evil, suggesting this awareness leads intuitively towards behavioral changes and is a countermeasure to evil.
</li><li><b>Non-Duality and Heightened Consciousness</b>: Non-duality facilitates a deeper understanding of selfishness and the nature of evil, ultimately fostering tolerance and understanding in the face of others' challenges. Recognizing the existence of evil within oneself and realizing that the perception of evil leads to its creation, counters the projection of evil.
</li><li><b>Transcending Ego and Material Attachments</b>: Gura proposes the transcendence of ego, the conceptual 'self', and the release of material attachments, including the physical body and beliefs, to help contend with the nature of violence and evil in the world, converting it into a conceptual issue rather than a physical one.
</li><li><b>Empathy through Imagination Exercises</b>: Gura recommends imagination exercises to imagine and empathize with the suffering of others, thereby fostering an understanding of the human experience. Envisioning oneself in painful situations can help individuals appreciate the interconnectedness of all beings, leading to more compassionate behavior.
</li><li><b>Concept of Non-Duality and the Devil</b>: Gura suggests that the devil can be understood as the ego representing the self, which can be purified by turning to God's light and surrendering to truth. He describes an ego death, wherein a connection to the divine replaces the self, allowing for the realization that evil is a projection in the mind and does not truthfully exist.
</li><li><b>Concept of Evil</b>: Evil is not a tangible property or characteristic of certain people or situations, but a concept invented by the self. People often perceive evil as outside of themselves, ignoring their own capacity for harmful actions. It's a subjective perception based on what threatens a person's self, their family, social circle, country, values, and entire identity. 
</li><li><b>Selfishness and Ignorance Fuel Evil</b>: People around the world act in a self-biased manner to accomplish their agendas, often leading to harmful consequences. This selfishness and ignorance are key drivers of evil. Even actions perceived as normal or necessary, such as paying taxes that fund wars, can contribute to harming others.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Evil</b>: People often perceive individuals or groups that oppose their values as evil. For example, terrorists are not evil to themselves while they might appear evil to others due to a different agenda. There's no fundamental difference between individuals who are deemed evil and those who are not. The difference lies only in degrees of ignorance, unconsciousness, and selfishness.
</li><li><b>Evil in Everyday Life</b>: People participate in evil actions every day, often out of ignorance or denial. For example, the invasion of Iraq resulted in the death of many civilians, and taxpayers from participating countries indirectly contributed to this outcome. However, this aspect of evil is rarely acknowledged and often ignored to preserve the self-perception of being 'good'. 
</li><li><b>Perpetuation of Evil</b>: Labeling others as 'evil' helps to maintain the perception of one's own goodness or righteousness. This process facilitates the continued creation of harm as it turns the focus away from self-reflection and recognition of one's own capacity for harmful actions. Evil cannot be effectively addressed without recognizing the existence of evil within oneself. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Mechanics of Evil</b>: The central theme is that understanding the mechanics of evil requires recognizing the interconnectedness of everything. To reconcile with the existence of evil in the world, one should acknowledge one's own capacity for evil and become more conscious of one's own tendencies, leading to changes in behavior.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Evil and its Relation to Selfishness</b>: Leo Gura suggests that evil serves the purpose of the ego and is fundamentally similar across various forms such as war, technology misuse, and terrorism. This is due to all forms of evil serving the ego's need to distinguish itself from others and maintain a sense of superiority. The concept of evil is utilised by the self to distance itself from others, prevent self-reflection, and perpetuate self-serving behavior.
</li><li><b>Evil, Self-Deception, and Lack of Self-Reflection</b>: Leo suggests that the concept of evil is used as a strategy by the self to label and distance oneself from perceived external threats. The act of labeling something as evil prevents one from empathizing with it and facilitates justifiable elimination. He emphasizes that individuals typically thought of as evil such as Hitler, dictators, and racists don't perceive themselves as evil. This is because the label of evil is often a tool of self-serving perspectives to maintain the self and halt self-reflection.
</li><li><b>Role of Ignorance in the Creation of Evil</b>: One of the examples Leo uses to illustrate the root of evil is the smartphone production industry. He notes that despite knowing about the inhumane working conditions endured by workers in phone factories, consumers continue to purchase new smartphones, propagating the cycle of suffering. This he attributes to a mixture of ignorance and selfishness, emphasizing that there's fundamentally very little difference between different sources of evil.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of the Devil as a Personification of Evil</b>: Leo elaborates on various traits of the "devil," a metaphoric symbol of evil. These include deceit and self-deception as primary survival mechanisms, massive arrogance, adoption of ideologies as a tool to establish identity, and materialistic and pragmatic outlook towards life. He asserts that the devil's existence is threatened by truth, leading to its constant evasion of truth and self-reflection.
</li><li><b>Spirituality and Religion in the Context of Evil</b>: Leo argues that true spirituality which seeks ultimate truth threatens the existence of the metaphorical 'devil'. However, the devil survives by subverting and corrupting spirituality to serve its purpose of self-survival. This is visible in the form of religious ideologies which often end up losing the essence of the original spiritual teachings.
</li><li><b>Evil as a Tool for Self-Preservation</b>: Leo emphasizes that the function of evil is to act as a defensive tool for self-preservation. By labeling another entity as evil, individuals and groups can justify offensive actions against it without guilt. He urges listeners to recognize this behavior within themselves to truly understand the mechanics of evil.
</li><li><b>Concept of Devil as Ideology</b>: The devil, or the self, often chooses to deceive itself by replacing God with ideology. This ideology, be it science, atheism, agnosticism, or theism, is inherently not God as it is limited. This provides an effective means for self-deception. This is exemplified and depicted in the TV show "CarnivÃ le". The devil in this story is an evangelical preacher misguiding millions towards falsehood while maintaining a guise of devout religiosity.
</li><li><b>DevilÂ’s Neurotic Self-consciousness</b>: The devil engages in neurotic self-reflection which includes feeling shame, guilt, and self-hate, often confused by many as true self-reflection. But in reality, these feelings are distractive tools used by the devil to deceive itself more deeply. The devil must deny their own 'devilishness' as acknowledging it would lead to their demise. 
</li><li><b>Benevolent God and Existence of Evil</b>: From the perspective of an all-inclusive and infinite God, nothing is evil. Evil only exists in the perception of the self or the devil, where anything that threatens the self is considered evil. The boundaries created within God include ignorance and conscious manifestations that play a game with itself.
</li><li><b>Elimination of Evil</b>: Trying to stop evil or fight against it only results in creating more evil. Acknowledging one's own capacity for evil is needed to curb its spread. Evil does not need to stop externally, rather, it requires an individual to become conscious of their own tendencies towards evil. This consciousness and awareness can lead to natural changes in behavior.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation and Misconception of Evil</b>: Labeling something as evil is a projection of the devil or the self. Since all is interconnected, attaching labels is unnecessary; the projection of evil creates more evil. The elimination of evil does not mean enforcing good behavior but involves a process of becoming self-conscious and recognizing the existence of evil within the self, leading to behavioral changes. 
</li><li><b>Role of Labels and Boundaries</b>: Evil is a concept that serves a functional purpose to an identified self by attaching a label to another, separated from the self. Once the self dissolves its boundaries and sees the interconnectedness of all, labeling or projecting evil becomes meaningless. The projection of evil actually creates more evil.
</li><li><b>Role of the Self in Stopping Evil</b>: Stopping the projection of evil and refraining oneself from committing evil deeds constitute the two facets of stopping evil. The projection of evil essentially creates evil, as it's a conceptual label attached by the self. When the self realizes the interconnectedness of all, labeling something as evil, which is essentially labeling self, becomes pointless. The unnecessary labeling is due to a misinterpretation and erroneous understanding of the nature of evil. Trying to stop evil externally creates more evil making the elimination of evil a concept heavily reliant on self-consciousness and self-realization.
</li><li><b>The Mechanics Behind the Demonization of Evil</b>: The act of labelling certain groups, such as the Nazis during World War II, as evil was a strategic move used to rally public support. The evil depiction dehumanized them, inspiring people to take drastic action, even including killing them. However, all humans have an innate discomfort with harming others that are perceived as similar to them.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Mechanics of Labeling Evil</b>: The fear of a potential Nazi domination or any similar threats typically stems from a focus on self-preservation and survival. The fear can be overcome by understanding the mechanics of labeling something as evil and acknowledging our mind's role in co-creating this perception of evil.
</li><li><b>Confronting Ego and Embracing Truth</b>: Ego, or 'the devil inside us', prioritizes survival over truth. However, to solve the problem of evil, priority should be given to truth and consciousness, even if it means death of the self. Understanding and surrendering to this idea can lead to enlightenment, or 'ego-death'.
</li><li><b>The Desire to End Evil is Selfish</b>: The motivation behind the desire to end 'evil' comes from a place of selfishness as it interferely with one's own self-interest. The problem is not deciding between good and evil, but rather engaging in that dichotomy which was created by us in the first place.
</li><li><b>Ending Evil Through Self Realization and Consciousness</b>: The intuitive approach of fighting evil by being 'good' falls short, as it perpetuates the dichotomy of good versus evil. The effective way to end evil is to acknowledge that one is capable of being the 'devil' and observing one's actions objectively. This process includes commitment to truth, surrendering to truth, and eradicating assumed ideologies about life, especially about good and evil.
</li><li><b>Surrendering Self to Truth</b>: Surrendering oneself to truth could mean to confront one's egocentric survival-focused instincts which mask the real truth. Evil can be eliminated by erasing the boundary that defines one's self, resulting in ego death, and the realization of the non-existence of the concept of evil.
</li><li><b>Evil Should be Recognized as a Projection</b>: It is critical to realize that the concept of evil is merely a projection of our minds which equates to creation of the so-called 'evil'. By recognizing this and experiencing ego-death, the individual reaches enlightenment or awakening and the 'devil' within each individual can be purified. This purification, however, may be emotionally challenging and could mean potential harm to one's physical body.
</li><li><b>Inner Realization Needed to Eliminate Evil</b>: To eliminate 'evil' from the world, individuals needs to eradicate their projections of evil and stop engaging in what they perceive to be evil actions. It is important to acknowledge that our bodies, or physical existence, can still be harmed irrespective of our spiritual awakening or the elimination of evil. The focus should not be on preventing acts of violence, but on understanding its nature and not being defensive when it happens.
</li><li><b>Disidentification with Physical Self & Material Possessions</b>: As Leo puts it, the first step to overcome evil and violence is to disidentify with all the material stuff including our physical bodies, minds, and belief systems. This suggests not allowing oneself to be affected or disturbed by physical threats or harms. By detaching oneself from material possessions and identifying oneself as non-physical eventually resolves the issue of evil.
</li><li><b>Imagination Exercise</b>: Leo recommends a compelling imagination exercise where one envisions experiencing life as diverse beings and victims of violence around the globe - a slave from the past, a concentration camp victim, a rape survivor, a civilian victim of a drone strike, an ant crushed by a child, a pack mule, a lion hunted for sport, or a pig bred in a factory farm - to help viewers better understand the suffering and pain of others.
</li><li><b>Non-duality and Perceived Evil</b>: From Leo's perspective, with the realization of non-duality (that all life forms are merely different perspectives or interpretations of the same entity), one comes to understand that they potentially embody all beings and have experienced all perspectives. Through this realization, he hopes that viewers would naturally cease to inflict any form of suffering on other beings, understanding that they are but parts of themselves. Surrendering the ability to criticize and condemn others, regardless of their actions, is the path Leo recommends to attain higher consciousness and eliminate evil. 
</li><li><b>Selfishness & The Dichotomy of Good vs Evil</b>: He warns his viewers against misinterpreting his words as advocating 'being good'. Instead, he argues that wanting to end evil is selfish, as it invariably threatens one's own ego/selfishness. People oppose selfishness in others only because it counters their own selfishness. The truly counterintuitive solution to evil involves acknowledging one's own potential for evil, committing to truth and consciousness, and surrendering to the truth, even if it implicates the death of one's ego. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Perspective of Violence</b>: Leo emphasizes that, even as we take these measures, violence and evil can still occur, but responding to violence with violence is proven to be ineffective. It's more valuable to understand the nature of violence and refrain from responding defensively when it affects us. 
</li><li><b>Problem of Evil</b>: According to Leo, the problem of evil is not a physical issue but fundamentally a conceptual one. Removing all boundaries, embracing the non-dual truth of existence, renouncing criticisms and judgments of others is the way he recommends to overcome it. 
</li><li><b>Empathizing with Pain</b>: This part of the lecture primarily revolved around empathy. The recurring theme involved understanding and experiencing the pain and suffering of others. This can help facilitate a deeper understanding of the human experience and encourage increased consciousness of the interconnectedness of all beings.
