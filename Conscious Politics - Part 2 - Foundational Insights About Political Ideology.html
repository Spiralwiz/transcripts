you all right welcome to conscious politics part two let's
jump right in we have an enormous amount of material
to cover and I am super excited about this I
can't tell you how excited I am I've been planning
this all week in fact there's so much material to
cover that we're gonna need an extra episode we're still
gonna be busy laying the foundation here in part to
the practical stuff will come towards the end I promise
it's gonna be worthwhile to really lay a deep foundation
here which is what is necessary otherwise I'm just gonna
give you a list of principles and policies and you're
not gonna understand like why why the policies are what
they are anyhow also I should I should point out
for you here that understanding politics and government is not
a tangent from self-actualization this will help you to understand
yourself and people in fact what we're talking about when
we're talking about government is we're talking about how to
be in communion with other living beings at a sort
of super organism level that's really what we're talking about
we're not just talking about abortion rights or racism or
tax policy I mean this is this is all nitty-gritty
stuff we'll get to that but you need to learn
how to commune with other living beings on a massive
scale nobody has taught you this you see and so
as you learn the principles of proper communion then that's
going to help you within your local community it's gonna
help you within your business and corporation because you have
team members there it's gonna help you even in your
family because really the problems you face in your family
you have political problems in your family don't you of
course you do those same problems exist on higher orders
of organizations it's just that scaled up by hundreds of
millions and then you see how difficult it is so
don't think of this as some sort of tangential topic
this is self actualization human beings we are social ape
creatures we are social we are self actualizing in a
social matrix you see and culture and collective ego these
are huge forces that shape our lives very much they
shape our egos they shape our identities so as you
study the principles of conscious politics and government in the
world after you're done with this series you're gonna see
that's gonna help you to deeper understand yourself and as
you understand yourself deeper and your own devilish ways all
your egotism and all the stuff that you're gonna be
self actualizing and purifying out of you through the spiritual
path as you do that you will gain insights into
what makes other people so bad at politics and government
and then everything will come together and you'll understand so
here's the key perhaps the most important thing I want
you to take away from this episode your level of
consciousness and development dictates your values your morals and therefore
your politics that's really the thing that's running the show
so at this point my political or rather my my
understanding of consciousness and human development has become so deep
that I can just look at someone on television on
CNN or Fox News or whatever and just look at
the politics that they're spewing or the morality that they
have and I can quickly identify what value system they're
coming from and I can quickly see that all they
are is just a zombie or a robot parroting away
running off a script with their ideology whether left or
right or whatever people vote simplistically for whoever they resonate
with a lot of times you see people on TV
pundits and analysts debating endlessly about all well why how
could how could this person have voted for that person
and how could this policy have passed and the others
they're surprised by these things there's nothing surprising about it
at all and there's nothing very sophisticated about at all
it's actually very simple whatever your level of consciousness and
your level of development that dictates your values and then
therefore you vote for that level of person it's as
simple as that nothing else matters gun rights abortion rides
this that it's all that's all nonsense what determines who
you vote for is your set of values and your
set of values changes depending on what stage of development
and consciousness you're at we'll talk about the stages here
in a moment everything else is just a retroactive rationalization
that your ego mind comes up with pretty stories that
you tell yourself and reasons and and logic and facts
and all this these are just arbitrary justifications that you
create after the fact to justify why you voted for
some or why you like some politician so what I'm
telling you here is that person who is at a
certain level of consciousness or development and value certain things
like nationalism for example they're gonna vote for a nationalistic
person they're gonna look at all the candidates out in
the field whether they're Democrats or Republicans and they're gonna
this is all gonna happen unconsciously but they're gonna look
and they're gonna see who do I resonate with it's
sort of like a feeling thing who do i resonate
with and the one you're gonna resonate with is the
exact guy or woman who has the same level of
consciousness and values that you have so if you're a
nationalist you're gonna resonate with a nationalist if you're a
hippie you're gonna resonate with a hippie if you're a
a corporate CEO you're gonna resonate with a corporate CEO
minded type of person who shares your set of values
it's literally this simple it's like the simplest thing there's
no mystery to it see and then what you tell
yourself about why you chose somebody that you have to
be very very suspicious of that doesn't matter because your
entire life is lived from your state of consciousness and
your level of development this isn't just politics this is
also how you show up in your relationships how you
show up at work how you think about money how
you think about sex all of this is governed by
these more fundamental structures of your own psyche see but
of course nobody is really conscious of these structures so
to them it's just a mystery of you know who
to vote for and why people vote and all the
sort of stuff actually it's extremely simple also I want
you to notice that your political ideology whatever it happens
to be left or right or Center is a survival
strategy of yours I want you to notice that it
has nothing to do with the truth you tell yourself
that your politics is based in truth but actually it
isn't that's sort of a little bit of a rude
awakening that I want you to experience here remember we're
going meta beyond ideologies you were indoctrinated into your political
positions if you just go and you you analyze how
you arrived at your political ideology where to come from
whether you're conservative or liberal it came from a from
early childhood and teenage upbringing within your family and your
culture and your colleagues and co-workers and they just a
doctrine aid you with various ideas of course this happened
and you were you were willing to go along with
it and that's where your political ideology comes from you
didn't do anything intelligent you didn't actually bother to sit
down and think for yourself and arrive at some positions
on abortion and gun rights and this and that you
didn't do any of this you just absorbed it from
your culture and whatever the status quo of your culture
is that's what you picked up and if you grew
up in a conservative family chances are you hold conservative
ideologies and if you drew up in a liberal family
you hold liberal ideologies notice this notice it remember when
I talked about what survival is in my two-part series
understanding survival I said that survival is not just about
surviving your physical body first and foremost survival is about
maintaining your identity and that ideology remember I said your
worldview is like an operating system which governs everything you
do and all of your motivations and all of your
actions and behaviors in all the various contexts of life
right so that's what we're talking about here the reason
people get so attached to their Nicoll ideologies and they
don't want to give it up and they get so
emotional about it and so defensive about it is precisely
because when we're talking about changing or questioning one's political
ideology we're talking about changing fundamental features of one's worldview
which is something the ego mind does not want to
give up because to it to admit that parts of
its worldview are wrong is very very threatening that's a
slippery slope that it doesn't want to go down because
that opens Pandora's Box to to much greater existential crises
and problems that we don't want to even get into
here see so people of course get very defensive about
their their worldview which is why religion politics sexuality these
are some of the most controversial topics that exist and
it's very difficult to have serious substantive conversations about these
precisely because people dig in their heels and the trick
is they don't want to explore different worldviews so what
I'm inviting you to do here is to drop all
of your ideologies whatever they are and to sort of
start to think from scratch rethink everything be very mindful
of how you're just executing a script you're just being
a zombie here a selfish zombie you're not being intelligent
culture plays a huge role in maintaining the status quo
of government and society 99% of people never think for
themselves their ideas are absorbed from culture this is true
even of serious intellectuals and scientists it's extremely difficult to
break out of the cultural matrix that you grew up
in and politics and government cannot evolve until culture evolves
so it's a tricky catch-22 because of course the powerful
and the most selfish people who have the most power
in the culture and in society precisely put up obstacles
to changing the culture they don't want the culture to
evolve because to them that is tantamount to death if
the culture evolves the political structure will evolve if the
political structure evolves they risk losing their power and since
they're just blindly selfish all they care about is maintaining
their power because maintaining their powers how they survive how
they reproduce how they pass off their resources to their
offspring and ensure that their offspring do the same that's
really what this is about and who gets to decide
in which direction culture should evolve which is the right
direction you see the problem here everyone has their own
opinions and hence we get to the culture wars and
the force of the status quo that is preserving existing
culture is extremely strong extremely strong most people in countries
around the world are attached to their culture and to
their way of life and they don't want change they
don't like change and so this is what we're dealing
with here so the majority of people are gonna resist
any kind of change or even any kind of discussion
about change necessarily so because they're afraid of what that
leads to what does the change mean for me and
for my family they're worried they're scared I also want
you to understand that logic reason and facts have been
co-opted by the ego logic and reason our survival and
selfishness not truth so whatever logic or science that you
use to rationalize your political ideology understand that this is
backwards rationalization you're not actually believing the things you believe
because they're logical or reasonable or because of the facts
or the statistics or because of science you use all
of those to entrench your existing positions which were adopted
blindly on blind faith not based on any kind of
reason logic or facts be very mindful of that trick
that the mind plays now here's an important distinction that
I want you to make that'll help you out there's
a difference between content versus structure content versus structure content
is the specific content of your beliefs people get hung
up on this stuff like content would be for example
are you a Muslim or you're Christian or are you
a Jew or are you an atheist or do you
believe we should ban assault weapons in the United States
or do you believe that we shouldn't these are content
based disagreements people get caught up on these this is
not what's important what's important is the structure the structure
is the underlying cognition that you're using to think about
the content it's how your mind works behind the scenes
that you're not aware of it's the very fact that
you're holding these beliefs without recognizing that their beliefs or
ideologies or where they came from or the fact that
you're just executing the script that is the deeper structure
and the most important piece of structure that we're to
be talking about at length here right now that determines
all political actions and motivations and opinions is the sense
of self and other that you have what is your
sense of self and what is your sense of other
that's the key that is so key most people just
assume that well my sense of self is just me
my body and then the other is just everything else
it's not so simple sense of self is a is
an elastic notion as is the sense of other so
we're going to explore this in a moment here this
is a this is a matter of how big is
your circle of concern and here we need to talk
about developmental psychology and specifically stages of moral development researchers
and psychologists over the last 50 years have done some
good serious research into how morality develops within human beings
and what they found is that there's a consistent ladder
of steps that people go up as they grow and
they mature so here are some of these steps this
is we're gonna be talking about now from going from
the smallest circle of concern smallest most condensed sense of
self to an expanding ultimately Universal sense of self and
circle of concern so first we start off with the
way that a baby is born into the world it's
just my physical survival it's the smallest circle of concern
you could have at this point you don't even care
about your family you don't care about your parents you
don't care about your friends because you basically don't have
any friends and your family you don't even recognize them
as your family it's just like a little toddler who
needs his milk otherwise he cries dad that's that's it
that's all he cares about he doesn't even care about
what happens to his mother he just needs what he
needs to live it's a very primitive form of existence
and this is how animals live as well animals mostly
just care about their own physical survival many animals for
example will actually cannibalize their own kind they will even
cannibalize their young in order to personally physically survive and
that's just a very crude form of survival you know
that we had to go through as as life-forms to
to get to where we are today then your circle
of concern expands some more as you grow up and
now it's not just me personally but of course you
have to include your family as well and usually also
you have to start to include your tribe as well
because you don't just grow up in a family outside
of a tribe this has never been the case in
human civilization until maybe yeah just now in the 21st
century well we always had a tribe so now I
care about myself my family and my tribe and I
care like I really care like if someone in my
family gets hurt or injured I actually empathize with them
and I want to help them and if they need
help I will gladly lend a hand but not to
some other family only to my own family because my
own family is mine and that other family is some
other family animal what do I have to do with
them likewise I will chip in for my tribe but
I won't chip in for the neighboring tribe because they're
not my tribe and that's my sense of self and
my sense of circle of concern then that grows to
include me my family but also now my civilization because
we're going beyond tribes we've evolved to civilization so my
civilization my ethnic group my culture my religion my morality
and my country all of that this is the level
of moral development that many conservatives are at right here
this is how they form their entire identity around their
family their civilization their ethnic group their their moral system
passed down from their religion and their culture and their
country and this is held to be the best and
everything else is expendable it's not mine that other country
that other culture that other civilization it has nothing to
do with me that's how they think then you grow
a little bit more and your circle concern expands to
all decent human beings on the planet all races all
cultures but not the bad guys not the evil people
not the criminals not the ones who would oppress the
innocent your circle of concern does not expand to those
those you hold as expendable because they're bad in your
mind what all decent people regardless of what country they
live in you have empathy for then your circle concern
expands even more as you become more conscious and more
developed and now you start to care about all human
beings on the entire planet good or bad including the
evil ones the criminal ones and even the ones who
would oppress the innocent you even have empathy for them
because you recognize that they too are human and many
of the most monstrous people on the planet actually there's
a really good reason for why they are that way
because they were abused as children or they grew up
in a very impoverished environment or they had terrible tragedies
like their family died when they were young or they
were indoctrinated into some kind of cult or some sort
of terrorist organization so you start to see that oh
it's not really their fault I can see why they
went down that road and if if not for me
being a little bit lucky being born in the right
circumstances and the right family and being raised I too
could have gone down that road and so oh I
see I I have empathy for them now - then
your circle of concern expands even more to include now
not just humans but animals and the environment you care
about the entire planet as an ecosystem this is called
Gaia planet Earth as a super organism you care about
the future of the entire planet not just for your
selfish needs it's not like oh well I care about
the planet because I don't want my children to you
know to live in it in a burning hell but
I actually care about just the well-being of the planet
itself and all the animals that live on it then
your circle of concern expands even further to include all
conscious beings in the entire universe not just this planet
and then lastly your circle of concern becomes infinite your
sense of self becomes infinite and you care about all
of creation whether it's living or nonliving in this dimension
in some other dimension in the past in the future
at all times all of it is something you identify
with and all of it is something you empathize with
and care for and want the best for so try
to peg yourself where are you honestly where are you
on this scale of moral development understand though that if
you're at a lower level this doesn't mean you're an
evil person it just means you're at that level so
I'm not judging you for being whatever level you're at
just be honest with yourself and don't judge yourself either
also understand that there's gonna be a problem here is
that if your level is too low you're not gonna
even want to accept that there are these levels you
see because some people listening to me here if they're
on a low level they'll say leo but why should
I care about the animals in the environment this is
some hippy [ __ ] some new-age nonsense all conscious
beings and you know what are you talking about this
is this is fairy tales and wishful thinking I mean
I can understand maybe caring for all human beings but
are you serious caring about animals and environment this is
this is silly yeah that you're speaking from notice that
you're speaking from your current stage of consciousness and moral
development that's how you feel and you honestly feel that
way and you can't understand why someone would care about
living beings on another planet to you it makes no
sense because you haven't evolved to that level yet you
see so that the trick here is that it's hard
to take seriously any level which is several stages above
your current level because if you could understand it and
you would accept it seriously then you would already be
there you see so keep that mind so the reason
we get such bad politics is because most of the
citizens who vote have a very small narrow circle of
concern and most of mankind is at a very primitive
level of moral development over 50% of the planet are
at the level where they have uh the circle concern
includes them their family and their civilization their ethnic group
and they are personal religion and country and nothing else
that's where 50% of the globe is at right now
see so it's it's it's not very sophisticated also I
should tell you about Lawrence Kohlberg stages of moral development
Lawrence Kohlberg is the developmental psychologist from the University of
Chicago if I recall correctly and he did some some
groundbreaking research by analyzing people and how they evolved as
they mature and he found the following six stages of
moral development really he broke it up into three into
three parts so first you have the preconventional then the
conventional and then the post conventional so each of these
three parts has two stages in it so stage one
pre conventional is as follows morality is based upon obedience
and a punishment orientation which basically means extremely selfish how
can I avoid punishment that's what the person cares about
so the reason that they're moral is because they want
to avoid personal punishment and suffering you know it's very
selfish a selfish way to be moral then you evolve
beyond that two stage two which is now a self-interested
orientation where now instead of avoiding punishment it's a question
of what's in it for me so all be good
as long as there's something in it for me like
I'll be good if you pay me some money that's
sort of thinking then you evolve beyond that and you
get into the conventional stage conventional stage three is interpersonal
Accord and conformity now the person is motivated to be
a good boy or a good girl and to have
some authority figure think of them as a good boy
or as a good girl and they get a sense
of achievement out of being that good boy or that
good girl and that is what motivates them to be
moral so they're not really doing it because they believe
it's right per se they're doing it because some authority
figure told them to and they want to conform to
what the authority of your told them and they want
the approval and love of the authority figure then you
evolve beyond that to Stage four which is now Authority
and social order maintenance this is a law and order
morality you conform to the laws of your culture and
your civilization and you accept them unquestioningly as the one
true right way and you believe that they are absolute
because they're passed down by God or some other authority
figure and it never really even occurs to you to
question law and order it just is what it is
and it's always been this way that's how you think
and so you just follow and you conform and you
you don't skirt the rules and then finally you get
to the post conventional stage Stage five which is the
social contract orientation here use to see that there's like
a social contract that we all sort of sign up
for when we're born and we want to participate in
that and that morality is not based in in religion
or in God but rather in social contract theory and
it's really about maximizing the greatest good for the greatest
number of people sort of a utilitarian philosophy then the
next stage after that is stage six this is called
Universal ethical principles here now you start to think critically
for yourself this is like the morality of Immanuel Kant
you think critically for yourself and you try to behave
in such a way that you're a good citizen within
your society and you try to follow your own principles
you set your own principles and here at this level
of morality you can actually question government laws because you
don't take them as absolutes here you can look at
some government law and you can say well you know
what that part in the Constitution where it says that
black people aren't even people but just like three-fifths of
a person or whatever that number was the ratio that
used to be there you know we can question that
that doesn't seem right to me because I have my
own internally grounded ethical principles and doesn't seem right to
me that black people should not count as a full
person so I'm gonna question that and I'm gonna stand
up for what should be right I have my own
internal sense of justice and and propriety and so I
can now question and change those laws based on what
my heart tells me rather than what the the book
says it doesn't matter what the book says it matter
what the Constitution says we can rewrite the Constitution because
the Constitution was written by men and how did they
come up with it well they followed their hearts or
that their own reasoning supposedly right that's how this type
of person thinks and then lastly there's a there's a
final stage which Kohlberg didn't even get to because he
himself wasn't developed enough and it was hard for him
to to gather the empirical evidence for it but I'm
telling you right now it's there because I'm there it's
transcendent morality we could call this stage 7 Universal self
love this is when your sense of self through mystical
experience and enlightenment becomes so great that it literally becomes
infinite and you become conscious of the substance of the
entire universe as consciousness and love and therefore you love
the entire universe because you realize that it's all a
product of your own mind this is a very radical
very advanced level of morality that less than 1% of
the population has ever tapped into or even understands exists
so so there you go so this explains a lot
about how people act with politics and with government is
because most of them are at a at a conventional
not even a post conventional but at a conventional level
of morality where they're mostly just conforming to various kinds
of authority figures that came in the past they're not
thinking critically about these things at all so their ideology
is based on that and their politics is based on
that now let me give you an example with abortion
here about how this morality stuff works so my claim
is the reason that we put these as numbered stages
each stage builds on top of the previous stage is
because what happens is that it's not just that these
are different random categories and a person just either accepts
stage 1 or stage 5 or stage 7 just willy-nilly
it's not how it works you evolve through it by
developing your sense of self by expanding it by becoming
more conscious so the claim is that you start off
at the bottom and you move towards the top now
most people don't make it very far towards the top
they start so they stop somewhere in the middle they
usually stop roughly at the center of gravity of their
culture or their family that they grew up in but
the reason we can say that the higher stages are
more advanced and more developed and more conscious is precisely
because once you evolve to them you will never evolve
backwards and they go in a consistent order so for
example with abortion and this is just one example the
first stage of morality of abortion is something like this
you ask a person at this stage is abortion right
or wrong and they'll just tell you [ __ ]
you I'll do whatever the [ __ ] I want
you don't get to tell me what to do stage
2 you ask a person is abortion right or wrong
and they say abortion is definitely evil because God says
so my Bible says so and you can't question the
Bible because it's the absolute truth then that person evolves
further if they keep growing and expanding their consciousness if
they keep doing self actualization work they will evolve to
the next stage where you ask them as abortion right
or wrong and they will say well it's complicated we
need to balance the suffering of the fetus versus the
suffering of the mother because clearly there are instances where
abortion can be abused so we don't want to just
give everybody free rein of abortion you know all the
way up until the final day of the abortion willy-nilly
aborting you know nine month-old fetuses you know this this
would this would be cruel and it would create unnecessary
suffering but on the other hand we also have to
take the the serious complications that mothers have during during
labor and during childbirth all of this needs to be
taken into account during pregnancy it's complicated got to take
rape into account we got to take incest into account
all of these complexities and you know we have to
we have to weigh the pros and cons and the
relative suffering of the mother versus the fetus because you
know if if the fetus is only like a clump
of cells not even a fetus yet and it's only
a month old it doesn't even have a heart does
it have a brain does it really suffer doesn't seem
like it suffers that much so in this case the
suffering of the mother if the Milly of the mother's
life is in danger something to happen then sure we
allow the mother to do what she used to do
but but you know once you get to a certain
point where it develops a heart and a brain and
you can you can tell that it's capable of suffering
now the situation starts to tip favor of of the
fetus rather than mothers than the mother's wishes and desires
and so see it's a it's a very nuanced position
about abortion so my claim is that once you evolve
to this nuanced position you will never go backwards to
believing that abortion is evil because God says so nor
will you ever go backwards to the point where you
say well [ __ ] it I'll just do whatever
I want see in this way we say that certain
stages are more evolved and developed than others because the
thing with expanding your consciousness is that once it expands
to a certain level it never contracts all the way
back now of course you can have temporary contractions and
when you're just pushing to expand it it can contract
back but once you kind of really expand it permanently
it never fully ever contracts back so the key to
understanding all politics is these stages of morale and also
ego development it's not just that morality develops through stages
but the ego develops through stages and here I'll point
you to a researcher a harvard-educated developmental psychologist by the
name of Susan Cooke Gruyter Cooke - Gruyter so weird
last name but she did some amazing research and she
she has nine stages of ego development that egos go
through I'm not gonna go to the details of that
it's it's too complicated and technical but just be aware
of that and I posted on my blog actually one
of her research papers it's like a hundred page research
paper which talks about the various stages of ego development
so the reason I'm giving you this is because I
want you to see that what I'm talking about here
is not just my own personal preferences and biases I
am I'm talking about serious scientific research that's been done
in fact in the future I will do a whole
episode called developmental psychology which will list about eight different
developmental psychologists reputable ones from top universities that have been
doing research for the last 50 years on this and
you'll see a lot of convergence and it'll really build
on top of the stuff we've talked about with spiral
dynamics so the key here about ego development is that
it's all about how selfish you are the more developed
your ego is the less selfish you are the less
develop your ego is the more selfish you are the
more selfish you are the more you are motivated by
greed fear ignorance hatred bias the more closed-minded you are
the more prone you are to denial projection blaming and
division and the more dogmatic and the more ideological you
are and when you are that way you vote for
those types of leaders you vote for the leader who
most reflects who you are you see so if you're
a racist you're gonna vote for racist leaders if you're
a hippie you're gonna vote for hippie leaders and so
forth the trick to conscious politics is stepping outside of
one's identity there cannot be conscious politics without expanding your
sense of identity that's what it all boils down to
because the more expanded your identity the more capable you
are of universal love and that is the thing that
we will need to resolve all of the tricky problems
of self dealing that make politics so dirty and problematic
see when selfish people do politics it becomes very ugly
it becomes name-calling factions and rivalries and ultimately violence and
genocide when selfless people engage in politics they can resolve
all sorts of problems without violence without name-calling they can
be adults rather than children so that's what we're working
towards here so how do we fix all the problems
with government firstly by taking personal responsibility for them secondly
by educating yourself about the problems many of these problems
are complicated and require study thirdly by expanding your sense
of self-consciousness in your capacity to love which something you
do through personal development work through consciousness work through spiritual
work by purifying yourself of your devilry that's how you
stop being a devil it's really simple you want good
politics stop being a devil be an example for others
of how not to be a devil and then they
will also not want to be Devils around you because
they'll see your example and so as you do all
this you become a better citizen and a better leader
within your community and then this creates an upward spiral
where everyone starts doing the same thing and then we
have a beautiful Society and to the extent that we
don't do this is the to the extent that we
have a evil society where it's selfish and vicious and
oppressive and unfair and violent and it's nasty to the
point where nobody wants to live in such a society
you want to run away and see suddenly now you
see why why government is so screwed up because nobody
wants to do the hard work of actually expanding their
sense of self and their capacity to love this is
hard to do all the self actualization stuff that you've
been doing over the years while following me you guys
who've been doing it and you girls you know how
difficult it is see it's filled with pain and suffering
and you know overcoming your own ego and you know
rude awakenings and ego backlashes all this most people aren't
interested in any of that instead what they're interested in
is just ideological debates because when they're engaging in ideological
debates this allows them to blame everybody else except themselves
therefore they never have to turn inwards they never have
to do any inner work they don't have to grow
they don't have to change they don't have to improve
as a human being they don't have to raise their
capacity to love they don't have to question their culture
or their religion or their family they can just comfortably
fit in and execute a script this is it it's
this simple it really is this simple but notice this
is not talked about anywhere else on television or in
the political analysis nowhere is this talked about as simple
and as obvious as it is you know once you
understand what I'm talking about here it's gonna be so
obvious you know like of course of course this is
the answer of course this is the root problem of
why government is so so corrupt see one of the
hallmarks of conscious people is that they take responsibility for
everything they don't blame they don't deny they don't project
it they don't ignore and they don't divide they don't
sweep problems under the rug they take responsibility for them
and they become proactive about it notice that all of
low consciousness politics often that you see on TV and
YouTube tries to blame somebody else it really is this
simple you can identify what political ideology someone has simply
by asking them who's responsible for all the problems in
the world and they will have a scapegoat for you
so who's being blamed either immigrants or my or minorities
women or feminists terrorists or muslims globalists are jews reptilians
Russia North Korea Iran various dictators around the world or
who are blame or just the politicians the President Congress
Republicans or Democrats are blamed the gays are blamed atheists
are blamed theists are blame religious nut cases are blamed
communists and cultural Marxists are blamed corporations are blamed the
media is blamed racists are blamed who do you like
to blame if you're blaming somebody and you honestly believe
that the world's problems would be resolved if we simply
got rid of the racists or the gays or the
communists or the Republicans or the Democrats or the globalists
you're kidding yourself you're not operating for a place of
high consciousness because if you were truly conscious your sense
of self would be so expanded that you would understand
that all of this all of these various groups and
factions that are that are fighting for power and control
that are acting selfishly and I'm by the way I'm
not excusing any of these people from not contribute to
the problem they certainly all of them contribute to the
problem in their own respective ways but um and and
also to various degrees so I'm not creating false equivalencies
here I'm not saying that gays are the same as
racists no don't get me wrong I'm just saying that
if you were conscious your sense of self would be
so expanded that you would realize that this is just
the cards that humanity has been dealt we are collectively
evolving through some complex stuff trying to survive on this
rock which is spinning around around the Sun at thousands
of miles a minute you see in the larger scheme
of things that's what's happening here and you know building
a society is a very difficult thing and people have
different agendas and people are different levels of development and
so you can't really blame anybody here and so a
conscious person would take responsibility for the devilry of his
or her government and that's exactly what's missing today in
our political discussions nobody wants to take responsibility for the
devilry that their government commits sure everybody loves to to
blame government and the politicians for being corrupt and evil
in all this but the truth is they're only as
corrupt and evil as the people who elected them and
you are directly responsible for what they are doing that's
how democracy works human rights abuses oppression and war is
your responsibility if your government is waging war you are
responsible for that war whatever human rights abuses and torture
that your government is doing you're responsible for it and
if you say no I'm not leo I didn't vote
at all there you go you're responsible by not voting
you're responsible by not making a choice by being lazy
by being ignorant you create the status quo you maintain
the status quo which is generally oppressive abusive and more
like see now I'm not blaming you per se responsibility
is a much broader notion than blame see my episode
blame versus responsibility you know I'm not I'm not saying
you're a bad or evil person by saying that you
need to be responsible for the devilry of your government
I'm just saying be responsible realize that you have you
have some say in what your government does even if
you live in a country you might say well Leo
but I live in a country where I don't even
get to vote so how am I responsible the government
just decides without my even able to to do anything
about it you can do something about it how do
you think countries that have the right to vote got
the right to vote because they didn't have it originally
no country was started with the right to vote and
certainly not a universal right to vote for women and
lower class people and for black people and minorities too
no it didn't work that way even in America this
wasn't the case in America the right to vote was
reserved for the most elite land owning rich people who
were also white and men so how do you think
the rest of them got the right to vote by
by standing up by taking responsibility for it and the
way that America was founded our founding fathers the way
that they got the right to vote even for the
for the for the rich white men of this country
is by waging a revolutionary war against some king in
England see so so only when you take responsibility are
you able to really challenge and change government what I'm
telling you here is something that you don't want to
hear I'm telling you that you are responsible for the
Iraq war you are responsible for nuclear weapons you are
responsible for immigration problems you are responsible for the corruption
of government you are responsible for corporate lobbying and Wall
Street shenanigans you are responsible for Donald Trump even if
you didn't vote for him you are responsible for terrorism
you are responsible for overfishing you are responsible for pollution
you are responsible for partisanship you are responsible for racism
even if you don't consider yourself to be a racist
this would be a position that a conscious person acknowledges
if you're not a conscious person you're gonna deny your
responsibility for these things you're gonna come up with excuses
such as like well Leo I'm not a racist so
how am I responsible for racism but you're part of
a larger society racists aren't some evil people that are
living somewhere else racists are your neighbors part of your
society your friends and if we look at it from
an even bigger picture perspective they are part of your
consciousness they are part of the entire universe which is
identical with yourself but now we're kind of getting getting
ahead of ourselves here okay so you're responsible for all
this stuff when you start to see it that way
your whole attitude changes you stop blaming and you start
looking for solutions you start being understanding towards those people
who you thought were evil who you spent time blaming
and you see that that blaming didn't solve anything and
only contributed to the problems because you blame them they
blame you and and then nothing happens nothing changes when
you take responsibility for these things then you can become
a great leader for example if you took responsibility for
leadership you might say if I mean for racism you
might say well I'm not a racist but what am
i doing to help change people who are race how
do I reach out to them how do I convince
them maybe I can start a school maybe I can
start a YouTube channel maybe I can write a book
maybe I can go talk to politicians maybe I can
become a politician maybe I can give an inspiring speech
and then through this you can change the situation you
can't change the situation by sitting around and blaming others
here are a few low consciousness political behaviors that I
want you to be very cognizant of because you might
be engaging in these number one trying to own or
ridicule your opponent's high consciousness people do not do this
number two taking Glee in the suffering of your opponents
so if you see a Democrat suffer and your Republican
and that makes you happy that that's happening or vice
versa if you're a Democrat and you see a Republican
suffering that makes you happy just know that that's the
low consciousness behavior you see the reason that you're happy
at the suffering of your opponents is because you've separated
yourself from your opponents and your sense of self is
so contracted that doesn't include your opponents if your sense
of self expanded further it would include your opponents and
therefore even though they're your opponents you might disagree with
them you're not happy that they suffer you feel compassion
for them you understand that they suffer out of their
own ignorance and you would like to help them but
of course not everybody will allow themselves to be helped
and you understand that but you don't take joy in
seeing them suffer even if they're deeply ignorant and unconscious
because you understand that at one point in your life
you two were deeply ignorant and unconscious see number three
holding an intellectual position as an absolute conscious people don't
do that not acknowledging that your perspective or point of
view is a point of view conscious people don't do
that unconscious people do that unconscious people deny that their
point of view is a point of view they tend
to hold it as an absolute next scheming and manipulating
to defeat your opponents if you scheme and manipulate a
lot to undermine your opponent's you're not a conscious person
if you demonize your opponents you're not a conscious person
if you call your opponent's crazy or insane you're not
a conscious person because when you call somebody crazy or
insane that means you're not interested in understanding their point
of view that's a defense mechanism you see and lastly
acting righteous beware of acting morally righteous conscious people do
not act morally righteous and with all these low consciousness
political behaviors that I pointed out here I'm not just
saying this for the sake of civility I'm talking about
something substantive and something much deeper I'm not just saying
at all we should all just get along and be
nice to one another that's not what I'm saying it's
not about and being nice or being pleasant sometimes you
do have to fight with in politics sometimes you'd have
to stand up against people who are truly devils and
want to do unconscious things you do have to stand
up you don't just lay down and be a doormat
and you don't just be civil with them you know
you don't you don't you don't just take Hitler out
for dinner to a tea party you know you don't
you don't need to do that that's not what I'm
talking about but you do have to be careful not
to fall into the very same traps that make your
opponents your opponents and not to to feed the downward
spiral into unconsciousness you see this is very important a
lot of liberals make this mistake they they fall into
the trap of thinking that well we're above the Conservatives
were more evolved to the Conservatives and so therefore now
we can we can act morally righteous and we can
demonize them and can call them Nazis and racists and
these sorts of things and we can even we can
even be glad when they suffer and those sorts of
stuff this is not conscious behavior be careful with that
even though you might be correct on individual policy positions
that doesn't mean you're acting conscious human being you see
separate the structure of how you act and how you
think from your individual policy positions whatever you believe in
as a liberal maybe you believe in medicare-for-all maybe you
believe in socialism maybe you believe in in free health
care or free college or whatever these are fine you
know believe what our policies you want but separate that
from the structure of your psyche and your ego ideology
cannot prevent devilry no ideology can in fact ideology is
the primary tool of devilry so changing your ideology from
a conservative one to a liberal one is not going
to do it morality cannot prevent devilry no system of
codified moral codes can prevent devilry technology cannot prevent devilry
some people have this fantasy it's the sort of the
techno bro fantasy that if only we have enough technological
innovation we have robots and machines we have the the
the digital singularity and we have Elan musk who becomes
our Overlord and solves all our problems through technology that
this way we will solve the problems of government and
unconsciousness and devilry no it's not gonna happen technology is
co-opted by the devil notice this every new technology presents
new problems we invent nuclear weapons and then devils get
a hold of them and then we have disaster so
technology's not going to do it and in fact some
of the newest developments that are happening with you know
brain computer interfaces and genetic engineering cloning this sorts of
stuff this is this is extremely dangerous stuff and it's
not gonna solve our problems gonna make the problems even
worse first we have to solve the devilry then that
will create space for more technology regulation also can't prevent
delery a devil is going to be the devil no
matter what the regulations are although of course regulations are
necessary the only thing that prevents devilry is expanding your
sense of self in other words stop being a [
__ ] devil that's how you stop devil ray spiritual
development is necessary spiritual work to prevent devilry and here
we run into one of the key problems right now
in our stage Orange by the Nemec stage where society
is the very notion of bringing spiritual development into politics
or government and to suggest that we cannot solve our
government and politics problems unless everybody spiritually evolved and do
spiritual work that is a non-starter already because you have
you're gonna have the scientists and atheists and and agnostics
and so forth you know whining and bitching and moaning
about the fact that no leo you're creating a theocracy
and you're you're you're forgetting about the separation of church
and state and what are you talking about this spirituality
just a bunch of New Age hippie [ __ ]
and it doesn't really solve anything it's impractical see yeah
with that kind of attitude because people are so ignorant
about what spirituality is we're stuck we're stuck with devilry
then stage orange devilry capitalist devilry that's what we have
right now I want you to really understand that political
discourse in our culture and media is happening at it
at just a barbaric childish level childishness that's what it
is it's children throwing food at each other that's what
our politics is right now none of the real issues
are being talked about that's the real tragedy of all
this really what I'm talking about here should be talked
about on CNN and Fox News and MSNBC every single
day that's all they should be talking about this is
the shitty Anderson Cooper should be talking about what the
[ __ ] is he doing sorry Henderson but this
is what you should be talking about dude not like
back and forth having Republicans and Democrats bicker with each
other about some nonsense tweet that Donald Trump made last
night that's not that's not gonna move us forward but
on the other hand I understand why he does what
he does because he's in a certain corporate system and
the stuff that I'm talking about here it takes hours
to talk about you can't have a three-minute soundbite about
these these things you know this is a serious this
is serious work but then again how else do you
expect serious problems would get solved other than through serious
work serious careful critical thinking study self analysis self reflection
people in our culture are deeply ignorant about government and
politics this right here contributes to at least 50% of
all of our problems simply this a lack of education
study and contemplation and I'm not even talking about advanced
ideas about non-duality or about even conscious politics as I'm
talking about here I'm not even playing for less than
1% of our population will even reach this stage to
be able to understand what I'm saying in this set
of episodes I'm just talking about extremely basic education most
people have no sense of political history about Nazism about
McCarthyism about slavery about racism about other nations about what
government is like in Scandinavia about what government is like
in Africa about how government evolved about the Roman Empire
about the Egyptian Empire about the Chinese Empire just these
basic things to be able to understand government and politics
you need a historical foundation this is absolutely critical because
history is filled with over 5000 years of politics done
in various wish vicious ways and we can see the
stuff that's worked in the stuff that hasn't worked and
by studying history you start to appreciate where we are
at today puts everything into context see but how many
books have you read about political history since high school
or the end of university whichever that was for you
if you didn't go to university how many books of
political history have you read since high school zero probably
for most people the answer is zero so of course
you're ignorant about politics and government and of course you
didn't vote for the wrong people of course you're gonna
be easily seduced and misled by various kinds of fear-based
ideologies which are peddled as a business by various kinds
of outlets on YouTube and on the on the TV
on cable see you got to read books you can't
you can't understand this stuff without reading books without studying
these complex problems you know our founding fathers were great
students of Athens and ancient Greece and Rome and various
kinds of political philosophies cutting-edge political philosophies coming from Europe
after the French Revolution they studied all this stuff carefully
and they came up with principles and and various kinds
of rules of thumb about how to architect a better
government which will have safeguards against these various kinds of
corruptions and problems that existed in other states for all
of human history they studied all that stuff and then
they came up with the Constitution and that was a
that was a pretty epic achieve but today you know
and of course they were elites and in their time
they were the cream of the crop they were the
top 1% you know in their time most people were
illiterate so they had no idea what was really going
on but today we have democracy today everyone gets to
vote but people are so ignorant that what they vote
for is ignorant stuff thinking that what they're doing is
being smart and intelligent so this point about lack of
proper education is central and one of the one of
the key policy proposals I will have for you in
the future episodes for fixing our politics and government is
a much higher quality education across the board which is
free to everybody in the country this is absolutely crucial
this is one of the highest leverage points that we
have to transform the world is to transform our education
system and there's so much we can do to improve
our education system but of course it's never gonna be
that easy because education therefore becomes a political powder keg
changing education is one of the most difficult things precisely
because the devils who are in power the most selfish
and unconscious people who don't want culture to change first
and foremost they don't want education to change in fact
what they want to do is they want to roll
back the clock on education they want to take education
backwards to teach their ideology that's what the devil tries
to do with education because education is one of the
key tools that mankind can use to awaken so the
devil needs to co-opt education and turn it into a
source of a spreading of devilry indoctrination and you see
that with the Trump administration look who he put in
charge of the Education Department um Betsy DeVos she is
trying to turn education backwards that's what she's doing this
is not an accidents is all by design but of
course the people who are doing this they're not conscious
enough to understand what they're really doing they think that
what they're doing is actually gonna be good for the
country but really what it is it's good for the
maintain maintaining of the status quo it's good for maintaining
their ideology they've confused what's good for their ideology with
what's good for the country these are two very different
things let's move on here and I want to point
out another important thing for you make the following distinction
any political policy or position can be criticized or analysed
from above or from below not just the left and
the right but from the above and from below so
for example religion what's a criticism of religion from below
it's something like this religion these days is so degraded
young people are not going to church we're not even
allowed to teach religion in the schools anymore we're not
allowed to to bring Bibles to school anymore you can't
pray in schools anymore this is all wrong we need
to bring Christianity back into the classroom we need Bibles
we need we need to make Christianity official state religion
this would be a criticism of religion from below a
criticism of religion from above would be something along the
lines of religion is problematic in that it presents important
truths about life and about human nature and about consciousness
in a dogmatic and ideological way it actually prevents its
own ultimate purpose which is to help to awaken people
and to help them to expand their sense of self
so the way religion is practiced today often times is
that actually it contracts a person's sense of self rather
than helping them to do the practices that are necessary
like meditation contemplation to grow themselves spiritually see see the
difference in criticism there so this is this is almost
the case with any position you can criticize it from
below or from above and oftentimes people make this sort
of conflation where they hear a criticism from above and
they misinterpret as a criticism from below let's look at
example at the example of science a criticism of science
from below is something like well science is problematic because
you know those scientists are godless atheists and they just
have their materialist agenda and the problem is is that
they don't understand God and they don't understand the importance
of Christianity and so they are missing something important and
so really what we need is we need we need
to teach creationism alongside with evolution in the biology class
that's what we need and you know science is overstepping
its bounds and science is making people doubt God and
doubt religion and doubt the Bible this is all very
bad that's the criticism from below of criticism of science
from above which is often how I criticize science is
that science is locked into the materialist paradigm and as
important as science is there are serious limits to science
as an epistemic method science is overlooking important aspects of
spirituality and mysticism because it's locked into the materialist paradigm
and it's trying to quantify everything and explain everything through
formulas and through mathematics which simply can't be done if
you're trying to understand the deepest levels of reality can't
do it that way and science is blind to some
of those limitations and also science is stuck in groupthink
and science is not questioning various metaphysical assumptions that it
holds as dogmas which it doesn't recognize are dogmas and
if we could help science to overcome these limitations science
would become much better but also it would free people
up to pursue spirituality more and therefore actually be a
net benefit for all of civilization and science itself as
well because the best scientists are actually reaching right up
to the point of being mystics so you see that
a very different kind of criticism likewise you can criticize
socialism from above or from below a criticism of socialism
from below is very common when you hear for example
on Fox News it's something like all those Socialists they're
really just communists they just want to seize all of
the money and they just want to redistribute it and
turn us into Venezuela that's what they want to do
and they want to take away all our all our
rights they want to oppress us and they just want
a big government rule that's all they want to do
and they're evil and they're anti-american a criticism of socialism
from above would be something along the lines of if
we give workers in a corporation the power to vote
and to actually have ownership of that corporation in the
sort of Marxian ideal there's a sort of problem which
Marx and many socialists don't take seriously which is that
if a corporation is truly run by committee by the
average of all the workers rather than by some really
ambitious passionate founder or CEO who has a vision for
this corporation then there there's a serious risk that the
operation will be run into the ground through a sort
of rule by committee and you know rule by committee
doesn't have a sense of direction or sense of vision
and therefore a lot of businesses will actually become less
productive and will ultimately fail which was sort of backfire
on the workers of that corporation so many of the
workers in the corporation and many socials and marches don't
understand the importance of the vision that the founder of
the corporation presents and the direction he sets for the
corporation which makes that corporation successful so for example if
you remove Elaan Musk from SpaceX or from Tesla or
or if you Moves remove Steve Jobs of course he's
he's he's past now but you know the loss of
Steve Jobs you know that that was a significant to
the significant detriment of Apple because it was his vision
that ultimately led Apple to become the the powerhouse corporation
that it is today without his vision it probably wouldn't
have happened see so if Apple is just run by
committee if every Apple Genius Bar employee just gets a
vote in how to run Apple is that really going
to produce the best products or is it gonna produce
kind of middling products with no vision that's a very
different quality of criticism of socialism so it's not the
socialism is bad or evil it's a question of nuance
see your criticisms of these issues almost anything can be
criticized but it has to be criticized with the proper
nuance from above not from below and what we mean
by the difference being below and above is simply how
conscious is your criticism that's what distinguishes whether it's below
or above it's not about left and right you might
say all leo but you're just being a leftist here
because it seems like you're in favor of socialism you're
more gentle on socialism than the then the criticism from
below from Fox News that's because you're trying to analyze
this situation from a left-right perspective and I'm telling you
that's the wrong way to to think about the situation
in fact this brings us to the more general point
that I want to make here which is that to
do politics properly you have to throw away these simplistic
dichotomies of left versus right individual which is collective capitalist
or socialist religion versus science small government versus large government
freedom versus regulation majority rule versus minority rule masculine versus
feminine to select one of these at the cost of
the other is a trap and a mistake rather what
you should be asking in all these situations is is
it low or is it high not whether it's left
or right or capitalist or socialist is it low consciousness
or high consciousness is it something that's coming from fear
and selfishness and a small circle of concern or is
it a position that's coming from an expanded sense of
self which includes everybody a universal sense of self and
love that's what matters and then let the chips fall
away they where they may if a universal sense of
expanded identity and love lead you to concluding that we
should be socialists then we'll be socialists I'm not I'm
not saying that that's necessarily the case I'm just saying
if if right if and if if an expanded sense
of self and universal love leads to you to conclude
that we need more femininity in our culture and that
we need more females and government than that's what you
go with femininity not because you're Pro femininity or you're
anti masculinity or you're Pro black people but your ante
why feel not because of these things but because you're
expanded sense of self and love has shown you the
proper way that's how you adjudicate all of these policy
issues and debates now let's talk some more about developmental
psychology and let's return to spiral dynamics I hope you've
watched my multi-part series on spiral dynamics I'm not gonna
of course you recap all of it here I want
to specifically focus on the political evolution that we see
within spiral dynamics so just like with moral development than
we're stages there are also stages of government development or
social development that we see throughout history and this has
been well documented through various research that you can go
read about read the book spiral dynamics you don't know
more but here I'll give you the political essence of
it so basically human government thousands of years ago started
out before there were major civilizations at stage purple which
was the tribal stage at this stage these are tribes
of hundreds of people maybe thousands of people at most
there is no serious government there is no formal law
system there's no legal system there's no court system there
might be a leader of the tribe but he's not
a dictator per se the tribe is actually very communist
ik examples of this these sorts of tribal governments and
they still exist are tribes in the Amazon deep in
the Amazon rainforest there are tribes within Africa tribes in
Papua New Guinea aboriginals in Australia and certain very backwards
kind of underdeveloped nations like Afghanistan a lot of their
government and politics is staged purple tribalistic and in this
level of government there is no real sense of individuality
you're working for your tribe your identity is enmeshed with
your tribe and there's a lot of tribal warfare so
it's not like these tribes live peacefully with one another
in some sort of romantic ideal where it's like you
have tribal people living in the Amazon and it's just
like the Garden of Eden and everyone is happy and
there's no government and so everything is great no no
these tribes are vicious there's tribal warfare they slaughter each
other they will wipe out neighboring tribes so their genocide
--all they will also enslave neighboring tribes so there is
slavery at this level this is not some libertarian ideal
or an anarchist ideal here then from that there's an
evolution as the society becomes larger into the thousands and
tens of thousands tribes no longer become sustainable and so
what happens is that because these tribes they become large
and they start to fight with one another too much
tribal warfare becomes so problematic that an authoritarian Rises some
big boss this is staged red government and he creates
an empire by rallying and unifying all the tribes together
not through love and peace but through conquest and enslavement
and vicious brutality rape and pillage raising entire cities to
the ground waging military campaigns this form of government is
authoritarian totalitarian and monarchic a monarchy is built through conquest
and raw power raw physical power masculine brutality women are
oppressed in these societies because they're not strong examples of
this include the Roman Empire the Mongol Empire North Korea
Russia some elements of Russia right now Saudi Arabia some
aspects of Mexico are still like this the cartels and
the mafias and all the corruption in Mexico those aspects
are like this of course Mexico still has some democracy
so it's a little bit more evolved than just pure
red but you can see aspects of it there for
the most part governments today the 21st century they cannot
be purely red they have to make some at least
some pretense of democracy otherwise they're just unsustainable we've we've
outgrown pure monarchy and authoritarianism it just it doesn't it
doesn't work because people have evolved culturally and morally to
the point where they won't stand for a monarchy after
the monarchy plays itself out then we move into the
next level which is stage blue stage blue is theocratic
ethno state isolationist and nationalist this is Nazi Germany this
is Iran India China Brazil Israel Poland and the rural
South and rural aspects of the US that's what I
mean by rule south this is a very kind of
conformist stage where people are just interested in upholding their
own civilization they think their own civilization is best and
what they want to do is ideally create an ethnos
State that's what Nazism was about creating an ethnos state
all the other the ones who are not like us
we throw them out but we build this massive civilization
for ourselves so it's sort of like tribalism but on
a grand civilizational scale now my tribe is my entire
nation and my whole ethnicity and so we will unify
you know Hitler was obsessed with unifying the German race
as the tribe so the tribe became the German peoples
but of course you know at the cost of killing
the Jews and the gypsies and a bunch of other
folks to develop a sense of purity this is nationalism
of course there's various degrees of it not not all
nationalists become Nazis it doesn't get as bad as Nazi
Germany all the time I'm not saying that for example
India or China or Brazil is as bad as Nazi
Germany I'm just saying that there's there's degrees of it
and there's definitely aspects of this in these various countries
that I've talked about and also in the rural American
politics then you evolve beyond that because you that's a
very limited way of thinking and now you realize that
the nationalist position isn't sustainable because actually there's a lot
of nations on the planet and we can't just be
viciously national to the expense of all our nations because
then we get into fights with our neighbors so we
get world war two you know millions of people die
and eventually Nazism collapses nationalism collapses under its own weight
because in the end people evolve beyond that two-stage orange
stage orange is like the founding of the US Constitution
basically it is democracy it is capitalist is this free
market often it's laissez-faire capitalism it's often neoliberal and often
libertarian here examples include metropolitan USA major cities Japan South
Korea Australia France the United Kingdom this is sort of
the standard kind of government that you expect this is
mostly what American government has been up until now you
know Trump is trying to pull it back towards nationalism
but before before it was being pulled towards nationalism whether
it was conservative or liberal mostly it was staged orange
government you know whether it's George Bush or Bill Clinton
mostly a kind of an orangish level at this level
there's just a belief that the market will solve everything
and that just growing the economy is all that we
really need to do everyone is kind of for themselves
we don't need to have any sort of sort of
collective identity we don't really need to worry about spirituality
we just need more science we need more money we
need more economy we need more technology sort of this
technological scientific fantasy thinking that that will solve all the
problems but of course it doesn't and then you reach
the next level so what's recognized the next level stage
green is the limitations of just unfettered capitalism the limitations
of unfettered capitalism becomes so obvious that we realize that
the free market is really a myth there's no such
thing as the free market because corporations manipulate the market
all the time to their advantage and if these corporations
become very powerful they start to corrupt government and that
capitalism this sort of idea of trickle-down economics doesn't really
work because what happens is that there's a growing and
growing disparity between the lower class and the upper class
to the point where the middle class gets squeezed out
and it becomes easier and easier for the top capitalists
in the country to own the entire country basically and
then to use that wealth and money to do whatever
they want and that is a unhealthy for the society
as a whole it becomes a cancer money becomes a
cancer also we realize that technology and science isn't enough
to the resolve these problems so we go to stage
green stage green is more social democratic more socialistic that
necessarily this that doesn't necessarily mean it's purely socialist or
communist but more sleeting towards socialism anarchism can arise here
at stage green as well anarchism can be both orange
or green depending on which version of anarchism we're talking
about but generally this is liberal is progressive there's some
elements of new ageism and pacifism and hippie ism that
come with stage green of course some of the ideals
here a little bit idealistic and impractical but nevertheless examples
include Canada Germany the Netherlands Scandinavia Switzerland Iceland and parts
of the United States the most progressive parts of the
United States like maybe San Francisco the state of Washington
New York City you know these are the most progressive
parts of America California entire state of California to some
extent is stage green or moving in that direction and
then beyond that you have stage yellow and then finally
stage turquoise the problem with talking about stage yellow and
turquoise when it comes to government politics is that there
are basically no solid stage yellow or turquoise governments in
the world we're starting to see a little bit of
emergence in Northern Europe in Switzerland in the Netherlands and
Scandinavia we're starting to see little glimpses of it but
it's still very early so it's hard to say exactly
what stage yellow let alone stage turquoise government will look
like that's something we're gonna have to invent going forward
and it's challenging I want you to see that it's
challenging to invent this stuff it's not written in a
book somewhere you know what the next level of government
will be we have to figure it out that's difficult
and it's doubly difficult when you have a bunch of
stage blue or orange people who are trying to you
know do their damnedest to make sure that nothing changes
and that we stay stage blue and stage orange and
that we just double down on that because that serves
their agenda generally what I think stage yellow government looks
like is that it's a it's a hybrid between socialism
and capitalism delicately balancing the pros and cons of both
it is moving towards a world government stuff like the
UN but even more so it is very systemic so
it thinks of social problems in a very systemic manner
and it is conscious of the entire spiral in its
conscious of human developmental stages and therefore what it tries
to do is it tries to respect each stage without
trying to oppress each stage or demonize each age and
tries to create systems which help to move people up
the spiral at their own pace that's what yellow looks
like and then turquoise this is hard to say I
don't know turquoise is based on mystical insights a sense
of Gaia I think at turquoise you're gonna have even
a larger sense of world government not an oppressive way
people can still vote and individual nations can still retain
autonomy because their whole ons but basically all nations realize
that they're part of the entire ecosystem of the planet
of Gaia and and spirituality now plays a much more
prom role in the culture and it becomes an aspect
of governance and of politics in a totally different way
than the way that evangelicals or fundamentalist Muslims try to
unify church and state that's not what I'm talking about
stage turquoises is a is it as a mystical type
of spirituality so what's important to understand about these various
stages of political development is that each stage sees the
world in a different way not just sees the world
in a different way but literally the world is a
different way for those types of people people at stage
blue or orange or green they're living in different worlds
there isn't one world there's a blue world there's an
orange world there's a green world and so on but
the tragedy of all this is that the lower stages
anything below stage yellow doesn't understand that there are different
worlds so the reason we have so much conflict is
because the predominant stages and most people in the world
right now are at stage blue orange or green none
of those stages understands that there are stages none of
this these stages understands that there are these these different
worlds and so they try to argue with each other
and fight each other and they never are able to
understand each other for example liberals are not able to
understand stage blue conservatives because the Liberals are stage green
and they think that blue the blue people are crazy
the Trump supporters they seem crazy to stage green liberals
and vice versa to stage blue Trump supporters stage green
liberal hippies social justice whereas they seem crazy but what's
being missed here is the fact that your mind is
constructing the world you're not just thinking about the world
and interpreting the world you're actually part dissipating in constructing
the world and this is lost on everybody sage green
or below there's really two tiers of politics there's tier
1 and tier 2 tier 1 is green orange blue
and everything below tier 2 is yellow and above the
difference between tier 1 and tier 2 is as follows
tier 1 gets hung up on the content and is
ignorant of the deeper structures like we talked about earlier
it's hung up on positions in ideology it's hung up
on specific policy proposals like pro or anti abortion or
pro or anti gun rights it's based in survival it
doesn't know anything but survival it's using politics as a
survival strategy without knowing that it's doing so tier 2
goes meta beyond ideologies and content and looks at the
deeper structure looks at systemic issues and it now recognizes
something beyond survival which is being in consciousness and its
sense of self is significantly expanded and not just limited
to the physical material body I would say less than
2% of the world population is at tier 2 probably
even less than 1% if we really want to be
brutally honest that's the situation we find ourselves in we
desperately need more people to move from tier 1 to
tier 2 if we are to fix our politics and
that is the intention of this series of episodes about
conscious politics conscious politics only begins at tier 2 anything
in tier one is what I call unconscious politics survival
based politics politics based on fish needs at tier two
you're now thinking beyond selfish needs now be careful here
liberals because some of you liberals will say leo but
I am at tier two because I'm a liberal and
I am progressive and I'm thinking beyond my selfish needs
you know I care about the poor I care about
minorities I care about ll the lesbian gay and trans
community and all this so solely oh I'm in tier
two no you're not no you're not be careful real
tier two is when you move beyond some of those
ideological positions you're still coming at it from a place
of survival for example the reason you care about minorities
often as times because you are a minority in a
surger survival to care about minorities of course that's pretty
obvious you know also a lot of times the reason
you care about poor people or about equality and justice
is because you've actually internalized this as an identity aspect
of your own ego and identity is that you care
about others that's still not quite there that's still not
quite tier two of course that's good that you've done
that it's better that you care about others than that
you don't care about others but still you're looking at
it from a survival perspective you're not ready neither there's
something deeper at play here than just survival being and
consciousness is running the show and that's something that you
still need to evolve up towards go check out my
episode spiral dynamics stage yellow if you want to learn
about that and also intro to systems thinking that's a
good episode for you to start to move beyond traditional
Orthodox stage green liberalism alright now let me make some
more fundamental points of how the nature of government first
you are part of a society whether you like it
or not there is no escaping society this is very
important that you admit because some people have a fantasy
that they can escape Society they say well Leo I
can just like earn a million dollars or become a
billionaire and then I can go buy my own private
island just live on my private island and I have
escaped Society so what are you talking about Leo I
can certainly be off on my own no you can't
because the only meaning that your billion dollars has is
thanks to society there's no such thing as money without
society see you can't be a billionaire and live in
luxury and have a private jet and have a private
island and have a fancy mansion with a fast sports
car and fine food and Rolex watches and all this
you can't have this without society somebody's got to manufacture
your private jet someone's got to fly your private jet
for you because you can't fly it yourself or if
you can fly it someone has to teach you how
to fly it someone has to create the gasoline or
the jet fuel to fuel your private plane someone has
to go fish the caviar that you're gonna have in
your private plane someone has to build your mansion someone
has to quarry and mine the granite the fine Italian
marble that you put on your kitchen countertops in your
fancy mansion someone has to defend your private island against
pirates and and invaders and if you say well Leo
I'll just you know I won't I don't care about
money I'm just gonna be like a hermit I'm gonna
give away all my money I'm just gonna go live
off by myself in the woods in the middle of
Alaska deep in the woods there outside of town outside
of civilization and I have escaped society and I'm independent
of society no you're not you're not you're still part
of Alaska you're still part of the United States you're
a United States citizen you aren't protected by the United
States Army and military otherwise Alaska could be conquered and
taken over by Russia you still have access to the
fire department the police they can help various wildlife services
can help you if you are getting attacked by a
bear then they can come and they can handle that
bear for you they provide you with food and resources
you can't live in the wilderness in Alaska without a
gun without matches without lighters without rope without shovels without
axes all of these things are manufactured by society I
want you to understand that you cannot survive outside of
society you will die that's - you anarchists and libertarians
out there some of you who have this really entitled
sense of individualism and you think that you can just
do it all on your own you can't you can't
it's never worked this way survival is vicious you don't
know how tough it is to survive all by yourself
even if you go to youtube and you type in
some survival videos some sort of Bear Grylls type of
[ __ ] or you know he's running around in
the wilderness eating bugs and all this and surviving on
basically nothing with his pocket knife even in those situations
he has a pocket knife he can't manufacture his own
pocket knife he can't manufacture his own axe he can't
manufacture his own tent and he's only out there for
a few days how are you gonna live out there
by yourself for decades not to mention which you're gonna
be bored as hell it's gonna be a miserable existence
for you you're gonna be totally lonely you're gonna be
horny you're gonna be desperate you're gonna be craving to
get back to society to all the luxuries that society
offers you and these luxuries can only exist thanks to
government and thanks to the complexity of the organizational systems
and infrastructure that government has built up over the last
five to ten thousand years so understand the depth of
this problem acknowledge that you are part of a superorganism
the superorganism doesn't just include your country this superorganism is
a superorganism of superorganisms so your country is a superorganism
which includes you but then beyond that the entire world
is a superorganism that includes all countries this is the
case whether you like it or not whether you agree
with the United Nations or not this is the case
that's the reality you need to start acknowledging that you
are part of the superorganism it's very easy to be
arrogant and to act like you're not part of it
in fact that's one of the luxuries of this superorganism
is that it allows you so much autonomy and independence
that you can forget that you're a part of a
tribe a part of a tribe which is part of
a larger try part of a larger tribe of a
larger tribe of a larger tribe which is ultimately the
whole globe this is how reality works it's got many
layers of structure and you are not at the top
the other important point we've got to talk about is
bureaucracy bureaucracy is vital to the functioning of this super
organism and specifically I want to talk about the court
system because people do not understand the significance of the
court system in our culture colloquially we like to make
fun of the court system various kinds of celebrity trials
that are silly and we we talk about all the
various bad verdicts that the court system rules and all
the wrong Supreme Court decisions that happen and we talked
about how lawyers are just money hungry and they're unscrupulous
and untrustworthy and all this sort of stuff but really
the court system the legal system is the very heart
that maintains the structure of government here's how it really
works let's say we're living in a tribal society 10,000
years ago where there was no government this is a
stage purple society there's no court systems here and usually
these tribes there's multiple tribes living in the same area
competing over similar resources so we have two neighboring tribes
we have tribe a and try B I am from
tribe a you are from tribe B now I'm in
tribe a and in my tribal culture you know I'm
a farmer I'm raising livestock I have pigs whatever that
I'm that I'm raising one of my pigs runs away
from me one day and goes towards the border between
your tribe and my tribe now remember there's no firm
legal system here so there's no clearly demarcated border where
my tribe ends and yours begins we have lose territories
and we roughly know where we are but you know
no one's ever bothered to draw a firm clear line
so this pig it doesn't even wander into your territory
but it wanders kind of close it's still in my
territory and I go looking for the pig but before
I find the pig you find the pig and you
steal it for yourself you say oh look a pig
you don't even know that it's my Pig you just
say there's a ball Pig oh this is a nice
fat pig I'll take it for myself you know one
of these pigs will feed my family for a whole
week or for a whole month this is nice so
you grab it then I discover that you stole my
pig and I go to you and I and I
knock on your door and I start yelling at you
give me back my Pig that's my Pig and you
tell me to go [ __ ] myself now me
see in my culture I've been raising this pig for
four years because I have a daughter she needs to
get married or rather I have a son I have
a son who needs to marry one of my neighbor's
daughters right and you know to marry to marry this
beautiful woman we need to provide a big dowry you
don't just marry who you love in a tribal culture
you got to pay for this [ __ ] years
of work off and go for a down payment on
a bride in one of these cultures so I've been
growing this pig this is a giant pig that I've
been raising for years specifically to provide as part of
the dowry this down payment to get this beautiful bride
to my son so that he can procreate and you
know have children I have I can have grandchildren and
then my genes will survive right so I need this
pig this is this is a serious matters it's not
just about food this is something bigger but because there's
no court system to adjudicate this this dispute that you
and I have you know used you steal my pig
and this threatens my very survival and my son's survival
my future lineages survival so I need that pig back
but you have already butchered the pig and already eaten
it so you can't give it back to me so
you send me packing you telling me to go [
__ ] myself so of course I go away because
you know your tribe is full of warriors and stuff
like that I can't just I can't just take you
on by myself so I go back to my tribe
and then I hash my plan I start talking bad
about your tribe how you stole my pig to my
neighbors and I rally my warriors we build weapons we
sharpen our knives and we come in the middle of
the night and we slaughter a few of your children
because we think that's only fair because you killed my
Pig you slaughtered my Pig that pig has cost me
my beautiful grandchildren now I've lost this this beautiful bride
that my son could have had now he had to
set has to settle for some lesser woman who has
a lesser dowry so so I slaughter a few of
your kids and then and then what do we have
we have tribal warfare see of course you get outraged
that I have slaughtered your children just for you slaughtering
my Pig and then you you go and you sneak
in the middle of the night and you slaughter some
of my children you kill my son and then I
get outraged by that and then I go kill your
wife and on and on it goes and this can
go on for hundreds of years literally hundreds of years
can pass and these tribes from that one Pig incident
will become vicious enemies they they go to sleep at
night cursing their neighboring tribe hoping to ethnically cleanse them
out of existence to the point where generations pass and
this clan tribal warfare still rages on to the and
the the the generations that came later they don't even
understand anymore they don't even know how this whole rivalry
began in the first place they forget about the pig
and the the son and the bride if they don't
even know any of this stuff all that they know
is that those are our evil enemies that neighboring tribe
and we must kill them because they're evil that's all
they know this is what the court system was designed
to handle this problem if there's a court system in
place now there is an objective impartial third party to
whom you and I can both go to and I
could plead my case that hey your honor he stole
my Pig and butchered it and this has caused me
grave harm because I can't now pay for for this
bride that my son needs and that other person will
say well your honor but uh I was entitled to
take that pig because the pig was on my land
and we have a clear boundary we can we could
say okay let's let's go to the government and ask
the government where exactly was the boundary was the pig
really in his land because if it was then he
he gets to keep the pig but if it wasn't
then he stole it and we have a system of
what constitutes theft and stealing these various kinds of technical
rules were established so that there could be clear lines
drawn within our society so that people could know what's
right and what's wrong relatively speaking we both agree to
a certain set of laws that we're gonna abide to
and then we adhere to those laws and if one
of us breaks it then we can go to court
and we can adjudicate this and then the judge will
decide the judge is impartial ideally and then the judge
will we'll give a sentence to one of us and
then through this process we can resolve this dispute so
in the end the judge might say you stole my
Pig the order you stole that leo's Pig and and
therefore you owe him $5,000 for that pig and then
you pay that and then I get my restitution we're
happy I don't need to grab my knives you don't
need to grab your knives we don't need to kill
each other that's what the court system allows this is
a brilliant invention somebody had to invent this and it
could only be invented within a government where the government
has a monopoly of force individual citizens are not allowed
to execute each other precisely because if individual citizens are
allowed to execute each other and render their own justice
how can you ensure that the justice that is rendered
is fair and objective because of course I'm gonna think
that I'm right and you're gonna think that you're right
and that's not gonna be enough that leads to clan
warfare we need a third party someone who's impartial to
take care of this for us and this is to
the benefit of both of us because it means that
my son and your children don't get slaughtered that's how
this works fair uncorrupt court systems are vital to maintaining
peace amongst human beings because what they are really is
an orderly process for adjudicating disputes and if there is
not such a process then there will be blood there
will be blood this is how things actually work not
the libertarian free-market fantasy but this is how things actually
work when you don't have government and you can actually
go and read books and study about of tribal cultures
live this is not speculation you can go and find
these tribal cultures today and Papua New Guinea in the
Amazon in Africa and you can study them and in
fact I have some books on my book list go
check that out some important books which talk about these
sorts of examples in my politics section I have a
politics category within the book list the reality is is
that you cannot stop people from organizing at higher levels
because that's what life wants to do that's what makes
governments so difficult you see it's not just that people
come together and are organized into one group called the
government no no no no it's way more complicated than
that if you have a free market people form all
sorts of groups and subgroups groups within groups within groups
within groups people form cabal's gangs syndicates mafias cliques masterminds
think tanks lobbies parties factions cults subcultures religions clubs militias
all of this naturally gets formed if you give people
the freedom to form groups which of course exists in
your libertarian fantasy you libertarians how do you stop people
from forming these groups when people have freedom the freedom
that you love so much you can't you can't stop
them and now you say well well so what yeah
they'll form these groups that's good no problem big problem
because the whole point of forming these groups is to
gain survival advantage people are not just forming these groups
because it's fun people are forming these groups because this
is how they [ __ ] survive this is how
they feed themselves this is how they reproduce so what
happens when I form my religion and you form your
religion and your religion contradicts my religion because my religion
says that I am the best religion and your religion
says that it's the best religion what do we do
then when we don't have a court to adjudicate our
issues we don't have a constitution we don't have a
monopoly of force by some external third-party what happens is
that I saw my religious followers that your religion is
evil and that they need to sharpen their knives and
you do the same and then we have a war
and millions of people die that's what happens in a
free market these various cabal's and syndicates that are formed
are formed precisely so that if i form a group
that can accumulate power can help ourselves to get some
advantage either some technological advantage some strategic advantage some political
advantage some ideological advantage we can form a group we
can become more powerful we can dominate their other groups
we can grow our group to oppress all the other
groups unless something stops it what would that be in
a free-market scenario nothing would stop it and therefore you
get slavery in the current system that we have a
government has been developed to prevent that so the beauty
of our government is that it allows the peaceful coexistence
of all sorts of interesting subgroups there are all sorts
of corporations and lobbies and think tanks and factions and
parties and cults and subcultures and religions and clubs and
militias which exist within just American government alone and they
can all coexist and not slaughter each other or enslave
each other or dominate each other because we have a
court system because we have a constitution which says that
there's freedom of religion and that one religion can't oppress
everybody else one religion for example can't take over the
schools and substitute all the textbooks with its Bible but
if there was no such constitutional mandate and there was
no court system and there was no police force to
enforce this you better [ __ ] believe that the
most powerful religion in our society would do just that
the religion with the most money would hire the most
mercenaries and would print the most Bibles and would take
over the schools and replace the textbooks with Bibles their
Bibles that's what they would do because this is how
selfishness operates this is survival not only do you need
to appreciate like I said in part 1 of this
series that humans are extremely vicious but they're extremely sneaky
and manipulative on top of that people organized to rig
the rules of society in their favor precisely because that
helps them to survive you would be stupid not to
do it what libertarians and anarchists don't understand is that
this this force to organize at higher levels is irrepressible
you cannot stop it even government cannot stop it and
what they misunderstand is how sneaky and manipulative human psyches
are to to accomplish survival they will find every every
loophole within a free-market to oppress and dominate and gain
favor for themselves that is what's going to happen and
they are not gonna have any moral qualms about it
because the majority of people are not at a universal
stage of moral development where they care and love about
Everett and they don't care and love everybody equally this
is less than 1% of the population to get to
a point where morality is widespread throughout culture already requires
thousands of years of government and education on a massive
scale that's the reality next point society is grossly unfair
selfish exploitative and barbaric I'm not just talking of societies
of the past I'm talking about today I'm talking about
America I'm talking even about the most developed countries in
the world grossly barbaric people are in denial about how
unjust society is because they are selfish when you're selfish
you don't care about truth or equality or fairness all
you care about is that which serves you and whatever
you identify with so if you identify with you yourself
your tribe that's all you care about if some other
tribe is oppressed or murdered or extinguished you don't care
that's what selfishness means and most people are at that
level of development most people are too busy following their
survival agenda to care about how others are being exploited
it's not in their benefit to even be aware of
exploitation if they are on the receiving end of the
exploitation routes and what's worse the way that oppression works
it becomes so internalized this oppression in one's own worldview
from birth and from indoctrination that those who are oppressed
do not even recognize that they are being oppressed for
example the women in Saudi Arabia who are oppressed do
not fully recognize that they are oppressed because their culture
teaches them that the suppression is just normal and how
it should be women are not supposed to dress in
skirts or wear makeup or you know expose their hair
and many women in Saudi Arabia have internalized this so
deeply from birth through indoctrination that they actually if you
ask them they honestly will tell you that Oh Leo
I'm not being oppressed this is just all part of
my culture this is part of Islam I'm just being
a good Islamic woman this is how you be a
good Saudi now of course of course there are women
in Saudi Arabia who can see through that there are
even women's rights movements and all this they recently got
the right to drive that was a big big deal
for them so of course many of them do understand
the oppression but many don't many are just so deeply
indoctrinated they don't see it that's the that's the tragedy
of oppression you don't always know that you're oppressed same
thing for example with with many slaves house slaves you
know it's easy if you're house slave to rationalize yourself
at all I'm not even that oppressed because you know
those slaves that are working in the fields they're the
ones who have it terrible and bad I'm actually lucky
to be a house slave a lot of house slaves
thought that way and today we have many wage slaves
we have millions of wage slaves under the capitalist system
which are brutally oppressed economically but they don't even know
that they're economically oppressed they have no idea and those
who are doing the oppressing are in denial about it
because it serves them their employers are of course in
denial about the wage slavery they think it's totally normal
because their culture has normalized it hey this is just
part of capitalism you know you if you don't like
it go get a better job that's see the oppression
is not happening because there's some evil genius individual sitting
there thinking of how to oppress people that's not how
oppression works oppression is just brute survival happening blindly and
then the denial that anything is wrong it's just selfishness
that's all it is the oppression is systemic the oppression
is cultural not individual I'm not just saying that there's
some evil CEO who is you know running some sort
of minimum-wage sweatshop somewhere in America of course there is
that you're plenty of that that's problem but there's if
there's there's a deeper problem the oppression is cultural because
it's the culture it's American culture business culture which allows
employers to suck dry all of the wages of their
employees without compensating them as well as they otherwise would
have if they had some compassion and a larger sense
of self you know not fairly compensating these employees and
kind of sucking them dry using them as wage slaves
this is considered totally normal and in fact necessary within
Wall Street business culture and in fact if a CEO
isn't doing this he will get angry calls from his
stockholders who will demand that he pushed down wages as
much as possible and break unions and deny people bonuses
for their overtime work because the stockholders they want those
dividends and the stockholders don't care about the employees because
the stockholder has a very contracted sense of self just
about his stock portfolio that's all he cares about he
doesn't care about the employees working at the companies that
he owns stock in does it matter to him that's
our system right now and everybody just thinks it's normal
and this is cool and of course when you benefit
from it it is cool it's great to be the
CEO of a giant company where all of the wage
slaves are working for you and therefore you can have
an income which is 5000 times greater than the average
wage that your employees make it was great for Jeff
Bezos it's great for Bill Gates it's great for Steve
Jobs it's great and they don't even know that there's
a problem why not because this is the system they
grew up in this is the culture this is staged
orange is totally normal and their sense of self is
roughly what it was for most of their adult life
they're not really working on growing themselves spiritually and so
that's the system and in fact they might argue well
you know even if I wanted to change the system
it's too hard to change the system that's right even
if Steve Jobs or Elaan musk decided that he okay
I want to be very generous with my employees he'll
he'll get kicked out of the corporation the stockholders and
the the the board room will kick him out that's
what will happen in fact Steve Jobs was kicked out
of Apple now of course not for those same reasons
early in Apple's history Steve Jobs actually got kicked out
of the the company that he himself has started that's
how it works the system is so out of control
that even the CEOs don't control it it's a cultural
problem it's a lack of cultural development and a lack
of collective consciousness not just individual consciousness responsibility needs to
be taken not just at an individual level but at
a collective level this is something that the right-wingers don't
fully understand they love to talk about taking personal responsibility
but they never take collective responsibility part of what it
means to take personal responsibility is that you recognize that
you're part of a collective and that you have collective
responsibility to you see it's not enough to just say
to a poor person all pull yourself by your bootstraps
man go get a second job work harder no there
are systemic cultural problems that need to be changed that
you must first take responsibility for otherwise we can't change
it for example racism is not just an individual problem
it's not just that I'm telling you that you shouldn't
be a racist of course I am telling you that
but hopefully you knew they're not ready as an individual
hopefully you're not a racist but that's not the issue
the deeper issue is that you need to recognize that
there's racism at a systemic level and that that can't
be fixed until you take responsibility for it even though
you yourself as an individual might not be a racist
at all but your culture in your society is racist
or has remnants of racism in it so the Conservatives
are correct it is important to take personal responsibility but
that's a very narrow definition of responsibility personal responsibility has
to go full circle and to include collective responsibility as
well right now in stage orange societies one of the
biggest ways that people are oppressed is not so much
racially or sexually even though that still exists but it's
economically this is one of our greatest struggles is the
economic barbarism that exists in some of those developed countries
right now what I mean by that is that we
have people in our society who have billions of dollars
and millions of dollars way more than they can ever
possibly use they squander this money on stupid things like
golden toilets and private islands and yachts and jets and
all sorts of ridiculousness well at the same time we
have people in society who are actually working two jobs
mothers who are working two jobs can barely sustain their
children can't put their children to proper daycare or send
them to a good school so that they can grow
up and have a decent shot at life and raise
their own consciousness these poor people who are not poor
because they don't work hard they're poor because of how
the whole system is structured you see they were born
it's right into the right family under the right circumstances
mmm they weren't able to get the best private education
at Harvard and so forth therefore they can't have jobs
that pay that awesome money that you need to to
really thrive in life and and so these people are
so busy working every single day as wage slaves just
to meet their basic needs that they are unable to
self actualize they don't have time or energy at the
end of the day to self actualize they don't have
money to buy self-actualization resources like books or courses let
alone to go beyond self-actualization to self transcendence because they
are so low at the lowest stages of Maslow's hierarchy
of needs and this ends up regressing all of society
this is one of our greatest challenges that needs to
be resolved because of this tens of millions of people
are not actual izing their full potential as human beings
they're not becoming great teachers and professors and scientists and
artists and educators and speakers and spiritual teachers and entrepreneurs
the way that they could because their family is barely
able to scrape by see and this ends up costing
all of society enormous lis because all of those people
tens of millions of people are not contributing to society
at their maximum think about all the amazing scientists and
inventors and engineers and artists and entrepreneurs and leaders that
we could have had if our resources were better distributed
this would not just benefit the poor this would benefit
everybody because those amazing scientists would make breakthroughs in cancer
research and those amazing entrepreneurs would cope with new businesses
new websites new apps new technology and then you know
those amazing teachers and educators they would they would educate
our children better it would improve everything for everybody including
the lives of the CEO and the the billionaire's their
lives too would be improved because you know what when
a billionaire gets cancer if it's a rare type of
cancer that has no cure he's dead but if he
wasn't so adamant in sucking up the wage the wages
of all his employees maybe some of his employees could
actually fund their children to go to a nice school
a nice university become actually like a cancer scientist and
come up with a new cure or a solution to
that cancer that the billionaire had so the billionaire is
gonna die with billions of excess dollars because that money
wasn't properly distributed in our society in order to allow
for the majority of its citizens to flourish to their
full potential you see it all interconnects it all comes
back around it's Karma this is why it matters this
is why it matters to you even if you are
comfortable right now even if you're in the upper class
and you know what I'm in the upper class I'm
rich this doesn't affect me I'm rich I've escaped wage
slavery I can live for the rest of my life
comfortably never having to worry about money again so I'm
saying all of this not because I'm poor and I
need to change the system in order to benefit myself
no actually the things that I'm saying are actually gonna
actually be in a sense to my detriment at least
in the short term because what I'm talking about is
actually making it harder for me like I could right
now go and hire a bunch of employees and exploit
them to make a lot of money that would become
harder for me under a new system a more evolved
system but see I'm not thinking about this selfishly in
like what is most best for Leo that's Tier one
I'm thinking about this from tier two not what's best
for Leo but what's best for mankind what's best for
the universe what's best for consciousness and if that happens
to encroach on Leo a little bit if that makes
a little bit harder for me I'm okay with that
that's selflessness that's conscious politics correcting oppression and inequality very
ironically makes the oppressors feel oppressed because that's how selfishness
works so if I'm a slave owner and I have
a hundred slaves who work my plantation if a movement
arises that starts to say that all slavery is immoral
and evil first of all how am I gonna react
am I gonna be sympathetic to that of course not
because it directly threatens my survival I'm the one who
has to give up his slaves I don't want to
do that those slaves give me a cushy life of
course I'm not gonna give it up in fact I'm
gonna go one step further I am going to act
like the victim now cuz this is what the ego
does it's sneaky it's selfish I am gonna act like
the victim and I'm gonna say that you are oppressing
me how dare you take away my slaves that's immoral
and evil look at how unfair you're being it's totally
normal that I have a hundred slaves it's fair it
has to be this way they're not real humans they're
like animals they just work for me this is how
I think this is how the ego has to rationalize
to itself its own selfishness you see it's not about
truth it's not about science or fairness or logic the
logic serves whatever serves me this is devilry this is
how it works the people who are gaining from the
oppressive system manufacture ideologies and narratives which justify first and
foremost not to others but to themselves that what they're
doing is actually good and proper because I cannot be
a slave owner while at the same time I think
that slavery is evil and wrong because that's a cognitive
dissonance in my mind I have to wake up every
morning and feel good about myself that's what the ego
has to do the ego has to feel right all
the time so if the ego is right that means
that owning slaves is right cuz that's what I have
right now if that's scenario we're considering you see so
I'm gonna spin various kinds of narratives I'm gonna bring
in science as well I'm gonna I'm gonna use science
to tell you why those slaves deserve to be my
slaves that's how this works that's what we're dealing with
and of course I'm gonna vehemently resist the changing of
my culture the changing of the norms of my culture
to say that slavery is evil I can't have that
I can't have that written in the books you can't
teach that to children because this conflicts so I'm gonna
I'm gonna start my own lobbying group which is actually
going to gonna print textbooks for children which is gonna
use science and religion to justify why actually slavery is
good and you know why I'm doing all this because
I have children that I need to feed and those
slaves feed my children and what I really care about
is the survival of my children that's selfishness that's how
this works replace slaves or slave owners with CEOs and
Wall Street hedge fund managers it's the same thing just
various degrees of it so of course they're in denial
about it you must be selfishness only works when you're
not conscious of how selfish you're being and how much
it hurts others it only works when you don't care
about others when your circle of concern is limited then
what you can do is you can externalize the suffering
and oppression outside of the circle of concern and then
you can create this little comfortable bubble for yourself to
live in that's the name of the game those in
power do not want to give up power and they
perceive anything that takes away their power as unfair by
definition that's the trick but all oppression and selfishness is
unsustainable in the long run and it ends up backfiring
if a government becomes too unfair the people will take
matters into their own hands there will be protests civil
disobedience and ultimately violence where the solution and coos until
the situation is equalized and that's what many political revolutions
are about equalization of gross and justices that cannot be
resolved in any other way but through violence because the
people who aren't doing the oppressing are so stuck in
their own rationalizations and justifications for their oppression saying that
their oppression is is actually normal and good and just
that you can't convince them otherwise but through violence through
physical force and government ideally is put in place to
reduce that reduce that to reduce these sorts of gross
inequalities and oppressions if it's not doing that then it's
not a good government and therefore the government itself is
corrupt and it needs reform and of course definitely government
can be corrupt all of these forces can corrupt government
as well you know if I'm a slave owner I'm
gonna go pay millions of dollars to Lobby the government
to make sure that slavery is not abolished of course
it makes perfect sense for me to do that another
point that people overlook is that you shouldn't assume that
what's good for you is good for everyone else this
is just not the case the key point here is
that many people profit and survive off the suffering of
others there are entire professions that are designed off the
suffering of others millions of people in our society feed
their children because their job is to pull resources away
from those who need it make them suffer to give
to your children what's good for the nation as a
whole is bad for many companies elites politicians and exploiters
for example peace is bad for the military-industrial complex even
though peace is the ultimate ideal any conscious person understands
this but for those millions of people who work for
the military-industrial complex for them what matters first and foremost
is not peace as some abstraction for some other people
that they don't know like for for the Middle East
it don't care about peace for the Middle East because
they're more concerned about feeding their children and sending their
children to Harvard so these people work in the military-industrial
complex they deny to themselves that there's a problem with
working in the military-industrial complex in fact they create all
sorts of stories and narratives to excuse and to justify
why working in the military-industrial complex is actually good and
they tell them so it's all pieces piece is not
really possible Leigha we have so many enemies abroad what
are you talking about peace this is just some hippy
ideal the fact is we need bombers we need missiles
and weapons and someone's got to do it and so
I'm doing it and I'm protecting the country you're being
selfish first and foremost realize that and the rest is
all sorts of narratives that you spin free healthcare for
example is bad for insurance companies and for many wealthy
doctors and hospitals in America this is especially the case
this is the problem we have right now we have
a we have a healthcare mafia which has a stranglehold
on the entire American healthcare system thousands of people die
unnecessarily every single year why because these hospitals these doctors
and these insurance companies want to rake in as much
money as possible pharmaceutical companies as well does any of
this matter to them how do they justify to themselves
Society has a pre-made set of narratives which make all
of this normal so they go to sleep just fine
at night because you know what what is the big
pharma CEO tell him oh well you know I got
shareholders that I got to work for and this is
a free-market economy it is if some sick kid can't
afford health care you know well he should have worked
harder she should get a she should get a job
his parents should have provided for him you know he
needs to take personal responsibility that's the problem and this
entire health care industry is gonna lobby to the tune
of tens of millions of dollars maybe even hundreds of
millions of dollars to make sure that free health care
free quality health care for all Americans is not offered
by the government because that would put them out of
business how are they gonna feed their children how are
they gonna pay for their golf course and their private
jet how are they gonna buy their Rolex watch see
so in their mind it's not that they're just resisting
free health care it's that they actually think that free
health care is bad it's unamerican it's anti-capitalist it's socialist
it's marxist it's it's it's going too far it's big
government but if your circle of concern actually was truly
universal if you expanded what you considered your sense of
self if you identified with all Americans would you really
be okay with tens of thousands of Americans dying unnecessarily
every year simply because they can't afford some ridiculously overpriced
medication or some ridiculously overpriced surgery what a humane conscious
loving society treat all of its citizens in such a
fashion such a barbaric fashion or they just have to
survive on their own if they get cancer or if
they get you know some heart condition or whatever no
of course not if someone in your family like your
mother got sick and you had the money and the
resources to help her but you didn't because you said
oh well it's her responsibility you know she should have
thought of that before she got sick she should just
pull her up by herself up by the bootstraps not
my problem see you would immediately recognize how barbaric you're
being if you thought that way why is that because
most people most people's sense of self includes their family
their immediate family to the point where they won't allow
an immediate family member to you know go hungry or
to starve to death or to die if they can
help it reasonably you know of course there's limits to
what you can do but the only problem is that
your circle of concern is not wide enough to go
beyond your family and beyond your tribe of people to
everybody universally and that's because you haven't developed yourself to
that level yet free education free high quality education is
very bad for private schools and universities threatens them enormous
lis so of course you're going to lobby against it
another very important point that people overlook is that normativity
does not exist normativity a nerdy philosophical concept what it
means is is that all norms are arbitrary and relative
there are no shoulds in reality there's nothing you should
do nor can you make someone else do what you
think they should do because you made it up therefore
morality is relative government is necessary precisely because normativity doesn't
exist if normativity existed if there was objective morality then
it would be very easy to get people to agree
on it in the same way that for example it's
very easy to get everyone on the planet Earth to
agree about the existence of the Sun you don't need
to debate very hard you don't need to present scientific
data you don't need to you know create elaborate courses
and textbooks to get people to understand that there's a
Sun because it shines every morning when they get up
it's obvious that's what we call objective this is not
the case for morality this is not the case for
thou shalt not kill or thou shalt not steal people
disagree on all these things people have different moralities based
on their sense of self self is relative as well
how you define yourself is all relative which makes normativity
impossible which means that we need to come together and
create a sort of a consensus about what the rules
are of the game we get to make up the
rules there are no rules handed down to us by
God on some stone tablet we got to make up
the rules and that becomes very tricky because who gets
to say what the rules are if everybody knows that
the rules of the game are made up whoa well
that's a very different situation than when most of the
people think that the rules are etched in a stone
tablet most people in society think that the rules of
society and morality are etched on a stone tablet by
God or whatever you justified or ground your morality in
it might be universal principle or whatever and so people
become ideological about what should and shouldn't be done by
humans precisely because it's made up and then they have
to be in denial about the fact that it's made
up because if they admit that it's all made up
then they can't ground an anchor their sense of self
and reality into that you see so what the ego
wants to do is the ego wants to make up
the rules of the game but then to deny that
it made them up it wants to objective eyes them
to reify them the ego wants to objective eyes its
own personal selfishness bias and preferences so if your preference
is that gay sex is dirty then you want to
not just have that as a preference your ego wants
to just wants to say that sex gay sex isn't
just dirty in my opinion from my perspective gay sex
is wrong because it's a abomination in the eyes of
God absolutely so likewise your ego doesn't want to admit
that murder isn't actually objectively wrong why not because otherwise
then you could be murdered and then someone could say
well yeah I murdered your family but it wasn't wrong
and to you that's extremely threatening and so you do
not want to open yourself to that possibility so you
actually want a culture and a society and a government
that objective eise's that murder is wrong because that gives
you comfort and security it also makes you feel good
for not murdering people makes you feel like a good
little boy and a good little girl see that's the
game here very very sneaky this is all the mechanics
of devilry at work at a collective level I also
want you to understand that the entire political spectrum of
left versus right and all the gradations that exist in
between is completely relative what counts as the left or
the right is totally relative relative to the era and
the culture in which you're living right now so what
is considered the left today was not the left a
hundred years ago and vice-versa this relativity is precisely what
allows for the thing called the Overton Window maybe our
heard of it in political discussions the Overton Window can
shift this is sort of like the average or the
the center of gravity of the of the conversation can
shift between left and right depending on era and culture
you know the Overton Window can shift and the reason
that this over would tune window exists at all is
precisely because all political positions are totally relative you make
them up you imagine them there is no true left
and true right slavery for example is considered evil today
but it wasn't 300 years ago and what I'm telling
you is that it's not that the people through years
ago were wrong and that today we're right what I'm
telling you is that there is no right and wrong
we make it up so if we say that slavery
is not evil it's not evil if we say that
slavery is evil it becomes evil and the reason people
get upset by admitting this is precisely because they really
want slavery to be objectively evil in some sort of
concrete sense and that's just not the case which is
precisely why slavery existed see if slavery was truly objectively
evil in a concrete sense slavery would have never existed
by the way you know an interesting point about slavery
the only stage of political development at which slavery guess
abolished is stage orange and above Spile dynamics we're talking
about here so at stage purple red and blue slavery
exists and it's not considered evil only a stage orange
and above so what you consider good and bad right
and wrong are relative to how developed you are and
relative to what your ego is identified with you have
to be very careful about applying today's moral standards and
our own consciousness from today to standards of centuries ago
this is a mistake that many liberals make that I
see is that they they tried to like demonize or
judge people in the past like for example Thomas Jefferson
or some of the founding fathers who many of them
were slave owners you know liberals will often say something
like well the you know they were actually they weren't
really they weren't decent men they were actually evil slave
owners and they were vicious racists and all this and
I mean of course that's true from our perspective today
but we have to acknowledge that that's only true from
our perspective today thanks to all the evolution we've done
over the last 300 years to get to today it
wasn't true back then and so it's improper to apply
standards of today to 300 years ago because when you
do that what you're not being conscious of and what
you're not appreciating what you're taking for granted is that
we we build on the shoulders of giants this is
how evolution works nothing is a given it all has
to be built from scratch it has to be invented
the idea that slavery has evil had to be invented
and spread throughout mainstream culture until the point where it
became so obvious that we don't even question it anymore
today this was not obvious 300 years ago and in
fact many people opposed it we had an entire civil
war over that you see so the the poles of
what is left and what is right is changing and
evolving all the time such that actually what's happening is
that as evolution happens we become more progressive and more
liberal and more liberal and more liberal so the stuff
that many conservatives oppose actually is the stuff that will
become the future after they die in the next generation
and so on and so on and so on and
so on people are always clinging to the status quo
whatever it is doesn't matter what it is whether it's
slavery or racism or sexism or capitalism at it they
cling to it because that's just what they've been indoctrinated
with and they're just conforming it's just conformist consciousness and
then they have to die for the next generation and
slowly you know culture evolves in this fashion this is
what happens and in this way the Overton Window shifts
and shift and sips to the point where today even
the most rabid right-wing conservative today would not argue that
slavery is proper it's unthinkable to argue that today you
would be booed and probably physically attacked in any public
setting where you a serious intellectual person stood up and
say well you know what slavery is actually okay and
proper even the KKK won't say this today that's how
much the Overton Window has shifted to the left relative
to where it was just 150 years ago you know
during the Civil War during the Civil War many people
probably significant chunk of the country would have actually argued
that slavery is proper the reason that the ship could
happen is not because people were wrong and now they're
right it's because there is no right and wrong we
make it up and what I'm telling you is at
this Overton Window in the next 500 years will shift
so radically to the left that the people who are
alive today even the most liberal people who are alive
today if they were just plopped into 500 years in
the future like they took a time machine they would
they would have a conniption when they saw how progressive
society is 500 years from now because they are so
used to the barbarism of today today's barbarism is so
normalized it ain't considered barbarism it will only look like
barbarism from the future all progress is relative to one's
past position you can't compare countries to each other simplistically
the way that people like to do you can't just
take America and Saudi Arabia and just compare them and
so like well Saudi Arabia's left less developed that means
they must be stupid or less intelligent or it must
be the Muslims you know the Muslims are clearly in
an inferior religion because they're not as developed as America
you can't do this you have to appreciate that some
regions of the world are much harder to survive in
and others there were different historical starting points so of
course different countries will be at different levels of development
because they had different strengths and weaknesses and different obstacles
to deal with you know how much harder it is
to create a stable government in certain parts of the
world for example in the Middle East where there was
enormous trial of warfare due to limited resource and very
hard geographic conditions and also for example in Africa some
some some European folks who like to fancy themselves as
superior to Africans you know they will they would like
to create this narrative at all well the Africans are
so backwards Leo if the Africans have the same IQ
as whites and Europeans that how come they don't have
good governments over there well a lot of it has
to do with the geography Africa is a very difficult
continent to survive in the jungles they have the vicious
wild animals mm-hmm you know it's hard to even build
a city in a jungle because the jungle just overruns
it breaks through your cement and concrete rows and everything
breaks your pipes and your plumbing the insects the the
diseases that exist there because it's a swampy sort of
a rainforest a wet moist environment makes building a government
there have much much more hard so yeah they take
all that into account you're comparing apples and oranges also
watch out for romanticizing to pass this is a common
mistake that I see people make especially conservatives somehow they
they say well if we just go back we roll
the clock back to to the 1950s or to the
founding of America the Wild West you know those were
the days where people were free and everything was nice
or if we roll we just roll the clock back
before the the the rise of civilizations where people just
live in little agrarian tribal communities everything was nice back
then you know you live in nature Leos it was
it was beautiful people just live in a Garden of
Eden and they just you know they just foraged for
whatever they wanted to there was ample food and there
was no oppressive governments and everything was nice pail it
wasn't genocide was rampant slavery was rampant famine and disease
were rampant poverty was rampant illiteracy was rampant you have
no idea how terrible it was never forget that 40%
of the Roman population we're slaves and even if they
weren't society cannot go backwards to a simpler time society
is part of evolution evolution is moving everything forward society
must evolve because technology evolves as technology evolves power dynamics
change structures change things that were possible no longer become
possible and sustainable you cannot roll the clock back to
some pre or agrarian society while maintaining airplanes global travel
space satellites global communications telephones smartphones the Internet what are
you what fantasy world are you living in nuclear weapons
and you want to live in some agrarian society you
can't put the genie back in the bottle technology can't
just be forgotten it's here we have to deal with
it advanced complex technologies requires complex logistics chains complex manufacturing
industry universities government subsidies government regulations to make sure all
that stuff works advanced education systems universities schools everything is
interconnected as we develop new advanced technologies this requires radical
cultural change for these technologies to be sustainable and workable
and not to destroy society you know the printing press
the invention of the printing press revolutionized religion you can't
do religion the same way that you used to once
the printing press is invented the power dynamics change with
the printing press all of a sudden it's easy to
print books everyone have their own personal Bible you don't
need priests who preach down to you in Latin because
the Bible is only written in Latin and only of
a to them because every book costs thousands of dollars
and nobody can afford it now everybody can afford it
now the books are translated into common languages that anybody
can read and now all the sudden the the priesthood
loses its power this is what the Protestant Reformation was
was about to some extent you know the democratization of
Christianity the decentralization of the Catholic Church and its hegemony
on religion in Europe see nothing can stay the same
with evolution constant change otherwise you're gonna die and that's
the whole game here is that egos are trying to
play this game so that they can survive long enough
not to go extinct and for their children to go
extinct and so they're trying to manipulate this whole system
they're trying to create an environment for themselves which is
most ideal to their genes of being passed on another
very important point is that society is incredibly complex and
counterintuitive solutions which you think will solve everything and will
help everybody end up actually backfiring and making things worse
this is one of the problems with tier 1 consciousness
and tier 1 cognition is that it thinks that it
has all the easy solutions to society's problems because it
thinks the society is very simple and and it basically
only looks at the status quo it's not looking towards
the future towards new technologies disruptive technologies which are arising
which requires social change it's not thinking about that at
all it's denying that so new technology requires systemic thinking
systemic thinking deals with the counterintuitive nature of complex systems
really go watch my episode intro to systems thinking to
understand this deeper one of the keys to systems thinking
is that you understand that any change you make to
the system in a local area will affect the whole
thing because it's an interconnected system and there are likes
feedback loops and so you study these systems very carefully
before you change or tinker with them because you understand
how dangerous it can be to tinker with the system
also it can be dangerous to maintain the status quo
of the system without anticipating the new environmental changes that
are happening this kind of systemic complex thinking only happens
at tier two because people are too selfish and too
worried about satisfying their own short-term needs at Tier one
stages blue orange and green in order to really be
good systems thinkers systems thinking requires objectivity and this is
what we need badly from our politicians and from our
leaders and from our scientists and from our citizens to
because you can't elect a systems thinker into office unless
the person who's doing the electing is advanced enough to
appreciate the value of systems thinking see you can only
vote as high as you yourself are in your consciousness
and development now some people here will say ah leo
but but but we do have like trump is a
good systems thinker he's really good at manipulating systems he's
so good at he's look he's actually he's a secret
genius because he's so good at manipulating systems this is
not a systems thinking selfish manipulation of a system is
not the same thing as systems thinking a key quality
of systems thinking is that you're not thinking about the
system in ways in which to manipulate it for your
own personal benefit you're thinking about how to make this
system function in a healthy way for the greater good
and of course Trump is the opposite of a systems
thinker Trump is a selfish opportunistic manipulator not a systems
thinker can he exploit a system to satisfy his ego
yeah he's pretty good at that but he ain't no
systems thinker systems-thinking understands the importance of balance delicate balance
between various kinds of dichotomies and dualities such as freedom
versus regulation or capitalism versus socialism or individuals and force
collectivism or masculine versus feminine it understands that taking one
side in any of these debates is gonna lead to
disastrous pathological consequences and you could only start to appreciate
the delicate balance of nature when you get to tier
2 and above really mysticism teaches you the importance of
balance the whole yin-yang thing go study some Taoism so
this is what is missing and remember balance does not
mean that you just split everything down the middle I
am NOT saying that we need to take pro-slavery positions
and anti-slavery positions and just take the middle point between
the two and call that balance that's not balanced that's
devilry true balance is you you look at every situation
carefully and sometimes you make a clear decision like slavery
is clearly not something that our society should tolerate and
that's balance that's proper balance now of course to a
slave owner that doesn't look like balance to a slave
owner his bias projected on to what I just said
makes it look like I am being biased so now
we're wrapping up part 2 there's still so much more
to say so much more foundation to lay believe it
or not we're really going deep here I hope you
can tell now you might wonder believe how do I
know the things that you say here are true and
that they're not just your ideology as always with my
work you need to observe this for your self happening
in life so the solution is observe observe observe study
history study politics observe how political actors behave in the
media in the news on YouTube and elsewhere be open-minded
as you do this be objective be unbiased be selfless
otherwise you're gonna have a totally warped perspective see your
ego is warping how you do your observation so if
you want to do your observation properly to understand the
things that I say you got to really step outside
of any preconceived ideas that you have about politics and
government and also very importantly have mystical experiences mystical experiences
open your heart and open your sense of self to
the most widest levels to the universal levels only really
once you're at a universal level of consciousness and self
can you truly understand what a conscious society looks like
where we care about each other and help each other
and not working against each other where the entire world
becomes your family where your compassion expands to everybody to
your friends and your enemies alike no matter what race
they are what color they are what country they live
in what their political positions are you become conscious that
all of them are an aspect of your own self
and that all of it is deeply interconnected and we're
all in this boat together and that we need to
work together so for that you need to do the
spiritual work be careful not to turn conscious politics into
an ideology who certainly could turn everything I'm saying here
into an ideology that is not what I want you
to do that would be a mistake but anyways that's
enough for today next time I'm going to talk about
more foundational ideas new stuff that I haven't said yet
and we're also going to get into the principles of
conscious politics we're really going to get to define it
I'm gonna give you a list of principles and then
there's going to be a part for as well and
in part four I'm gonna give you specific policy ideas
for how to turn our society into a conscious one
