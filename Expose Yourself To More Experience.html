[Music] if you haven't already check out my second new
youtube channel called actualized clips you'll find the link down
below in the description all right in this episode i
want to focus upon something very basic for just basic
self-help so we're not going to get into some advanced
crazy spirituality here just basic self-help this this will change
how you live your life right look fundamentally what we're
doing here is we're doing personal development we're self-actualizing you're
trying to build a better life for yourself ignoring spirituality
for now you're just trying to build a better life
for yourself you're trying to figure out what life is
and i don't mean at a metaphysical level although hopefully
you're interested in that i talk about that elsewhere but
your you need to at least be able to figure
out what life is so that you can navigate it
for purposes of survival and for purposes of just thriving
if you want to thrive in your life if you
want to build a great life for yourself you have
to figure stuff out how do you do that well
of course you can listen to people telling you answers
but the problem there is that you don't know who
to listen to because just to know who you should
listen to because there's a lot of people you can
listen to and frankly a lot of idiots out there
who you could be listening to so who do you
listen to how do you determine that well you have
to sort of bootstrap your own understanding of life even
if you just want something like a material result like
more sex or more money there's a lot you don't
understand about how to get sex and money getting sex
and money actually is pretty challenging to understand how to
do that it takes you years of trial and error
and experimentation and experience and lots of failure to figure
out just how to achieve that most of these results
that people want but usually don't get it's because getting
them is very counter-intuitive that's a theme we've discussed in
the past in my episode called the counter-intuitive nature of
life but what i want to talk about here is
i want to connect really like four different things i
want to talk about experience i want to talk about
experimentation i want to talk about trial and error and
i want to talk about failure because these four this
is like the the quadrilogy what's what's uh we have
a trinity what would be like a uh the the
quattro of trent of trinity i don't know how you'd
say that doesn't really roll off the tongue very well
so we have this quattro um and uh and this
is crucial really for for mastering your survival and for
personal development so the key really to life is experience
you need experience to be good at something in life
and in essence learning is just experience i have episodes
in the past where i i give you different perspectives
on what learning is we've talked about learning as making
distinctions we've talked about learning as behavior change we've talked
about learning as i'm even forgetting at this point i've
called it something else i've called it observation right learning
equals observation so we've got those three and now we're
bringing sort of the fourth piece learning is experience learning
is experimentation learning is trial and error learning is failure
i was actually this idea for this for this topic
came up for me because first of all i've just
been reflecting on how much experience has played a crucial
role in my own understanding of reality and whatever mastery
of life i have and i'm not claiming to be
some master but i have some degree of it you
might say and whatever degree that i have is all
thanks to experience basically i have more experience of life
than most people although and in those areas where i
don't in those areas i'm not mastering life and so
i do have those areas so don't think that i
have experience across the board there are there are many
areas in which i'm deficient in my experience but also
i was specifically thinking about this topic from the from
the point of view of science because i was thinking
to myself after i released my my big three-part series
deconstructing the myth of science part one two three i
was thinking about it some more and like because i'm
always thinking about science i'm always thinking about what is
science how does science work because it's it's extremely significant
uh but i was thinking about like what what is
the essence of science i'm trying to boil it down
to its essence and i talk about that in that
series but um i sort of gained a new perspective
on it and really if you want to boil science
down to its nub what it is is it's science
is trial and error that is science see we like
to tell ourselves that science is a sophisticated method where
you propose a hypothesis then you test it then you
verify it uh through some sort of objective measures that
maybe there's some sort of consensus building with a community
of other like-minded scientists and they verify your data they
repeat it or they don't it's falsifiable or it's not
falsifiable and all these sorts of concerns but really this
is this is it's too much it's too much this
is not really what science is this is a sort
of a the idea of science the myth of science
that they've constructed within academia and that they teach to
to middle schoolers and to high schoolers and to lay
people but this is really not what science is because
you see you have to ask yourself where did that
method and that formulation of science come from and you
have to really trace it back and you have to
ask yourself like how did the very first humans create
anything like science at all um and don't worry this
is not an episode about science i'm just we're gonna
we're gonna go into some practical stuff here but just
to set this up like think about it humans at
one point were basically like apes living in the forest
or in the savannah we were a little bit smarter
we had better hands and tools and stuff and dexterity
bigger brains but how did we come to understand anything
about nature or the world at all if this doesn't
blow your mind you're not using your mind it's mind-blowing
stuff just the fact that we could know anything at
all is mind-blowing so how did we figure it out
where did it come from because there was no god
who told us how to do it we had to
bootstrap it ourselves and there was no scientific method and
people think like oh well we just used the scientific
method no it didn't exist it so didn't exist you
see that when humans first started figuring out nature they
didn't even know that something like science was a valid
possibility the idea that you would like pick up a
rock and you would throw it up in the air
and then observe it fall up or rise up and
then fall back down and then you would repeat that
as an experiment and you would test that over time
and then you would find patterns and draw conclusions from
that or you would falsify stuff or validate stuff this
this itself had to be discovered somehow it took mankind
tens of thousands of years just to discover that people
people completely take this for granted it was not obvious
that that's how you study nature it was not obvious
that that kind of method would produce valid results and
in fact it's still not obvious that it does you
sort of assume that it does but what if it
doesn't what if you can't study all of nature in
that way what if you need some other way what
would be an alternative way see people don't even think
about this but anyways the way that we bootstrapped ourselves
knowledge-wise as humans epistemically is basically it wasn't through some
sort of grand philosophy it was basically through very dumb
brute force trial and error you just fumble around with
stuff until accidentally eventually you notice a pattern like you
walk outside of your cave every day and you don't
notice anything special but you walk out every day after
day after day after day after day and every time
you walk out you look at the sun sunrise you
see the sun is rising and rising and rising and
rising and rising it all looks the same and so
you're just you expect the sun to rise every day
and then one day you notice after a thousand days
you notice wait a minute the sun isn't rising at
exactly the same place on the horizon it shifts a
little bit like one day it rises left of the
mountain the next day it rises right of the mountain
like there's a mountain range there in the distance and
and then you start to look at that further and
then more days pass and every day you walk out
you look at it and you notice actually the sun
is is moving every day it's moving a little bit
to the right or a little bit to the left
and then you keep watching it and watching and watching
and watching and watching it for years and then eventually
you notice that wait a minute yesterday it was moving
to the right and today it's moving to the left
it changed directions and then you keep watching and watching
it and watching it and watching it for another year
and then you find another day on which it reaches
sort of its apex of moving to the left and
now it starts moving to the right and then you
do this over and over and over and then you
develop some sort of sense of what the sun is
doing it was just an accident basically you discovered this
by accident and really this is the history of most
of science most of science is not done by these
geniuses who can see far into the future most scientific
discoveries they're actually pure accident just trial and error people
fumbling around in the lab doing stuff a lot of
scientific discovery some of the greatest ones were like the
stupidest things they involved no intellect and no theorizing or
any kind of conceptual activity it was literally like somebody
accidentally spilled some some liquid from a flask it dripped
into another into another petri dish and then something happened
the next day they noticed it it's like oh we
discovered a cure for bacteria or infections or i don't
know whatever i mean there's many of these sorts of
examples you can find throughout throughout the history of science
and uh and at first it seems like oh well
these are these are just anomalies these are just lucky
coincidences and this is not really what science is this
is these are like the exceptions to science and then
when you think about it deeper this is what i
was thinking about in regards to this topic because i
was thinking about this deeper and i realized these are
not the exceptions to science this is the heart of
science and of course by science i don't just mean
what's done in a laboratory i mean how you come
to know anything at all about anything like really remember
when you were a kid remember when you were five
years old or eight years old and uh you were
just playing with toys or you were sitting in the
car looking out the window observing the birds or the
sun or the trees or whatever and you were like
a little scientist you were wondering what things are how
they worked you were connecting dots you were noticing patterns
things were mysterious to you and then they stopped being
mysterious you started to understand them grasp them in some
way and sometimes you misunderstood things and then the error
of that was pointed out to you by adults or
just by your own experience and then you you course
corrected and you adjusted and you figured stuff out and
other things you didn't figure out like maybe your parents
abused you and you didn't figure out why and you
still don't know 30 years later you don't know why
why do your parents abuse you you don't know the
signs of the psychology behind why it happened to you
or why the kids school bullied you you still don't
know you still don't understand and that puzzles you and
frustrates you and maybe it plagues you to this day
but other things you do understand like you understand the
rain you understand clouds and you understand the sun to
some degree and how that works and how the weather
works and other things like that but what i'm talking
about is i'm not talking about so much about the
stuff or the ideas and knowledge that adults programmed you
with that's not interesting i'm i'm more interested in how
you figured stuff out for yourself like try to remember
some original insights that you had about the nature of
nature where you actually figured stuff out for yourself adults
didn't tell you and then maybe in fact later some
adult told you or maybe later you read a book
and then what you read in the book just confirmed
what you already discovered for yourself about how parts of
life work so what was happening there experimentation was happening
experience was happening trial and error was happening a lot
of failure was happening like you taught yourself how to
walk somehow how'd you do it through fumbling around and
just experimentation until you figured out how stuff worked of
course you also have sort of strong instincts for that
biologically um as as a little baby or toddler um
so that's not the best example but try to come
up with some examples where you actually learned some stuff
or discovered some stuff on your own through a process
of experimentation and trial and error that's really the essence
of how to figure anything out and most science is
done this way through sort of a brute force process
where you just try a bunch of stuff and then
something something happens you discover something once in a while
pretty rarely most of the stuff you try fails and
it's not interesting and it's not worth very much but
then once in a thousand times something very worthwhile is
discovered and then you remember that and then you share
it with others and that sort of becomes science and
then what happens is that retroactively humans and academics and
philosophers sort of concoct a scientific method that is projected
backwards in time to make the whole process look much
smarter and more intelligent than it really was and then
we fool ourselves into thinking that we're using this process
to discover new stuff when really mostly we're being stupid
and we're discovering new stuff a lot of times just
brute force and accident so anyways enough about science back
to your life in your life to achieve a great
life what you really need is you need massive experience
with life and you can deliberately do this you can
deliberately live your life and set up your life in
such a way that you gain more experience than other
humans you control how quickly you gain experience you control
how you set up the circumstances of your life where
you place yourself in life will determine how much experience
you get and a lot of times what people do
is they get into a sort of a comfortable rut
and they're not building experience very quickly and in this
way they stagnate and they become so comfortable that they
might even grow uncomfortable with any new experiences and then
they're not able to progress very far in their life
and especially if you want to go beyond the center
of gravity of development of your culture and your society
then you have to seriously expose yourself to radical new
experiences a very wide gamut of experiences beyond that of
most people around you this is crucial and there are
many ways to expose yourself to new experiences i mean
it really depends on what you're interested in sort of
mastering and understanding but like you can expose yourself to
new sexual experiences to new intimate relationship experiences to new
friendship experiences like just think about the kind of friends
you've had in your life think about the diversity of
those friends what cultures they were from what kind of
books they've read what kind of interests they had what
kind of relationships they were into what kind of business
activity jobs and career they had it was probably very
narrow most of your friends were probably very like-minded to
you they watched the same entertainment the same media they
read the same books they live in the same place
in the same city even and so you didn't get
a very rich gamut of different experiences whereas think about
what would happen if you were like traveling around the
whole world if you decide to spend the next five
years traveling around the world and developing friendships deliberately with
people from every different culture different religion different philosophies different
age ranges not just your age but older ones imagine
if you befriended somebody who was 80 years old like
you went to a nursing home and found some you
know some board out of his mind old man who
had a lot of life experience you know he traveled
the world maybe he was even like in world war
ii or vietnam and uh maybe he he had three
marriages and he had five children and you know he
had three bankruptcies and he had uh you know two
ordeals and battles with cancer that he survived through and
now he's 80 years old in this nursing home got
nobody to talk to and maybe you befriend this guy
and you pick his brain and you learn from all
of his experiences and you learn from all of his
mistakes you know you ask them you know what were
your biggest mistakes in life what were your biggest regrets
what do you wish you would have done differently what
did you do correctly and so on and so forth
and that's just like one person uh but imagine if
you befriended people who spoke different languages different uh practice
different spiritual schools and techniques uh from all around the
world just imagine how much more diverse your experience set
would be like this alone could completely change your life
in fact not could it it absolutely will but it
takes effort to do that to set that up for
yourself and it's not like i'm wagging my finger at
you here because i myself in this particular department am
deficient i'm not a very social person and um and
there's costs to that like if i did decide to
devote the next five years of my life traveling around
and being super social with all these different people and
picking all their brains that would that would have a
transformative effect on my life like it's obvious that that's
the case hopefully you can see that but it's it's
a matter of like of course also you can build
experience in many other ways so it's a matter of
picking and choosing you know what fits you your personality
style i'm very introverted so that doesn't really fit me
that well although there's a case that can be made
that precisely because it doesn't fit me so well that's
what might grow me the most sometimes you want to
work on your strengths other times you want to work
on your biggest weaknesses it's a little tricky to figure
out you know which which is right for you and
i have spent time in my life periods in my
life where i was extremely social i didn't meet lots
of people thousands of people and i really pushed myself
so there was moments like that in my life and
maybe there will be more of that in the future
i'm just throwing this out as an example though it's
kind of an easy obvious example but but that's just
relationships and friendships what about what about experience with different
kinds of intimate relationships like maybe you've experienced with monogamous
relationships but not with polyamorous ones or maybe you've experienced
being very promiscuous but not committed and monogamous and there's
there's value in exploring that whole terrain and this now
connects with a previous episode i did about learning equals
making distinctions remember that one so there i specifically talked
about i even gave you an exercise to go to
the grocery store buy a bunch of different apples and
and you know taste them all do a taste test
and make distinctions between different kinds and flavors of apples
well look that is in a sense what you're doing
when you're exposing yourself to more experience because not only
are you exposing yourself to more experience then you're applying
that exercise of heightening the contrast between distinctions and making
conscious distinctions between things and then this is where you
really start to make powerful distinctions and you start to
learn differences between things and this allows you to gain
mastery over life so imagine if you were able to
have lots of reference experiences with japanese culture chinese culture
middle eastern culture australian culture american culture european culture and
making distinctions between all of those first of all imagine
how much richer your life would be for that but
secondly this would make your your mind have to be
have to become more complex to be able to accommodate
that no simplistic worldview would be able to hold all
those different diverse reference experiences and you would start to
make some powerful distinctions there [Music] but there's a lot
of ways again like i said that you can gain
experience like you can put yourself into a difficult entrepreneurial
environment where you have to start a business i did
that in my in my mid-20s that was one of
the best things i've did for my growth is exposing
myself to that the experience of building a business the
experience of marketing and sales most people don't expose themselves
to these things and of course the reason most people
stay in their comfort zone is because when you're exposing
yourself to radical new experiences beyond what you're used to
beyond what is the norm of your society or your
childhood or your family situation that you grew up in
all of that presents cognitive dissonance because it challenges your
worldview your mind to open up and to try to
understand things that are outside of what you understood before
because your world view is going to only be as
large as the experience set that it was fed that
it had to accommodate because your mind is pretty lazy
your mind doesn't think too far ahead your mind basically
just struggles to make sense of the limited experiences you've
had of life and then if you want to really
stretch your mind out you got to expose yourself to
new experiences then that forces your mind to grow and
that that's difficult that's challenging sometimes it's scary it's uncomfortable
it makes you struggle it makes you confused you're lost
you don't know how to make sense of things sometimes
your view of the world is flipped upside down like
maybe you were raised as a fundamentalist christian and then
you go live in the middle east in an arab
part of the world and uh you live there for
a few years and it it it makes you completely
now question your christian worldview because now you have this
additional set of reference experiences from your you know living
in an arabic culture and now you start to question
your cultural norms your etiquette your moral system what you
consider good and bad and right and wrong your political
views you start to question these things or what you
can do is you can retreat and you could say
oh this i don't like this and you can you
can fly back home and entrench yourself even deeper into
your old ways and beliefs you see so just very
practically not in some sort of deeply philosophical manner but
just very practically if what you want is an amazing
life then create a plan a long-term strategy for exposing
yourself to more experiences wider experiences more foreign experiences and
just gain more experience in anything or even if you're
not going to go very wide you can also take
this concept narrow and deep as well like for example
let's say you want to become a musician okay well
what's stopping you from being a great musician basically it's
your lack of experience you need so much experience with
music to become a master of music and i don't
just mean listening to different genres of music i could
even mean like even within a single genre of music
you can go so deep on that genre you can
gain so much more experience than you presently have you
can gain so much more experience with different musical instruments
or even with the same musical instrument and you can
keep going deeper and deeper and deeper and so what
happens is as you're gaining this experience you're also of
course playing around with stuff you're experimenting so the experience
you're gaining ideally it's not just passive it's not like
just like you get on a on a boat and
you sail around the world and you gain passive experience
by looking at different cultures and reading different books that's
that's great of course but active experience means that you're
in a situation and you're also trying to manipulate it
too and that's when things get really interesting because when
you start to manipulate any situation that you lack experience
in what happens you fail a lot it's frustrating you
don't get the results you expect you discover that getting
the result you want is much harder than you imagined
and here most people quit and they retreat back into
their comfort zone but what you need to do is
you need to persevere past that and keep pushing yourself
past the failure motivate yourself to to go past the
failure um because there's usually sort of a steep learning
curve with most things that are of any uh value
in life you push past that and then you gain
more experience by failing and failing and failing and by
failing and observing your failing right so remember i said
learning equals observation so you fail and you observe how
you failed and why you failed and then you make
distinctions about what constitutes failure and success in that particular
area so maybe you're sitting at the keyboard you know
at the piano sort of so to speak and you're
a musician and your little playing little melodies constructing them
whatever so it's one thing to just to be listening
to music and making distinctions with music it's another thing
to actually be creating music experiencing what it's like to
be pressing the keys hearing different sounds and making decisions
like oh that sounded awful and all this here i
played a few notes here that actually sounded pretty good
it'll be getting a little melody here whatever and then
you start to build on top of that but then
you fail again and you fail again and the first
piece of music you compose is going to be garbage
but maybe there's going to be a little five second
segment of it which is going to be pretty good
but the rest of it the other three minutes of
it are gonna be garbage um but just by doing
that and completing it you can look at it you
get experience by looking at what you created and then
you can judge it or kind of assess it and
see like well what are the good parts what are
the bad parts what's the difference between the good part
and the bad part and then how can i do
better next time and then this is sort of this
feedback process of learning and this is experience and this
is ultimately what you need to to master life any
area of life it doesn't matter what it is relationships
sexuality business marketing social skills attraction skills spirituality computer science
physics hearts and crafts painting music making film whatever it
is so the problem is that most people there are
several problems most people they don't select early in their
life a domain or two or three or four that
they are going to build some deep experience in instead
what they do is they sort of dabble around and
they don't have a plan for developing deep experience in
anything and because of this they end up working in
a wage slave job at starbucks for the rest of
their life and they can't break free of it because
to look to earn good money in society uh either
you got to be a scammer or some sort of
manipulator and you got to exploit the money out of
somebody which i don't recommend you do i've talked about
this in my uh escape how to escape wage slavery
episode um but the other way is that you have
to actually add value so in this method you're you're
leeching value from the world you're basically stealing this is
the stealing method and by the way this is how
the majority of the money in the world is is
actually made it's through stealing the majority of the money
and wealth in the world is stolen um and who's
it stolen from it's stolen from those people who actually
provide positive value in the world and the way they
provide positive values they they develop some sort of deep
skill in something and how do they develop that deep
skill through massive experience and trial and error and experimentation
failure and that's why it's much easier to steal than
it is to do something constructive and creative because when
you steal the people who steal are the ones who
actually don't have any deep expertise in anything except maybe
stealing itself it's just sort of a paradox but um
and you actually you can you can develop deep expertise
in stealing you can get very very sophisticated and clever
with stealing and hiding the fact that you're even stealing
anything you can make stealing look like it's a like
it's an art form or something some sort of positive
act but anyways we're gonna guess that um let's focus
on something positive here so how do you positively create
something in the world well basically to earn more money
you need to have higher skills this is what's preventing
you from getting a high paying job is your lack
of advanced skills if all you know how to do
is sweep the floor and scrub a toilet then that's
the kind of job you'll get if you have some
better skills like maybe you know how to take restaurant
orders and serve food in a friendly manner then you'll
become a waiter and you'll earn more than scrubbing toilets
and then if you have some higher skills than that
like maybe you know how to build a website through
html coding and javascript and whatever php then you'll earn
even more than a waiter uh because that's you know
you're getting you're getting into high creativity now with those
kinds of skills and those skills take time and effort
to build it's difficult to learn all these different programming
languages and then the more complex the programming language is
the more you're going to get paid for it so
you're going to get paid more for knowing php than
you will for html because php is hard to learn
and you're gonna you're gonna earn more as a c
plus plus programmer then you probably will with php because
c plus plus is harder to do generally speaking and
you can do more with its more robust language there's
there's more stuff you can do although you can earn
quite a lot through php as well um but but
anyways this is sort of what you find is that
the the higher the skill you can develop in a
thing of course it also depends how valuable the thing
is sort of innately some skills you can develop very
highly like maybe you can develop the skill of poetry
very highly but poetry isn't very marketable so you're not
going to earn that much as like a poet although
you could you could become a world-class poet you know
if you build your skill high enough but generally speaking
if it's a skill you're building is something that people
want to buy not like poetry um like music film
writing programming these are all great fields that you could
earn millions of dollars in if you really really really
develop your skill the problem is that of course it's
very difficult and labor intensive and even monotonous to develop
skill in these things and it takes years years and
really a decade or more to develop a really solid
skill in any one of these fields and this is
really the thing that is holding you back the most
i think from succeeding in your life is that you
simply haven't been deliberate about training yourself and practicing enough
to develop skills to high levels and the reason this
is is because it takes a long time to develop
these skills and it takes commitment and you have to
chip into it invest into it over a long period
of time every single day every single week for months
and for years and for a decade or more and
in general people are very bad at doing that without
any kind of support structure so like the reason you
have mathematical skills because you spent 12 years in school
being forced to learn mathematics the reason you have language
skills whatever they you know you have writing speaking is
because again you spent 12 years forced into this system
of sort of factory farm education where you were forced
to learn the writing skills and the speaking skills and
still even after these 12 years your writing skills probably
suck because writing is a very very deep skill set
to build and school doesn't teach it barely at all
i mean it teaches like the basics but it doesn't
teach you how to be a great author of anything
um that's something you have to do on your own
and so see the problem is is that people are
very poor at coming up with a vision of who
they want to be what they want to achieve in
life like 10 years 20 years down the road and
then working towards that every single day they simply lack
the clarity to do that and without the clarity what's
gonna happen is that you're gonna like dabble around and
stuff you're gonna do a little bit of writing for
a week then you get bored with it as soon
as it gets difficult as soon as you see how
shitty of a writer you are you're gonna quit and
you're gonna say oh maybe maybe writing is not my
thing i'm gonna go do music then you try music
for a month and then you realize how bad you
are at that how difficult that is then you quit
that and then you you go and you play some
video games then you say oh maybe i'll become a
video game developer and then you try your hand at
that and then you realize holy video game development is
harder than writing and and and music combined it's it's
it's way harder than both of those things and then
you you you know you move on to something else
and you keep doing this and then but you don't
have anything see you haven't actually built anything in your
life and therefore you're you're a rather useless human you
can't actually create something amazing that's the fundamental problem you
want to know why you're poor if you're poor and
why you struggle to get rich it's really quite simple
it's not because capitalism is holding you back um and
you live under some oppressive system no it's more like
just you you literally don't know how to create anything
amazing you can't discipline yourself to do it you can't
motivate yourself to do it you don't have the vision
to do it and you don't have the skills to
do it and you don't have the experience to do
it and you're not able to persevere past the failure
that will come in trying to do that thing because
even if you have high skills and you attempt to
do something that's creative and amazing you're gonna run into
a lot of failure even with high skills and you
have to have the ability to persevere past that and
to do it anyways and to actually generate that result
so what i notice is that people are very bad
the average person is very bad at generating any kind
of amazing result but they're very good at generating mediocre
results uh like like monkeys at a typewriter just punching
keys they're pretty good at that and so that's why
most people end up working at the at these wage
slave grinding jobs like at the amazon you know warehouse
you know packaging boxes or waiting tables or scrubbing toilets
or doing some sort of menial administrative work stuff like
that right because these these these jobs don't require a
lot of skill or the skill they require is pretty
easy and quick to learn you can learn it in
six months whereas the kind of skill you need to
be a brain surgeon takes maybe 10 or 20 years
to learn and it costs a lot of money to
learn it too likewise learning the skill of how to
build a business this takes years and decades to perfect
that skill and it costs a lot of money too
you need courses books trainings you need social connections you
need to talk to the right people learn from them
a lot of these a lot of these skills you
can't just learn totally from scratch by yourself you really
need to to network with people who are in that
industry who know some of the tricks of the trade
that you can learn with them from them otherwise it's
going to take you too long to learn it yourself
so my biggest advice to those of you who are
young a lot of you watch me in your in
your early 20s is that if you haven't already done
this you got to get like dead serious i mean
dead serious about building this kind of skill set in
something at least at least in one or two or
three areas this is what you're going to use to
climb out of the whole of wage slavery this is
what you're going to use to build a great life
for yourself and if you don't do this you're basically
screwed you're going to be struggling with money for the
rest of your life because you're not a you're really
the bottom line is that you're not a valuable member
of society if you're born into this world and you're
part of this society which you inevitably are there's really
only two choices either you're going to be a drag
on society and you're going to be dragging society down
or you're going to be lifting society up and you
can't lift society up unless you develop a robust set
of experience and you develop some some valuable skills that
society values and even though this is challenging to do
it's much more preferable to help pull society up than
to be a drag on society by by not having
the right skills by not being able to produce an
amazing result so just ask yourself this what area in
life am i able to produce an amazing creative result
in is there any maybe you can write some great
sales copy some amazing sales copy okay great maybe you
can edit a youtube video in a great way okay
great there you you've got something maybe you can compose
a song that's amazing you got something there but i
would bet that most of you listening can't do this
in any area at all and that's the fundamental problem
so what's the solution to that well the solution is
to realize that if you don't correct course and you
don't get serious dead serious about building some of these
skills you're going to be screwed for the rest of
your life you're not going to have a great life
no matter what else you do the these we're just
talking about very fundamentals here these are the fundamentals of
survival um everybody needs this and so then then the
trick just becomes about becoming very clear about what you
want to build that is because you got to focus
so you got to stop dabbling and you got to
actually build something concrete be able to generate at least
one amazing creative result in one area of life whether
it's filmmaking painting music singing dancing i don't know jujitsu
making videos editing videos making video games at the gym
public speaking writing coding being a leader pick at least
one thing and then master that thing and by the
way i talk about this in much greater detail and
length in my life purpose course so if this topic
is resonating with you and you want some actionable steps
on how to do this and how to really pick
which one of these things is right for you that's
what the life purpose course is for it's over 25
hours of exclusive content that's not available elsewhere on the
channel so check that out i kind of hold your
hand and guide you through the entire process of how
to figure this out for yourself um because ideally you're
going to pick something that you're passionate about and not
just any random thing in fact ideally you pick the
thing that you're most passionate about and not just any
random thing and you build that skill uh so for
me in my life just to give you an example
what it's been for me is as early in my
life i there were actually quite a few things that
i was sort of interested in building skills in uh
one was in game design i spent a lot of
time thinking about what it means to design a great
game a fun a fun game fun video game um
i built skill skill in that i've built skill in
web development i spent a lot of time developing websites
and doing graphic design for front ends of websites and
also learn how to do some back end coding and
stuff like that that's that's been very useful for me
i used as a from bootstrap my my first business
and my my early success having those skills was was
valuable and it still serves me today to have that
technical knowledge um and now i've sort of transitioned into
just pure understanding and into public speaking basically um so
like what's really really powerful is if you can build
a skill that's kind of rare that most people don't
even consider to be a skill like for example the
skill that i stumbled into that most people wouldn't even
consider a skill like nobody would teach you how to
do this in any school or in any program but
basically i've i sort of pioneered the skill of understanding
reality itself i sort of stumbled upon it i was
interested in it that's the most passionate thing that i
was into in my life was it was difficult to
figure it out because it was so abstract but like
my entire life i i spent thinking about the nature
of reality and how life works and how everything fits
together interconnects and then i spent literally hundreds of hours
explaining it to myself in my own mind why people
behave this way why is there evil why is there
good you know what is reality and how does knowledge
work how does science work how does science fit together
with with religion and how does that fit together with
mysticism and spirituality and what does it mean for politics
and this how does it all fit together and so
as i was explaining all this and i was doing
this even back in high school back in my college
days you know long before i was doing it professionally
through actualize.org but basically this is the skill of philosophy
and see most people wouldn't consider philosophy to be a
skill or even if they do they would think like
well that's a useless skill it's just mental masturbation and
who's going to pay you money for that i don't
know i make pretty good money doing what i do
but you see it it like it had to be
developed this is something that had to be developed over
over years and really a decade i spent the last
decade mastering this skill and i still haven't really mastered
it i'm still working on that and also figuring out
how to articulate my insights so i i've always had
profound insights the challenge in most of my most of
my challenges how do i articulate it in a way
for other people to understand that's useful to other people
and see so if you're attracted to my content why
is that because there's a certain depth of understanding that
you get here that you don't get anywhere else you
see and so really what i'm selling is i'm selling
my skill of philosophy that i've cultivated within myself and
this is not a skill that you can go to
any school that will teach you how to do this
even the idea to that this could be a skill
that you could develop and monetize even that idea is
like maybe one in a 10 million people in the
world had that idea and actually follow through on it
maybe even less which is why when you find my
content you really resonate with it and you well either
you hate it or you love it but if you
love it then then like you can't get it anywhere
else right sure there are other teachers out there but
you can't quite get the skill that i'm putting forth
here anywhere else not in this way and so you
stick around and maybe you pay some money whatever buy
course hopefully um maybe donate or something right see this
is what i'm talking about um but this took an
enormous amount of experience an enormous amount of trial and
error like there are many videos that i recorded that
i never published why not simply because they didn't meet
my standards like i would consider them failures i would
record it i would look at it and i'd be
like nah i don't like it something about it isn't
quite right it wasn't masterfully articulated i missed some important
points or i made some bad points or whatever and
and then i had to reshoot some videos i reshot
five times in total completely because when i record one
of these videos i don't do any you know cuts
or takes like if i do a two hour talk
it's two hours and if i up anywhere along the
line that's it is i have to redo the whole
thing right but what that taught me is how to
be on point for two hours straight so that i'm
not relying on some sort of editing process and at
first it was very very difficult i had to re-record
most of my episodes twice or thrice in the early
days and it was quite frustrating um when i started
but i knew that if i kept going eventually i
get to the point where i'm at now where now
it's rather effortless i can talk for two three hours
rather effortlessly the biggest problem i have is just like
i get tired after after two and a half hours
of talking just it's physically exhausting um but see that's
something i developed and and recently i've been thinking about
this and i'm like i'm asking myself the question like
how can i take my skill now to the next
level um and i have some ideas about how to
do that you know more contemplation on the sort of
back end on the but sort of on the front
and i've been looking at actually analyzing sort of micro
analyzing different public speakers that i respect and admire and
actually trying to like incorporate some of their some of
their mannerisms and some of their ways of speaking how
to modulate your voice up and down i was thinking
about like how do i change my vocal tonality should
i talk soft should i slow down um whatever right
so all those things i can adjust and over the
you know the next five ten years i hope to
you know fine-tune all that stuff to become really great
at the sort of the front end of the the
speaking just the the literal vocalization of the insights because
that's like half the equation is how do you verbalize
the insights and then how people take it they could
take it positively or negatively depending on what mood i'm
in depending on what voice i use and so forth
and uh you know i can use different rhetorical styles
i can cite more examples or less examples i can
use stories and allegories i can make jokes and make
things more funny and more interesting and more dramatic i
can spice things up or i can be more sort
of like spiritual and energetic sort of that eckhart tolle
osho thing where just i just kind of stare at
you with my eyes more anyways these are all things
variables that i can fine-tune into the future but see
thinking about that five ten years into the future i
can build towards that this is not something i can
just wake up with one day or accomplish in a
single week these are patterns in my way of speaking
and thinking and talking and even the way i use
my hands and the way i use my eyes and
the energy i exude this takes five or ten years
to make a significant transformation with that it's almost like
you know you got crooked teeth you got to put
braces on it and you got to slowly every day
you're you're moving your you know if you're doing that
invisalign treatment thing that they do it like every session
you know you're moving it millimeter by millimeter by millimeter
over a course of a year to realign your teeth
well but the problem with that is that you have
to have a vision of where you want to realign
them to if you don't have a vision of how
you want your teeth to look as like the end
goal and you're not able to work at it you
know millimeter by millimeter every day you're never going to
get there your teeth will always be crooked and so
it is basically with your life but we've almost narrowed
this down too much towards sort of a career skill
i don't want to limit the discussion to just how
to build career skills although that's ridiculously important and most
of you would benefit enormously from implementing this very practical
thing in your life develop a strategy for what kind
of skills you want to build career-wise and how you
can generate some amazing results that will that will totally
open up your life and uh one of the ways
in which it will open up your life is simply
that once you do have some marketable skills you will
be able to land a fairly well paying job maybe
you won't be earning six figures or maybe you will
but even if it's not six figures you'll have enough
where you're you're pretty comfortable and in fact you'll have
a little bit extra that you'll be able to use
to then so you can use that cache to further
expand your acquisition of experience really what we're talking about
here is we're talking about self-investment what people suck at
is investing in themselves long term they waste money on
on games and cars and other frivolous materialistic things when
really all the money you get where do you invest
your money sometimes on my forum i see people saying
like oh i gotta spare five thousand dollars i gotta
spare ten thousand dollars what should i invested in should
i invest it in bitcoin should i invest it in
trading cards or pogs i don't know what do you
wanna invest in all that is dumb what you want
to invest money into is yourself building your skills building
your experience base building your uh your knowledge base so
that might look like buying books or courses or seminars
that's a great way to invest in yourself because those
pay for the rest of your life dividends or travel
that expands your experience base or networking events going to
a conference a lot of times these professional conferences can
have a fairly pricey cost of entry like a ticket
could cost a thousand dollars to a a convention i
remember when i was young i went to the i
don't go to conventions that much but uh you know
these days but like when i was young i went
to the gdc which was the game developers conference that's
held in san francisco every march and it's like a
trade conference for serious game developers it's not it's not
like e3 where it's a bunch of games for the
public this is like there's no games there for the
public this is just like basically uh it's like a
week of serious workshops about the craft of designing games
the business the marketing side of it the coding side
of it the game design side of it the story
telling side of it and you can you can meet
people there who are like industry luminaries and famous people
like i met i met the um i went there
for how many times did i go i think i
only went there once i went there once um back
when i was starting my game career and uh i
bumped into um alexey pagetnoff was actually the the original
programmer of tetris the original tetris i bumped into him
which was really cool um and and yeah you just
bump into interesting people you get you talk with them
you they give you ideas that you haven't even thought
of before and it's maybe business connections too i almost
actually landed a my first game design job i landed
because of a connection that i made there at the
game developers conference with one of the one of the
new studios that was working on a new game so
anyways so and the ticket for that cost like a
thousand dollars plus you got to pay for hotel you
got to pay for food you got to pay for
air travel it's another like 500 bucks there or maybe
even another thousand and so like to have spare money
to be able to afford these kinds of experiences that
expand your general experience of life in specifically a direction
that you are interested in right so that wasn't just
a random convention i went to that was like that
was like my life purpose was to become a game
developer at that point and so that perfectly aligned right
but i had to have the money and the freedom
to do that so that's what having a nice job
will get you it'll get you the money and the
freedom and some of the time off to be able
to then um pick yourself up by your bootstraps even
higher so you keep bootstrapping and bootstrapping yourself in this
way until it sort of becomes this um very positive
upward um virtuous cycle and if you don't have that
in your life then it becomes sort of a downward
cycle where you get stuck working a dead-end job you
hate it you're miserable you're not passionate about anything you
get more depressed and more depressed and you can't motivate
yourself to really build any kind of skills and then
you kind of spiral downwards and downwards you spiral into
alcohol drugs weed porn hanging out with bad friends watching
tv all day long playing stupid video games you just
keep going down this spiral and spiral spiral and then
and then before you know it you're 30 years old
40 years old 50 years old 60 years old and
it's too late to build any skills and you're and
you're so far gone you're so deep and to learn
helplessness and victim mindset that your whole life has been
squandered and then you're not even interested in expanding your
experience base beyond merely even just career skills never mind
career skills how do you get people interested in just
traveling and exploring different cultures and religions and cuisines and
whatever just expanding their their experience base with psychedelics with
spirituality whatever it might be and then these people are
ignorant in a sense we might say that ignorance really
is just nothing other than a lack of experience in
things people who are ignorant about politics just haven't read
very many political books haven't listened to a lot of
good political commentary haven't thought deeply about politics haven't really
wrestled with the ideas therefore they are literally inexperienced with
the ideas that they themselves hold in their mind so
the key that will unlock all of your life very
practically is gaining more experience and being deliberate about it
having a plan having a strategy so that your experience
is leading you towards something it's not just haphazard random
experiences that are just kind of cool or fun or
pleasurable it's not about the pleasure of it although of
course you should try to enjoy the experience when you're
having it but it all boils down to experience because
reality is nothing but experiences we might say and this
exposure to experience is also a very good antidote to
the biggest epistemic problem of all which is belief and
ideology and you know how much i speak about those
things as negatives belief and ideology and self-deception what is
the ultimate solution to all of the epistemic problems how
do you become unself-deceived experience it's experience to know anything
within reality you need deep experience with it and the
deeper the thing you want to know the more experience
you need because the more deceptive it's going to be
and the more experience you need with the deceptions the
more you got to fall into the traps get deceived
then realize oh i've been deceived then correct yourself you
know that that would be a failure and then persevere
past that so perhaps the most profound area in life
where people have the least experience is with epistemology with
the functioning of their own mind you see that itself
is one of these sort of abstract skills that you
should be wary of as most people have no idea
this is even a skill but yet this is one
of the most important skills you can develop in your
life is the abstract skill of becoming deeply experienced with
the trickeries of your own mind how your own mind
fools you how beliefs work how ideology works how you
get trapped into different paradigms how your ego reacts how
it emotes and why it's doing these things for certain
survival purposes that are holding you back that are counterproductive
out of fear and selfishness and judgment and hatred and
all these other things we've talked about unconsciousness so basically
becoming conscious of the functioning of your own mind and
psyche and this is very different from just getting beliefs
see like you can listen to some psychologists on youtube
talking about psychology to you whether it's jordan peterson or
somebody else you can even listen to me talking about
psychology to you you can listen to me talking about
spirituality to you or whatever but what's the use if
you don't have the reference experiences for the things that
are being said riley notice that there's a difference between
like for example me teaching to you about the hero's
journey and you sitting there learning learning it and listening
to it that's not a very deep learning though because
it's all just ideas and beliefs in your mind versus
you actually going and experiencing the hero's journey for yourself
like when i talk about threshold guardians or i talk
about the belly of the beast or i talk about
the wise old wizard these are all standard you know
elements of the hero's journey or the holy grail when
i talk about the holy grail of the hero's journey
do you have a reference experience for that for what
that means what is the holy grail you don't know
probably and so to you this teaching is just like
a cartoon whereas actually if you actually did go on
a hero's journey and you actually faced some threshold guardians
and they kicked your ass and you had to click
your wounds and then you met a wise old wizard
who taught you some lessons um that helped you along
the way it gave you some magic powers maybe like
five meow dmt that helped you along the way and
maybe if you did go to the belly of the
beast or the belly of the whale rather and and
maybe if you did discover some holy grail you see
this is this is this would be experience this is
what would make you a true hero is the experience
of that not reading about in a book not hearing
about it from some crusty old professor who himself hasn't
done it absolutely everything that you think you know about
the world every single word that humans utter only makes
sense to the extent that there's a reference experience to
which that word is pointing to like when i say
the word love you only understand what that means if
you have a reference experience and your depth of understanding
of what love is is limited precisely by your reference
experiences maybe you loved your dog and then it died
well that's like one experience of love that you had
in your life and so if that's your only experience
of love then how how rich is your understanding of
love going to be when i use that word and
if i'm talking about absolute love divine love god's love
metaphysical love what is that to you that says nothing
to you because you have no reference experience for it
it's like a big blank in your mind it's sort
of like when i say antarctica you have a vague
idea of what antarctica is and means because you saw
it on a map maybe you saw a video of
it's somewhere at one point in your life snow mountains
white glaciers whatever penguins and that's it like that's your
whole experience and understanding of antarctica it's extremely limited and
cartoonish whereas there is the actual antarctica that you could
experience but that's like a blank and you're it's missing
see that experience is missing in your mind so the
word antarctica to you doesn't mean very much the way
it would for somebody who's actually lived there for a
few years in the cold with the penguins and whatever
and so it is with all words in the human
language especially with with many spiritual words words like god
or samadhi or mystical experience or psychedelics or consciousness or
nothingness or infinity see you have you have no reference
experience for these things most most of you don't and
so you're trying to understand these things but you're lacking
the reference experiences you see so rather than just spinning
your wheels trying to understand these things in some sort
of conceptual manner what you have to realize is aha
of course i'm lacking the requisite reference experiences and there's
no amount of thinking that's going to solve that problem
for me i have to go and discipline myself to
do some practices to gain the reference experiences that these
words are supposedly pointing to that i don't have like
how do you know what an orgasm is only if
you have a reference experience for it and see there
are certain kinds of orgasms you don't even have reference
experiences for you might be under the impression there's only
one kind of orgasm because you've only had one kind
see so the the limitedness of your reference experiences is
sort of the limits of your reality and it is
what closes your mind down so what i encourage for
you very practically is look ahead five ten years into
the future and ask yourself what kind of investments do
i wanna make into cultivating powerful reference experiences how do
i have to expand my current set of experiences that
will help me to be the person that i want
to be in 10 years what does that practically look
like where do i have to travel to what kind
of people do i have to talk to what kind
of conventions and conferences do i have to go to
what kind of work do i have to do what
kind of practice do i have to do do i
have to meditate what kind of meditation do i need
what kind of uh what kind of mystical experiences am
i missing do i need psychedelics do i not do
i do i need to sleep with certain people or
befriend certain people do i need to just build technical
skills with drawing with painting with music with coding with
speaking with writing with thinking and then especially ask yourself
what kind of abstract skills rare skills that most people
don't even consider think of as skills do i need
to build do i need to have more experience with
how my own internal mechanics of my mind work with
psychology and then get to work building those reference experiences
expanding your experience set and as you're doing that of
course you're also going to be experimenting so experimentation goes
hand in hand with experience the more you experiment and
tinker around in these different areas the more experience you'll
gain and of course failure goes hand in hand with
this and really trial and error as well because when
you first start out you're not going to know what
the right things are to do and that's okay you
don't need to know all the right things what will
compensate for that is your perseverance and your passion as
long as you're passionate about it and you're going to
persevere past the failure and you're able to coach yourself
and almost cheerlead yourself through the failures reframing your failures
as just part of the process and as a stepping
stone towards your ultimate success and your ultimate vision then
the failures will not be serious obstacles you'll keep pushing
and going and going and growing and actually it's the
failures that are going to ultimately generate your success you
have to completely reframe how you think about failure most
people when they go into a project or into some
sort of thing that they want to gain experience and
first of all they're not even thinking about it as
an experience gaining opportunity they're thinking about it how do
i get a result like maybe you're a desperate guy
who's lonely and wants to get laid and you're a
virgin uh and you're like 25 years old and so
you hear about pick up and you go to the
and you just think about okay so i'm going to
go to this club here and then i'm going to
like talk to 10 girls and maybe one of them
will like me and i'm gonna take her home and
she's gonna become my girlfriend you're thinking of it in
those terms you're thinking about like the girlfriend that you're
gonna get from from doing some action whereas really that's
the wrong way to think about it the way you
want to think about it is this is a an
area in my life where i'm lacking an experience the
problem here is not that i don't have a girlfriend
the real problem is i don't have experience so what
i'm doing here is i'm not hunting for a girlfriend
i am immersing myself and gaining a massive amount of
experience i'm gonna over expose myself to experience in this
domain because i'm lacking in it clearly i'm lacking the
skills and then you go you go do that and
then and you're doing it for the experience not for
the girl and then the girl is just a side
effect of that and so the reason that's so powerful
is because when you're doing this you're going to you're
going to lose a lot of girls and so if
you're getting hooked up on you know hung up on
every girl that you're going to lose that's going to
dump you or not text you back or you know
ditch you on a date flake on a date whatever
your like your heart is going to be broken all
along the way and that's going to happen anyways but
even if you're after the experience but but what helps
is when you frame the whole thing in the context
of like this is a journey of me gaining experience
and that even all these cases of girls dumping me
and screwing me over and not texting me back and
whatever that's all failures but also experience and trial and
error and experimentation i'm going to experiment with this whole
process and learn from all those and and in the
end it's not going to be about the final girl
that i get it's going to be about the the
entire process of gaining experience and how that's going to
grow me and change me and so it is into
anything you go into right like you might go into
a project where you want to like create a indie
film and you're just you're just so focused on how
do i create this film how do i get this
film out how do i earn money with this film
and you're just focused on a single film and your
vision there is too small because that single film can
easily fail and in fact it probably will fail any
business you start is likely going to fail any serious
project you undertake is likely going to fail so how
do you compensate for that and still become successful well
your idea of success can't be hinged on any single
project or any single person or any single job it
has to transcend beyond that to the mastery of the
field that that that's in so your goal should not
be to release one successful film your goal should be
to become an amazing filmmaker and to acquire the skills
for doing that and then this one film you're working
on right now that's just a stepping stone towards that
and if it fails it doesn't really matter because you're
going to go on to to the next film and
you're going to make it even better based on the
failures of this current one and if it does succeed
great you'll you'll take the money from that and you'll
funnel it back into your own skill set and then
you'll use it to make it even better filled next
time and you'll learn from your success and also from
the failures that were there as well because even with
every success there's ways you could improve it and do
it better next time same thing with with intimate relationships
you know most people when they get into a relationship
they're so blinded by their infatuation with this other person
that to them the relationship is like well this is
the one the one ultimate relationship and it becomes about
the relationship rather than building the skills that are necessary
to be successful in just any relationship in general like
if what you really want if your goal is to
have a great marriage with children let's say you're a
woman you don't want to sleep around you don't want
to be promiscuous you just want to like a nice
marriage you want to land a great guy and you
know how hard it is to find a great guy
but you're hopeful and maybe you're going to get lucky
and you will bump into that great guy he'll approach
you one day while you're sitting at a coffee shop
or whatever and then you'll hit it off together and
then um and then you'll marry him but you're not
thinking about this properly because yeah you can marry him
but then um do you have the communication skills to
maintain that marriage do you have the relationship skills do
you have the sexual skills that needs to be built
and you're fooling yourself if you think that you're going
to just build that from the ground up with your
dream partner once you meet them that's not gonna happen
uh especially because like if you really do meet your
dream partner you're gonna fall so head over heels in
love with that person you're gonna be so intoxicated for
the first year of that relationship you're gonna forget all
about the the fundamentals of building communication skills and relationship
skills and setting boundaries and building emotional awareness becoming aware
of the internal mechanics of your psyche and ego and
how it manipulates this relationship and how it is acts
needy and selfish and all this which eventually will lead
to its destruction you're going to forget all about that
because you're just going to be running off the fumes
of of passion for the first year and then by
the end of that first year it's going to be
too late because already boundaries will have been crossed mistakes
will have been made that can't be revoked and your
marriage is is is doomed before it even began if
you really care about that then you should have spent
the first 10 years of your life building these skills
practicing practicing practicing practicing reading contemplating making distinctions training your
mind training yourself training your body for what you ultimately
want this is what it takes to become successful in
a thing see it takes attention to detail it takes
a certain meticulousness a certain forethought and planning it takes
a vision it takes a perseverance and commitment it takes
going through this rather mundane process of practice and see
now now it's very clear why the majority of people
are not successful and never will be because they simply
can't discipline themselves to go through this level of meticulousness
the other skill that i sort of develop is um
so i talked about this philosophy skill but another sort
of distinct skill there is just studying my own mind
and how it deceives itself i've spent 10 20 years
doing that like really observing my own self biases and
making distinctions there about what is really going on inside
my own mind and this wasn't done just by reading
a bunch of books it was done by actually working
with my own psyche and my own emotions and introspecting
and there's so this is such a deep skill set
that you can literally spend all your life building this
this skill set you might call the skill set mindfulness
although that might mean other things for you know in
certain contexts but like mindfulness is a great skill to
build there's a lot of these amazing skills to build
the problem is that building most of these skills is
pretty tedious it's not it's not exciting it's not like
watching tv or playing your favorite video game so see
most people what they do is they they like with
their free time what they do they use the majority
of their time just to pay their bills and then
the rest of the free time they use just to
get a little bit of emotional uh excitement as a
compensation for the you know the boring choring chore work
that they did for their job just to pay the
bills and so it just becomes a cycle of like
grinding meaningless work for half the day and then the
other half the day is just recuperating from that grindless
soul sucking work and and you do that through some
sort of low consciousness means such as video games or
tv or youtube or or porn or weed or whatever
and then where where is their time and room within
that cycle for actually developing your skills in something there's
not developing skills takes takes patience it takes energy too
i mean after you after you spend eight hours of
grueling grinding soul-sucking work for your boss you come back
home are you really going to be motivated to build
some skills no you just you want to veg out
you want to eat a pizza and grab a bucket
of ice cream and sit down in front of game
of thrones and just watch a season of it until
you got to go to bed and then restart the
whole thing because because what are you gonna look forward
to tomorrow you just gotta you know in the morning
you gotta wake up early and then go back and
do the whole the whole grant eight hours of grind
again of meaningless soul soul draining grind and then the
cycle continues and it's very difficult to break out of
that cycle i know i've been in that cycle it's
very difficult to break out of that cycle but then
again if you don't you basically have surrendered your entire
life the earlier you are the easier it is to
break out of this cycle most of you who watch
me are in your early 20s and 30s you still
have plenty of time to break out of this cycle
or even to avoid the cycle entirely that would be
the ideal is that you have this stuff planned out
so early in your life like when you're 18 20
years old you've already got everything planned out and you've
already been building skills for the past five or even
10 years really you should be building these skills you
should be doing what i'm telling you here from the
age of like 10 or 12 really so that by
the time you're 20 you've already built up a massive
amount of skills and you can already produce amazing creative
work like i see some people online who are who
have such amazing creative skill like i love i love
to look at digital illustration and art i've actually been
thinking of of doing some actual like projects some some
paid commercial projects within digital illustration and i was i
was looking to hire some some some good digital illustrators
and sometimes i just look through portfolios of illustrators motion
designers graphic designers and so forth um 3d modelers and
like i just i just see people with such incredible
talent and i just i just look at that and
i say like these guys figure it out very very
young it's clear that these people had a clear idea
of like i want to do motion design motion graphics
or i want to be a 3d modeler or i
want to be an animator or i want to be
you know a game developer or a you know a
concept artist and they just did that year after year
after year at the year they became so good their
work is so amazing that hiring this this person is
a no-brainer you look at this person like of course
i would hire this person i would hire this person
in a minute it's just and and these people can
charge like high rates these people can charge 100 to
200 an hour for their work and you're glad to
to pay them that because you know that hiring this
person you're going to get an amazing result if you
need that kind of person for your project this is
how you want to position yourself as that kind of
person and there's really nothing today that is stopping you
from doing that because most of the skills you want
to learn today there's a youtube channel that's for it
that will teach it to you whether it's drawing music
painting programming or if not a youtube channel there's a
website if not a website there's a course there's a
paid course there's a free course there's conferences there's books
there's manuals like it's easier than ever to learn these
skills the problem is that no one is going to
do it for you no one is going to tell
you that you should be building these skills this is
something only you can decide for yourself as the chief
executive of your life only you can make these big
picture decisions for your life your mommy and daddy are
not going to come and knock on your door and
tell you that you got to learn these skills only
you can do that and only you can figure out
what skills do i need what skills fit my personality
fit my strengths fit my passions fit my you know
my vision of where i'm angling to as a human
being how much experience do you have with life the
less experience you have the less capacity you have the
weaker you're going to feel the more you're going to
feel like a victim people who feel like victims don't
have a lot of experience and also they're not good
at reframing failure so they give up too easily failure
is like your greatest friend if there was if there's
one thing you got to do if you're doing basic
life improvement or self-improvement is you got to learn to
reframe every failure that's just a stepping stone towards larger
success you got to put it into a bigger picture
context you're not going to become successful by just doing
small successful things that leads to major success you're gonna
become successful by failing a lot a lot a lot
a lot it's gonna depress you it's gonna it's gonna
demotivate you and you have to push yourself you gotta
get back up you gotta be be your own cheerleader
no one's going to cheerlead you and you got to
keep getting back up and trying and trying trying of
course you don't try the same thing you you adjust
based on the failures right because the failure tells you
what you did wrong if you analyze it if you
observe it carefully within your failure you will find the
keys to what's going to potentially succeed in the future
and this trial and error process allows you to fine-tune
what you're doing until you you hit upon something that
clicks and then finally it makes sense to you the
thing you were failing at now you understand why you
were failing at it you know you were making these
films and nobody nobody was watching them and they kept
getting shitty reviews and you keep asking yourself every time
you released a film and it failed you you kept
asking yourself why does nobody want to watch my movie
why does it keep getting bad reviews you know why
isn't anybody interested in in it when i when i
talk about it well and then you analyze that and
you find those things you know what are the points
well it was the wrong topic it was the right
the wrong actors the wrong writing the wrong script the
wrong genre the wrong whatever and eventually you figure that
out but in the process you're gonna have to change
yourself too you see because this is the ultimate secret
is that the reason that people don't expand their set
of experiences is because it kills you when you've expanded
your experiences enough your ego can't maintain its old self
it's going to collapse parts of your ego are going
to fall away and that is a painful process we
don't like change because change is essentially a form of
death the more the change the closer it is to
death so now you understand the importance of experience what
are you going to do to proactively strategically methodically develop
the kind of experiences you need in life make a
list and think outside the box don't just go for
the sort of standard cliche experiences of like oh i'm
going to travel to paris or whatever i mean maybe
that's good for you i'm not saying don't do that
but like think deeper and think more abstractly too the
material experiences per se are not the most important and
then if you want help figuring that out then check
out my left purpose course all right that's it i'm
done here please click that like button for me and
come check out actualize.org that's my website there you'll find
my blog with exclusive stuff that i'm posting all the
time you'll find my book list uh with hundreds of
books that will help you to expand your experience base

with inner experience developing that my life purpose course is
available there of course you can find that you can
support me if you'd like on patreon.com check out the
second channel actualizedclips and this really takes us into the
concept of mastery what i've been talking about here is
mastery and mastery is something i've covered in life purpose
course mastery is something i have an old old episode
on it's one of the earliest episodes i shot when
i'm still shooting stuff outside um like six or seven
years ago check out my my mastery episode read the
book mastery by george leonard it's part of my book
list uh that was one of the most important self-help
books that i read early on as i discovered the
self-help domain and it it really emphasized the importance of
getting good at something the difficulty is finding what is
that thing that you really want to get good at
and then committing to it and i know it can
be difficult especially if you have a lot of different
passions you might be wondering like well leo how do
i choose which one of those is the right one
can i have multiple am i allowed to split my
energy between two or three different passions well we discuss
all that in life purpose course and help you to
figure out how to focus how to focus on that
a specific one and how to gain clarity about that
so to gain clarity on this requires figuring out what
your top values are and that's a big component of
the life purpose course so really i can't explain it
better than what's explained there so if you're serious about
this go check that out you
