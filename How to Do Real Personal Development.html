hey Leo here fractionalized org and you might be asking
yourself who is this guy and why should I even
listen to him to help me figure out what I
should be doing in my life well I'm sitting here
in front of my little library of books that I've
been reading over the last five years and that I
still continue to read this is not actually all them
I couldn't stack them high enough and then of course
that's not counting all the video products and seminars that
I've attended and audio products that I listen to but
the point being is that it's really not to show
off and to show you how much I've read it's
about creating a sense of certainty that what I have
to say can have value too right because I have
processed a lot of information and this was not done
to impress anybody else this was simply done because I
need to figure this out for myself and I didn't
find any resources out there that were telling me how
this was gonna how this was gonna play out nobody
out there was telling me what I needed to do
to get engaged with life no one was out there
telling me what I needed to do to become rich
and successful no one was out there telling me to
do what to do to become healthy so I need
to go out there and figure it out and I
didn't have those resources and I was coming from an
environment where my family and my friends were doing this
stuff so my family wasn't healthy in fact they were
the opposite my friends weren't successful or healthy either so
I couldn't learn any information from them so I had
to figure it all out of myself and you know
right now we live in an amazing time we live
in a time where you can go out literally and
Google something or type something into YouTube and you're going
to get a free video that tells you how to
do this how to do that how to learn a
new skill how to develop yourself in all these different
ways and that's amazing like three information 20 years ago
you would have just killed for this but with all
that that's out there I find that it's a little
bit low level it's how to write you can go
out there and learn how to do a specific thing
the problem is that you're not going to follow up
with it you're not going to actually do it because
the underlying all that is the engagement that you need
to have the motivation the drive right and also the
big picture some of higher-level strategies that you need because
sometimes what happens in life is that you're fighting really
hard to win the battle and you win the battle
but you end up losing the war and that's because
you've been a bad strategist you've been doing something that
wasn't ultimately leading you towards what was going to make
you happy what was going to make you fulfilled and
so part of the reason that I have these books
here is because when you read through one book you
can get some nice how-to information when you read a
couple hundred books which you get is you get wisdom
you get strategy you start to see that some things
are more important than others and the core of wisdom
is knowing how to put value on things it's knowing
what to pursue and what not to pursue and why
and where it will work in one situation or where
where it won't work in another so what I want
to tell you is that I'm committed to giving you
wisdom I don't want to give you a how-to although
we will be talking about specific techniques and tactics that
you can be using and one two three kind of
checklists that you can go through and I should go
out there and implement but I want to make you
an independent thinker I want to set you up for
success in the long term I don't want you to
just succeed next month I don't want you to succeed
next year I want you to have a successful life
Antonia successful life means living to your full potential so
this this is my study of how to live up
to a full potential how does someone anyone live up
to their full potential no matter where they are whether
they start off poor or whether they're already rich and
on status but I'm still unsatisfied with what they're doing
this information here gives us some clues and of course
it's important that it's not just books because it's very
easy to sit down and read a book and to
start doing empty theorizing for me the real trick and
challenge of self development and success is sure you read
about it but then you actually go out there and
you try it and the value for me has been
and going out there and trying these various different things
and seeing what actually works and why does it work
and what does it work and in which situations certain
things work in which situations do they not work and
who do they work for what types of people do
they work for right and so a lot of what
I'm talking about I try not to talk about anything
in theory at all I never or I really hate
to just talk and not walk my talk so anything
that I talk about whether it's fitness or career advice
or how to get your life in shape or money
success starting a business any of that kind of stuff
I try to always talk about it from personal experience
so these books give me some rounded foundation and some
theory they give me a lot of important conceptual knowledge
but most of it has to be tested because there's
a lot of in these books honestly and a lot
of it is not as effective as it should be
and for me part of the challenge or the last
five years as I was struggling with self-help is figuring
out which aspects of self-help actually work because it took
me a couple years of reading books just to start
to see results from self-help the first few years I
really wasn't seeing anything I was getting a lot of
interesting information but it wasn't making a change in my
life it wasn't making me more engaged it wasn't giving
me more motivation it wasn't making me more successful or
giving more money I had to go out there and
really study figure out you know what are the things
that that trigger the results because that's what I'm about
I don't like just positive thinking and wishy-washy language and
abstract theorizing I want to bring it down earth I
want to get results that are real for me right
whether that means more money better health more happiness better
outlook on life all those things ultimately have to happen
I have to feel them if I don't feel them
I don't care about them so that's where this comes
in the other thing is that I have quite a
bit of experience testing this stuff out I've really tried
to create a rounded well-rounded life for myself whether it's
getting my career into shape getting myself into shape I
don't know if you know this but throughout most of
my life I used to be fat I was overweight
I was 65 pounds heavier than I was right now
and I really struggled to lose weight for a very
long time until I started applying some of the stuff
that I learned and got disciplined about it and then
drop 65 pounds at five months and I've been able
to keep that off for eight years now so sustainable
change right and the question of course is how do
you do stuff like that how do you make positive
changes in your life that actually stick that are sustainable
and that make you happy so right now I'm not
sitting here sucking on my thumb hoping to go eat
some junk food in fact I eat super clean right
now and I love it I feel great about it
and that's not how I was before so part of
the reason I tell you this is not to brag
so much as to show you that it's possible because
the first step is believing that it can be done
the biggest problem I had when I was starting all
this stuff is I didn't know could it be done
I had some ideal wishes that it worked but I
was always skeptical and that skepticism was justified in some
cases because not all this stuff works some of it
is some of it does work but the stuff that
does work and when you figure that out and you
get those nuggets oh boy it's really really worth it
so what I want to help you do here is
to cut the learning curve down right so you're not
spending all this time reading through all these books because
honestly who has time to do that not everyone I've
made a career this is my life is doing this
stuff so now I can make it work but most
of you don't have that time and frankly don't want
that so instead I can cut that learning curve for
you and I promise nothing easy for you're still gonna
have to work for it but I can certainly promise
to eliminate some of the the dead ends that you
would be going down right whether it's your health which
I've really optimized my health to the point where I
eat clean all the time now 100% clean never even
stray one time like no cheat days none of that
stuff and I feel great about it how did I
do that what kind of inner mindsets that I had
to to develop in myself to make that happen I
can share stuff like that with you or how do
you create a business did you know that I created
a an internet business that earned me over a million
dollars in cash profit over the span of about four
years how do you do that and I started that
business with two thousand dollars of investment of cash how
do you do something like that or how do you
become less judgmental of others and less judgmental and critical
of yourself how do you get more excited about what
you're doing in your life how do you create a
career that you really love how do you become successful
in relationships I used to be horrible with relationships in
fact I didn't even know how to talk to women
huge problem for me I was coming from a from
a background was very uncomfortable in and secure with myself
because I was overweight through most of my life that
it really hurt me with dating relationships in the opposite
sex to the point where I was so shy that
I didn't even know how to speak with a girl
and then I took it upon myself to really correct
all of that through a lot of study and a
lot of practice going out there and actually changing things
and I got involved with the with the pickup scene
for a few years and got a lot a lot
of insight and results from that so whatever part of
your life you want to get handled you know I
tried to design my own life and I think that
there are these basic elements that are core to everybody
everybody wants to have good relationships to be happy everybody
needs to have a decent career to be happy everybody
needs to to feel good in their own body and
to be relatively healthy and exercising and eating quality foods
to be happy everybody needs to have certain mindsets that
make them think in a positive way so that you're
not in fear all the time and you're not self
sabotaging and you're not doubtful and anxious all the time
without these basic pillars you can't really have a happy
life and so in trying to create a happy life
for myself I basically had to go in and retool
some of these pillars some of them I was basically
at zero at relationships zero literally the worst thing you
can possibly be that's where I started career I was
a little bit better at because throughout my youth I've
always kind of put attention on that and I figured
that was important so I was a little bit better
there but then again I started my business I had
no business experience at all so basically started that from
scratch and figured it all out somehow and so now
I've brought that pillar up and then of course you
know health I was super unhealthy basically again it's starting
at a zero I grew up in a family where
health was not valued at all and really still isn't
and so I had to kind of bring myself out
of the weeds there so getting these these pillars into
place whatever it is that you need to get into
place and really getting a nice balance across the board
of all those has been a challenge and these books
have helped me do it the seminars that i've watched
i've helped me do it the training that I've gotten
has helped me do it the people that I've interviewed
and talked to have they'll help me do it the
friends that I know and some of the world leading
experts that I've talked to have helped me do it
and the clients that I worked with have shared some
valuable insights with me for what works and what doesn't
work for other people so I encourage you to really
take advantage of this most information I offer is free
you can find it just by the videos on the
site and the articles go ahead and look at those
take advantage of this because this is something that really
cut your learning curve down and let you get your
life taken care of and any part of your life
that's not doing as well as you want it to
we can make it better and I personally have proved
it to myself this is possible in any area of
your life and from everything that I've seen from all
the experts to all my friends to all the clients
that I've worked with it's possible the question is are
you doing it correctly let me show you how
