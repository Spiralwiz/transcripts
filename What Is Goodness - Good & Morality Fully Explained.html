You know, it's funny. It's funny that no one in
your life has ever taught you what goodness is. Isn't
that amazing? None of your teachers, none of your professors,
all your fancy degrees and bachelor's degrees and master's degrees,
and PhDs, and all these experts and all your physics
and all the scientists, and still no one, no one
can give you a simple explanation for what goodness is?
Well, here it is, you've come to the right place.
Even in many spiritual teachings, I noticed that they don't
really talk about goodness, they don't explain what it is.
And I think that's because many of these teachers simply
aren't directly conscious of absolute good. They may be awakened
in various kinds of ways, but they're not deeply conscious
of the absolute good. That is a facet of the
ultimate awakening. Which is why I think that a lot
of times, it's not talked about in many spiritual traditions
like in non duality teachings of certain kinds, in Neo
Advaita teachings in Advaita teachings of certain kinds, it's not
talked about, of course, in other teachings, it is talked
about, so it varies. But good is not merely just
a human thing. It's not just a human quality. And
it's not just a human invention. And it's not purely
a relative thing. Even though of course, mostly, when people
talk about good and bad, they're talking about relative good
and bad, they're talking about the duality of good and
bad. This is not what I mean, when I say,
goodness, when I say goodness, I'm talking about goodness with
a capital G, absolute good. That exists. And you can
become directly conscious of what that is. This is not
a belief, this is not an ideology. This is not
a speculation. This is not a philosophy, this is something
you can become directly conscious of. And I'll just share
the conclusions of my own conscious realizations with you, in
the hope of inspiring you to pursue these realizations for
yourself so that one day you can have these realizations
of goodness for yourself. And then that could possibly improve
your life. And you could use some of the things
I talked about now already to start improving your life
even prior to having had a direct realization of absolute
goodness. You see, it's a little tricky, because most of
us are operating under the materialistic paradigm, sort of the
scientific paradigm. And under this paradigm, we just assume that
reality is neutral. Right? Like atoms aren't good or bad.
They're just neutral. Right? And good, is it's sort of
like an unscientific concept. You might say, like, if I
tried to tell a scientist that the ultimate nature of
reality is absolute goodness, that scientists will say, now, that's
just some hippie nonsense. That just sounds good to you,
Leo. That's like some wishful thinking, bro. Like you've been
smoking too much weed or something. But I mean, this
is not some sort of tangible, quantifiable form a liable
thing like some equation. So there's that kind of bias
there. But notice, again, this is one of those metaphysical,
tricky, sneaky, metaphysical assumptions, hidden assumptions of science, is that
reality must be neutral. And that if you think that
reality is good, somehow you must be crazy. And then,
as the objection goes, you know, well, Leo, if if
reality can be absolutely good, then what about absolute evil?
Shouldn't it also be absolutely evil to balance it out?
Well, it turns out not to be the case. And
I'll explain why in a minute. And an even under
some Buddhist conceptions of reality, and advice and conceptions of
reality, there's also sort of this assumption that consciousness must
just be neutral. Not good. Well, there is such thing
as absolute goodness, I become directly conscious of it for
myself. You can as well There's nothing particularly special about
me in this regard. So what you can become directly
conscious of is that physical reality is the material realization
of absolute good. Physical reality all of it, the physical
universe, as you know, it, is the very embodiment of
absolute good, it's not neutral. It's absolute good. Why? You
might wonder, how can this possibly be the case? Sounds
kind of crazy. Sounds kind of loony? Why would reality
be good? And not neutral? Well consider that all of
the stuff that you consider bad is actually just a
consequence of the way that you judge reality. I mean,
that's literally what bad is, it's a judgment that you
project onto reality. Can you see that a lot of
people can't see this. They think that that bad is
somehow baked into the physical structure of reality. As though
like, theft is actually bad, or murder is actually bad,
or genocide is actually bad. But if you're truly unbiased,
in the way that you look at reality, you can
see you can kind of step back from the situation,
you can see that actually, it's not bad, the badness
that is there is something I'm projecting into it because
it's bad for me. It's bad. From my point of
view, it's bad because I have various sorts of attachments
to how life should unfold. I believe there shouldn't be
theft, I believe there shouldn't be rape, I believe there
shouldn't be murder. And of course, why do I believe
these things? Not because they're absolutely bad. I believe these
things, because all these things are threatening to my own
survival. Pretty obvious, right? But then you might wonder, here's,
here's where it gets kind of tricky, because you might
then think, Okay, well, Leah, if that's true, then shouldn't
goodness just also work in the same way? That goodness
is just also a projection of the human mind? And
it's also just, you know, from a certain point of
view, like maybe you think that I don't know what
sex is good. Children are good, pleasure is good. Food
is good, the kind that you like, I mean, whatever
you think is good. being nice to people, you might
say is good, charity is good. giving donations to the
hungry is good. These sorts of things. And you might
say, well, Leo, isn't that all a projection of, again,
this sort of biased mind. And you're right, it is,
those are projections. Because you're, you're selecting certain things to
be good relative to other things, which are not good.
So you know, giving donations to children you think is
good, whereas abusing children you think is bad. So here,
we're dealing with good as a lowercase g good, relative
good. And this is a projection of the human mind.
But then what people don't realize is that there is
absolute good, absolute good transcends and includes both of the
relative good and bad. So in a sense, what happens
is that you your consciousness expands, and becomes so holistic
and so integrated, that you gain enough meta awareness to
realize that. Yes, the bad stuff is just a projection
of a biased mind. For survival purposes. Yes, the lowercase
g good stuff is also a projection of the selfish
biased mind for survival purposes, because usually what the ego
calls lowercase g good is simply that which serves the
ego. So you're clear about that. But then what happens
is that you break through to a meta consciousness of
the entire dynamic as a whole. All of reality is
hold. And you see that from that ultimate absolute point
of view. It's all absolute good. Good with a uppercase
G. And here, you realize that good is not just
some human thing. Good is that deep existential facet of
ultimate truth of what consciousness is consciousness This is goodness.
And consciousness is all there is, as we've talked about
many times before. We've talked about how reality is one,
we've talked about how it's it's infinity, infinity can only
be one. And the nature of consciousness is good. And
everything else is just a subset of that. Everything else
serves the ultimate good. So why would reality itself and
consciousness itself be the ultimate good? Think about it. If
you had unlimited power, to create any kind of reality
that you could create, of all the possible ones that
you could create, what kind would you create? That would
be the highest good, out of all the possible ones?
The answer is, you would give an infinite number of
beings the opportunity to experience and discover the infinite goodness
of consciousness for themselves. That would be the ultimate good
if you created a reality like that. And here we
are, we are in that reality. Now you say but
Leo, that isn't that circular. So you're saying that the
ultimate good is to create a reality for other beings,
of which there's an infinite number of other ones, to
realize the goodness of reality? That's very tautological. That's like
a recursive definition of goodness, because you're using goodness within
the definition of goodness. Yes, exactly. That's not a bug.
That's a feature. You see, because since reality is a
singularity, an infinite singularity, since it is one, there is
only one reality, and can only ever be one reality.
That one reality has to be at the ultimate absolute
level, has to be its own source and its own
end its own goal and its own point. So what
is the point of reality? You might say? Well, the
point of reality is, of course, just itself. And what
is the point of goodness, the point of goodness is
itself, goodness, is the one thing that is its own
reward. See, you don't do good things. To get something
else, you do other things to reach the good. Like
money by itself is not good. Because you can use
money for all sorts of bad stuff. But goodness, is
good, in and of itself. That's a special property of
goodness, that allows it to hold this absolute position amongst
everything else. So imagine, if you will, an entire universe
in which nothing but good existed? Why wouldn't God create
such a universe if God had infinite power? Well, of
course, that's exactly what God would do. Now, you wonder,
Well, why didn't God do that? But of course God
did. Here we are. This is it, you're sitting inside
of it. You are it. This is absolute good. What
this means is, it's not possible for there to be
a universe that's any better than the one that exists.
This is the ultimate one. The difficulty though here is
that you do not have sufficient consciousness, to understand infinite
goodness. Your definition of infinite goodness is corrupted by your
lack of consciousness and by your selfishness, and all of
your biases and judgments. You see, that's the problem. You
think that God made a mistake in the design of
the universe. Because here you are in the universe is
finite creature, moving around, walking around doing stuff, and stuff
doesn't go your way. But that's only because you're so
self centered, and you're expecting a good universe to be
that which satisfies all of your selfish needs. But of
course, if the universe was structured like that, that wouldn't
be a good universe that would be an evil universe.
because it would suit you, but it wouldn't suit all
the other infinite creatures and beings in the universe. See,
that would be a selfish universe. Instead, what we actually
have is we have a completely selfless universe. A selfless
universe is one which is not biased towards any one
individual being or creature. It's completely neutral, in that it
treats all beings and creatures equally in a certain sense.
It doesn't privilege anyone doesn't put anyone on a pedestal
above any other one. Even though of course, certain creatures
have more abilities and other creatures that of course, that's
obvious. But that doesn't mean that like, for example, a
human is better than a donkey. Just because the human
can do calculus. And a donkey can't know under they're
both equally good as far as the universe is concerned,
that the universe is is, is treating everyone like a
perfect judge would in a courtroom, you had the perfect
judge in the perfect courtroom, he would treat both defendant
and plaintiff equally without any kind of bias or prejudice.
And that's exactly what God does with all of its
creatures. But in so doing, you see the problem from
the creature from an individual creatures point of view, which
is where you're sitting there looking at this thing from,
from an individual creatures point of view, from an individual
human point of view. A lot of times, it doesn't
seem fair, what the judge is doing. And the problem
is that because you're so selfish, you will project your
own selfishness and bias and judgments onto the judge. And
you will think that the judge is making some sort
of error in his judgments, because he's not siding with
you, because you want the judge to side with you,
because you're selfish. And of course, if the judge did
side with you, for some sort of biased, partial reason,
that wasn't part of the truth, then that would be
a bad judge, that would be an evil judge, that
would be a corrupt judge. But that's precisely what she
wants he, you don't really want a good judge, when
you go into a courtroom, what you really want is
you want a judge who's corrupt in your favor, who
will favor you who's partial towards your side. Because you
don't care about the truth, you care about winning. And
you care about winning, because you care about survival. So
from your point of view, it seems like the universe
has a lot of bad stuff in it. Actually, it
doesn't. The universe is absolutely good. But you need to
have enough perspective, and meta awareness and distance in order
to be able to see that you can't see that
from your little egoic. self centered perspective. See, one of
the most profound realizations you can have in your life
in this work that we're doing is to realize that
only good can exist, nothing else can exist. In fact,
existence is goodness, they're synonymous, they're identical. There's nothing bad
that's ever happened in the entire universe. It's all only
good. If you have infinite consciousness to see all the
goodness, if your consciousness is less than infinite, you won't
be able to see and appreciate all of the goodness,
because infinite goodness requires infinite consciousness, because actually, they're the
same thing. They're identical. Any consciousness which is less than
infinite, is going to be partial, and is not going
to be infinitely good. Non goodness is literally impossible for
the universe. Other than that, as a illusion, or as
a misperception of the universe. So anytime you look into
the universe, and you see something that you don't like,
and you think it isn't good, really, you think that
that's because God made a mistake in the construction of
the universe? Actually, it's us making the mistake in perceiving
that part of the universe. You don't see how that
part fits into all the other parts and adds up
to absolute goodness. See, because your perspective is, is always
finite. It's missing how all the finite pieces interconnect into
infinite goodness. So to see the apps Good requires infinite
perception, you need to literally be able to see how
every piece fits together and serves the larger hole. If
you're looking at individual local areas of the universe, then
yeah, it'll seem like you're seeing bad stuff. But really
all that bad stuff. If you zoom out far enough,
you will see how it plays into the ultimate goodness
of everything. Now, you might wonder, well, Leo, what about
evil? Well, there is no evil, of course. That's the
beauty of this. When you realize absolute goodness, you automatically
solve the problem of evil, evil is just a problem
of perception. So this age old Phil Scott's philosophical problem
that, that philosophers and theologians and even scientists have, you
know, debated and wonder about for 1000s of years? Like
how could How could God allow for evil to exist?
Or alive? Why does the universe contain so much evil
within it? And the answer is just so simple. Stop
projecting the evil onto the universe, and you will stop
seeing it. It says though, you're looking at the universe
through a through a cracked set of glasses. And you're
wondering, why, why is why they mean, everything looks so
cracked. It's your glasses. It's not the universe itself, it's
cracked. So here's God's existential dilemma. You see, God itself
is infinite goodness, that's literally what God is. God's greatest
wish for you because it's infinitely good is for you
to realize that you are infinitely good, and that everything
is you and that everything is infinitely good. But here's
the problem. If God forces upon you, goodness, then you
actually won't be able to realize goodness, you're going to
recoil in horror. See, you might wonder like, well, Leo,
why didn't God just create a universe in which every
human was just automatically? Perfectly good? Why would God create
imperfect humans? And the reason is precisely because God is
good. Because God is good. God must allow you the
freedom to choose whether you want to be good or
not. Because goodness cannot be coerced. Goodness has to be
chosen, consciously chosen. If it wasn't that it wouldn't be
good. You see. That's the trick with goodness. You might
think you can force goodness onto somebody else, but actually
you can't. Because the very essence the very heart of
being good is that it's uncoerced. It's unmanned, dated. You
shouldn't be good. See, a lot of times, religious people
and moralistic people, they have this, this huge mental hang
up, in that they say Leo, but what's stopping me
from being evil? What's stopping me from raping people and
killing people and, and thieving and pillaging and genocide and
doing all this sort of stuff? What's stopping me from
doing that? If there are no rules, no objective rules
in the universe? If God is not going to punish
me, for thieving and killing, then why shouldn't I do
it? And of course, the answer is so obvious. The
answer is that nothing is stopping you. If you are
at the level of consciousness, such that you desire to
rape and kill and thieve and do violence onto others,
and to harm others. If that's your level of consciousness.
Then you see, if God was to force you to
be good, if God created rules and punishments that required
you to be good, then you wouldn't really be good.
You would just be pretend pretending to be good under
threat of punishment in the same way that like in
a dictatorship if You know, a journalist is told that
he must write some sort of puff piece about the
dictator, praising the dictator in, in the newspaper under threat
of, of his family being tortured, of course he's gonna
write that puff piece. Now does that then does that
make it true? Is this puff piece about the dictator?
True? No, of course not. He's just writing it because
he has to, because he's coerced into it. Because of
course, he wants his family to not get tortured. So
obviously, he's going to do that it doesn't make any
make it true. Well, likewise, if imagine, see what you
want, as you, you sort of want God to do
the same thing to you. It's like you want God
to be this dictator, and to dictate goodness to you.
But if God did that, then it wouldn't be really
true, true goodness, you would be acting out of fear.
And you wouldn't be consciously selecting goodness, you would only
be selecting it because you want to avoid some punishment.
But that's not goodness. You see, that's evil. That's selfishness.
When you're acting out of fear, and you're acting out
of self preservation, you're being selfish. You're not being good.
To be good. You have to be selfless. And so
the very odd and mysterious thing about goodness, is that
it turns out that actually you can't truly be good,
unless you choose to be good without any coercion. For
no reason whatsoever. Yeah, for no other reason than simply
because you like being good. See, it's only when the
joy of being good, overpowers every other drive and desire
and craving and priority that you have, only then will
you truly be good. If there's any higher priority in
your life, then pure goodness for its own sake, then
you're not good. You're actually evil. See, what you truly
have to realize here is that goodness is its own
end. And this is absolutely crucial, because God has to
be its own end, because God is one there's nothing
outside of God. See, it can't have some sort of
other purpose. It can't have an ulterior motive, its motive
has to be itself and what it is, is pure
goodness or just the pure joy of existence itself, the
pure joy of consciousness itself on clouded and uncorrupted by
any kind of self biases, any kind of needs for
anything else. Just purely directly existence, purely directly consciousness, purely
directly truth, purely directly goodness. And so of course, it
must be self justifying, self reinforcing and completely tautological. This
is such a profound tautology, that literally, if you become
conscious of this, you realize that nothing but goodness can
ever exist. And that is the very structure of reality
and the very structure of God. And precisely because that
is its structure. That is what goodness is, goodness is
such a structure that nothing other than it can exist.
That's what it means to say that it's absolute, is
completely all encompassing. And that's just the nature of infinity.
There can't be an infinity without goodness, because they're identical.
And of course, there can't be anything outside of our
of infinity. And there can't be anything prior to infinity
because infinity occupies every possible domain and every possible dimension,
every possible possibility, every possible space and place that anything
could be. So here's sort of the genius of God
is that God's consciousness is so pure and so uncorrupted
by any kind of biases. It's so perfectly neutral, that
it it sees the beauty of every possible form that
could exist. And it welcomes all of it. It accepts
all of it. embraces all of bid and loves all
of it, because it sees that all of that is
itself. That's what it is. It's everything. It's everything that
could possibly be. It's the sum total of everything that
could possibly be. So the mistake the ego mind makes
here just says, like this, it thinks like this. Well,
it sort of imagines that God is this being sitting
up in the cloud. And then when God is creating
the universe, God is thinking to itself, Well, should we
have monkeys or rhinoceroses, it's like, well, the monkeys, they're
kind of smelly and ugly. So we won't have too
many of them. Instead, we'll have rhinoceroses. And then it
says, Well, should we have humans or not? It's like,
well, yeah, humans, okay, we'll have humans, but we'll only
have these kinds of humans, but not those kinds of
humans. And then so you think that God is is
created as sitting there. And he's very picky and choosey
about, about how it's creating stuff. But of course, this
is this is a silly, childish, egotistical notion of God.
Actually, God is not a person, God is completely impersonal.
It's the universe. It's the field of infinite consciousness that
gives rise to everything that we're sitting in right now,
communicating through, so. But see, in a sense, God is
so neutral, and so unbiased, that it allows everything within
it to arise, without any kind of judgment or rejection
of it, it embraces all of that, and that is
the ultimate good, such that whatever arises is the good.
So really, the problem of evil here is overcome, not
in the way that people conventionally think of, of removing
all the evil stuff from existence, but rather by embracing
all the, quote unquote, evil stuff, embracing it with such
depth and metaphysical profundity, you embrace it so totally, that
literally, it ceases to be evil anymore. Because what you
realize is that anything that was evil was not actually
objectively evil. It was only evil in your inability and
lack of consciousness to comprehend its role in the larger
totality. And when you comprehend its role, you understand it,
and also you fully embrace it with consciousness and love.
It literally ceases to be evil, and then you realize
it never was evil. It was simply your own biases
and selfishness, which prevented you from realizing that that evil
was actually good. That's the ultimate mindfuck that people don't
appreciate about good versus evil. Evil is not an objective
problem. Evil is a problem of perception. It's a problem
of consciousness. And since reality is nothing but consciousness that's
it that solves the whole problem. Now, here, people make
the mistake of thinking like, well, Leo, so So does
that mean that when I become very, very conscious than
raping, it will no longer happen, and robbery will no
longer happen, war will no longer happen and in genocide
will no longer happen. No, I'm not saying that. All
of those things will happen. war will continue to happen
for 1000s more years, the thing that will change is
not the war, what will change is your understanding and
perception of the war, the war will get so recontextualized
that you will see and understand and accept the war
as being part of the larger whole of which is
just a part of you, yourself. Because war is just
a part of what you are because you are the
whole universe. So anything in the universe is just a
party view. So you see that and you recognize it
and you embrace it, and you accept it. And then
even though people could still be killing each other with
rockets and guns, and so on, you're gonna you're gonna
see the larger context. So war will get recontextualized for
you. Likewise with rape, theft and murder and any other
evil that you can imagine. Now, of course, understandably, a
lot of people don't like this idea. This is very
threatening to them. And that's because they lack the consciousness.
They lack the development. They lack the open mindedness, they
lack the non judgement, and they don't, they literally do
not have the ability. They're not strong enough. Their mind
is not strong enough to accept All of themselves, their
mind is busy rejecting certain aspects of unreality. And that's
because they're not concerned about truth, they're concerned about their
own personal survival, they've confused their own self preservation. For
the ultimate good. You see, so to realize the ultimate
good, this requires that you sacrifice yourself a little bit.
And most people aren't interested in sacrificing themselves. They don't
like that. They have a lot of preconceived ideas. They've
developed enemies, they've made enemies out of people out of
different ethnic groups out of different cultures, out of different
organizations after after, of different political parties, they've made enemies
out of these different things, different facets of reality. And
so now Good luck trying to get them to admit
that actually all those enemies and all that bad stuff
that you were fighting against your whole life, that all
that stuff was actually absolute good. How do you convince
a person of that, especially when they've been personally deeply
wounded or injured by some group of people or some
individual or some ideology? Like, for example, if you're, if
your parents were killed in Vietnam, by the communist regime
there today you might be living in, in America as
a sort of a Vietnamese American, but you know, you
know, your family history, and you know, how, like, someone
in your family was killed by these horrible communists. And
so now, you, you feel that these communists are evil?
And that communism as a whole is an evil ideology.
And of course, why do you feel that way? Because
it personally hurt you. And the deeper it hurt you,
the harder it will be for me to try to
convince you that actually, communism is part of absolute good.
Now it doesn't. Communism here, I'm not, I'm not picking
on communism, per se. I'm not trying to convince you
of the validity of communism here. I'm just, you know,
could I could use an example, with capitalism the same
way. I mean, a lot of people these days hold
capitalism as evil. Many progressives and socialists and liberals and
spile, dynamics stage green folks, you know, they see capitalism
as the greatest evil. And why do they see it
that way? Well, because they were hurt by it in
some way. Ultimately, that's ultimately what it all goes back
to. The stuff that you consider evil is simply that
stuff, which hurt you, in some way, hurt your ego,
hurt your survival. So maybe you're a progressive today, but
you went to school, and you got a bunch of
student loan debt. And now you're stuck in wage slavery,
and this naturally upsets you. And there are these elite
people, these capitalists who have a lot of money, you
know, these billionaires, whereas you, you know, you're, you're working
some dead end job for years and years just to
pay off your student loan debts, and you don't have
a lot of prospects in your life, and you feel
that the system is rigged against you. And in a
sense, you're right. I mean, structurally speaking, the system is
rigged against you. But nevertheless, I mean, it's still all
absolute good. But you can't see it that way. Because
you're not careful enough about yourself biases. See, when I
talk about self biases, you don't take that whole notion
seriously enough, you think I'm just toying around. But I'm
not toying around. Because self bias is at the very
heart of the whole problem of trying to understand reality,
and straightening yourself out about the nature of reality. See,
as long as you don't take self bias seriously, you're
going to be deeply self biased, and you're gonna be
projecting yourself biases all over the place, and you're not
going to be able to see reality. Clearly. The reason
I obsess about self bias so much, is because my
top concern is to see reality clearly. And obviously, the
only way you can see reality clearly is if you
eliminate every single self bias you have, including your preference
for being alive. See, that's your biggest self bias right
there. If I put a gun to your head, and
threaten to pull the trigger, you're gonna have a very
strong self bias for that trigger not to be pulled.
And you might say, well, what's the problem with that?
Well, the problem with that is that that that, that
dynamic, that self bias runs your entire life and distorts
your entire perception of reality, and from that all your
other problems materialize So the reason that so few people
understand absolute good, the reason your teachers and professors and
parents and your clergy and whatever, your preacher and your
Imam, the reason the reason they didn't teach you about
absolute good, is because how could they, they were too
self biased to ever realize absolute good. So they can't
teach it to you. And of course, they're all going
to deny that what I'm saying here is true. Because
their self biases require them to deny it. Even to
just admit that what I'm saying here is true, is
already deeply, deeply threatening to any self biased person, because
they don't have to admit how selfish they are, how
selfish they've been. So it's your very selfishness, which prohibits
you from seeing this. So God is infinite good, because
God is infinitely selfless. So in a sense, we could
say that the universe is totally neutral in the way
that science and materialism tend to hold it. The universe
is totally neutral. But what you have to what the
scientists materialist don't fully realize is that it's not enough
just to say that you have to actually realize what
ultimate neutrality means. Ultimate neutrality is just not it's not
just like, oh, well, yeah, it's just neutral. Mineral ultimate
neutrality leads to absolute good. So the two are not
really in, in conflict with each other. It's just that
for the scientist, the idea of neutrality, especially an idea
for the mystic, for the awakened one for the sage,
the idea of neutrality is actually absolute good. And it's
utterly mind blowing, profound and amazing. When you have this
realization of good, it really feels like good, it doesn't
feel neutral. It feels really good. It feels like infinite
good. It feels so good. It's like grounding and goodness.
It feels like you're dying in the goodness, that's how
good it is. It's scary, good. It's infinitely good. It's
absolutely good. Now, you might wonder, have you ever thought
about this? If God exists, what stops God from being
evil? Think about it. What stops God from being evil?
Those of you who think that there needs to be
fixed objective moral rules or shoulds. Like you shouldn't murder,
you shouldn't steal, you shouldn't pillage whatever. For those of
you who believe in these sorts of rules, well, but
so are you saying that God is bound by these
rules to? Is there a rule that says that God
should be good? But if there is, where did this
rule come from? Because God is the Creator of everything.
So if God created everything, then God must have created
this rule. So God created this rule for himself. So
why didn't God create some other rule? I mean, if
he said, If he created this really could create a
different rule. So you see the problem here. Since God
is the highest authority, there can't be a higher authority
above God, because any higher authority about God would itself
be God. So God can't have any rules placed upon
it. God has to be infinite and unlimited. But that
being the case, you wonder, why can't God be evil?
And the reason God isn't evil, is not because it
has to not be evil, but simply because it's totally
selfless. And so it chooses good. Why? For no reason
whatsoever. There's not a reason for God to choose to
be good other than goodness itself. God is good because
if you were infinitely conscious and utterly intelligent, you would
choose to be good there'd there will be absolutely nothing
for you to gain in being evil. You see, the
only reason anyone has ever in the history of mankind
ever committed a single evil action. A single selfish action
is because there was something that they We're going to
gain from it. Whether it was some money, or some
sex, or some power, or some prestige, or some celebrity,
some fame, some big house, a fancy car, whatever. All
of this is done. Because you think you're going to
gain something by getting some material thing. But since God
is infinite, and God is the entire universe, God has
literally nothing to gain from being selfish, because it already
owns the entire universe. So there's nothing for it to
gain, therefore, it can't be evil. It has no motivation
to be evil. Pretty cool. The logic of this is
very interesting. There's a very delicious, exquisite divine logic to
God. You can spend a lot of time running through
the sort of logical loops in your mind thinking about
love and goodness and infinity and oneness and consciousness and
how it all interconnects in a very perfectly logical way.
It's very satisfying to to contemplate that. Now, what about
morality? Let's talk about morality for a little bit. A
lot of people are confused about morality, what is morality?
And why do people get morality so wrong? So actually,
the human mind and ego has different stages of moral
development that it goes through from very low levels, crude
levels, unconscious levels, to the highest levels, which is basically
what I've been talking about here. So at the lower
levels of morality, morality is basically based on punishment and
reward, for example, little children, to behave in moral ways
to follow rules. And to, you know, to be nice
to others not to bite their friends and their siblings.
This is sort of the early origins of morality and
children. How do you get children to obey these rules,
it's simply through brute physical reward and punishment. If, if
a child is biting his sister, you know, you maybe
smack them over the head, if he's biting her, to
get them to stop. And you smack him hard enough,
he'll stop. Why, because the pain and suffering of the
smack on his head is going to be worse than
the joy he gets from biting her. And then over
time, he'll learn to stop biting her. And then, you
know, as he matures and grows up and develops a
little bit more, then he internalizes those rules, and he
develops a little bit more autonomy. Now, he doesn't need
to be literally physically punished, he can just be kind
of threatened. And he can be threatened with not even
physical violence or pain, but oftentimes just with a sort
of a, a look of disapproval. Or just because he
knows that, you know, his friends will see him in
a bad light. Like, you know, you're in school, why
don't you just take a dump in the middle of
the classroom, even though you might want to, because you
know, it takes more energy to go to the bathroom,
it will be easier to just take a dump on
the desk, on the teacher's desk, why don't you do
that? Well, because there's gonna be so much disapproval, peer
to peer pressure comes in here, there's gonna be so
much disapproval and humiliation and embarrassment from all your friends
and colleagues and teachers who will look at you and
think of you as a monster, basically. And you don't
want to be thought of as a monster that doesn't,
that doesn't sit well with you. So you learn not
to do that. And so that's sort of the next
stage of morality is where your morality is not based
on physical punishments and rewards, but it's based more on
how well you're going to fit in with your peer
group. And this is a lot of what morality is
for, for many people who are at spile dynamics stage
blueish. In a lot of religious fundamentalist type people, for
them, morality boils down to basically just being good conformists
to their society or community and not sticking their neck
out of the herd too far for fear of it
being chopped off. So it's that kind of conformist morality,
then. And this morality is usually based on rigid a
black and white rules of do this, don't do that.
This is the 10 commandments idea. And these sorts of
people tend to really believe in this idea that there's
an objective, absolute right and wrong in the universe. And
of course, for these people, it's very sad because these
are the most religious people. And you know, they're they're
so passionate about God and so forth. But actually, they're
completely incapable of understanding what true goodness is. They're completely
incapable of understanding God. Precisely because they're not actually contemplating
the nature of existence for themselves. They're just following rules.
And following rules, doesn't lead you to absolute good, it
actually has the opposite effect, which is why these religious
people, religious fundamentalists, are some of the most violent and
evil people that have ever existed. They love to do
genocide, and they love to subscribe to nationalism, they love
to have a superiority complex about their culture, their religion,
their worldview, their ethnicity. They love to judge even though
the Bible tells them not to judge, but they do
it anyways, because they can't help themselves. Because true morality
is a function of consciousness. You can't really fake true
morality. Your consciousness determines it. Your level of moral and
cognitive development determines it. If you're not able to grasp
the relativity, of reality, there's no way that you can
truly be moral. Because you're gonna be stuck in your
own perspective, in your own biased worldview, in your own
selfishness. And you're not going to acknowledge the validity of
all the other worldviews and perspectives that are out there,
all the other religions, all the other political parties, all
the other ideologies, all that stuff, right, you're gonna think
that yours is the best. So the next level of
morality comes when your morality is based on principles, more
so than hard and fast rules that you read in
a book that you take literally. So here, the principles
become more like, you know, treat others the way you
want to be treated. That might be a principle, the
golden rule. There might be other principles of truthfulness, and
honesty and compassion and whatever else. And these are principles
that you're you're not just following a prescribed rigid set
of, of formulas. But rather, you're intelligently trying to apply
these principles in various kinds of messy situations. Within moral
philosophy, there's a whole slew of these sort of edge
case examples, where it's these little thought experiments where, you
know, you say something like, Well, if there's a, if
there's a some sort of, we caught a terrorist, and
he has the codes to a nuclear weapon that's going
to explode in 10 minutes. What do you do with
this terrorist? Can you torture him? Is that moral? Or
would it be? Or do we have to just let
him you know, we don't torture him. That would be
the more immoral move, but then you know, a million
people will die when this bomb goes off, like, what
should we do? And then the questions are, deliberately the
thought experience are designed in such a way that they're
deliberately very kind of gray areas. So there's no clear
right or wrong answers. And that's, in these situations, the
sort of stage blue people who have a rigid morality,
they're not able to cope with these situations very well,
which leads to evil. Because any finite attempt to formalize
infinity is going to by definition, lead to all sorts
of problems and evil, and it's done for selfish purposes.
So if you truly want to be moral, what you
need to do is you need to have enough flexibility
and open mindedness such that and consciousness and intelligence and
selflessness, lack of bias such that in these situations, you're
able to adapt very fluidly. And you're not hindered by
any kind of rules or shoulds. But actually, you look
out for the greater good of the entire hole and
you have this very holistic perspective, not just the perspective
of your little tribe, family, race, corporation, group, political party,
nation or species or whatever you need to truly be
able to take a perspective that is beyond your species,
beyond your tribe, beyond your nationality, beyond your gender beyond
any of these things, and then you will be able
to be the best that you can be. You will
be more Godlike. So the ultimate morality is a state
of such radical, high consciousness and complete neutrality and complete
lack of self bias and complete lack of personal agenda,
that and a perspective that is so broad that it
encompasses the entire universe, such that you're able to see
the relativity of everything, of all perspectives and all beings,
and you don't get stuck on selfishly defending any one
of them. And then you're able to make decisions, and
act intelligently, with balance in perfect alignment with what is
necessary for the advancement of the whole universe. Yeah, it's
a tall order to fill to get there. See, because
the thing that's preventing you from getting there is all
of your personal stuff, you'd have to be completely impersonal
to be able to serve that role. That means all
of your cravings, desires, fears, beliefs, ideologies, all of your
personal needs, all of this would have to be surrendered.
Because all of these are going to bias your perception
of reality, and are going to limit your scope of
understanding and concern. And your highest priority has to be
truth above everything else. Because of course, good and truth
are identical. So this is what I would call transcendent
morality. It's the morality that completely transcends all norms and
rules. And oftentimes, it can look to people who are
lower in their development and consciousness, it can look like
actually it's completely immoral, or amoral. Because it's so relativistic,
it's so profoundly relativistic, that it doesn't judge, for example,
Hitler. It doesn't judge Nazis. It doesn't judge terrorists. It
doesn't judge suicide bombers. It doesn't judge rapists. It doesn't
judge corrupt politicians, it doesn't judge the capitalist, it doesn't
judge the socialist, all of the things that you want
to judge, it doesn't judge. That's precisely why it's so
good. But the problem is that people who are too
low in their development and consciousness, they don't perceive it
as the ultimate good, they perceive it as evil. See,
because they've defined the ultimate good as their own survival
and all their own biases. So when they've done that,
when they see true goodness, they must project upon it,
their own biases. And, of course, their ego must label
that as evil. That's the whole tragedy of it. They're
literally incapable of seeing goodness, your capacity to see goodness
in others, is simply a function of your consciousness. The
less conscious you are, the less good you're able to
see in others. And if you're infinitely conscious, you will
see infinite good in absolutely everybody in everything. Don't believe
me? This is not an ideology, actually do it? Do
it become infinitely conscious and see what reality looks like
from that vantage point? Don't assume you know how it's
going to look. Don't assume that it's going to look
neutral. It may not it may look good. It may
look really good. It may look scary good. It may
look so good at terrifies you. So, this leads us
to the question of the old age old philosophical question
of what is the good life? What does it mean
to live the good life? Philosophers have been asking this
question for millennia. without really giving a clear answer. Well,
I'm going to give you a very clear answer right
now. The Good Life for human beings is to realize
absolute good, and then to work to embody it as
best as you can for the rest of your life.
Or, to put it in other words, to become godlike.
Or to put it even more starkly, to become God.
So Look how good your life is, is simply a
function of how close to God are you able to
become. That's it. It's that simple. Now, of course, to
be able to actually work towards embodying goodness, you first
need to realize what absolute goodness is, or to even
know that it exists, it's not enough to just hear
someone tell you about it. I mean, this is the
starting point, we got to start somewhere, so it's good
to hear it from me. But that's not enough, I
could be lying, I could be wrong, I could be
deluded, whatever, you know, from your point of view. So
from your point of view, now you have to validate
whether what I'm saying is true. And the only way
you can do that is by actually becoming directly conscious
of absolute goodness. And not only do you have to
do that in order to validate me, but you have
to do that for your own self. Because until you
become conscious of absolute good, then you won't really understand
the point of embodying it, or what you're really even
working towards, or why you're working towards it. You know,
I can tell you to be godlike in your life,
but you won't understand how, and you will understand why.
Which is even more important. In the back of your
mind, you're not going to be fully convinced that this
is the right way to live your life, you're gonna
think that there are other ways you're gonna think that
having a bunch of sex is a better way, you're
gonna think that having a bunch of money is a
better way, you're gonna think that doing a bunch of
cocaine is a better way, you're gonna think that traveling
the world, is a better way. And you're going to
be wrong. But you won't understand why you're wrong. The
only way to understand why you're wrong, is to become
directly conscious of what is absolute good. And then you
can use that as as your north star to guide
you for the rest of your life. And in a
sense, that is what religion is trying to do. That's
the function of religion. That's the function that it served.
Since the beginning of human civilization, it's tried to be
that North Star, and it's trying to guide people, the
only problem is, is that the people were just following
some ideas, and some ideology that somebody else told them,
they never actually broke through to absolute good consciousness. And
so they were just, it's a case of the blind
leading the blind, leading the blind, leading the blind leading
the blind, off a cliff, into evil. Because you can't
get to absolute goodness, through a mechanical process, or through
following rules, or through the 10 commandments, or through hearsay,
or belief or any kind of ideology, all of that
only leads to evil. The only way to get to
absolute truth is by actually becoming conscious of it first
and foremost. And then you can, you can understand what
it's going to take to, to actually start to embody
it. Now, here's a really practical aspect to everything I've
talked about here. This might have seemed to you rather
metaphysical and abstract and philosophical, here's where it gets practical.
I want you to recognize that within you, from the
beginning of your life, there was always an impulse inside
of you, whether it was large or small, but it
was there, there was an impulse inside of you to
be good. Just as simple as that just to be
good. Isn't that true? Check. Don't believe me check. Is
there this impulse inside of you to be good? It
might be as simple as you see an old lady
walking across the street and she's struggling. So you want
to go out there to her and try to help
her with her groceries or whatever that she dropped. Or
it might be as simple as you know, your child
is struggling with something at school, and then you you
have just a natural inclination to go and to help
your child or you see a dog freezing in the
streets in the middle of winter, and you just have
a natural desire to, to, you know, to grab this
dog and take it home, feed it some food and
give it a warm shelter. Or you see a homeless
man, you know, begging on the curb for some food
with a sign that says you know, please help I'm
hungry, whatever. And you just, you know, have an impulse
to say yeah, I should probably give him $5 Or
something that that that desire, that impulse for genuine goodness,
not because of how it's going to make you look
not because you have to not because it's Got to
impress anybody. Because all of these are, of course, obscuring
factors. It could be the case that you know, you're
you're on a car driving on your way to church.
And you know there's there's five of us sitting there
in a van, you and your your colleagues that always
go to church together and then you see this poor
person sitting on the side of the road, and then
you feel obligated, like, oh, well, normally I wouldn't, but
this today, I'm gonna I'm gonna pay him $20 Because,
you know, all my church friends are watching and you
know, they're gonna, they're gonna think I'm, I'm so godly
if I do this, if it's that, if that's the
reason you're doing it, then it's not genuine goodness, that's
actually the ego sneaking in there. I'm talking about genuine
goodness, when you do it, without any reward back when
you do it without any expectation of a, you know,
increase in your reputation. Not because you're gonna get punished
either. See, if you think all if you think like
this, like, oh, well, look, there's that, that that poor
person, if I drive by, and I don't give him
$5 I'm gonna feel guilty for the rest of the
day, I'm gonna feel bad. So I better give him
$5. That's not it. That's ego. I mean, genuine goodness,
think of it. Think of one time in your life,
where you did something genuinely good for somebody for no
reward, and no for no reason other than, for goodness
itself. And think about how that felt. Now multiply that
times a million times infinity, and you will understand why
God is nothing other than good. Because you'd have to
be a fucking idiot. You'd have to be truly a
moron. To be able to be good, but then not
to be good and to do something else instead. I
mean, what else? Are you gonna? Do? You got something
better to do in the universe, but but to be
good? Well, what are you gonna do, you're gonna go
get money, you're gonna go get a bunch of sex,
and that's going to be better for you. Nothing will
make you feel as good as being good. It's completely
tautological. So it has to be this way. Because good
is good. That's what good is. It's very direct. It's
so circular, that it just is. So I'm telling you
that you do have this impulse inside of you. This
impulse is not ego, this impulse is actually God trying
to move through you. The problem, of course, is that
this impulse gets obscured, and clouded and corrupted and forgotten.
Because of all of the survival demands that you're placed
upon. As you're here trying to live in this material,
plane. You need to earn money, you got to feed
your kids, you got to go to work, you got
to answer emails, you got to do all this stuff.
And because you're so busy doing all that stuff, you
lose touch with this impulse towards goodness, and your life
becomes purely pragmatic about getting stuff done. It becomes very
mechanical. And all of a sudden, you're going to work
and you're working 40 hours a week, 60 hours a
week doing something. Not because it's good, but because you
need to, to pay the bills. You've gotten sidetracked and
lost in the complexity of life and survival. See, like,
you might become a an engineer who works for a
defense contractor like Lockheed Martin, Martin manufacturing, you know, missile
warheads, or nuclear weapons to be used in the Middle
East or somewhere, or whatever. And are you doing it
out of goodness? No, you just, you got sidetracked somewhere
in life years ago, decades ago. And you're just unconsciously
mechanically moving through life doing stuff, following rules, to get
your paycheck to survive. And that has supplanted your true
purpose in this life, which is goodness, the pursuit and
manifestation of goodness. And you have a bunch of rationalizations
and ideologies justifying that what you're doing actually is good.
So, the practical thing that I'm telling you here is
try to remove all of that clutter, and all of
that obstruction and get down to the root of that
impulse inside of you to be good. And start to
follow that impulse every single day, a little bit more
and a little bit more, and build your entire life
around that impulse. And if you do, that is going
to be the best life that you can live that
life, that strategy will produce for you. The greatest joy.
If you do that, of course, it takes time to
build up your life around the simples, it can take
years to build it up, especially if you've spent the
last few decades living like a devil. And constructing a
life which is the opposite of this impulse, which is
all purely based around survival. Being good, truly good is
one of the most challenging things you'll ever do in
your life. Which is why so few people rise to
this level of goodness. To be good requires being godlike,
which requires that you face every fear and conquer it
with love. Which is the ultimate rule for living life.
Every fear you encounter, conquer it with love, that's the
ultimate solution to your life's problems. For example, if you're
working for Lockheed Martin as an engineer, and you're you've
been manufacturing warheads for last 10 years, because that's just
something new, you know, fell into that trap. And now
you hear what I'm saying here. And you realize, oh,
shit, Leo's right. You know, I have been manufacturing these
warheads, like what was I even thinking, Why did I
even get this job? Why am I why I stay
here for 10 years? Now, you face a problem. Now
you face fear? Because now it's like, well, yeah, what
Leo says, is correct. But like, yeah, my job does
not align with my impulse to be good. I have
some other impulses to be good that, you know, don't
fit with this job. So, but what do I do,
like, I can't just quit this job, I got kids
to I gotta feed down. And maybe I won't get
another job. The economy is not doing so great right
now. So that's fear, fear arises. And then you have
to conquer it with love. And you have to be
fearless. And you have to make a difficult decision here,
which is to say, Okay, I gotta find a new
job, that's going to be more aligned with my impulse
to be good. And what what might that be I
don't, I don't know. That means you have to go
do research, you have to go job hunting, maybe you
need to change your entire career, maybe you find that
engineering no longer works for you. Now you got to
become I don't know, whatever, you want to become something
totally different want to become an artist? Okay, you wanna
become an artist, but that's a huge transition. There's financial
difficulties there difficulties with your family, maybe your wife won't
support you bla bla, bla, bla, bla, bla bla, right.
But facing all those challenges is precisely than how you
will realign your life and then build a life that
will truly be good. That is the new good life
for you. But of course, it's so scary to do
that it's much easier to stay at your old Lockheed
Martin job, and to keep earning a nice fat salary.
not stressing yourself too much about being good or whatever.
And just to ignore, ignore the fact that you're creating
weapons, that that kill pill, people just ignore that and
just pretend like everything's fine. That's just one example. I
mean, I hopefully you can see how this translates into
millions of examples. This is just one example. So what
does it mean to say that some person is good?
Like, oh, oh, you know, Sarah, she's such a good
person, or Johnny, he's such a good person. What do
we really mean when we say that about somebody? What
we really mean is that he or she has godlike
qualities. And what are those? Well, here are God's qualities,
truth, honesty, integrity, concern for all rather than just oneself
or just for some, doing what is necessary for the
benefit of all. Working for the benefit of others. selflessness,
self sacrifice, love, non judgement, humility, acceptance, non attachment, consciousness,
the recognition of beauty in everything. Giving rather than taking
benevolence, fearlessness, wisdom, intelligence. Creativity, flexibility of mind, or just
flexibility holism, the ability to see the whole of not
just the parts, forgiveness, forgiveness of anyone for anything, balance,
and not selling out. Those would be some of the
most important qualities of God. And when you see a
person that aligns with most of these qualities that I
just listed, you're gonna automatically think this is an amazing
person, this is an exceptional person, wow, I want to
be friends with this person, wow, I want to marry
this person. Wow, I want to be a student of
this person. I want to be a follower of this
person. Because such people are rare. And such people offer
the world hope and a glimpse of what they could
become, they offer you a glimpse of what you could
become, if you lived the good life. A godly life,
a godlike life. And that is because in the ultimate,
biggest picture, all motion in the universe, all of evolution
basically is moving reality towards higher consciousness, higher unity, higher
integration, and higher love and higher goodness, because ultimately it
has to lead to an absolute infinity of goodness such
that any point in the universe, if you select that
point, and you follow that point, all the way to
its natural conclusion might take billions and trillions of years.
But if you follow all those points, eventually all those
points will merge together into a absolute goodness. And that
is how God created itself as absolutely good. You see,
any point within God, because every point is within God,
any point within God has to ultimately to the Godhead,
you see, it's just a question of how long it
takes and how circuitous the route is. But eventually, every
point leads back to the source, and then goes back
around and cycles like this forever. And that's what God
is. And that's what goodness is. And that's what love
is, and that's what infinity is. And that's what you
are. And so just you being alive, you're, you have
an opportunity to participate in this process. This process requires
conscious participation on your part. And it's difficult to do.
And the reason is difficult to do is because you're
selfish. Becoming good. Becoming godlike is the hardest thing in
the world, which is why there are so few godlike
people in the world. Because it requires surrendering yourself. And
it's really difficult to surrender to the self, because 4
billion years of biological evolution has led to a very
strong sense of self within you, that self was necessary
by all of your ancestor 4 billion years of ancestors
you have of selfish ancestors, that were increasingly more and
more selfish, because they had to be just in order
to survive for you to get here. So of course,
it's difficult for you to abandoned 4 billion years of
evolution in this one lifetime. You might wonder, Well, where
is this God? Why is God invisible? Well, God is
invisible. Because if God was visible, it would have to
have a form. If it had a form, it would
have a self. And if it had a self, that
it wouldn't be infinitely good. So the reason God is
invisible for you, atheists and physicists, you think this is
a cop out, but it's not it's actually the very
nature and structure of God, God has to be invisible.
Because if it were visible, then it would not be
unlimited. And then it would not be absolutely good, it
would actually be evil. So when you ask God to
be visible, when you ask God to incarnate into a
single limited form, you're asking God to be evil, which
of course, God won't do. But at the same time,
God is visible, this is it. You are God, this
everything you're seeing is God. God is invisible by virtue
of the fact that it takes infinite form. So you
can't pin it down to any one form. So it's
a rock, it's a tree, it's a car, it's a
human, it's a dog, it's a alien, it's a planet,
it's a whatever, it's all of it. Now, here, we
got to talk about a very big trap that comes
up for people. And this is falling into the trap
of the ego, or the self, adopting a role or
persona or a front of selflessness. And confusing that with
what I'm talking about here, which is true selflessness. So
please, let's distinguish these two things. We have true selflessness
on the one hand, which comes from an increase in
your consciousness, and actually surrendering your biases and your survival
attachments. That's the true selflessness, this sweat actually makes you
good. And then there's the egoic version of it, which
is an aping or a mocking of that, it's doing
that without actually doing it, it's pretending like you're doing
that. So this is the example of, you know, some
of the spiritual people who like to talk about love
and goodness. But then in reality, they are just adopting
that as a persona. They don't have sufficient consciousness to
truly be conscious enough to act selflessly. And they have
all sorts of attachments and things. And they're mostly run
by their ego. But now their ego has also added
another feature to it on top of everything else, that's
sort of the cherry on top of the ego sundae,
as it were, is that the ego believes that it's
selfless, and godlike. And this is, of course, very dangerous
and problematic. So honestly, I even hesitated to release this,
and to shoot this video. Because after I came up
with the idea for it, I was thinking like, well,
but what's the point of even telling people about absolute
good news, because isn't, the only thing that's going to
happen here is that there's going to listen to all
this, and then they're going to just adopt it as
a persona, just another thing for the ego. And then
this is just going to make them more egotistical and
selfish, this idea of living the good life, now they're
going to go around thinking that they're living the good
life, when actually they're, they're pure devils. And so I
thought about that, you know, gave me some pause. But
on the other hand, this has to be explained somehow.
So I just, you know, look, there's there's traps everywhere
in this work. You've heard me say that a lot
of times in the past. And that's very true, especially
for this episode. There's a huge, huge, huge trap here.
So just watch out for this. And also, there's the
trap of self sacrifice, and people pleasing. And a lot
of women especially fall into this trap. So I want
to point this out to ladies, because you can really
hurt yourselves here is, but I mean, men can also
fall into this trap. It's this idea that you take
on this persona of being the self sacrifice, or the
one who sacrifices for everybody else. So you sacrifice for
your children, for your family, for your husband, for your
boyfriend for all of this for the world for the
company, you're sacrificing and sacrifice and you're giving and you're
giving. And people keep taking from you and taking from
you, they don't give you back and then this this
exhausts you of your energy that leaves you shattered and
broken and abused, and then you stay in abusive relationships
because you think that for you to be godlike, and
to live the good life, like Leo said, I have
to stay with my abusive boyfriend and he just can
keep abusing me. And Leo told me I have to
stay in I have to keep taking it. Because that's
what God would do. No, Leo didn't tell you to
do that. That's a misunderstanding of what I'm talking about.
In that situation, actually. You need to see the the
larger good is served by you know is not served
by you being abused. Because when you're you're abused, and
your values are trampled upon. That is not serving the
greater good. It doesn't serve you to be you know,
emotionally manipulated by narcissists and leached on by energy vampires
this this doesn't do anything good for you and your
ability to serve people in the world. This lessens your
ability to serve others, you have to see the bigger
picture here, you're lacking a holistic enough perspective. And really,
you're succumbing to fear. You're not being fearless by staying
in an abusive relationship. Actually, you fear. The reason you
stay in the abusive relationship is because you fear leaving
your abusive husband or boyfriend. And that's because maybe you
think that you won't find a better better boyfriend or
husband, maybe you think you're too old, maybe you think
it's, it's too much trouble, maybe things gonna be too
painful, you're too attached to him, you fallen in love
with him. You don't know what's going to happen to
the children, you're afraid for the children's sake and all
of that. But that's fear. That's not true love. True
love is stronger than that true love is courageous. True
love, is bold, in the sense that it's willing to
cut some losses here and there. Right? True love doesn't
just get trampled upon. Because if you truly are fulfilling
this manifestation of the good life, you're a rare and
unique individual. We need you as a leader in the
world. And how can you be a leader in the
world when you're stuck in this abusive situation? How can
you be a leader in the world when everybody walks
over you when you can't enforce your boundaries? When the
values that you value when you value truth, and honesty
and love and all this when you value this in
your intimate relationship, but your husband or boyfriend doesn't? And
he shuts all over that? You see, that means you've
you're sleeping with the devil. You're sleeping with the devil
and you're tolerating the devil's games. That's not very godlike.
See, to be godlike, you have to you don't got
God doesn't compromise with devils. You think if the devil
comes to God and gives God a bunch of bullshit,
the God God will just say, okay, yeah, I accept
your bullshit. No. God's truth cuts through all of the
devil's bullshit. And God doesn't let himself be manipulated by
devils. If you're truly doing it right now, I frame
it here in the context of for women. But of
course, this doesn't just apply for women, it applies for
men as well. There are many situations for you, man,
where you also self sacrifice. And you people please and
you don't enforce your boundaries. And you think that you're
being good by doing this, but actually, you're, you're being
meek and weak. And weakness is not a quality of
God. Strength is. So the antidote, antidote to your problem
is more strength, more courage, more fearlessness, more integrity, sticking
through having the courage to stick through and honor your
own values, right. And one of your values is that
you don't allow people who abuse you. You don't allow
devils to manipulate you, that should be one of your
values. And if that means you're going to lose that
relationship, then you have to take that hit and accept
that pain of losing that particular relationship and deal with
the fallout of it. That is really where the self
sacrifice lies. The self sacrifice is not in tolerating abuse,
the self sacrifice is in. Sight sacrificing your weak little
ego. And all of its petty concerns about how it
feels that it's comfort and all that such that you
can ditch this situation and go on to a better
situation but going through a sort of a difficult period
there in between the bad and the good situation. For
example, if you're a drug addict, you're addicted to heroin.
The self sacrifice for you in that case, is the
sacrifice of the ego. That occurs when you decide to
kick heroin, cold turkey, let's say and then all the
withdrawals you go through it all the emotional agony and
suffering you go through for the next month after kicking
that heroin. That's the true self sacrifice. Now, you might
wonder, Leah, what's the difference between good and love? Because
you've spoken about love before, now you're talking about good,
they sound like the same thing. Is there a difference?
Well, they are very similar. There's a, there's a subtle
distinction there to be had. But ultimately, you know, all
these absolutes are going to unify into a single thing.
So ultimately, of course, the ultimate good is love, love,
truth, good consciousness, God's self. Everything, nothing infinity. All these
are identical, ultimately. But also, as you sort of go
lower in consciousness, they sort of fragment and split apart
into different facets, like I've talked about, in my episode
called the many facets of awakening. So good is one
facet of awakening loves other facet of awakening truth is
another facet of awakening, you can have these realizations independently,
you can also have them. Together, in combination, you can
realize how they all equate to each other. So there's
different realizations of this. Mostly here, I'm emphasizing good because
I'm also relating it to the kind of common usage
of that word that we use, which has certain utility
to it. You know, the word good does serve as
sort of a different function in our language than just
the word love. They're not always used interchangeably. But But
yeah, ultimately, they're a similar. Now, it's impossible to become
good without the following things without truth, which includes honesty
and integrity. This is crucial. If you don't value truth
above everything else. You'll never be good by definition. Because
if truth is not your highest priority, then the only
other alternative is that falsehood. And illusion is a higher
priority than good. I mean the truth. Because these are,
these are your only two options when it comes to
truth. You either value truth above illusions and falsehood, or
you value illusions of falsehood, above truth. And if you
do, then you're a devil, and you can't be good.
Because truth is good. And then also, you need it's
impossible to be good without consciousness. You can't fake being
good. Good is an honest signal. It's the most honest
signal there is. You can't fake being a good person.
Have you noticed that? No matter how hard you try,
it will work. And you can't fake being good through
beliefs. And through ideology. It's not enough to believe you're
good. It's not enough to believe in God. It's not
enough to read the whole Bible and memorize it word
for word. That's not enough, you can't become good that
way. Consciousness is what you're lacking. So raising consciousness is
crucial. You can only be as good as you are
conscious. And the reason most religious people aren't very good
is because which leads them to the third point, it's
impossible to Be Good Without a deep realization and understanding
of relativity. Relativity is crucial. And by relativity, what I
mean is go see my episode called Understanding relativism, part
one, I will also release a part two in the
future. Relativity is hugely important, but relativity basically means understanding
that all perspectives are relative, including, of course, your own
and appreciating the relativity of reality. Reality is absolutely relative.
Everything is relative except the absolutes. And so that's another
reason why religious people, traditionally religious people, fundamentalist religious people
aren't very good is because they don't understand relativity. In
fact, they demonize relativity. They demonize things like post modernism.
And they put their own perspective and worldview on a
pedestal, and they denigrate all others. When you do that,
you're not being truthful. And that you're going to be
judgmental of other perspectives. You're not going to see how
they all fit together. You're not going to see the
relativity and partiality of your own perspective. You're going to
confuse your own perspective with the Absolute Truth, which is
actually false. And therefore you won't be good. You're gonna
be evil. See how it works. It's very elegant. The
logic of this is very elegant, precise. The next thing
you need to be good is a lack of bias,
as we've been talking about. Being good is like being
a very high quality judge, you need to truly not
have any biases towards any defendant or plaintiff, you need
to be able to look at every situation neutrally, the
way that God does, because God isn't attached to any
situation. So God can look at it neutrally, you need
to emulate that. The next thing you need to be
good is a concern for the biggest picture for the
highest level of concern for all rather than just some
part, this is actually very closely related to this issue
of bias. See, if you're concerned about your little tribe,
or your little political party winning, or your little sector
of your religion winning, or your family, doing well, but
you don't care about the, the well being of your
neighbors or other families, if you care about your nation
doing well, like you want America to do well, and
you don't give a shit what happens in China, or
in Africa or elsewhere. That's the very thing that leads
to evil. Do you think God prefers America over China,
over Russia, over Germany, over Brazil, over Argentina? No. God
has no such preferences. God's concern is for the whole
thing. You might say, well, so God's concern is for
the earth. No, it's not for the earth. It's for
the other trillion planets that exist in this universe, as
well. And everything in between, and not just planets and
all the creatures on them. But everything, every microbe, ever,
every, every stone, every tree, everything anywhere, every particle of
space, dust floating around in space out there, everything, the
concern has to be total. Anything less than total concern
for everything leads to evil. Because absolute good doesn't happen
on local level, it happens at the absolute level, at
the total level at the level of totality. And the
last thing you need to really be good is non
judgment. That's a huge one. Non judgment, notice how about
you judge stuff all the time you judge everything. Look
at how much you judge within politics and locate. I'm
not saying don't get me wrong, I am not saying
that I am by any means completely above all of
these biases and on judgments or judgments and, and that
I'm that I have perfectly embodied any of this stuff.
I'm not saying I've embodied even half of it. I
have a lot more work to do to embody this
stuff. But what I am saying is that I've understood
up to this point, how this stuff works. And that
that's a that's a big deal. You know, before you
can truly worked to embody this stuff, how can you
ever embody it if you don't first just understand what
it is and how it works? Alright, so really with
actualize that org my first and primary concern for the
last eight years as I've been shooting this content has
simply just been understanding what the hell is going on,
and how to live a proper life. Just figuring that
out alone has taken me like, over 10 years of
never ending research and contemplation just to figure out what
the right things to do are. Now, at this point
in my life, I've kind of understood now I kind
of know what all the right things to do are,
but I haven't done them all. That'll take me another
10 or more years to start to do them. All.
Right. So if you're sitting there thinking like well, but
Leo doesn't behave this way. Well, that's right, because Leo
is a finite thing. Leo is only 35 years old.
Leo has another hopefully 40 years of life left to
work all this stuff out. And, and Leo is not
above you. Leo suffers and deals with all the same
shit you do. See, maybe I'm a little further along
a few years more developed the new but overall, I
mean, whatever issues are preventing you from becoming completely godlike?
Well, those are the same issues that prevent me from
becoming completely godlike and prevent every other of the 8
billion people on this planet from doing the same thing.
If it was easy as easy to do as just
watching a few of Leo's videos. Then the whole world
would be godlike, which obviously isn't the case. So obviously,
it's very, very difficult to do, even if you know
how to do it. Knowing how to do it is
the easy part. But still, it's hard to get even
to this point, it's hard to get. Most people will
never just reach this level of understanding, conceptual understanding, but
then to actually fully live in alignment with this is
very, very difficult. In fact, I almost hesitate to, to
feed this idea into your mind, because now you see,
the problem is going to happen here is that now
you're not going to be able to enjoy life, because
you're going to have this idea in your mind, like,
oh, I have to be godlike. And every single day,
you're going to be realizing how on God like you
are, and all the things I told you, and every
single day, you're going to notice, oh, I'm judging someone
there. And I'm bias here and all. I'm not conscious
in this situation. It's like, Oh, I was an asshole
in this situation. And then you're going to get so
neurotic about this whole thing of being good. That actually,
you're going to pervert the entire process, and you're going
to get depressed by it. And then you're going to
turn into a devil. Because you're going to be guilty
over this. Your life is going to suck for the
next five years, as you're struggling with all this, see
what you do? I know because I've done it. I
mean, it's very, very tricky. You have to be very
careful about the way in which everything twists, inside out.
Upside down. That's just the nature of the ego mind.
It's always perverting everything. It's misunderstanding everything is taking everything
the opposite way. It's approaching everything backwards. Well, yeah, that's
why it's difficult to do. Again, if there weren't all
these traps, everyone would have done it by now. There
will be a lot of really, really good people out
there in the world, very godlike people. And the fact
is, they're just aren't. Because there's so many traps that
they get lost in these traps. So there you go.
The bottom line is that life is very simple, devote
your whole life to actualizing goodness with a capital G.
And then once you've made that commitment, then take the
actions that goodness demands, see goodness demands certain difficult actions,
that of course, we don't want to take. And that's
why most of us are very good. Because we don't
want to take those actions that goodness demands. Maybe goodness
demands you quit your job. Maybe goodness demands you go
back to school, maybe goodness demands you leave your boyfriend
or girlfriend, maybe goodness demands that you go meditate in
the woods for a month, maybe goodness demands that you
give more money to charity, and you don't have very
much money. Maybe goodness demands, you read more books, and
you don't want to read books. Maybe goodness demands you
stop smoking weed because it makes you chronically lazy and
you don't want to do that. You're addicted to whatever.
Well, do you want to grow or not? Do you
want to self actualized? Or not? If you do, and
this is what we're talking about here. And that's really
all there is to life. You're either actualizing towards the
highest goodness, you're becoming more godlike or you're not. And
you're wasting time with distractions, and you're stimulating yourself in
alternative ways, which are all going to be poor substitutes
for the real deal. Let's see. All right, that's it.
I'm done here. Please click that like button for me
and come check out actualize that org is my website.
On there, you will find the book list, you will
find the life purpose course you will find my blog,
you will find the forum and other material and exclusive
content that I plan to be releasing in the future.
So stay tuned for that. Make sure you check back
with me because I will be releasing new courses and
new resources and other things I have planned in the
future. And you'll want to be staying aware of those
things because they could really help you in your life.
And the final thing I'll say is this. Remember that
my teachings are really designed for enthusiast of this work.
I go into unnecessary detail truly. And I cover topics
that do you need to know all these topics? Not
really. My work is designed for philosophers. Which means that
these are people who love this material. These are lovers
of wisdom in the literal sense of philosopher lovers of
wisdom, so if you love wisdom, then that's what this
work is for us for Michael on tennis is designed
for that, so that you love the wisdom, you love
the details, you can sort of really go deep and
juicy with it. So just keep that in mind. For
many of you, this level of depth and detail may
not be necessary. It all very much depends on how
much you want out of life, you know, you're gonna
get out of life, what you invest into it. And
if you just want a basic, successful life, then you
probably find my material too long winded and too abstract
and too philosophical. And you can find other teachings and
teachers out there, they're a little bit more direct, and
a little bit more practical than me. But if you
actually enjoy contemplating how wisdom works, how everything interconnects together,
the way that I do, that's what my love and
passion is for, then this work is for you. And
you'll, you'll be able to appreciate it. And then of
course, certain fruits will come from, from going to this
level of depth, you'll have a deeper understanding and appreciation
of wisdom and life than you might otherwise have if
you only took the more utilitarian approach. But hey, find
whatever method works for you. That's one of the most
important things I can imprint you with is that in
this work, the point is not to follow Leo, the
point is to find a path that works for you.
And if I'm part of that path, great. I'll be
part of that path. Until I no longer am. And
one day I no longer will be part of your
path. But also don't be too eager to leave me
behind. Because there's a there's a lot still you haven't
learned for me yet. See, just by watching a few
videos, you think you've understood it all. But you haven't
I can, I can promise you that. And there's a
lot more that I'll be sharing with you in the
future. It's not just a rehash of the same old
material, we have a lot of practical topics to come.
I know I spent the last year or two really
hammering on the existential metaphysical and sort of abstract philosophical
topics, very spiritual topics. But we're reaching a point now
that I'm sort of exhausting, exhausting that for a while
at least, I feel satisfied with the the level of
content sort of the catalogue of content that I've built
around the spiritual topics. And in the future going forward.
I'll be talking more about just very practical topics, simple
stuff, success based stuff, relationship stuff, more practical, psychological stuff
that's not so spiritual. And I know you guys will
love that stuff. So thanks for hanging in with me,
and suffering through my overly metaphysical deliveries and so forth.
And the practical stuff is coming
