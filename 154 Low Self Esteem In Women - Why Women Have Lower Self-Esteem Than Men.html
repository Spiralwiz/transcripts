            <ul>
    <li><b>Different Pressures on Men and Women</b>: Leo mentions that both men and women face different pressures and expectations brought on by societal norms. Men are encouraged to be competitive and assertive, while women are expected to be nurturing and focused on relationships and families.
</li><li><b>Masculine Energy and Rapid Learning</b>: According to Leo, the constant exertion of masculine energy i.e., pushing boundaries and exhibiting an aggressive attitude, may lead to challenges, pressure, and resistance, inducing rapid learning and growth. This dynamic is exemplified in environments like military boot camps.
</li><li><b>Negative Consequences of Not Challenging Oneself</b>: Women who do not challenge themselves and continually play supportive roles are likely to experience a decline in self-efficacy, even leading to brain deterioration. This often occurs when they stay within their comfort zones and do not actively engage in challenging situations.
</li><li><b>Victimization and Lack of Control</b>: Because of both cultural conditioning and biological factors, many women may feel like victims and lack control over their worlds. Women tend to naturally adopt more submissive roles, leading to feelings of helplessness and tolerance of unfavorable situations. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Balance</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance for women to maintain their femininity whilst also being active, confident, and challenging themselves in their unique ways. By doing so, they can boost their self-efficacy avoiding dysfunctional relationships and feelings of powerlessness. He states that self-actualization is as crucial for women as it is for men.
</li><li><b>Self-Actualization Guidance through Actualized.org</b>: Leo concludes by promoting his website, Actualized.org, where he releases new content weekly, distilling advanced ideas into "golden nuggets" of wisdom. He encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter, like, and share the video to extend its reach. He asserts that consistent small steps can lead to a better life.
</li><li><b>Women playing a secondary role in their lives</b>: Due to societal or relational dynamics, women often find themselves consistently playing second fiddle or taking the backseat. When women relegate themselves to this submissive, less active role for extended periods, their self-efficacy can considerably erode. 
</li><li><b>Effects of comfort zone confinement</b>: Remaining in one's comfort zone without challenging oneself or actively engaging in life can further degrade self-efficacy and foster a feeling of victimhood, akin to a rut the individual can't escape from.
</li><li><b>Role of physiological differences</b>: Alongside cultural conditioning, biological differences underline natural inclinations. The innate femininity in women promotes attributes like compassion and nurturing, which are remarkable qualities. However, these traits can inadvertently lead to a tendency to be more submissive, rendering them less assertive and more tolerant of unfavorable conditions.
</li><li><b>Importance of active femininity</b>: While it's crucial for women to embrace and maintain their femininity, passive compliance leading to being treated as a doormat is detrimental. Women require a balance of holding onto their feminine attributes while remaining active, confident and continually pushing their boundaries. This approach promotes self-efficacy, wards off dysfunctional relationships and prevents feelings of powerlessness.
</li><li><b>Role of self-actualization in women</b>: Regardless of gender, self-actualization is vital. Women must perpetually strive for growth, continually challenging their comfort zones. It fosters more control over their lives, enhances their relationships, and helps build better lives progressively.
</li><li><b>Leo's goal through Actualized.org</b>: Leo aims to provide wisdom to viewers for them to understand life, themselves, and facilitate self-actualization. Through continual growth and an understanding of advanced ideas, he helps keep viewers on track of their goals in relationships, business or health. He endorses a steady, gradual process for building a better life, which he delivers through weekly newsletters and videos on Actualized.org.
