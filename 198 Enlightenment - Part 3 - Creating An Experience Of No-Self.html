            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/NXd8ojx_jOY' target='_blank'>Enlightenment - Part 3 - Creating An Experience Of No-Self</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Present Moment Reality</b>: Enlightenment is achieved by gaining firsthand experience and insight about the present moment. It is based on the principle that only what exists right now, in one's direct present experience, is real. All past and future thoughts are illusions created by the mind and are not reality.
</li><li><b>Principle Acceptance</b>: Spiritual alignment work doesn't require justifications or proofs for principles like "reality is only what exists right now." Leo makes it clear that this principle, though simple, does the heavy lifting in the empirical investigation and applying it rigorously can lead to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Illusion</b>: It's important to be aware that most people spend their lives either living in the past or the future, mistaking projections from their minds as reality. Even thoughts about the present moment that are not directly experienced (seen, felt, smelled, heard, or touched) are illusions and not reality, like imaginary thoughts about the back of one's head.
</li><li><b>No Self-Experience</b>: The objective of the video is to create an actual experience of no self. Leo wants viewers to experience that the entity they believe to be "I," which thinks and perceives everything around, is an illusion. True enlightenment involves the realization that this entity does not exist, which eliminates all fears, frustrations, and problems with relationships and motivation.
</li><li><b>Guided Meditation</b>: The video features a guided meditation to help viewers experience the truth of no self. Viewers are encouraged to find a quiet place and follow along with Leo's instructions. 
</li><li><b>Practicality</b>: The video is notably practical, and it requires active participation from viewers for them to experience and understand its concepts fully.
</li><li><b>Arbitrary Realness</b>: What is considered real is largely dependent on direct sensory experience. An unseen moon or sun, for instance, isn't real for the individual if they aren't directly experiencing it. This principle extends to people and other phenomena as well. 
</li><li><b>Viewers Challenge</b>: Leo challenges viewers to suspend their doubts and go along with his guidance to reach the fruition of the spiritual journey. No theories, philosophies, or beliefs are needed to understand the principle; only direct experience matters.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as an Experiential Journey</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that enlightenment is an experiential journey, not a logical or rational understanding of reality. The goal is not to outsmart others or develop a better theory of life, but rather to simply be the truth.
</li><li><b>The Nature of Existence</b>: Leo further explains that existence itself is not rational. It's not something to be logically explained or thought about, it simply exists. While humans have developed ways to manipulate reality, understanding the existence of reality itself is the main focus of spiritual enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Questioning Personal Existence</b>: Leo encourages viewers to deeply question their personal existence. He brings attention to the question "Who am I?" and highlights it's not as simple as our physical or mental identities. 
</li><li><b>Enlightenment Beyond Defined Frameworks</b>: Enlightenment is outlined to be beyond a philosophy, theory, religion, belief, or scientific model. Leo stresses that it is actually about direct experience of reality or being, without any intermediaries such as thoughts.
</li><li><b>Limitation of Thought</b>: The problem with thoughts is highlighted. Thoughts prevent us from actually experiencing reality, and Leo suggests that it might be possible and fruitful to be reality itself without thinking about it.
</li><li><b>Introduction of Meditation Process</b>: Leo introduces a meditation process to help viewers experience existence directly. They are guided to sit comfortably, relax their bodies, and ground their attention in the present moment to experience sensations as they occur.
</li><li><b>Importance of Experiencing Sensations</b>: The importance of directly experiencing and accepting the sensations and emotions occurring in the present moment is emphasized. There's a focus on becoming aware of sensations the body has been unaware of while being caught in thoughts and worries.
</li><li><b>Body Scan and Relaxation</b>: Viewers are guided through a body scan, moving their focus from their feet to different parts of their body, experiencing the sensations therein and relaxing their muscles as they go along. The goal is to become calm and centered in the present moment.
</li><li><b>Note on External Interruption</b>: Viewers are reminded to ensure they are in a quiet spot where they will not be interrupted during their meditation for at least 10 to 20 minutes. 
</li><li><b>Credit to Peter Ralston</b>: Leo expresses gratitude to Peter Ralston, a significant influence in his ideas about enlightenment, whose guided meditation sessions inspired him greatly.
</li><li><b>Concept of Reality through Direct Experience</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes actualizing the understanding that reality is only what exists in the present moment. This principle does not require any proofs, just an acceptance and rigorous application in life, leading towards enlightenment. The only reality is what is directly experienced right now, ruling out past and future events as they no longer exist. 
</li><li><b>Living in the Present</b>: Despite thinking that we are living in the moment, our minds are often preoccupied with past or future events. Leo emphasizes recognizing the true reality, which is what can be directly felt, perceived, and experienced in the present moment.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as an Experiential Journey</b>: Leo confirms that enlightenment is about experiencing, not about logic or outsmarting others. He warns against overthinking and encourages viewers to use this tool of spiritual introspection for deeper understanding.
</li><li><b>Existence as a Non-rational Concept</b>: Leo shares that existence itself is non-rational. Knowledge is all about manipulating reality, but understanding the existence of reality itself is beyond comprehension. Enlightenment stands out from philosophy, theory, religion, or scientific model. It is the process of experiencing being itself, discarding intermediaries like theories or philosophies.
</li><li><b>Issue With Thoughts</b>: Thoughts can be a barrier to experiencing reality. Leo suggests instead of contemplating reality, it might be possible to be reality directly. He introduces a meditation session to experience this state and provides Peter Ralston's teachings as a reference. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Experiencing the Present Moment</b>: Leo encourages viewers to experience the sensations in their body rather than controlling or manipulating them. He guides viewers through a body scan exercise to relax the muscles and achieve better connection with the present moment and the reality.
</li><li><b>Automatic Body Processes</b>: Leo asks viewers to notice automatic processes like breathing and heart beating that happen without conscious control. Further, he pushes viewers to eliminate concepts of time, possessions, social obligations, roles from their mind. The goal is to achieve unhindered state of presence and freedom from all attachments.
</li><li><b>Imagining Reality Free from Societal Pressures</b>: Viewers are asked to imagine a reality where there are no societal obligations, culture, worries, responsibilities, beliefs, traditions, emotions, thoughts. Noting down these existential thoughts, viewers are asked to just exist and experience the sensations and experiences of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Exploring Sensations without Preconceptions</b>: Leo encourages viewers to explore their sensations without any preconceived notions or beliefs. The idea that one's true self is the entirety of these sensations is put forth. The viewers are asked to remove external influences and opinions, leading them to experience reality without any filters or assumptions.
</li><li><b>Strategy to Experience Calm</b>: Viewers are asked to experience calm and embrace the emptiness and peacefulness. They are asked to take deep breaths and let their muscles relax completely. The exercise needs to be repeated in case of any distractions or resistance.
</li><li><b>The Concept of 'No Self'</b>: Leo shares the concept of 'no self', which is a state where one identifies with raw experience and existence itself, devoid of thoughts, opinions, roles, and attachments. He argues that through exercises and introspection, separation between self and the external world can disappear. The essence of enlightenment lies in exploring and understanding the reality of one's essential nature, beyond the preconceived notions and influences.
</li><li><b>Understanding the reality of present sensations</b>: In the first part of the transcript, Leo asks viewers to engage deeply with their senses. He encourages people to experience sensations as though they are completely unfamiliar, devoid of any preconceived notions, beliefs, or assumptions. He posits that sensations exist without any observer or entity experiencing them, which makes them the raw fabric of existence. Leo suggests that the viewer is the sum total of every raw sensation felt at that moment and could exist without identifying as an individual entity. 
</li><li><b>Reevaluating Self-Identity</b>: In the next segment, Leo guides viewers in a reflection exercise aimed at deconstructing their sense of self. He advises them to strip away all external influences such as possessions, family and friends, cultural influence, emotions, thoughts, self-image, and the feeling of being an individual observer. Once this is done, he asks what is left. The goal is to experience reality without any filters, assumptions, or desires for it to be a specific way.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Raw Experience</b>: The next part emphasizes the acceptance of the immediate experience, regardless of its nature. Leo encourages the viewers to sit in silence, accept any stray thoughts that come up, and feel them as the raw sensations that they are. Acceptance of reality, as it currently exists, leads to a calm and peaceful state of being.
</li><li><b>Essential Nature and Existence</b>: The subsequent discourse expounds on the viewer's fundamental and essential nature, questioning whether all that exists is but raw experience. This sets the stage for viewer introspection about their nature and existence, without biases, prejudices or pre-conceived beliefs about reality.
</li><li><b>The Contentment of Existence</b>: Leo encourages viewers to feel contentment and happiness in the present moment regardless of external or internal conditions. He proposes that mere existence is sufficient for happiness, and that viewers need not identify themselves with a physical body, self-image, thoughts, or experiences - since all of those are not truly them. 
</li><li><b>The Experience of No-Self</b>: He gives a brief guided meditation where viewers are prompted to silently observe their sensations and experiences, leading potentially to an experience of 'no-self'. This refers to a peaceful, content state where individual ego-identity dissolves, and one merges with the raw experience of existence itself.
</li><li><b>Conclusion - The Invisible Man Analogy</b>: Leo ends by explaining the concept of identity using the Invisible Man analogy. He suggests that people attach to physical and intangible 'garments' (possessions, relationships, beliefs, etc.) to create a visible identity. However, by removing these, the essential nature - comparable to the Invisible Man - is revealed. This fundamental question about one's essential nature, unadulterated by external elements, is integral to spiritual enlightenment and can only be realized through an honest, deep, introspective exploration.
