[Music] [Laughter] hey happy halloween 2021. so in this episode
we're actually going to have a pretty practical and serious
talk i want to talk about this concept that is
called burning through karma and it has very much to
do with tackling the issue of desire and craving in
your life and how to go about that this is
going to help many of you who are pursuing spirituality
who are young in your 20s and maybe 30s but
are really overlooking some uh important considerations when it comes
to spirituality on the one hand and then materialism on
the other hand so this concept of burning through karma
what does it mean and don't don't take this too
literally this is not some sort of scientific theory this
is just it's it's a loose sort of metaphor you
might say basically you know like i teach a lot
of deep spiritual stuff uh and many of you guys
who watch me are in your 20s and 30s and
one of the challenges that i one of the challenges
that i see with you guys is that because i'm
talking about these lofty metaphysical things like god and love
and consciousness and awakening and so forth that then you
tend to just pursue it simply because leo is talking
about it and it's the cool thing to do the
right thing to do the highest truth or the highest
good or whatever to pursue and while that is technically
correct the problem is that your psyche might not be
prepared to pursue it because as they say you might
have karma that you need to burn through first and
so what this just means is is it means that
look uh you have basic material needs and cravings and
desires that are motivating you as the sort of biological
animal being that you are that most of us are
we're talking about cravings for food for money for sex
for approval for fame for success for materialistic possessions maybe
it's uh having a house or having a sports car
or going on a beautiful vacation to some you know
bahama resort or going skydiving a scuba dive like this
kind of stuff right the sort of fun adventurous kind
of stuff that ordinarily if you would ask a person
like what does a good life look like and let's
say they have no idea what spirituality is or any
of these deep philosophical ideas then to them a good
life would just be like a very adventurous fun life
where you're successful you're famous you have plenty of money
you have financial freedom to do whatever you want you
have cars and you have friends and you can party
and you can enjoy yourself this people imagine this to
be the best life possible um but of course now
when i get to you and i start brainwashing you
with all these spiritual ideas you start to realize that
well the best life possible is not that that's an
illusion that's not the best life possible and then what
can happen is that you can swing your pendulum in
the opposite direction to the point where you poo poo
all material pursuits and then any actual cravings or materialistic
needs that you have inside of you for financial stability
or for friends or for sex or romantic relationships or
maybe even for marriage and children like maybe you have
these cravings inside of you but just because you've been
brainwashing yourself with spiritual ideas of asceticism and detachment and
non-materialism this kind of stuff and letting go and surrender
and not chasing and not manipulating reality too much right
these sorts of spiritual concepts you can swing your pendulum
in the opposite direction to the point where you neglect
these aspects of your life and for some people the
ascetic lifestyle might be appropriate but generally speaking i would
say that's a minority of people a tiny minority of
people maybe less than one percent of people are suited
to the ascetic mystic lifestyle where you eschew all of
these things that i was just mentioning and just go
straight for awakening something sort of like the classic you
know ramana maharshi case where the guy was like a
teenager and basically he was already so conscious and wise
that he wasn't even interested in materialistic pursuits you know
he wasn't interested in women he wasn't interested in money
he wasn't interested in business he wasn't interested in having
a family he just he was just interested in basically
in like contemplating what death is and just awakening and
then that's what his whole life became but people you
know you have to understand that this is a very
exceptional human being you are probably not this human being
if you're this kind of human being you're not listening
to me you don't need to listen to me you're
already out there doing it and you probably are more
conscious than i am so why are you even listening
to me so for the majority of you who are
listening to me especially you youngsters i want to make
sure that you're you have one foot on the ground
and that you keep yourself realistic as you go about
developing yourself the reality is is that most of us
have animalistic cravings that we need to somehow work through
and this is what is called burning through one's karma
now whatever the the metaphysics of it is you could
say that you know from past lives you were kind
of working your way way up and now through this
life you're still working your way up and you're still
maybe not ready for a full you know a straight
path to awakening but i don't really care you know
what the what the what the actual like physical explanations
of this are whether you have past lives or not
just the reality is is that you probably have basic
needs that you need to satisfy first before you're ready
to do really deep spiritual work and really the best
time to satisfy those needs are when you're young in
your 20s and 30s and so i want to share
some some insights from my own personal lessons that i
got my own personal life experiences here which will make
maybe help to shed some light on what you're going
through because i know a lot of you guys are
going through this so basically the way it worked in
my life is that i had a certain unusual set
of priorities that i focused on so when i was
in my teens i focused a lot on my sense
of life purpose and what my career would be and
my academics and my education so i knew that i
wanted to have a great career and for that i
knew i needed to have a great education so i
put all of my skill points and sort of time
and energy into that to the point where i neglected
a lot of stuff like socializing having a lot of
friends sleeping around having girlfriends this sort of i i
deliberately ignored this it's not that i couldn't have done
these things it's that i was more interested and had
a higher priority in my education and then as i
got good at education another priority arose which was philosophy
i discovered philosophy and i started to study philosophy and
i started to just contemplate life deeply for my own
self metaphysics epistemology this sort of stuff asking the big
questions and so that became a big priority for me
that was more important to me than chasing girls and
so that's what i focused on and then through university
and university you know usually when people go to university
they party they go drinking they go to various kinds
of um dances and clubs and bars and this sort
of stuff a lot of a lot of folks will
actually spend more time socializing in university and having sex
and chasing girls and whatever else being in relationships than
they do on the academics so i deliberately ignored all
of that and focused completely on academics because i knew
that that was important for my life purpose so i
did that and then after i graduated from university i
had to work extra hard to start my career as
the beginning of my career so i worked for a
few years on that then i got my first job
and i basically got my dream job as a game
designer and that seemed to be going well but then
within about a year i realized that this is still
not really what i wanted what i really wanted was
to work for myself to be uh fully creatively autonomous
not beholden to any boss or any corporation and so
for that i had to start my own business so
then i i spent the next three years or so
like really working hard 100 on my business and so
during this whole time i was neglecting for example the
social aspects of my life now there's pros and cons
to this the pros is that i got an amazing
education the pros is that uh uh i was able
to to really work on my career and i was
able to build a a a great business which made
me financially independent and i knew how important that was
to me because because that gave me the thing i
value the most which was creative autonomy i could basically
do any kind of work that i wanted to do
that's what i wanted the most that meant more to
me than having girls relationships romance friends or anything else
so that's what i focused all my energy into and
i got it but then after about three years of
doing business there like i started to realize that my
life was out of balance i was neglecting the social
aspects i was exactly the romantic aspects of my life
and i was starting to feel that right so what
happens is that when you neglect certain aspects of your
life a craving builds up there a deep craving a
deep desire for that thing that you've been neglecting or
that you've been ascetical towards and in a certain sense
for the first 25 years of my life i was
like a basically like a monk because i was so
focused on life purpose and there was a lot of
great stuff that in a sense that built the foundation
for my life but also on the other hand there
were sacrifices that were made there because certain things like
socializing and romantic relationships and dating and this sort of
stuff this stuff is actually better learned when you're young
there's actually a certain period in your life where you're
supposed to it's sort of like the ideal window to
be learning that stuff which is basically like from age
i would say 20 to 40 or maybe even 35
like while you're young handle your romantic stuff and in
a certain sense i've that was the con there is
that i started late and then because of that there
were certain um i had to work extra hard to
solve that because you can't solve something like that that
lack of experience you can't solve it overnight or even
in a single year right because people who were doing
this since high school they've gotten 10 20 years of
experience meanwhile i was working on my business this sort
of thing so then what happened for me is after
my business uh was reasonably successful and i felt financially
comfortable i i i then i shifted i put a
lot of energy and attention i got it to pick
up i i shifted into learning to socialize going out
to bars and clubs and so forth i hadn't even
been to a bar or a club in my entire
life up to that point that's how i focused i
was on what was truly important to me um and
so i did that but i had certain deficiencies it
was difficult to it was difficult to change that because
in a certain sense when you put your mind in
a single focused way on one thing like meditation or
enlightenment or business or whatever it's almost easier i mean
it is easier it is much easier to get success
that way than it is to be focusing on multiple
things at once and trying to to get them all
right and um and then uh i did that for
a few years and then i got i started actualize.org
and i worked on actualize.org because actually it was a
new business i was really passionate about it then i
spent the next five or eight years working really hard
and actualized that or again sort of neglecting the social
and uh romantic aspects of my life uh and during
this time that i was developing actualized.org the the eight
years that i was working on actually.org flew by so
fast because it wasn't that i was just pumping out
content every single week which i was basically for eight
years but it's also that i had to be learning
so much because i felt such an obligation to my
audience to not mislead them and to inform them with
you know the best insights that i could so i
had to be reading a lot researching a lot meditating
a lot i got into spirituality during this point got
very serious about psychedelics during this point psychedelics were a
whole tangent that i wasn't really expecting that um was
a basically like a detour uh within my life and
really transformed how i see uh reality and what my
priorities were and so forth and in a sense i
got into spirituality and i just started doing it not
really knowing where it's going to take me and it
took me into incredible directions that i didn't even anticipate
but at the same time i realize now that there's
certain aspects of my life that i still haven't burnt
the karma through yet to the end and so specifically
with me it's in the romantic relationship domain so what
i've you know as i was focused on actualize at
org over the last five or eight years it's not
that i didn't have romantic relationships i i did but
they weren't they weren't like a focus of mine and
um and they didn't meet my cravings and what i
really wanted out of them so what i find now
is that what i want what i have a craving
for is um and this is something so here's the
lesson for you that you have to be very honest
with yourself about what your cravings are what do you
generally crave in life because there's a lot of times
that you might crave something but then society or somebody
else or even some spiritual teacher or maybe you even
perceive that leo myself am somehow judging you for what
you crave like maybe what you just crave is money
or what you crave as sex or what you crave
is drugs or what you crave as food or what
you crave is you know something like that that's pretty
shallow like that and basically the lesson of this episode
is you have to be honest with yourself this is
part of what self-honesty is about part of what introspection
is about and really this is part of spirituality here
is if you have materialistic cravings be honest about what
those are if you've been living your whole life in
poverty and what you really crave is to just have
some financial freedom and to be able to buy a
nice car and to be able to you know pay
for your kids so that you don't have to keep
making excuses to them for why you can't buy them
the kind of gifts they want for christmas or whatever
or you want to buy yourself some nice clothes that
you normally wouldn't have been able to afford but you
want to treat yourself materially to these things then that's
where you're at in life be careful trying to pretend
that you're more spiritual or more detached than you really
are the reality is that you have those cravings and
desires those are your particular attachments we might say that's
your karma and that's now something you got to deal
with and you need a realistic strategy for how to
deal with that so there's really the question here is
you know what are the what are the strategies for
dealing with cravings and desires ultimately what we want to
do with low consciousness or sort of base animalistic cravings
and desires is the materialistic ones is we want to
we want to exhaust them and as we exhaust them
or transcend them and there might be multiple ways of
doing that i'll talk about that in a second then
what we want to do is we want to transcend
those to reach higher kinds of desires so a base
desire might just be having a lot of money or
getting a lot of one night stands and then if
you exhaust that you can transcend to deeper and higher
quality desires like the desire to be creative for example
or artistic or the desire to have free time just
to to meditate into introspect or to do philosophy and
then you could even transcend those into even higher desires
right um ultimately if you transcend everything you're gonna you're
gonna reach the desire for total selflessness that will be
your highest desire so the more you transcend selfishness and
materialism the more purified your psyche becomes and your consciousness
and the more your desires shift towards helping others towards
communion with others towards a deep intimacy with other towards
a merging of self and other towards becoming more selfless
and more loving and more godlike until eventually you become
metaphysical love you become god the problem though is trying
to get there too quickly without deeply exploring and exhausting
burning through the karma that you have because there's a
tendency to want to kind of like leapfrog all the
all that stuff and just get to the top of
the pyramid so to speak now for for certain people
for certain spiritually talented attuned exceptional people they can do
that they don't necessarily need to go out there and
earn a bunch of money and get very famous and
have a bunch of sex in order to ultimately realize
that none of that makes them happy you know buy
10 sports cars and that doesn't do it for you
and then um and then finally then you reach god
um for for some exceptional people that's not necessary they
can just go straight to god so like rahm and
maharshi for example um but that's probably not you and
that's not even me and so what i've been coming
to grips with lately is i've done a lot of
spirituality over the last five years let's say um but
i noticed that there's still certain things that i want
out of material out of materialistic life out of this
dream that i'm in there shouldn't certain experiences that i'm
sort of missing that i want to have that i
know that i will regret not having and so for
me specifically again what that is is i want it's
not it's not just sex and it's not uh it's
not just one night stands what i'm interested in is
i want uh like a very deep profound uh romantic
experience with a woman and i mean i've had certain
levels of it but but you have to realize how
many levels of depth there are to this like a
profound uh like sexual intimacy is how i would characterize
this craving uh not just physical intimacy of course physical
but also uh emotional and and even spiritual and ultimately
metaphysical and so i feel like i haven't i haven't
scratched that itch deeply enough within myself and i feel
like that's holding me back so what i've noticed in
myself through introspection is that i could like ignore that
craving and just sort of put it in the back
of my mind and just sort of like focused towards
doing deep spiritual work and that's what i've been doing
uh over some number of years um but then lately
i've been thinking rethinking that strategy and i've been thinking
like you know i'm still young i'm still relatively young
is that the right strategy or is is the better
strategy here to actually recognize that i have these cravings
within myself and rather than trying to like deny them
or demonize them or judge them and say that they're
wrong or that they're low consciousness or that they're too
materialistic or whatever actually maybe the higher spiritual move here
is to admit to accept and then to actually work
through them not to just ignore them or to deny
them and this actually is a very high in a
certain sense counterintuitive move of self-love right because look if
you really loved yourself you would also accept and love
your shadow and your dark side any kind of materials
to cravings and desires that you have and you would
want yourself to satisfy those in a deep way such
that you can transcend them not in a sort of
a rushed way where it's like yeah okay quickly get
it over with like get it over with you know
go have sex with a few people and just get
out of your system like not like that i mean
like if you really truly loved yourself think about god's
love for you god's love for if god truly loved
you you might say like well leo god wants me
to quickly realize that i'm god uh maybe not maybe
what god wants for you is really because the love
is so deep that god accepts your agenda so much
as its own that god wants you to want what
you want in a sense that's what true love is
true love is not to demand of the other to
do what you need them to do to reach your
level true love a deeper love than that would be
a love where you you accept the place that that
consciousness is in that conscious being is at a certain
level and it can't realize the higher levels until it
exhausts its lower levels of consciousness and therefore if it
wants something petty then you're you love that being enough
that you are okay with it wanting something petty like
if your child wants some candy see one attitude you
could take is you could say you know no don't
eat any candy it's bad for you it'll it'll rot
your teeth and it'll make you fat like you could
take that attitude and you might say well that's loving
because in certain times you're looking out for the child
that's one way to look at it but another way
to look at it is that still it's not it's
not the deepest love the deepest love would be to
actually put yourself in the child's shoes don't look down
at the child what if you were the child what
if you had those cravings and you you wanted some
of that sugar maybe what the child needs is not
a a lecture from you about how bad sugar is
and why he shouldn't eat it but maybe what the
child needs is actually some like deep compassion and a
realization that this this child this this conscious being needs
to actually experience for itself what sugar tastes like to
satisfy that craving and even if he gets addicted to
it maybe he needs that too that's also part of
his evolution and and then also this conscious being needs
to learn the downsides for itself not to be lectured
about how bad sugar is but have the child eat
the sugar and then realize what the downsides of it
are through direct experience so that then the child can
awaken to something beyond the craving for sugar you see
this would be sort of a strategy of burning through
the sugar karma we might say and so um and
so really there's there's two strategies for dealing with cravings
and desires one is to try to ignore them suppress
them and ultimately let them go and it is possible
and i want you to to always remember this that
whatever craving or desire you have in life you should
be open to the idea that it's always possible just
to let it go just let it go whatever it
is you want that you think you're lacking just let
it go and in a certain sense this is the
most spiritually evolved and direct path towards your evolution is
just let it go if you can but that's a
big if if you can if you want to see
you have to want to because if you do it
out of a sort of a moralistic place like uh
you know a lot of religious people will do this
stage blue religious people is they will they will try
to you know avoid sinful behavior because it's wrong and
they're going to go to hell and there's some sort
of like they feel like there's an external moralistic pressure
put upon them to not behave in sinful or evil
ways well that's definitely not going to work because that's
going to lead to guilt and suppression and repression and
that's that's so that's a recipe for uh um for
a lot of bad stuff uh so the other approach
is to uh actually recognize that you have this craving
within you and then actually to in a in a
non-self-destructive manner to go about satisfying it with the idea
that you will pursue it for some number of years
hopefully you will reach the results you want you will
experience the fruits you'll experience what it's like to satisfy
that desire and you will also experience that the satisfaction
of that desire does not make you complete or happy
in some ultimate sense you're still going to be facing
with unhappiness and there's still going to be many problems
in your life and you're still not going to feel
complete and the reason that is because what you ultimately
desire is you desire infinite love you desire god you
don't just desire some sex or a relationship or some
children or some money or a sports car you desire
something much deeper than that but you yourself aren't ready
to really face your true desire and you're not really
really ready to surrender all of your attachments yet to
reach that highest level of selflessness and love so you
have to work your way up to it in baby
steps so that's the second method i think the second
method is much more realistic for many people and i
want you to think about your own situation in life
whatever it is for you whether it's food sugar sex
money houses cars relationships whatever get clear about what you
really crave and get clear about what things are you
willing to surrender without experiencing them and then what things
are you unwilling to surrender what i mean what desires
and cravings are you simply unwilling to surrender without first
experiencing them like for example let's say you're a virgin
and i tell you you know hey you can be
totally happy and complete you can experience profound levels of
of metaphysical joy and bliss and ecstasy beyond anything that
a human orgasm can give you that beyond any sexual
experience that you can get i can tell you that
and that's technically um and so in that sense you
might say okay well then i don't need sex i
don't need to pursue sex i can just shortcut that
and just go straight to to what leo's talking about
here with this sort of metaphysical ecstasy and spiritual ecstasy
but like um but then you also have to ask
yourself yeah but am i willing to like never have
a sexual experience in my entire life is that something
that would that would sit well with me or would
that bug me for the rest of my life would
i regret not doing it and it's not that you're
fooling yourself to think that having sex one time will
somehow complete you or solve all your problems it won't
it's obvious that it won't but on the other hand
if you're so lacking in that department maybe it's not
so wise to just treat that lack flippantly as though
it doesn't matter as though it's not important maybe it
is important and and no one can tell you what's
important it's all about you like what what are you
what are your standards what kind of experiences you want
to have in this life so for me personally um
even though that i know that i'm in i'm in
a dream here and that no particular experience that i
have will ever satisfy me or please me in any
lasting way in this world in this dream um there
are still certain experiences that i want to have and
so namely i want to have some very deep um
physical emotional and spiritually and even like metaphysical um intimate
romantic experiences uh and i feel like if i just
imagine myself on my deathbed not having had what i
know i can have in this department i feel like
i would feel like my life was not fully actualized
something would be missing and yet at the same time
i'm not fooling myself into thinking that if i have
some of these romantic experiences that all of a sudden
that will like solve everything in my life you see
so it's a little bit subtle and nuanced here i'm
not fooling myself anything that if i have these experiences
that now all of a sudden you know like the
spiritual work is no longer important i can just ignore
that no in fact the way i frame it in
my mind is that i need to burn through this
karma i have these experiences that i want to have
satisfied to a certain degree and then also realize that
that it still won't fully satisfy me and then then
i can go to really deep spiritual levels with my
work and if i try to ignore this then it's
going to hold me back from going to the deepest
spiritual levels that i could go to so that's sort
of the conclusion that i reach for myself um again
i'm not saying this is something that applies to you
i'm just giving this to you as an example so
that you can you know try to apply this to
your life see in which areas of your life this
applies maybe it applies with your finances maybe it applies
with your art for example on the one hand you
want to pursue awakening in god and love on the
other hand you just want to be artistic and you
find that there's some tension between those two like should
you focus more of your energy on your art or
on your meditation your spiritual work and you find that
when you focus your attention on on the meditation spiritual
work in a certain sense you know that's like the
right move but in a certain sense it doesn't really
satisfy you as much as if you focused on your
art right now for the next five or ten years
and so my point here being is that when you're
still young when you're in your 20s and 30s and
maybe even 40s there's something to be said to investing
that time on tackling materialistic desires that you have try
to get that out of your system as early as
possible i see that some of you who are following
me are sort of taking the opposite approach which is
what you're doing is you're sort of like neglecting all
the material aspects and you're just going straight to psychedelics
and straight to meditation and self-inquiry and yoga and nonduality
and you're still maybe only 20 years old or 25
years old or 30 years old and i think that
this is dangerous now for some of you it's it's
right and if it works for you it clicks for
you great do it but for others of you who
are trying to do this and you're seeing that it's
failing you're not getting the results you want i would
suggest that maybe you need to rethink your strategy and
that really you got to get honest with yourself about
your materialistic cravings and desires and needs and really focus
on those first focus on those for 5 10 15
years satisfy those you know build a business do your
art develop your career um handle your finances move away
from your family so that you're independent you're not under
there um you know under the heel um have the
romantic and sexual relationships you want develop the friendships you
want go socialize go party go have fun do this
sort of stuff get it out of your system and
then maybe when you're older now once you get that
stuff out of your system then there will become a
natural place in your life where you say well i've
done this and i've done that i've traveled i've ate
great food i've made good money i've had some fame
i've had some success and this sort of stuff and
okay i've done that stuff it's great fine but now
i want something more and then i think that's really
when your spiritual work will produce the most fruits and
in a certain sense to to pursue awakening and spirituality
too early in your life is in a certain sense
doing things backwards now again for some people it's it's
appropriate but for most people i think it's backwards actually
because there is that maslow's hierarchy of needs and self-transcendence
is at the very top of the hierarchy for a
good reason so you want to satisfy your lower needs
first for most people now again this doesn't mean you
have to do it this way it just means for
most people this is probably their karma and what they
need to do is you know burn through a good
amount of it in their 20s and 30s before they
can get really serious about spiritual work now you might
wonder well but leo um what makes the difference how
about you know some people who pursue like sex or
luxury or travel or money it seems like some people
maybe even most people pursue that stuff and they get
stuck in it they get lost in it and they
end up chasing money or sex or whatever like for
their entire lives it doesn't seem like they exhausted what's
the difference between a person who pursues sex and has
sex for five or ten years gets a lot of
it out of his system and then moves on to
other things versus a person who becomes a sex addict
and just has sex chasing women endlessly you know philandering
endlessly for the rest of his life what's the difference
between those two how do we avoid this second situation
how do we actually make sure that when we're pursuing
and satisfying our desires that they're actually getting satisfied and
then transcended rather than just an endless pursuit of the
same thing over and over and over again like some
people you know some some millionaires and billionaires they just
pursue more and more money there's they're like 80 90
years old and they're still just chasing money every day
they're waking up thinking about how to make more money
but what's the point of all that money you're going
to be dead in five years you don't need any
more billions of dollars you already got more than you
can spend what are you doing so this is this
is a question i've been pondering it's a deep question
i i recommend you contemplate it too because i honestly
i don't know exactly the answer but here i'll speculate
a little bit with you i think that i think
that honestly some people are just so dense in their
consciousness and they have so much karma so to speak
to burn through that in this lifetime they're not going
to burn through much of it they're going to get
stuck with sex money or whatever i think that another
important factor is that these people just don't a lot
of people simply don't have the theoretical foundation to know
about the possibilities of even transcending these desires and what
what greater things lie beyond right so if you've been
following actualize.org and you've been studying my content then you're
in a rather unique situation because i've talked a lot
about the limitations of materialistic pursuits and uh you know
if you've contemplated this stuff you should and you introspective
you should notice how you're chasing and pursuing of materialistic
things never really fully satisfies you and so as you
apply consciousness to the fact that your selfish actions and
your limited ways of pleasuring yourself um as you become
more conscious you realize that the these things they they
they don't lead to the greatest satisfaction and then you
listen to me and i talk about things that are
sort of higher forms of satisfaction like spiritual satisfaction that
you might get or if you've done psychedelics you've experienced
the kind of love profound love and sense of completeness
that you get on a psychedelic journey um and that's
just that that puts your ordinary materialistic pursuits into into
a context into their place it shows you how petty
they are right but i think that for from for
most people who are out there pursuing materialistic things um
they're roughly a spirodamic stage orange they don't even know
of the higher stages they don't even know about green
or yellow or turquoise they don't know about transcending the
ego they don't know about spiritual ecstasy and bliss right
they don't know about love they don't know about god
they don't know about these things they're not even in
that person's mind like you know take someone like like
warren buffett i don't know i really don't know much
about his psychology or what he knows or doesn't know
but i just picture him as somebody who just like
materialistically pursues more and more money for its own sake
i don't know how this makes him happy but apparently
apparently it does somehow um i don't know why he's
like 80 years old now and he's still not sick
of pursuing money and just investing more and more i
would think he would have exhausted that by now but
apparently he hasn't and why is that probably because he
doesn't know that there's higher things because he's so stuck
on just that one thing also i think that people
who are very very good and talented in a narrow
capacity at one thing they can easily get stuck in
that thing so for example if you're really really good
at investing you can easily get stuck 80 years of
your life just investing investing investing investing because that's all
you know that's that's what you're best at and you
don't want to explore any other aspects of life really
because you wouldn't be very good at them as you
are at investing or if you're like if you're really
good with women i know some guys like this who
are just like players like they're just naturally really good
with women they always were and so for them having
lots of sex just comes very naturally and effortlessly they're
really good at it it gives them a certain amount
of pleasure of course it never fully satisfies them so
they have to have more and more and more hundreds
of women and then they just keep doing this into
their 40s and 50s and maybe their whole life they
will just be doing this um and uh that just
might be because that that's the like the easiest path
for them that's what they're really good at and then
for them to do something else to find other higher
pleasures this might be um you know this might be
very much out of their comfort zone not something they're
talented or or gifted in and they would have to
work really hard at it it would be painful and
so they don't do it they don't go in that
direction i think that also people with a lot of
trauma early trauma that trauma can can sort of twist
and distort your psyche and get you stuck in certain
ways and then keep you stuck there in those patterns
for the rest of your life unless you go and
deeply heal that trauma and address it and of course
that trauma usually is very difficult to heal it's painful
people don't want to look at it it's buried deep
in the psyche and so i think a lot of
trauma contributes to people getting stuck um and that would
require you know years of therapy years of psychedelic work
years of introspection and and for many people it's easier
just to avoid that and just to you know to
focus on the simpler pleasures of life as sort of
a coping mechanism against that um but what i would
say is that if you pursue the satisfying of some
of your deepest desires some of your genuine desires with
an attitude of mindfulness and consciousness and you put it
in the proper context and also at the same time
you're studying spiritual theory and you're building this deep foundation
that we build here with with actualized content and maybe
you're exploring a little bit of psychedelics and you're still
meditating a little bit these sorts of things um and
you you understand that the pursuit of these desires is
going to be a temporary thing you're not like you're
not fooling yourself into thinking that you're going to keep
doing this for the rest of your life in fact
you might sort of set it like a rule for
yourself like okay you know i'm going to pursue business
for the next five or 10 years i'm going to
exhaust that i'm going to pursue money or fame for
the next five or 10 years i'm going to exhaust
that i'm going to pursue sex and relationships for the
next five or 10 years i'm going to exhaust that
craving and then i'm going to move on to higher
things and by the way when i say exhaust and
move on to higher things i'm not saying that you
know you have relationships for 10 years then you stop
having relationships after 10 years i don't mean that i
just mean that like you're going to get to a
point where you're not needy and lacking in that thing
anymore whatever is money you know i'm not saying you
you make money for 10 years then you stop making
money i'm saying you focus on money intensely for 10
years maybe over overcompensate for that and then maybe your
business stabilizes you can still earn money you can still
do business but then after that that's not no longer
like a a deep motivating thing for you you move
on to other things meanwhile you still end up earning
a little bit of money right like you don't be
be realistic about how this works um and so in
this way you evolve and also you know you you
you're aware of spiral dynamics you're aware of developmental psychology
you're aware of the susan cook reuter nine stages of
ego development model that i talked about um with an
episode series by that title so um you're aware of
those stages and you you know you're you're sort of
anticipating that basically if you're sort of following this developmental
psychology model of spirodynamics or susan cook reuter you're sort
of expecting that every five years or so of active
development will move you up one stage five to ten
years one stage so maybe right now you peg yourself
at blue or orange so you kind of anticipate that
you know for the next five or ten years i'm
gonna move one stage from orange to to green and
then another five or ten years from green to yellow
and so forth um [Music] so as long as you're
studying this theory and you're you're serious about your own
evolution i wouldn't worry too much about getting stuck chasing
some desire for the rest of your life i think
that mostly happens when people have a lot of trauma
and who are overly specialized in that thing and also
they're not they're not they're not thinking deeply about metaphysics
spirituality and the all the foundational kind of principles that
we talk about in this work so i think if
you're if you're following that then i wouldn't worry too
much about that and i would actually encourage you to
allow yourself to accept embrace and to even love some
of your cravings and desires and to to be honest
with yourself about your need to satisfy those and to
burn through some of that karma and also recognize that
there are certain things that are best done when you're
younger and other things that are best done when you're
older in fact spirituality and meditation and awakening we might
say that these are actually more suited towards the second
half of your life not the first half of your
life because in the first half of your life you
really have to master survival that's what a lot of
you are missing you need to figure out a way
to pay for yourself to be independent of your family
to um socialize have friends have intimate relationships because you
crave those things um like if you're like most people
you need to figure out your nutrition your diet your
exercise regimen you need to work on your health make
sure that your health situation is stable and balanced so
you don't have problems there if you have any kind
of disorders autoimmune issues whatever you got to fix those
a lot of those have to do with your diet
and your lack of exercise success this is the time
to work on your success if you have a feeling
that you need to be artistic this is the time
to be artistic because this you're in your prime you
know in your 20s and 30s you're at your prime
intellectually in many ways you're at your prime in terms
of your energy levels because after age 40 your energy
levels are going to start to dip um your cognitive
capacity is going to start to dip um and also
like with with with with sex specifically and romantic relationships
um your 20s and 30s this is the prime time
this is when you do it because the last thing
you want and this is sort of like where i
was coming from thinking about this is like the last
thing i want is to be some 60 year old
man who is very awake and conscious and spiritual but
on the other hand i still have sexual cravings that
i didn't satisfy when i was younger and those are
still lingering with me when i'm 60 and then i'm
like a horny 60 year old right like this and
and you actually see this with plenty of spiritual teachers
a lot of spiritual gurus and so forth and monks
um one of the problems with them is that because
usually a monk goes into being a monk very early
in life in their 20s and then they spend like
let's say all their 20s and 30s pursuing monk hood
and sainthood and this sort of stuff being a yogi
and then they end up being like a great teacher
in their 50s or 60s but then you have all
these sexual scandals that happen with these spiritual cults and
so forth because the bottom line is that these these
some of these gurus and monks and yogis and so
forth they um they kind of went about the whole
thing backwards and then they spend their later half of
their life trying to like satisfy some of those base
sexual cravings and i think that honestly they um they
still have those very powerful sexual cravings because they didn't
satisfy them when they were a monk and and honestly
awakening and enlightenment may not be enough to satisfy you
in that domain it may it may not be enough
it can satisfy you in other ways but you will
still have those lingering sexual cravings that you didn't get
out of your system and maybe you'll have other sorts
of cravings maybe you'll have a craving for money too
because you didn't pursue it when you were younger so
there is a certain wisdom to pursuing the base material
things when you're in your first half of your life
um otherwise you're going to end up as some like
creepy 60 year old who's all awake but then like
chasing 20 year old girls you you didn't satisfy that
when you were in your 20s and your 30s and
then that can become abusive that can become toxic and
kind of creepy and weird um and so like looking
at my own life i see myself like i don't
want to be in that situation so i want to
um and i want to be realistic with myself now
could i just sit down and tell myself you know
what i'm just going to completely let go and surrender
of any kind of cravings or desires that i have
for any sexual or romantic experiences any kind of intimacy
intimacy just let go of all of it and just
go purely for the abstract metaphysical love and that will
be enough to satisfy me i mean i'd like to
believe that's possible um but on the other hand i'm
also just human i'm infinite but i'm also human too
right that's that's the conundrum and so are you you're
infinite but you're also human and so your mind is
corrupted with various kinds of attachments and limitations you have
a limited finite mind um which is attached to a
sort of an animal body and that animal body has
its cravings and needs and you have to be realistic
about those in general i think that the idea that
you can transcend sexual craving through pure abstinence is a
very flawed idea and that for the majority of people
this will not work that's also why uh i'm pretty
much against the no fap movement because there's there's this
sort of silly idea within the no fap movement that
you can just sort of will yourself to abstain from
masturbation and then that that somehow you're gonna you know
you're gonna break that craving and you're gonna transcend it
through this abstinence and through being very kind of like
strict with yourself i don't think this works effectively it's
never really worked the church has tried this various monastic
traditions have tried this and what ends up happening usually
is it backfires there are many stories that you can
read of monks and celibate priests and so forth who
try to abstain from sex because you know you're not
supposed to it's not spiritual so to speak uh and
then what ends up happening is that actually even if
those people are spiritual in other ways those cravings don't
go away in fact they intensify and they get perverted
because they're they're being suppressed they get perverted and they
manifest themselves in perverted ways in abusive ways leading to
molestation rape and all sorts of weird crepe creepy stuff
like that that um that is way worse than if
they were just honest and allowed themselves to satisfy those
cravings when they were younger in a healthy reasonable way
now of course you can always go overboard with the
satisfaction of your cravings and you can even destroy your
life by chasing sex or drugs or money or fame
or material possessions and luxury you can destroy your life
this way so it's very much about balance you have
to find that balancing point and you have to pursue
the satisfaction of your desires in a in a mindful
conscious way consciousness is the key i think a lot
of people who pursue material pleasures they do it unconsciously
and then it becomes uh it just becomes like another
habit a compulsive habit and so one area in my
life where i have transcended desire and craving the most
is when it comes to food i used to be
very addicted to food the worst kinds of junk food
when i was younger because in my family the the
notion of health food simply didn't didn't exist you would
eat the greasiest saltiest fattiest uh least healthy food that
you could find because it tasted the best that was
the sort of family culture that i grew up in
and then i i had to work really hard to
change that within myself and that took a process of
like 10 years of rewiring my mind retraining myself but
i i'm i'm at the point now where um i
still get cravings for sugar and sweet things for example
and certain kinds of you know guilty pleasure food but
generally speaking i've i feel like i've transcended those cravings
and part of the reason that is i think is
because what happened with me the way i translated my
food cravings is basically i ate so much of the
greasiest saltiest unhealthiest worst food imaginable in my youth i
ate so much of that food that i basically became
disgusted with myself and the consequences this was having on
my body on my physical appearance on my self-esteem on
my confidence on my sexuality um on my ability to
attract girls on on my on my mental performance on
my mood and my feelings my energy levels all this
stuff i became so disgusted with the negative consequences of
this that i reached certain tipping points in my life
there were multiple tipping points that i reached where i
just like swore off junk food forever and it was
such a deep swearing off that i don't even crave
it anymore like for example i haven't eaten pizza in
probably eight years i have i hadn't eaten a slice
of pizza not because i don't love it i love
pizza ordinarily speaking um but um i just i reached
sort of a tipping point where i became disgusted with
eating pizza to the point where now i can walk
by you know a pizza parlor and they have these
big juicy pizzas rotating right in front of the window
i can walk by and i can look at i
can kind of say in my mind i can be
like yeah that looks that looks kind of delicious but
on the other hand i have no more craving for
it it's a it's a very interesting phenomena i kind
of i can appreciate it i could i could almost
want to eat the slice but there's no more craving
and i don't really have to hold myself back the
way i used to in the past a similar situation
for example with ice cream i i would love ice
cream i would you know over eat buckets of ice
cream to the point where i was just nauseous and
disgusted with myself from eating so much ice cream but
then after doing that so many times i became so
disgusted that now even though i still enjoy ice cream
um i basically rarely partake in it and um and
if i do it's not gonna it's gonna be moderate
it's not gonna be to the extent where i nauseate
myself with it and i'm disgusted with myself um and
and that took a lot of a lot of failure
and trial and error to reach that point in my
psyche where something shifted like that so i think similar
things are possible for example with sexual cravings and with
cravings for material things um i still have certain material
cravings i would say the biggest one would be like
romantic intimacy um and you might not even say that
that's material i mean in a certain sense it's not
material really what i crave is not sex what i
crave is like a deep spiritual intimacy with another human
you know fem with feminine energy basically um you could
call that material or not material however you want but
still it's a craving and so i kind of put
it in the material category it's sort of an attachment
but you know i still for example enjoy nice things
i like to buy nice things sometimes i like buying
i like to buy nice clothes sometimes um but it's
it's very help i would say my relationship to all
that is very healthy in the sense that i i
don't go overboard i don't waste a bunch of money
here or there and i don't fool myself into thinking
that this is going to somehow make me happy or
that this will obviate the need for deep spiritual work
that i plan to be doing in the future so
anyways these are just some thoughts on what it means
to burn through karma think about how this applies to
your own life be realistic with yourself if you can
surrender and let go certain cravings just without having to
experience them then do it that's the most direct path
but if you can't that's also okay and consider this
as part of your practice of self-love right god's love
for you is so profound that if you want to
eat a bucket of ice cream to the point where
you're just disgusted and you have a stomachache and you're
in a food coma for the next day from eating
a gallon of ice cream god's love for you is
such that god wants you to experience that and there
is a higher wisdom there that when you do that
that's where you your consciousness truly starts to learn from
direct experience why you shouldn't eat a bucket or a
gallon of ice cream right you sort of hit rock
bottom and that's honestly what happens with a lot of
alcoholics and drug addicts is at some point they hit
rock bottom either they die or they hit a psychological
rock bottom where they realize like you know if i
keep going down this road my entire life will be
destroyed and so i have to stop and then they
learn to stop and then they learn to moderate themselves
now you have to be careful you know with something
like hard drugs it's it's extra dangerous because you can
easily kill yourself you have more leeway when it comes
to sex and food and chasing money and so forth
but still you have to be careful because you you
can waste decades of your life chasing this stuff if
you're doing it in a compulsive unconscious way and you
don't properly contextualize so what i recommend is that if
you're going to pursue some of your you know material
desires and cravings do it but still keep learning the
theory keep learning the theory keep reading the books keep
a little bit of a spiritual practice going you can
still meditate an hour a day while you're pursuing whatever
you're pursuing materially you can still do a psychedelic once
a month and now psychedelic for example will will help
to keep your priorities straight so that you understand and
remember you don't forget that this chasing of whatever material
thing you're chasing that it's not going to ultimately lead
to the highest satisfaction for you psychedelics will show you
that they will get you to think deeply about your
priorities and so just what i recommend is that you
maintain even if you're going to be doing something material
like doing a business or pursuing money and fame still
maintain at least a little bit an hour or two
a day of some kind of spiritual practice or just
even spiritual study or just reading spiritual books or watching
my videos or watching somebody else's videos along the same
lines as what we're talking about here just to make
sure you don't completely fall off track right and then
also put this process into a larger context of like
this is part of your whole evolution right it's not
that you're pursuing women or you're pursuing a car or
a house for it so it's like you're seeing that
that's that's part of your evolutionary process and and that
that puts it into a larger context and you have
sort of a plan in your life that you know
for the next five years i'm gonna be doing business
then for the next five years i'm gonna be doing
uh relationships then for the next five years i'm gonna
be doing something else and then i'm gonna be evolving
myself in this way and i think if you do
it like that then um realistically for most people this
is the best way for them to evolve themselves telling
the average person to just drop all of their cravings
all of their attachments and go straight for god in
love this is not going to work for the majority
of people it has never worked throughout the history of
of of mankind it has never worked this has been
tried by spiritual and religious orders and cults and traditions
for thousands of years there have been ascetic monastic traditions
and and what's the conclusion from all that we have
we have thousands of years of experience the conclusion is
that it works for a tiny percentage less than one
percent of people and for normal people it doesn't work
it's not sustainable they don't have the spiritual giftedness for
it they have too much karma they have too much
baggage uh or whatever they're they're simply not wise enough
to execute on that and honestly i don't know if
i'm uh strong enough to execute on that like a
hundred percent directly you know in the sort of in
like the classic buddha sense you know the buddha just
like the buddha the story of the boot is that
he left his wife he left his children he left
his palace in his kingdom and he went for seven
years into the force to meditate and to attain nirvana
and enlightenment um that's very [ __ ] radical the
reason that story is so powerful is because precisely because
almost nobody that story doesn't apply to almost anybody it's
it's like supernatural it's like being the michael jordan or
the kobe bryant of of baseball or basketball um like
that the average person cannot ever become that good at
basketball they don't have that kind of drive that motivation
that skill set those genetics that perfect combination of everything
that is necessary to be able to achieve that level
of world-class performance so um be careful comparing yourself to
these sorts of mythical figures like ramana maharshi or the
buddha or christ or something like this you're not like
this if you were you wouldn't be watching my videos
and i'm not like that either right uh i'm not
as spiritually strong or um maybe courageous or as motivated
as those people so i have to i have to
do spirituality in my way whatever suits my situation i
can only progress at my own rate so you have
to be careful comparing yourself to people who you are
not like um all right so there you go there
you have it and now you understand what burning through
karma means i'm gonna i'm gonna use that phrase in
the future i've been actually wanting to explain this phrase
for a while because i like using it it's just
a quick little phrase that you can use to help
to help people who are stuck and sometimes what happens
is that when you pursue spirituality too early too soon
without handling your basic survival what happens that you can
actually get very bad consequences you can misapply the teachings
i've spoken about that in the past you can even
become suicidal or depressed you can get ahead of your
skis or you can just put yourself into a very
bad material situation where you let's say you even attain
your mater you know your your spiritual pursuits and fruits
you attain all those but then like your life conditions
are very very bad you don't have a house to
live in you're homeless you don't have a career you
don't know how to make money you know how to
socialize you're very awkward with with people you're sexually inexperienced
this sort of stuff and that that doesn't really make
for a great life either you see so balance is
important survival mastering survival i consider that uh inescapable if
you think you're gonna pursue buddhahood while completely ignoring survival
and that the pursuit of buddhahood will allow you to
short-circuit the need to learn survival you're fooling yourself in
fact if you can't master basic survival then the chances
of you ever waking up i think are pretty small
i would consider getting proficient at survival like a prerequisite
even for the pursuit of serious spirituality because serious spirituality
is is much more difficult than just learning how to
get a job or developing a career or earning a
bit of money or learning to socialize or learning some
dating skills so be realistic with yourself and remember that
everything i said here is really a part of a
deeper self love you're not going to reach the highest
spiritual attainments through some sort of puritanical moralistic guilt-tripping of
yourself there has to be a deep self-acceptance a deep
honesty about your own limitations whatever they are your own
cravings you have to accept them you have to love
them and only then can you transcend them so try
that on precise you
