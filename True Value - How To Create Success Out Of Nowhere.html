hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about true value okay let's
talk about true value so I've been thinking about this
issue of value and sometimes I use the word value
in my videos and I talk about lower values versus
higher values the way that I'm going to be using
it in this video is a little bit different so
there's a couple of different definitions for what value is
although there is overlap eventually so what do I mean
by true value I think that a lot of our
potential and a lot of opportunity in our own lives
is simply squandered because we're not very good at seeing
the true value of things or tasks or projects that
we can be involving ourselves in how does this actually
work how does this practically work well I find this
happening in my own life I find this happening in
the lives of my clients other people really what's happening
is it's very easy to look at a thing and
value it in an unrealistic way instead of seeing what's
true about it we see the apparent value or the
value that society puts on it or the value that
our family puts on it or the value that somebody
else's belief system puts on it rather than the real
value that that thing has to to us to you
to me to whoever is doing this evaluation so how
does this actually look in real life well give you
an example I was coaching a client of mine who's
really brilliant sharp guy he's a video game designer and
one of the challenges he had is that we were
talking and he said well he felt like he wasn't
getting enough learning out of the work that he was
doing and that the company he was working for he
just wasn't able to get enough knowledge there he felt
like he wasn't progressing fast enough and so we were
looking into that issue and one of the things that
came up is that he really felt like he didn't
have any tools or avenues to go down to learn
more about his craft and that's a serious problem right
you got a you got to be always learning to
get better so we were looking into that issue and
then what came up is that we found out as
we were talking that he actually had access to the
GDC bolt and the GDC vault is for video game
designers and museum developers probably you don't know this not
being involved the industry but I was in that industry
and what they have is they have a convention called
GDC it's the Game Developers Conference and it's held once
a year in March in San Francisco and what that
means is the best game developers in the entire world
all flocked to that one location in a convention hall
and basically they have they have speakers giving amazing lectures
they have visionaries they've got literally the industry leaders all
there they're doing roundtables they're giving lectures they're giving their
best tips and techniques all the stuff that they've been
working on in the last few years they bring that
out they talk about they dissect it they analyze it
so this is a really an amazing opportunity for a
designer to be in at GDC and you can listen
to a lot of these lectures learn a lot of
stuff and this goes on for about one week every
every month in the month of March every year so
the GDC volt what that is is it is all
the lectures and all the panel discussions all the roundtables
from every GDC over the last like 15 years and
that has been all organized as audio files and I
don't know if they have video now they probably have
video as well so audio and video just all the
resources of all those discussions are there now that is
a goldmine and I remember when I was a designer
I would I didn't have access to the whole vault
but I would selectively purchase just individual lectures from from
that vault and there's literally thousands of lectures in there
and I would just buy one or two lectures and
even there I got so much value out of that
it gave me so much know-how so much advancement as
a designer that I was like wow that's amazing I
need to study this more and so there was a
lot of value in that right now this uh this
client that I was coaching he actually access to this
entire vault for free through his company and we're talking
about that and it seemed like he was so down
on his prospects that he didn't really see the value
in what he had there the opportunity and that's a
lot of what happens in our own lives is that
we don't see the opportunities that are already there sometimes
we're so caught up in the way that our life
is already flowing that we miss some of these gold
mines literally gold mines that we can go and we
can dig through and just pull out total gems so
you know it took me some it took me some
effort to convince him that this is actually something that
he should mind some more because he's got this opportunity
now he needs to go in there and capitalize on
it right and maybe now he will because now what's
happened is that literally I saw the value that he
was missing and then I pointed him to it and
I said look you're missing value here why don't you
go and try to capitalize on this value and then
in his mind it triggers and it goes like all
right there is more value here than there appears to
be on the surface and then when he goes in
there and evil digs through it he'll actually probably discover
that there's even more value than he even thinks there
is right now because stuff will just pop up right
you can't even anticipate what you're going to get from
going through and looking at hundreds or thousands of lectures
you can't even anticipate some of the enormous potential that
that can have I mean he could pull out one
idea from that that will start some new project start
a new business venture help him with you know serious
challenge at work that he's got and I find that
that is so so true and that that this is
just one example I mean I find that this is
happening in my own life too there's so many things
that when I really think about it put my focus
on and I really ask myself what's the true value
that and I like I see it I get a
flash of it because this is consciousness this is awareness
they have to bring to the problem you bring awareness
to it it's like whoa there's so much value there
and yet I'm not capitalizing on it at all and
yet I spend the rest of my day complaining about
how I should be doing better I could be doing
better I don't have enough resources I don't have enough
of the know how or the information that I need
to move forward when in fact there's so much out
there now why is this happening this is happening because
of this distinction between apparent value and true value and
society has to carry us along and we're unconscious and
we get on in the flow of society we go
along with it and we just tend to conventionally value
things as society values them you know you see for
example a nice Ferrari on the street and that Ferrari
you might say oh damn like you're let's say you're
walking with your friends you see that broad it's like
damn like that's something to behold because do you know
that that car probably costs what a hundred thousand two
hundred thousand three hundred thousand whatever it cost right a
couple hundred grams that car cost and you're like wow
that's something special there's a reason I'm looking at that
Ferrari and I'm not looking at this at this Toyota
Camry over here because that has more value right more
value but what is the true value that's the apparent
value that's kind of the value of society it's the
surface level value what is the true value the true
value is what that thing can do for you and
ultimately how successful it can make you and how fulfilled
it can make you so when you're looking at it
from that perspective all the sudden that Ferrari might not
have as much true value as you think it does
in fact maybe this camry has more value because i
can guarantee you that the camry is much more practical
than a Ferrari in the camera you can probably actually
like load up your groceries you can actually have some
some space for for your friends to come travel with
you on a trip that you want to go on
it's a lot cheaper to maintain it takes cheaper fuel
it's probably more efficient better for the environment I mean
there's a host of really practical great things about a
camry which is by the way why cameras are so
popular is because they're extremely utilitarian and practical and still
nice you know there's much worse cars on a Camry
but a Ferrari Ferrari has some nice things going forward
as well I'm sure it can get you some attention
from the girls and other stuff like that and maybe
it can make you look like a hotshot in front
of your your business partners but is that really true
value for you you got to ask yourself that's status
that you get it with a Ferrari is that true
value or is that apparent value probably a lot of
it as a parent and the true value you're not
saying and this goes for everything you got to really
start to ask yourself what is the true value of
eating more vegetables in your diet what is the true
value versus the apparent value there what is the true
value of doing meditation the true value not the apparent
value what is the true value of waking up on
time every morning and never sleeping in what is the
true value of having a career that you're really really
passionate about rather than just dialing it in and doing
a boring nine-to-five job what is the true value of
doing personal development committing yourself to doing personal development what
is the true value of that book that you have
lying on your coffee table just that book that you've
always been telling yourself that you should read that awesome
book you all you even bought it but now it's
just laying there on your coffee table and you're not
picking it up what's the value of reading that versus
the apparent value what's the true value I find that
this is so true especially for example with a book
because the book every book actually on the back has
a sticker on it and has a value and that
value is usually for a paperback book that's what it's
usually between $10 to $20 that's about the cost of
a paperback book in the u.s. right now yet that's
the value that the manufacturer puts on it that's the
value that the author puts on it that's the value
that the marketplace puts on it but what is the
value of that book to you if it's the right
book that has the right information that is appropriate for
your life right now then the value of that book
could be tens of thousands of dollars it could be
hundreds of thousands of dollars it could be millions of
dollars how can that be well if you read a
book for example on starting a business and you've been
thinking about starting a business but you haven't yet because
you don't really know what to do and you haven't
really gotten the courage to get out there and do
it but then you read this book and you read
someone's story about how they started a business and that
inspires you all the sudden that motivates you to go
out there and start your own I mean wow what
is the what what just happened there there's there's this
divergence between you not having a business and now having
one and the difference sometimes the difference is a very
small tangible thing something that puts you just over the
top from one path on to the next and that
difference in this case could be a fifteen dollar paperback
book that is lying on your coffee table that you
have not picked up because you are not seeing that
this book has the potential of making that shift for
you from the track that you're currently on maybe working
some sort of menial job and not getting paid well
for it too starting your own business become an entrepreneur
growing through that and earning millions of dollars and creating
jobs for other people and improving the world I mean
wow what a huge difference made by something apparently valueless
right fifteen dollars for this book apparently no value I
mean I see this personally in myself I've given you
examples of some of my clients but with myself I
really see this because I have access I'm kind of
fortunate and also unfortunate in this way is that I
have access to literally all the best books a lot
of the best personal development material seminars audio programs video
programs lectures I have all this I literally have dozens
of books on my bookshelf that I've purchased already and
they're just sitting there and I haven't gotten myself to
them and honestly if I just tried a little bit
harder I would but what's happening is I'm not seeing
the apparent value as well I literally have a vault
of gold in my house a vault of gold which
is knowledge and I have it processed it yet and
I sometimes I delay I still read a lot but
also I'm not reading as much as I could be
and I'm not studying as much stuff as I could
be because when I really think about it and I
put consciousness to it which I just did before I
started shooting this video from kind of my conscious awareness
on the fact that wow I have all this amazing
information that I could be digging through right now and
how much value would that have for me it would
be ridiculous because it would be allow me to improve
my own life but then it would allow me to
share that information with you guys and then influence your
lives and so literally this information could be shaping thousands
of lives including my own and all my viewers so
for me that's like wow ridiculous ridiculous levels of value
and yet I take it very complacently right now and
the reason is is because I'm hooked on the apparent
value and not on the real value so what does
it take to see real value well I think conscious
awareness you have to start thinking about what is really
valuable in your life and what is the value of
something I'm sure when you actually sit down and do
this either through journaling or just through contemplation throughout your
day you're just thinking about stuff you think about it
and you ask yourself questions like what is the real
value here what is the real value there and you
start looking at different aspects of your life you know
all the different components that you've got you've got your
gym routine you've got what you're eating you've got your
business you've got your family life you've got hobbies that
you've got you've got the books that you're reading or
not reading the TV that you're watching the entertainment that
you're doing the way that you're interacting with your friends
all those situations you can analyze using this filter of
true value and ask yourself is this the most valuable
thing that I could be doing with my time is
the value that I think is there really there and
is the time and energy that I'm putting into this
activity is it really justifying the value that I'm getting
from it the real value not the fake phony value
but the real value and that ultimately means is this
activity promoting my well-being is it promoting my health is
it promoting my level of fulfillment is it promoting my
happiness is it promoting my peace of mind is it
promoting my bank account and my finances and my career
if it is then that's something that you want to
invest more of your time and energy into and if
it's not that's something you want to be pulling yourself
out of pulling yourself out of this can be tricky
because a lot of times you have to go against
the flow you have to go against the grain so
to speak of mainstream society and popular culture and even
the friends that are around you because your friends for
example my really hold that is very valuable to have
a fancy car and so you kind of get caught
up with them and your friends might think that it's
really important to have a nice car and so they're
trying to one-up each other with buying better cars and
showing off and maybe your your coworkers and the people
that you're working with they're also interested in that and
so it's like a game it's like everyone's playing this
game of trying to get a better car and it's
like oh who's got the best car this year it's
that guy and you kind of buy into that whole
thing that's you buying into apparent value because if you
really think about that situation you're like wait a minute
what is this car really doing for me is it
doing what I want it to be doing is it
really improving my life or is it just me playing
this game with other people like a big chess game
and I'm just moving pawns around and nothing's really happening
that's cars maybe cars are silly to you maybe that
you're saying yourself well cars I would never I would
never see any any real value a car I would
never get caught up in that but yet there's something
else that you're probably caught up on some sort of
trap maybe we can call it a value trap something
that you're doing that is not really aligned with what
you should be doing it's not really making you fulfilled
yet you're caught up on it and you think that
it's important just because either society tells you that it's
important or your friends tell you that it's important or
just your past conditioning overall maybe the way you were
raised or the beliefs that you created within yourself are
telling you that yes this is something that I should
be really focused on for example money I mean how
hooked are you on money is the money that you
want the increase in money is that extra raise extra
promotion that you want is that really going to lead
you to better health is it really going to lead
you to a better career is it really going to
lead you to more fulfillment I mean maybe it will
but maybe you won't I'm guessing that if you're at
at a at a point your life where you have
difficulty paying the bills then it probably is important to
you but if you're putting your life where you can
handle your bills and you've got most the stuff handled
and now you're just shooting for that extra promotion you
just want more you just want more and you really
look into that and you ask yourself why do you
want that extra promotion then you might look into it
one day and you might say to yourself wow you
know I'm working myself mad here trying to get this
promotion I'm I'm sacrificing time with the family I'm sacrificing
time with my girlfriend or boyfriend I'm sacrificing my own
hobbies and other things I should be doing I'm sacrificing
my own health and and peace of mind just so
I can get this extra $10,000 a year but what
is that really going to do for me I mean
it's going to be a few extra digits in my
bank account but might that time be better spent doing
something else something that more directly aligns with what I
want my life with my true and deep fulfillment that
can be hard to do because you have to really
be independent minded I think that's why a lot of
successful and really happy people in life they're really successful
ones the ones that are living extraordinary lives I think
those people by necessity have to be independent minded and
that's why I'm very keen on this idea of independence
and being independent minded you have to be thinking for
yourself because if you're thinking along with everybody else or
you have this tendency to just go with the flow
what's going to happen is that you are going to
go with the flow and you're just going to get
carried downstream and the stream that it's going to carry
you down it's basically going to carry down into the
mud of society because society's values are very much low
consciousness values they're not values of success and excellence there
are values of mediocrity and comfort and laziness it's very
easy to get caught up in that there are also
values of shall lowness and values of superficiality so while
on the one hand I'm using this money example and
it might sound like I'm criticizing money I have nothing
against money in fact I think you should make as
much money as you can and that more money is
better so there's nothing wrong and Heron tea with money
just as long as you don't use it and you
don't delude yourself into being that hamster in a wheel
just chasing something that is ultimately not making you fulfilled
so if you have a good reason for having more
money great but if you're just chasing more money with
that promotion to get more money for some sort of
shallow superficial reason just simply because you want to appear
more successful in front of your family or just because
you want to be the highest-paid person in the office
or just because you've been conditioned that you should be
making over six figures every year or some sort of
shallow silly non-authentic reason then you're never really going to
be satisfied in life and this is why you have
to start to develop your own independent thinking because you're
going to have to start to look into situations very
critically from now on analyze the true versus apparent value
and then go for the true value right because it's
very easy to see it but then have people pressure
you into giving up your notions of what the true
value is and then going for the apparent value because
it's always easy to go for the apparent value it's
much harder to go for the true value so the
true value might mean that instead of going partying tonight
and getting drunk on a Friday night you sit down
and you read a book because you see that the
book that fifteen dollar book on your coffee table that
that has millions of dollars worth of value for you
in terms of not just money but also your fulfillment
it'll make you fulfilled when you're running your own business
right versus going out and partying and drinking with your
friends on a Friday night which has maybe some value
of blowing off a little steam and having some fun
but ultimately you see that that's not really what you
want that's not really they make you fulfilled in life
doing that maybe once in a while but you don't
want to make a lifestyle of it so there you
might have this clarity moment where you say you know
what tonight I'm not going to go out tonight I'm
going to and I'm going to finish this book because
I see that there's real value in this book and
that other thing is a parent value all right so
this is it this what I have to say about
true versus a parent value go out there and find
the true value and have the courage to pursue it
that's so critical to creating an extraordinary life all right
