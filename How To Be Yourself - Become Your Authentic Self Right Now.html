hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
we're going to talk about how to be yourself alright
so let's break into this one how do you be
your self how do you be your authentic self how
do you stop acting for other people how do you
stop being a people pleaser and how do you honor
who you really are this is something that I've actually
struggled with for pretty much most of my life and
it's been a really tough journey that's held me back
in a lot of ways always being a people pleaser
and always worrying about what other people thought about me
I have other videos I have a great video up
there that talks about how to stop caring whether people
think about you so you might want to check that
one out as well but here let's talk about how
to be yourself so what I want to go into
some of the reasons of why you're behaving this way
why you're having difficulty being yourself and I want to
give you a couple of ideas about how to start
to turn that around so that's what this video is
going to be about real quick basically you can probably
notice that there are people in the world they're comfortable
being who they are they're very grounded they're very solid
it's almost like they don't give a [ __ ]
there's that type of person maybe you have friends that
are like that or you've met people like that and
then there's the other type of person which is the
type of person that is always living afraid living afraid
of what other people will think of them and what
they do is they take their authentic self and they
bury it and their authentic self it's like this the
shining light that's inside of them right picture like a
little Sun inside of you the shining beacon of light
but what happens is that you put layers and layers
of negative beliefs and limiting beliefs and social conditioning religious
conditioning bad parenting you put all that on top of
it until that that that shining beacon is so covered
in grime and dust and mud that literally none of
the light can break through just maybe in little places
where you have a crack here a crack there and
what you've got is you've got this very unenumerated an
illuminated beacon and that's what's fueling you and that's how
your life your life is coming from that from that
place and if you come from this place it's hard
to be successful in life it's also has hard to
be truly fulfilled and truly happy because your authentic self
is buried and you've got all this logic and reasoning
and beliefs around why it should remain buried and so
unless you go in there and start to dig around
really you're not going to fix it what's going to
happen is that you're going to keep it buried for
the rest of your life and you're not going to
be excel phix pressive the way you want to be
you're not going to be your glowing radiant self and
you're not going to be magnetic and so people will
not really be attracted to you as much as they
should be and you're going to have trouble in your
relationships you're going to have trouble in business and career
you're going to have trouble with communication skills with speaking
to people with a personal fulfillment to so it's not
just about how you interact with others but your personal
fulfillment you're going to lack fulfillment on a deep level
because you're not able to express yourself so let's talk
about what if some of the things that are holding
you back the biggest thing that's holding you back is
that you've got this mental image you've got literally a
mental image or even a movie that you play of
what you look like from other people's points of view
right it's as though you're being watched I can speak
about this very articulately because I'm talking from my own
personal direct experience here is that I have this and
I've had this for a long time I've really numbed
it down lately over the last five years I've really
worked a lot of those issues out but I still
I still have that lingering and I'm still working through
this is that I still when I'm you know when
I'm just walking through a crowd or I'm out of
Starbucks or I'm at the gym or even when I'm
sitting at home it's always as though I'm being watched
through a camera I kind of have that sense it's
like a sixth sense and on some level this can
be nice there could be maybe some advantages to that
you're a little bit more reflective you kind of you're
more aware and conscious of what you're doing but it's
also stifle because you're always looking at yourself as though
you were looking and judging yourself as a third person
right and you put yourself into other people's shoes and
you ask yourself well what is that person think of
me you know how did how did this play off
how do what I say affect them how did that
affect their mood their feelings and that whole game you
start playing this game of what other people think about
you and you tell yourself that this is actually okay
that this is the right way to live you tell
yourself that the reason you do this is because you're
an empathetic person because you actually care about other people
and that's what I told myself as well the problem
is that you're too empathetic like everything in life there
has to be a balance right and the problem here
is that you're overly reactive to what other people think
about you I'm not telling you to be a dick
I'm not telling to be an [ __ ] or
a [ __ ] what I'm telling you is that
if you are having difficulty being yourself and you care
a lot about what other people think about you then
you shift the scale to the other side a little
bit towards the uncaring side don't worry you're not going
to go overboard it's going to be too hard for
you to become totally cold and heartless you're not going
to ever get there so but we do need to
start to shift you so basically you have to stop
caring about what other people think about you anything that
will get you to stop caring is going to improve
your function life it's going to make you more self
expressive I think the core of why you care about
what other people think about you is because somewhere deep
down inside of you you feel like what they offer
you can have true and lasting value and really think
about this because this is a deep idea somewhere deep
down inside you tell yourself that this person that you're
interacting with whether at work or in your relationship and
your family with a friend that this person can give
you something and that something is is so meaningful it's
so valuable that you need it and therefore you will
do whatever it takes to get it now this could
be a tangible material thing like money but in most
cases it's not that it's more ethereal which you're actually
after is you're actually you're after approval what you want
is approval and approval feels so good right when your
self-image is validated by other people when people tell you
that you're a nice person when people compliment you on
how you dress on how you look on how sexy
you are on how masculine you are on how confident
you are when people tell you how good a provider
you are how much money you're making how much status
you have how cool your car is how good you're
doing at work how excellent you are how proud they
are of you right all of this all these things
are basically ways of lavishing you with approval and it
might sound on the surface like well what's wrong with
that you know what's wrong if someone tells me that
they love me what's wrong if someone tells me I
did a good job when in fact I did do
a good job what's wrong with someone giving me a
compliment on how I dressed if I really put in
a lot of time and effort and dress really nice
shouldn't I get complimented for those things I mean there's
nothing really wrong with that as long as you're not
going overboard the problem is when you start to need
it psychologically it becomes like a crutch it literally becomes
like a drug a drug for approval and it can
be really difficult to wean yourself off of this and
what you're telling yourself deep down somewhere unconsciously is that
actually this approval is is something valuable it's something like
you need you want it it's so it's so important
right either that or something tangible that you're getting maybe
it's the the sex that you're getting from your relationship
you're telling yourself that well that's something I want that's
something that's valuable to me that money that you're getting
maybe from your parents or from someone that's supporting you
or even from your job you know you tell yourself
well I really need that money or that love that
you're getting in a relationship or with your friends or
you know wherever that's support that you're getting the assistance
that you're getting maybe somebody is helping you with something
and so you feel kind of indebted to that person
a little bit obligated you don't want to rub them
the wrong way you know what if you say something
honest to that person and then because of that they
think that you're some sort of weirdo or they think
that they no longer want to associate with you you
know that might affect your work relationships maybe that affects
your business prospects maybe then your clients will think poorly
of you maybe get back around - tough - your
social circle so you have all these kinds of thoughts
and because of this you think that this is like
all these things sex money love assistants approve all these
things are valuable and what you're going to discover if
you really delve into personal development is you're going to
discover that they're actually not valuable at all and what
I mean by this is that they can never give
you true inner fulfillment these are all things that you
can chase and these are all things that are very
losery and will make you feel like you're getting it
you know like oh if I could just get a
little bit more money a little bit more sex a
little bit more love a little bit more you know
support from my friends a little bit more approval from
the people at work or from my boss then I
will be happy but that's a big big trap it's
a misunderstanding of really how happiness and fulfillment work and
really what you're looking for is you're looking there for
stimulation and excitement rather than true happiness this is too
deep of a topic to cover here if you're really
interested in what true happiness is I have a great
video on that it's called what is happiness go ahead
and search for it there I talked about some very
advanced deep concepts I go further into this idea of
what happiness is and that it's not what you think
it is but for now here's got to take me
at my word that these things are really not going
to make you fulfilled and so really what you're doing
is when you're kind of playing up to somebody else
you know when you're holding back your opinions when you're
trying to act so that you're perceived in a good
way that's basically pretension we might call that pretension and
ultimately what you're doing is I want you to realize
this is that you're you're whoring yourself out you're being
a [ __ ] very literally what does that mean
that means that you're acting you're not being authentic to
you you're not being yourself somehow you're sacrificing that so
that you can get a positive reaction from somebody else
right and this happens everywhere in life and you can
have all in very very subtle ways I mean literally
you could be whoring yourself self out when you go
to to a Starbucks right you go to a Starbucks
and there's a long line and you're standing in line
and you're about to go up and place your order
and all of a sudden someone like cuts in front
of you as though they had in order before you
but you know that they're like they're trying to to
get their way in there so they cut in front
of you but you say to yourself well what should
I do like I really don't like the fact that
they cut I should call them out on it but
on the other hand I don't want to like cause
this whole ruckus and I don't want to like impose
myself right I don't want to be perceived as being
the jerk like I don't want that guy to think
that I'm being rude or something and so you kind
of hold yourself back right and you just stand then
you're like well I'll just let him go it's not
a big deal but see what happened there even though
that's like a very small insignificant seeming thing the significance
of that is that you weren't you weren't being yourself
you were being authentic there because authentically you were upset
at that situation and you felt like the right thing
to do was to call them out on it but
you hesitated you held back and the reason you held
back was because you didn't want you know there's there's
something that you whoring yourself out for so in this
case it just might have been you didn't want him
to think bad of you that person that cut you
didn't want him to think bad of you and so
you just let it slide and if you do that
at Starbucks I can only imagine where else you do
it in your life in your intimate relationships in your
business at work at the gym right it just it's
it's a philosophy that you have and I know because
I've come from this place and so you lack assertiveness
you lack confidence and you basically sacrifice yourself and your
own values but more than that you sacrifice your your
soul basically you're basically selling your soul for loo heat
of approval you're selling your soul for a little hit
of love or sex or money or some of that
assistance that you're getting in your life somewhere so I
want you to recognize that is that that's what you're
doing so maybe that's sex you might tell me well
sex has value to me I really enjoy sex and
love has value for me I need love in my
life and I you know I need money what's wrong
with money how am I going to pay the bills
if I don't have money and you know what's wrong
if I need somebody to assist me you know people
need assistance from other people well there's nothing wrong with
it but you know is it worth the cost of
selling out your soul is it worth the cost of
all the fulfillment that you're sacrificing that you're laying on
the table because that's what you're doing and the worst
of it is is that not only are you whoring
your out in both subtle and big ways but you're
doing it for something that will never make you fulfilled
so I understand if you hold yourself out for something
that would actually last would be of actual lasting value
to you but that's not the case here right someone's
opinion of you is not going to make you any
more fulfilled if everybody the world loved you that would
not make you more happier than anybody else really it
wouldn't go and penetrate deep in here it would look
nice on the surface and he might make you happy
for a few days or for a few weeks or
maybe a month or so but it's not really going
to he's satisfied and having all the money in the
world being the richest person in the world in and
of itself is not going to make you any really
more satisfied not on the inside it'll look nice on
the outside and same thing for you know the love
that you're getting from a relationship and the same thing
with any kind of approval you're getting from your friends
or your boss or your coworkers it's just not it's
not going to work because the happiness is is going
to come from inside out rather than from outside in
so your whoring yourself out really for something that's actually
very very shallow too so that's the worst of it
is that you're whoring yourself out for that so what's
the solution well the solution is to accept that there
are real costs to being you there are costs to
being you right there's a cost for standing up to
truth sometimes people might think of you badly sometimes you
might get fired for that right sometimes maybe you'll even
get thrown in jail for that certainly a lot of
cases in history of famous figures who that's happened to
certainly your your spouse might actually leave you and your
girlfriend or boyfriend they might break up with you if
you actually are your authentic self so those are the
costs there are costs I'm not saying that those are
necessarily going to be the cost that you incur but
those could be some of the costs of being you
now you know what's the flip side of this well
the flip side of this is that you don't need
everyone to like you and in fact it's not even
possible to make everyone like you even if you everything
perfectly so you have to just accept that certain people
will not like you and that it doesn't really matter
in fact your best strategy and success chances of success
in life chances at fulfillment and chance is that most
the most people liking you is to be yourself because
when you're yourself your authentic self your magnetic you're attractive
people want to be near you maybe not the same
people that want to be near your fake self right
now so acknowledge that I'm not saying that you can
maintain everything in your life as it is and still
be yourself you might need to make some sacrifices there
might be some costs because chances are right now you
[ __ ] yourself out and now you have some
social debts right and when I tell you to stop
caring about other people and start being authentic well you're
going to cope with all sorts of reasons about why
that's too costly for you you're going to say well
then my boss will say something bad my job might
be in danger my relationship might be in danger something
else might be in danger well what's more important to
you is it more important to you for you to
be getting those shallow things or is it more important
for you to be self expressive to really be yourself
to really be fulfilled inside and then to act from
that and to live your life from that and to
create a business from that place to create a career
from that place to create a nice relationship from that
place what's more important I mean you can still keep
whoring yourself out if you want to but in the
end being a [ __ ] is not a good
way to look to go through life so my suggestion
is to to bite the bullet on this one and
be yourself despite the costs in fact what I'll have
you do is we're going to wrap with this something
practical I want you to write down a list of
all the ways and all the areas in your life
where if you started to really act yourself really honest
with yourself and expressing yourself honestly where you might incur
some costs where there might be some friction and some
tension one of those debts that you're now kind of
sunk into I want you to write those down at
work in your relationship you know in any kind of
interactions you having with other people any any area of
life write them down maybe you think that you'll have
strain in your marriage maybe you'll think you'll have strain
at work so write those down and be specific about
what the costs are and then when you survey the
whole list of costs I want you to say am
I satisfied with these costs or am I going to
decide to be my authentic self despite the costs [
__ ] the costs be yourself you're going to be
much happier and ultimately you're getting more successful - it
just might take a while for you to recreate your
life a little bit because some of those things might
actually fall off your you know off out of your
life and when they do you have to be okay
with it because you have to recognize that when you
are your authentic self now people it's going to be
better it's going to be more of a stable success
because now people that are going to be attracted to
you and situations that you're going to be involved in
those are going to be more authentic they're going to
be aligned with you right rather than being the Sham
that they are right now so you got to stop
living this this sham kind of life and the final
exercise that I'm going to wrap on is is the
following is I want you to observe yourself over the
next day in very subtle ways I want you to
see how you're whoring yourself out and I want you
to call yourself out on it so for example if
someone sends you a simple little email and you want
to reply to it but then all the sudden you
kind of stop yourself and your natural reply you want
to kind of you know you want to soften the
edges of it you don't wanna be coming off too
impolite or too rude or you're worried about what that
little paper person is going to how he's going to
interpret your response and you kind of dumb down your
response on that email make it kind of sweet and
polite well notice that notice what you're doing there is
that you are whoring yourself out to get a positive
reaction from that person and at that point I don't
want you to judge yourself this is kind of mindfulness
I also have a video on mindfulness you want to
check out this is a practicing mindfulness is you just
you just observe yourself whoring yourself out and you don't
judge yourself you don't say this is bad or good
you just let it be and you just follow through
carry through [ __ ] yourself out but be conscious
this time do it consciously I don't you do that
for the whole day and notice the subtle little ways
in which you're doing it kind of like that Starbucks
example that I gave you all right so this is
Leon we'll be signing off be yourself don't be a
[ __ ] all right even much happy you're not
being a [ __ ] trust me on this one
this has been well proven through through hundreds and thousands
of years of wisdom books and knowledge that have been
written on this stuff so it's definitely a solid principle
to follow is to be yourself and pay the costs
