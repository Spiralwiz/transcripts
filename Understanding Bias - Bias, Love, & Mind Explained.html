[Music] bias it's time for us now to get serious
this is a foundational episode within epistemology and also metaphysics
and in fact we'll be bridging epistemology and metaphysics with
this topic of bias now you might think leo you've
covered this topic plenty in the past why cover it
again and it's true i have a very important foundational
episode called self bias that you should go watch which
is a prerequisite for this one although this one can
stand on its own too you can watch them in
any order you want but i have covered self bias
and now i want to speak about an even more
generalized notion of bias which is just bias without a
self of course it's going to be very related to
self bias that topic we covered but i just want
to talk about bias period and its epistemic and metaphysical
significance so we're going to be talking about what is
bias and why is it so important what is its
existential role and this is a rather unique perspective on
epistemology and metaphysics that you won't hear covered anywhere else
sure you can hear people talking about cognitive biases and
this sorts of stuff but to really get to the
bottom of how significant bias is towards the very structure
of existence and your consciousness this is utterly profound if
you grasp the things i'm saying in this episode this
will change how you see reality for the rest of
your life it's that important so my claim is that
the notion of bias the concept of bias lies at
the very heart of metaphysics and epistemology in that you
actually cannot understand what metaphysics and epistemology are nor can
you have an accurate metaphysics or epistemology unless you have
a deep consciousness of bias much deeper than any scientist
or philosopher has bias explains the very core of reality
all human behavior all self-deception all of consciousness and all
epistemic error it's not possible to understand existence without a
deep understanding of bias and nobody in your education has
ever explained this to you no scientist no academic no
psychologist no philosopher and probably not even any spiritual teacher
which is a little bit baffling how can you do
spiritual work without a deep consciousness and a teaching about
bias but you know i've read a lot of spiritual
books a lot of nonduality and vedanta and this sort
of stuff and they don't they don't cover bias very
explicitly which has me rather surprised which is why this
episode will be so valuable to you because you're probably
not going to hear this anywhere else if you don't
hear it here so stick with me so of course
we have to wonder to get us started to get
the ball rolling what is bias well bias is a
preference for one thing over another thing it's not complicated
that's basically what it is but think about what that
really means a preference for one thing over another thing
if we assume for a moment that reality is one
which it is we've covered that elsewhere i just take
it for granted then now you understand why reality must
be one so reality is one but it contains many
parts many partitions which are what we call parts so
what's going on is that as a living organism you
have a preference for one of those parts over other
parts but now really contemplate this with me why would
one part of reality be better than any other part
why would one part be more important than any other
part have you ever wondered this have you ever contemplated
this deeply you should because if you can crack this
nut this will unravel the mystery of life and reality
for you we tend to take our biases for granted
first of all we don't even notice them we're just
unaware of them that's the first problem so you gotta
raise your awareness uh secondly we're in denial about our
biases and thirdly we don't think critically about our biases
we don't really question them we just take them as
a given as the only way that things can be
for example you have a bias towards room temperature 75
or so fahrenheit i don't know what it is in
celsius like 15 or 20 something celsius uh you have
you have a bias for that temperature as a human
and maybe a little bit higher maybe a little bit
lower but very close to that range especially when you're
not air conditioned and heated and wearing a bunch of
clothes and things the tolerance you have for what temperature
you prefer out of all the possible temperatures think about
all the possible temperatures in the universe what slice of
that do you prefer do you enjoy are you biased
towards or biased away from see your bias towards a
a very tiny sliver of all the possible temperatures that
exist and you just take that for granted and you
go about your life as though well yeah okay and
so what and you just you just mosey about your
life as though there was nothing important about that but
that's hugely important have you ever wondered why why are
you so sensitive to temperature why do you care at
all why would one part of reality or one condition
of reality be better than any other part is 75
degrees fahrenheit is that like uh because you prefer that
and you have a bias towards that does that mean
that like that's what's good for everybody in the universe
everybody enjoys that temperature kind of silly isn't it to
put it like that but of course this is just
one example you have hundreds and thousands of these kinds
of biases and this is a rather innocent example that
we're discussing right now there are a lot more problematic
examples that we'll get to soon but very existentially very
abstractly speaking what i want you to contemplate for now
is why would one part of reality be any better
than any other part and deserve preference over any other
part better to whom for whom is it better and
better by what criteria and who is adjudicating or selecting
the criteria by which you are judging which part is
better than some other part and why would it matter
at all to whom would it matter would it matter
if you were not alive would it matter if you
were not human for example if you weren't human would
it matter what temperature it is let's say you were
a rock does it matter to you if it's negative
100 fahrenheit or positive a thousand fahrenheit would it matter
to you actually contemplate that don't just believe me think
about it pause if you need to and think about
it what you should start to see is the relativity
of these situations and this now connects with the topic
i've covered in the past called understanding relativism part one
there's also going to be a part two and probably
a part three so stay tuned for those we have
a lot more to talk about in terms of relativity
but here i want you to start to see the
relativity of all biases this is going to turn out
to be crucial for the very structure of how consciousness
and the universe works for example does a rock care
if you place it into water or into outer space
or on the moon or in lava what does the
rock care see it doesn't care because it doesn't have
a sense of self the rock doesn't have a bias
but now if we take you you care you care
if we place you into lava now you must say
leo but the rock should care shouldn't it care if
it gets placed into lava because it'll get destroyed but
that assumes the rock has a sense of self that
it would be afraid to lose or that it would
care to lose but does it no you can put
a rock into lava it doesn't matter to the rock
the rock will dissolve and the rock will cease to
exist as a rock and it still won't care that's
how selfless a rock is now if you take a
stripper with big hot tits and you rub this rock
on her tits is the rock gonna care no but
why do you care whether you're a guy or a
girl why do you care why do you care if
your dick is rubbed on some hot tits or if
you're a girl why do you care if your boyfriend's
or husband's dick is rubbed on some big hot tits
that are not yours see you care very much you
have a bias towards that or against that why i
want you to really question this why should it matter
at all i want you to question it so deeply
that you realize that it doesn't actually matter but at
the same time you still want it or you don't
want it you still maintain the bias so even though
you can sit there and logically philosophically abstractly question this
sort of stuff the reality is at the end of
the day once you're done with all your philosophy you're
still going to maintain your bias that's how deep your
bias runs that it doesn't it's not it's not penetrable
to logic it doesn't matter what the logic is logically
you can know it makes no difference but you're still
going to be hung up on it and it's going
to be driving your life it's going to be driving
your behavior your thoughts your emotions your goals and dreams
so the fundamental question if you want to really understand
what's going on in the universe is you want to
ask why does why does anything matter at all why
does it matter what happens to you and of course
what you'll realize of course is that uh survival is
why things matter to you see my episode called understanding
survival part one part two those are also foundational for
this talk as prerequisites but survival is what's going on
and so uh what i want you to notice is
how your attachment to the persistent of finite things necessitates
bias do you understand what i mean by that i
mean that if you exist in the universe willy-nilly without
any attachment to existing as a specific thing then life
is easy and you don't care about anything it's carefree
but as soon as you get attached to some finite
form that you want to exist as or if you
want that form to exist near you or within your
vicinity like let's say you you purchase an expensive sports
car you want that thing to persist you didn't just
purchase that sports car and then you just kind of
enjoyed looking at it for a few minutes and then
you're okay with it getting destroyed or stolen tomorrow you're
not okay with that sports car being driven into lava
you're attached to it because you paid for it and
you have to work really hard to earn the money
to pay for it and also it gives you some
kind of pleasure in return every time you look at
it in your garage it gives you a little bit
of pleasure you're invested in it financially and also more
importantly even emotionally and uh even egoically maybe it's even
part of your self-image part of who you picture yourself
to be as a person who drives this sports car
you're a sporty type of person and maybe you even
have convinced yourself that by by driving around town in
the sports car you're going to get women to notice
you and that's how you're going to get laid and
that's how you're going to find a wife and that's
how you're going to have children and that's how you're
going to reproduce and leave your offspring and your legacy
in perpetuity this is in a sense your ticket to
immortality the sports car at least if you're foolish enough
to believe that and plenty of people are but see
as soon as you want that finite object to persist
you now need to have biases you need to be
biased towards car washes and biased against lava and hurricanes
and hail and birds and their droppings and teenagers who
are going to key your car or steal your car
you need to be biased towards good neighborhoods and biased
against bad neighborhoods where they will uh you know break
in maybe steal your radio or something you need to
be biased towards good weather bias against bad weather you
need to be biased against potholes you see what i'm
explaining is not rocket science it's very simple but this
simplicity adds up very quickly and that the trick is
that it gets ignored very easily because it is so
obvious and because it is so central to our survival
so we tend to ignore it and then we run
into all sorts of problems which we'll get into here
in a moment because fundamentally you see uh what you
should care about if you want to understand the ultimate
nature of the universe is that you need to have
clear perception clear perception of reality but how can you
have clear perception of reality when you are attaching yourself
to various things for purposes of survival and then that
necessarily creates biases and then these biases get get baked
into your mind and psyche and then you operate based
on these biases and you just take them for granted
as a given you stop even questioning these biases and
a lot of these biases are not even obvious to
you until they're pointed out to you so see you
might have a bias against hurricanes but you don't even
realize where that bias comes from you just see a
hurricane is coming on the news and you're like well
[ __ ] hurricane is coming i got to do
xyz to prepare myself and do all this sort of
stuff and now you got to worry you have fear
you have anxiety you have whatever and you just take
that as just well that's just how what it means
to be human is to be afraid of hurricanes and
what you're not realizing that access at an existential level
that's not what it means to be human that's what
it means to survive as the thing you're identified with
your car your house your body even see even your
body is something you identify with you might say well
leo but the hurricane even if it even i didn't
have a house and a car i would still be
worried because i i you know i'm human humans just
have to worry about hurricanes no that's something you're proactively
doing and you've see you've internalized these biases so deeply
you take them for granted and then this goes on
way beyond hurricanes you see this this is this ripples
and cascades through your entire life your moral system your
views about what's right and wrong your spiritual attitude or
lack thereof your religion your politics and all this sort
of stuff it's all infected by these biases you have
which are run by survival also see my episode called
how survival shapes who you are very closely related to
this topic so i won't be rehashing that we're going
to go further here so one thing you need to
start to do is you need to start to notice
how profoundly biased you are and everyone is around you
you got to keep contemplating this week by week by
week month by month year by year by year you
got to grasp it to your bones how utterly biased
you are in all these different domains of life whether
it's in relationships in business in school in in the
church that you go to wherever you go even when
it comes to the kind of youtube videos you click
on or don't see your biases even determine what you're
going to click on or even how you react to
these words that are coming out of my mouth so
let's point out to you a little bit of how
just how ridiculously biased you are and how much you
take your biases for granted so here are some examples
so here's a question for you have you ever contemplated
this why aren't you if you're a man why aren't
you interested in your mother's vagina and actually this works
well for women as well if you're a woman why
aren't you interested in your mother's vagina sounds like a
ridiculous question right it's so obvious you're so uninterested in
your mother's vagina that you even cringe when i say
that and that image pops into your mind you see
that's a bias right there already just even your your
little kind of gut response to first hearing my words
right now a few seconds ago even a little gut
instinctive response you've had of cringe or whatever or awkwardness
that already reveals how biased you are see if you're
a if you're a normal sort of heterosexual guy you
uh you spend a lot of time thinking about vagina
don't you a lot of time uh but not a
lot of time thinking about your mom's vagina why is
that why are you so biased don't take that for
granted don't just say oh well leo that's disgusting or
something like no why why are you disgusted why are
you squeamish why are you afraid to go there why
don't you want to go there why are you uncomfortable
why don't you fantasize about your mother's vagina with the
same lust and passion that you do about the other
ones and if you're a woman why aren't you as
interested in your mother's vagina as you are in that
hot guy that you want to date like have you
ever thought about that why are you attracted to that
guy's dick but not to your mother's vagina after all
what's the difference between a vagina and a dick see
you even take for granted the physical difference between these
things you actually think that the physical difference between a
vagina and a dick somehow make one more appealing than
the other but that's not what's going on because see
in the case of a guy there is not much
physical difference between his mother's vagina and the vaginas that
he's chasing after so see a guy can't have that
excuse of like well but leo that's just because you
know uh one is physically different from the other not
in the case of your mother and you might say
well leo but that she's my mother of course i'm
like i'm not gonna have sex with her but why
have you thought about that why and what's even more
interesting is why are you so instinctive about it why
are you so unreflective about it why do you take
it so for granted that you can't have sex with
your mother where did you get that idea do you
think the universe at large has a bias against your
mother's vagina like somehow your mother's vagina is just uninteresting
to the universe but that other vagina over there that's
really interesting and exciting do you think the universe sees
it that way interesting huh here's a question for you
why don't you dream of [ __ ] a goat
you've had a lot of sexual dreams in your life
whether you're a man or a woman but have you
ever dreamed of [ __ ] a goat why not
you say well leo but a goat is not human
okay so what who says that you have to have
sex with humans where is that written in the universe
where did you get that idea see when you actually
start to question these things this is what i mean
by existential questioning you're you're really questioning you're you're truly
questioning you're not taking anything for granted nothing is obvious
and also nothing is off limits and in fact those
things that you would consider off limits or those things
that you would find squeamish or uncomfortable or scary to
contemplate you actually prefer to question those things because you
have an intuition that the reason that that is taboo
or the reason that that is scary or uncomfortable is
because there's something hidden there that your mind doesn't want
you to see and what you should further notice is
that even when you do this sort of existential questioning
and you probe honestly and deeply into the truth of
the matter the truth of the matter in this case
is that your mother's vagina is no more important than
any other um that's the truth of the matter and
the truth of the matter is that having sex with
a with a woman or a man or a goat
makes absolutely no no difference in any kind of absolute
sense can you see that now you can say something
like oh leo but i can't have children with a
goat that i can't procreate okay true but who says
you have to procreate who says that's important why do
you have a bias towards procreation you say well leo
because that's what all all animals do so who says
that you should do what all animals do who says
that's important who says that's significant who says that's good
who says that's right where is that written this is
the kind of questioning you have to do if you
want to be a serious seeker of truth and so
what you're going to start to realize is that all
of this is relative but even as you realize that
logically what you will further notice is that even though
you can spend five hours sitting here deconstructing who you're
having sex with and who you're not at the end
of the day you're gonna go have sex with the
thing you're biased towards you're not gonna go have sex
with a goat even if you're conscious that there's no
reason why you shouldn't there's no good reason this is
crucial for you to actually see actually happening don't believe
me do it and see how it happens and by
do it i don't mean have sex with a goat
i mean question this stuff and see that you're still
going to be averse to having sex with a goat
now maybe maybe some of you won't be i don't
know there's some twisted people in the audience but then
again you see even when i say something is twisted
that's just twisted according to social convention is it actually
twisted who's to say what's twisted and what isn't it's
very important for you to see how your biases run
you despite any logic you have because there's this fantasy
going around these days in materialist circles among scientists and
academics and philosophers and logicians and so forth public intellectuals
the sam harris types there's this there's this sort of
air of of rationality wafting through the air as though
we're all rational actors and then as soon as we
understand something rationally logically we understand the truth of it
that then we're going to act in accordance with that
and that that is what's running the show but that
is obviously not what is running the show because your
biases are not logical there's no logical reason why you
shouldn't have sex with a goat now you might say
leo but it's you know i might get a disease
that's a that's a good logical reason that's not a
good logical reason because why are you biased against disease
and you say well because it's going to cause suffering
and death well why are you biased against suffering why
are you biased against death you see the problem here
is that the human mind is so stubborn and so
biased that it it's too biased to even want to
question these things what it does is it just draws
a sharp line it says beyond this line i will
not go so leo maybe i can question you know
having sex with goats okay i'll i'll i'll go that
far with you but i won't go and maybe even
i will go far enough to say that maybe catching
a disease maybe that's a bias of mine doesn't really
matter okay i'll go that far but when it comes
to suffering or to death that's where i draw the
line i'm not going to question that suffering is just
bad it's self-evidently bad and we're not going to question
it any further and death is just self-evidently bad and
we're not going to question any further and these are
just logical biases to have and yeah i have these
biases but so what it's logical you're biased you're stuck
on your biases when you reason that way what i
want you to actually do is i want you to
i wanna i want you to reason so objectively so
to speak with so little bias when i say objective
what i mean is no bias reason about these things
so objectively that you penetrate down to the very bottom
of of the the issue and you realize that even
suffering and death and disease that these are things that
are just arbitrary biases that you have and there's no
reason why you should have them or that you should
act in accordance with those biases why aren't you interested
in having sex with your children if you're a parent
see you don't even want your mind to go there
because you might even fear that you might even have
like a fantasy or two you're too afraid to even
go there because the consequences of it are so horrifying
to you see you're you're biased you don't want to
reason about this logically you're so you might say to
yourself well leo but but i want to keep my
children safe you know if i was molesting my own
children that they would grow up all twisted and and
um uh psychologically damaged and by the way leo it's
a crime too you know it's a crime molesting children
is a crime so that settles it right but do
you think that from the universe's point of view molesting
children is a crime no a crime is something humans
invented and there are plenty of people in the world
who do not believe that having sex with children is
a crime there are even people in the in the
world many of them hundreds of thousands maybe millions of
people who believe that having sex with their own children
is not a crime in fact for the majority of
human history having sex with children was considered perfectly normal
most girls and women were married off at the age
of 15 13 12 even 10 even younger than that
and for centuries and millennia uh noble and royal families
would intermarry and interbreed with each other deliberately deliberately in
order to maintain the purity of their genetic offspring and
they consider that not only not twisted and weird they
considered it the highest good for example in ancient egypt
the pharaoh would have to marry his own sister or
a close relative in order to maintain the purity of
the royal bloodline it would be outrageous to try to
marry somebody who's not part of the royal family this
would be considered a sin and a horrible thing to
do and he also probably married her when she was
very young too you see so none of this stuff
is as obvious as it seems or as obvious as
your culture has told you that it is and i
want you to notice your emotional reactivity and sensitivity to
these topics i picked these taboo topics as examples for
a good reason not because i have a personal fetish
for this stuff but precisely because they are taboo and
precisely because they're going to evoke emotional responses from you
and if you can't if you can't bite this bullet
if you can't tackle this problem head on then what
what chance do we have to talk about truth what
truth can there be you might say oh leo but
i can investigate truth without these questions no you can't
actually you can't this is the delusion of rationalism and
materialism and scientism is this idea that you as a
scientist sitting in your cubicle can objectively uh study reality
investigate reality without actually addressing personal issues within you as
though your ego is detached from the world and that
you can somehow access truth or find truth in this
way you can't you'll never find truth unless you're willing
to to to face your deepest biases head on there's
a whole host of biases that come with having children
why should your children get special treatment why should they
go to the best schools than other better schools than
other children why should they get more food than other
children why should they get dessert and toys when other
children are starving why should they go to the best
doctors do you see how biased you are when you
become a parent now again i'm not judging you be
careful i'm not judging you so i don't have children
which makes it easier for me not to have those
biases but i can empathize with you and i can
understand those biases if you are a parent if i
was a parent i would also have some of those
biases all right so i'm not judging you for your
biases i'm just asking you to to think about them
critically and objectively if you think about it honestly you'll
have to admit to yourself that there's no reason why
your children are any more important than any other children
and you will see that i want you to get
to a point to see look at your child and
see that your child is no more important than any
other child in the world and one way to help
you to do that is to again you can sort
of ask the question like from the universe's point of
view from god's point of view does god care about
your child more than he cares about your neighbor's child
or a child in africa obviously not right obviously not
why should god care about more about your child you
might say well leo because my child is so beautiful
and special but if you look a little bit deeper
you'll realize that every parent thinks that his or her
child is is beautiful and special and and more important
and somehow deserves some special treatment but from the universe's
point of view and another way to put this if
you don't believe in god and so forth and that
word rubs you the wrong way you can just um
you can almost look at it from a physics point
of view like from the point of view of physics
like let's say we take a totally impersonal force what's
nice about physics is that it's impersonal so an impersonal
force like gravity does does gravity care about your child
more than it does about your neighbor's child let's say
your child is really really good gets straight a's is
really cute looking and uh you know is a great
artist and and does all is nice to all the
other children like just a straight a student just a
perfect child you couldn't ask for a better child and
let's say your neighbor's child is like the worst kid
you could imagine he uh you know he bullies other
kids and he he tortures little animals squirrels and stuff
that he catches in the back of the house he
tortures those and um he's got some screws loose you
know some mental issues and and he he does criminal
activity and he smokes drugs and heroin and this sort
of stuff um does gravity care does gravity apply more
towards the good child than the bad no gravity doesn't
care but why do you care you see gravity in
this case is unbiased you're very biased why who's more
truthful are you more truthful in your attitude towards children
or is gravity more truthful in its attitude towards children
so i want you to start to intuit that there's
a connection between truth and between even-handedness or lack of
bias with a lack of bias comes in even-handedness a
sort of equality we might say is what we get
with bias i mean with without bias and conversely if
we have bias then we get inequality now isn't that
interesting those are two interesting concepts equality and inequality which
do you want in the world do you want a
world that's equal or unequal see here's where it gets
a little tricky because on the one hand you want
to treat your children very unequally you want them to
have the best schools the best doctors the best food
the best toys the best house to live in the
best part of the world to live in that's what
you want for them and on the other hand if
you're a good progressive type let's say hopefully hopefully you
don't have a worldview where you want society to be
deeply unequal let's assume you're a little more conscious than
that so if you're sort of a progressive type then
you want equality in the world you want equality in
our school system right like you don't want your teacher
your kid's teacher to treat your kid worse than all
the other kids that would be unfair that would be
unequal you don't want the principal of the school to
be for example racist against your child you don't want
other children in your school to bully your child because
he's too short or too tall or too fat or
got too many pimples or whatever or got red hair
or wears glasses you don't want him to be treated
unfairly and equally by by anybody see do you see
what's going on here already look at how your attachment
to this child has completely distorted your perception of reality
and how corrupted it's made your mind because literally you
look at your child on the one hand you want
to everything unequal that's positive for your child and then
all the negative stuff you want to protect your child
from and then any kind of inequality that would happen
to your child you would at the same time be
very opposed to that if it was against your child's
interest and your therefore your own interests you see that
and in your mind you can invent stories and rationalizations
to square all of this so that it makes sense
in your mind but no matter how many rationalizations and
denials and stories you make it's never going to solve
the fundamental problem that your perception of reality in this
situation is untruthful you're conflicted on the one hand you
want inequality when it serves you other on the other
hand you don't want inequality when it doesn't serve you
and you're you're cherry-picking and then you're creating justifications for
why you should be cherry-picking and why your cherry-picking is
is proper and correct all of that needs to be
completely deconstructed and questioned and of course see now you
start to get a sense of why truth-seeking is so
challenging and so rarely done by people because see when
you're sort of like a scientist sitting in a cubicle
and you're just constructing a theory of everything in your
mind or you're solving some calculus equations or you're running
a computer simulation this is so detached from your life
and from your emotional system and from your ego it
doesn't matter what the results are it doesn't really matter
what the result of the computer simulation is you'll accept
those results for the most part but i mean even
there scientists have attachments to pet theories and in reality
they will not accept any result they will only really
accept the results that that reflect their their their worldview
but anyways let's not get sidetracked into that but see
what i'm saying is that when you start to actually
look at an issue that touches you something you're really
attached to like your children and you try to see
that truthfully that's where it gets really difficult so one
of the tricks of the mind that causes most people
to never be able to find truth is that the
mind cordons off truth-seeking into a safe conceptual domain which
is detached from any kind of connection to your survival
conditions and this is what most academics and scientists do
and this is not an accident they do this very
deliberately although unconsciously it's actually a systems-wide corruption within all
of science and academia is that the way it's all
geared is that you can do that stuff while having
a firewall against the consequences of your intellectual constructions and
investigations so in universities they literally have something called tenure
tenure means that no matter what you publish basically or
or do in a university once you reach a certain
level of experience they give you tenure and as a
professor you get tenure and then you can never be
fired you can basically write any kind of book you
want and they don't have legal grounds to fire you
and this is kind of nice because it gives you
shelter it gives you a firewall and the justification behind
it is that well professors need tenure because then they
can explore whatever ideas they want but actually this is
a ruse in a certain sense that's true and i'm
not really saying you should get rid of tenure but
what i want you to notice is that this sort
of firewall is created and then the professor can just
go off and explore various kinds of ideas and all
those ideas are going to be detached for the most
part from his survival concerns and then the professor can
explore all sorts of interesting philosophy and abstractions and models
and science and so forth um and he will never
find the truth because you know why he's gonna get
so comfortable with his tenure and his salary and all
his colleagues and all the awards the university uh gives
all the credentials all the status all the accolades and
all of this and he's going to become some sort
of you know big status guy in his field he's
going to have a reputation to defend and once he
has all that he's done he's cooked he's never going
to find truth because questioning all of that is going
to be too uncomfortable it's going to be too threatening
just as it is to question the situation with your
child because you see if you truly take on this
project of questioning your biases with regards to your child
you might actually reach a point where it's not going
to be philosophy anymore it starts his philosophy but eventually
gets to a point where it's like but tomorrow i
have to select a school for my child i could
select the expense of school i could select the cheaper
school which one am i going to select if i
don't question my biases i'm going to just select the
expense of school because i'm trying to i'm trying to
you know maximize and survive with my child if i
question all this i might say you know what maybe
my child maybe it's not fair that my child gets
to go to some uh preppy elitist private school that
most children can't afford maybe he's just gonna go to
public school and this significantly harms your child's survival because
your child's survival all else being equal is going to
be much greater putting him in a private elite school
than into an ordinary public school because the elite school
has much better teachers it's much better funded it's got
smaller class sizes it's got better resources better books better
computers better prestige better reputations better chances of getting accepted
into higher universities and all of this and this will
set your child up for life now imagine being so
unbiased that you would actually say no to that say
no to your own child and put them in a
public school and and this will especially present a cognitive
dissonance for you if you're a progressive type of person
because as a progressive you believe all children should have
access to good schools on the other hand when it
comes to your child even if you're the the best
progressive when it comes to your child you're going to
be very tempted to cut a corner here to say
yeah all kids should belong to good schools but you
know what we live in leo we live in this
in this shitty capitalist system i can't change it so
i'm going to put my child in the best school
that i possibly can because yeah if we had good
schools i would put them in there but we don't
we don't have good public schools therefore i'm going to
put them into a private school this is exactly how
your mind is going to rationalize it if you have
the money now if you don't have the money it'll
be easier for you if you don't have the money
for private school it's not even an option then it's
easy for you for your ego to say ah well
leo but there's no problem i'm i'm a i'm a
totally consistent progressive i believe at all children should go
to private to public schools i believe private schools are
evil but it's very convenient that you believe private schools
are evil as long as you can't afford them you
see that's the trick that's the bias at work and
so yeah you'll put your your child in a public
school but that's just because there's no other option but
then you'll take credit for that and you'll actually use
that to build a sort of progressive ego now if
you're a really high integrity person and you're really conscious
you might have so much integrity that you might actually
do that even if you could afford the elite private
school but you see there's little different gradations here so
my question to you is this fundamentally what do you
care about more if you have a child do you
care more about realizing what's true or do you care
more about improving the survival chances of your child if
you had to choose between those two which would you
choose over 90 of people would choose their child over
the truth why are you then surprised at all the
inequality in the world we have all this inequality we
have racism we have sexism we have income inequality we
have people bullying each other we have inequality in terms
of what school you can go to what part of
town you can live in are you cool with that
is that the kind of society you want to live
in is that a good society is that a healthy
society how would you like it if i had a
bias against you i have lots of people who watch
my videos but let's say i knew you personally and
i just developed a bias against you i didn't like
you i didn't like your race i didn't like your
face i didn't like how tall you were or how
fat you were or whether you're a man or a
woman or whatever you are i didn't like your sexual
orientation and i treated you badly i charged you more
for my courses than everybody else i served up more
ads on my videos specifically for you because i don't
like you how would you like that see you would
be outraged and yet when you do this in your
life relative to your children or to your career or
whatever else you're you're involved in you act out on
your biases all the time and you rationalize and excuse
it away as that's perfectly fine and then you turn
around and you get upset at all the unfair treatment
in the world you get upset that women don't have
sex with you equally as much as they do with
the chads or you get upset that men will cheat
on you with more beautiful women you get upset at
that you don't like that you see so fundamentally what
selfishness is selfishness is trying to get unequal treatment when
it serves you and then trying hard as hell to
avoid unequal treatment when it doesn't serve you that's what
selfishness is and that's what ego is all about that's
what your whole life has been about are you upset
at the elites who are running the country and running
the world are you upset that it's unfair that these
giant multi-billion dollar corporations are lobbying the government and corrupting
the government with their donations and lobbyists and and political
action committees and so forth and they are buying the
politicians are you upset at that why after all your
whole life revolves around inequality in favor of yourself but
that's what those elites and corporations are doing they're just
following exactly the same principle that you've been following their
bias towards their own corporations and interests they want subsidies
and tax breaks for their company they want laws that
favor their company so for them inequality when it serves
them is great it's your own logic reflected back you
but you see the whole um the whole trick of
the ego is that it sort of uses a two-way
mirror it lets the it lets the inequality sort of
shine through in one direction but then when it tries
to come back in the other direction it reflects it
off so when you're being unequal and it serves you
you're happy you're happy as hell but as soon as
someone else is being unequal to you in exactly the
same manner under the same conditions and principles just tit
for that now all of a sudden you're outraged is
so unfair life is so unfair but you don't care
when life is unfair in your favor notice that it
takes a lot of self-honesty and integrity and commitment to
truth to notice that by the way see my episode
what is integrity part one and there will be a
part two in the future too about that so ask
yourself this question why should your company get to get
subsidies or tax breaks more than any other company question
why is order better than disorder or chaos why is
peace better than violence and war why do you like
food x but hate food why does the universe have
the same preference for the food that you like or
hate why is one style of clothing better than another
style of clothing why do you like butterflies but you
hate spiders and snakes why is being rich better than
being poor why is being free better than being a
slave you might say that leo these things are so
obvious but they're not obvious i want you to question
these so deeply that you realize that it's actually not
better to be rich than it is to be poor
and it's not better to be free than it is
to be a slave these are biases you have these
are distortions in your worldview and your perception and your
cognitive processes processes as a result of survival and in
fact you are so attached to survival that you can
no longer even honestly admit to yourself that these are
distortions you have internalized the distortions so deeply that you
actually think that these are somehow absolutely true there are
millions of people in the world who actually honestly believe
that freedom is better than slavery in some objective sense
and they call that objectivity it's a complete perversion of
what objectivity is objectivity says that there's no difference between
freedom and slavery it's subjectivity and bias that says that
there is the only reason you don't like the idea
of being a slave is because it wouldn't feel good
but who said that your feelings should dictate what's true
or what's important or what should or shouldn't happen in
the universe is the universe supposed to honor your feelings
is that what you want your personal feelings to run
the universe think about that for a moment what that
would mean if your personal feelings ran the universe you
feel this way today you feel that way tomorrow your
feelings are up and down you're depressed you're miserable you're
hateful you're bitter you're fearful is this what you want
running the universe think about how deeply selfish and biased
you are and you want that to run the universe
are you [ __ ] insane and you get upset
at god for not catering to all of your stupid
petty little whims and biases and fetishes and fears and
aversions and you curse god for constructing this horrible universe
why because it doesn't cater to your every whim and
comfort need you're literally crazy with what you're doing you
have the entire thing backwards furthermore question why is science
better than fundamentalist religion you think god cares more about
science than fundamentalist religion why is rationality better than irrationality
you think god is bothered by irrationality you think gravity
doesn't work on irrational people it only works on the
rational ones why is pleasure better than pain and suffering
why don't you want to get tortured why is life
better than death and here's a really twisted one for
you to contemplate why is truth better than falsehood the
way i've been describing all this up to now it
might almost feel as though you're saying well okay leo
so so leo your bias is truth that's your bias
so you're contradicting yourself leo because you're telling here you
are chiding us about our petty little human biases but
then truth itself becomes your bias so we can now
judge you for that who says that truth is better
than falsehood but i've preempted you because i already told
you to question that who says truth is better than
falsehood why not live a totally false and deluded life
why not be completely self-deceived who's to say that that's
any worse than the pursuit of truth question that too
question everything make no exceptions don't make exceptions for the
things i say so contemplate all these examples and more
this is just tip of the iceberg you're way more
selfish than just these examples there's just a little a
little smattering of the stuff you're selfish about and now
ask yourself what effect do you think all of these
biases have on your life on your sense making capacity
on your epistemology on your ability to understand the world
on your ability to be happy on your perception of
reality on your worldview on your truth-seeking pursuit if you
fancy yourself a truth seeker of any sort on your
ability to love on your mental health and on your
emotions and on your relationships to other people organizations and
society at large and then to yourself too your relationship
to yourself how do you think you relate to yourself
if you are so biased you can't see the world
properly do you think then you can see yourself properly
and do you think maybe that has some effect on
your ability to be happy to love yourself to be
confident to have self-esteem to be able to attract the
women you want or the men you want to keep
them to make them commit to you to love them
to even love your own children you see what's really
twisted with a child example is that you might say
well leo i just you know leo i'm just acting
out of love see yeah you're gonna get really tricky
with me you [ __ ] i'm leo i'm acting
out of love for my children and therefore out of
love for my children i'm gonna i'm sacrificing the truth
and all that stuff i'm sacrificing it for love love
is more important than truth that's why i'm sending my
children to this elite private school and to hell with
equality and all this stuff i want love for my
children but you see again there's going to be a
boomerang here it takes a while for it to boomerang
but it'll come back and hit you in the back
of the head so here's how it's going to work
you're going to you're going to tell yourself that you're
doing this out of love for your children but as
you're doing so you're going to create distortions in your
perception of reality and then those distortions remember here's how
the karma gets you you're going to be using those
lenses that you used to manipulate reality for the benefit
of your children you're going to use those lenses to
see your children for the rest of your life and
you might say leo will so what well so what
is that every time you look at your children you're
going to see flaws in their behavior and in who
they are and in their appearance you're not going to
like this about them you're not going to like that
about them why because according to you you know you
want the best for them you know they shouldn't be
smoking they should be having sex they shouldn't be doing
this and this and that and then you're going to
be controlling them and micromanaging them and you're gonna call
that love and then your children will learn that crippled
twisted form of what you call love from you and
then they will become actors in your little game to
please you for the love that you're trying to give
them and then they're going to learn that twisted form
of love and then they're going to transfer that twisted
form of love onto their children and their children and
their children and their and their children what you need
to see is that when you can't see reality honestly
without bias this corrupts your entire sense making and perception
system which of course affects everything else you do in
life all of your future interactions with your children will
be corrupted by that whether you realize it or not
and not just your children with all humans and with
society at large and with even with your own self
see when you become this judgmental with your children when
you become so biased you're cherry picking everything to optimize
everything that's why you're doing this survival always backfires because
then you're going to look at yourself in the mirror
and you're also going to start to optimize yourself too
you can say i don't like this i don't like
that i don't like this note i don't like the
teeth i don't i don't like how i am and
then you're going to hate yourself and you're going to
be depressed and you're going to wonder why am i
so depressed you're depressed fundamentally because you have a corrupted
way of seeing the world and these corruptions are your
very biases you see the world untruthfully and from that
you are actually disconnected from truth you're disconnected from love
you're disconnected from god and then you suffer and see
when you suffer in this situation you have a bias
against suffering so ultimately what's going to kill you the
ultimate boomerang is your bias against suffering because in the
end of the at the end of the day after
all of your manipulations all of your selfishness all your
biases all of your distortions and self-deceptions at the end
of the day all that's going to lead to suffering
and guess what you're not unbiased when it comes to
suffering see if you were doing what i was telling
you maybe you could have developed the capacity to be
totally unbiased and then if you suffered it wouldn't be
so bad but now you get a double dose of
suffering because now you're suffering and then you're suffering that
you're suffering and you hate the suffering and that just
doubles your suffering and you want to break free of
the suffering but you can't because you can't see the
world clearly and then you're just suffering more and more
and more and you become this toxic victim and you
hate yourself and you hate your life and now you're
depressed and suicidal and all that and you're stuck in
it so deeply because you actually believe that there's something
wrong or bad about your suffering when in fact there's
no reason why suffering is any worse than not suffering
if you look at it objectively look at it from
a sort of scientific point of view where in science
does it say that suffering is bad and pleasure is
good nowhere nowhere in science as it says so does
it say so and that is in fact true can
you see how arbitrary all these biases are from an
existential universal absolute point of view so now we get
to the fundamental intuition behind this episode this is the
fundamental intuition that you're missing if you are trying to
make sense of all of reality the ultimate nature of
reality if you're trying to come up with a grand
unified theory of everything this is what you're missing listen
close here's the fundamental intuition why would ultimate reality have
any biases at all can you intuit that ultimate reality
should be perfectly symmetrical perfectly unbiased think of bias as
an asymmetry within consciousness if consciousness was purely symmetrical the
highest form of consciousness is so purely symmetrical and even-handed
and even-minded that it has no biases or preferences whatsoever
for any part of itself it's a complete unity but
then it develops biases and finite forms in its pure
state in its highest form when consciousness is just a
pure formless singularity completely undifferentiated that's the godhead when that
is the state of consciousness it's complete it's undifferentiated and
there is no difference between one thing another thing it
can't like one part of itself more than any other
part because they're indistinct literally there are no physical objects
yet physical objects didn't come into existence for a physical
object to come into existence within consciousness what has to
happen is that it has to develop a form which
is already a sort of bias at the physical material
level so at the metaphysical level which is the deepest
level consciousness is completely unified this is like what consciousness
was before the big bang we might say or what
the universe was like before the big bang then for
the big bang to happen the big bang event we
might say at the physical level what it is it
is a development of bias it's a bias towards form
away from formlessness so forms get created those forms fractionate
and break apart and subdivide infinitely to create all of
the plethora of forms that you see around you today
star dust and planets and suns and moons and uh
trees and rocks and rivers and asteroids and humans and
everything else and as the forms are are are subdividing
the forms take on biases especially as the forms get
attached to surviving and maintaining their form because initially in
the universe no form cared about maintaining his form and
so all the forms were just flying around then you
had rocks and rivers and stuff and they also didn't
care about maintaining their forms and they didn't survive very
long and then you had living organisms arise and now
you have forms which care about maintaining their forms and
as soon as they had to care about maintaining their
forms that was the bias bam right there you got
bias but also there was bias before that at the
physical level so that's bias at the sort of psychological
level within the animal mind but there's bias first at
the physical level which is literally for formless consciousness to
even to create a single atom or a single particle
that's a bias conscious has to undertake it has to
be biased towards existing as a particle rather than something
else a non-particle as a circle or a sphere rather
than a cube for example as a proton rather than
as an electron as a quark you know up quark
rather than a down quark as a muon rather than
a gluon or whatever or a photon and so it's
creating these biases already at the physical level and then
these biases after billions of years will percolate into the
the animal mind and then they will become psychological biases
too and even a plant already has biases you know
you put your plant near the window where the sun
is shining and you have two windows one where the
sun shines one where it doesn't the plant will actually
turn itself towards the sun how is it doing that
has biases towards light and towards warmth or whatever you
know has biases towards oxygen and other things and biases
away from certain chemicals and certain animals and other stuff
even in a plant that exists already so first i
want you to see that every finite object in the
world is a bias within consciousness even a physical thing
like a chair a chair is a bias within consciousness
if it wasn't biased it couldn't exist as a chair
it would be infinite it wouldn't be finite and then
of course i want you to notice that all human
minds and animal minds are biased whether it's plants or
or ants or your cat or your dog or your
child or you or your spouse and also all institutions
you know we can go and order above that to
a collective level all institutions all groups all political parties
all corporations all clubs guilds military units nations tribes sports
teams they're all biased can you see that every sports
team wants to win the championship for itself not for
somebody else do you think god cares which sports team
wins sometimes it's funny to see sports team players in
the nfl or something you know they do an interview
before the the game or after the game and they're
thanking god for the victory or they're praying to god
for the victory or you know the people and you
know like the terrorists in the middle east are praying
to allah for victory over the infidels and then american
soldiers are praying to god for victory against the terrorists
what do you think god is doing about all this
god is sitting up there and god is hearing all
these prayers what do you think happens oh can you
see how all these prayers cancel each other out into
a perfect cemetery if every sports team prays to god
to help them to win the championship and god helps
everybody equally then it's as though god didn't help anybody
at all so now i want to show i want
you to try to imagine what would a totally unbiased
mind look like see your mind is biased we've established
that i hope i hope you're honest enough to admit
that to yourself but what would try to imagine a
mind that is completely unbiased try to imagine what it
would be like for you to drop all of these
biases we've been talking about for your children and for
the temperature and for your sports team to win and
all this sort of stuff drop all of it for
your favorite food drop all your biases how do you
think you'd feel part of the problem here is that
you're not even conscious of all of your biases yet
so when i tell you to drop them it's hard
for you to even imagine it because you don't even
know what your biases are other than the ones i've
hear made explicit but you have way more than that
i can't tell you all your biases that's some work
you got to do yourself because selfishness is blindness to
one's own biases that's what selfishness is if you were
conscious of all of your biases and the consequences of
them on your life you would drop them the reason
you don't drop them is a you're not conscious of
them at all and you're busy defending and justifying them
so thoroughly that you're completely blind to them and and
two you're not conscious of all the consequences and you're
not you don't have enough consciousness to see how it's
going to boomerang on you if you cleared that up
by raising your conscious you would drop many of your
biases to a point there are limits we'll discuss those
in a minute so the absolute truth is that all
biases are existentially arbitrary and meaningless they don't have any
reality no objective reality to them all biases are subjective
all value and meaning is relative and imaginary and as
a result god does not have any biases so one
definition of what is god people sometimes wonder there are
many ways to define what god is very profound ways
but here's one that we're going to focus on in
this episode i've given you many definitions elsewhere but this
one is specific to this episode um well actually i
have talked about a bit elsewhere too but anyways um
god is a mind that has absolutely no biases that's
profound think about that and try to draw some connections
with you what this means for you what i what
i mean if god is a mind that has no
biases and your mind right now your human mind has
a bunch of biases then the only difference between your
mind and god's mind is literally your biases so if
you drop all of your biases guess what you become
god this is i'm describing uh the gateway to god
to you here but leo where is this magical god
you talk about this is so new-agey and so woo-woo
and all this sort of [ __ ] i i
want to see this god prove to me that this
god is real but if god is nothing other than
a mind which has absolutely no biases and yet your
mind is so full of [ __ ] biases how
can god be proven to you even your demand for
a materialistic proof or a rationalistic proof can you see
how that itself is a bias that's the mind [
__ ] here be intelligent i'm telling you something very
profound you can access the mind of god but only
if you drop all your biases especially all the ones
you don't want to drop especially rationality especially science and
now you say bullio if i drop my science and
my rationality then i don't what's that what's the point
even then there's not even a point to live anymore
then it's just all nonsense and self-deception no it's not
how you imagine it to be that's your mind and
your bias he's fear-mongering to you you see every bias
you have you have has a very good self-justification mechanism
the bias doesn't just live by itself the bias is
almost like an organism that lives inside your mind like
a parasite it feeds off of you and it defends
itself and one of the ways that the parasite of
rationality and science defends themselves is that they say that
if you let go of me then horrible things will
happen to you you will fall into self-deception and delusion
and religious fanaticism and whatever else every bias behaves this
way if it's a nice juicy deep bias because if
it didn't you would have gotten rid of it a
long time ago these biases sap and drain your energy
they'll certainly fear monger you as in this case so
anyways god is a mind that has no biases and
that is just equivalent to saying guess what guess what
i'm going to say god is love that's right god
is love now you can appreciate a little bit what
god is love means god is love is not some
hippie wishful thinking saying god is love means a mind
with no biases guess what love is guess what absolute
love is the realization that there is no difference between
anything that's a technical definition of love love is not
a human emotion or feeling like they taught you at
school or in biology class love is the metaphysical realization
that every difference in reality including all the physical differences
between all physical objects is imaginary so when you realize
when you become conscious enough and your mind becomes pure
enough to realize that the difference between a kangaroo and
a terrorist is imaginary when you realize that's an imaginary
difference then you can love the kangaroo and the terrorist
identically because they are literally physically fused and undifferentiated within
your consciousness at a physical level i'm describing the most
physical level really it's more proper to call it a
metaphysical it's it's such a deep physical level it's it's
metaphysical it transcends or is prior to physics and then
if you can if you can get that at the
physical level then it's even easier to get it at
the psychological level because at a psychological level you have
let's say uh your favorite food maybe sushi and then
your least favorite food maybe a dog turd and when
you realize that the difference between sushi eating sushi and
a dog turd is purely relative and arbitrary it's just
a subjective bias you have then you literally don't care
which one you eat and then you can love them
both equally and as long as you are fooling yourself
to believe that the sushi is better than a dog
turd you will forever love the sushi more than a
dog turd and your love will be less than infinite
less than total do you realize what infinite love requires
infinite love requires that you love everything equally you can't
love one thing more than another because look let's say
let's say the universe here's how i'm gonna explain this
let's say the universe is filled with a million objects
different kinds some of them you love some of them
you hate now the question is what percentage of them
do you love and what percentage of them do you
hate if you're if you're a very picky person let's
say you're the most pickiest person in the world here
you're very difficult to please let's say actually let's simplify
this example let's say we have a hundred different foods
at a buffet this is a better example all right
a hundred different foods at a buffet you have filet
mignon and you have lobster and you have uh you
know soups and salads and uh hors d'oeuvres and olives
and salami and cheeses and all you have all these
different dishes pastas and rices and all this all right
vegas buffet the caesars buffet if you want the best
buffet in vegas go to caesars all right so you'll
get something like that it's really good anyways um how
do we determine how loving you are well how many
of those foods do you love if you're a very
picky eater and you know maybe you are one i
used to be a very picky eater i still am
somewhat picky but not as picky as i used to
be i was sort of raised in a family where
my brother was very picky eater was a very picky
eater and then he sort of influenced me in terms
of that anyways that rubbed off on me from my
older brother but anyways if you're a picky eater then
you go to this buffet and most of stuff you
don't like you hate it you only love one percent
of the stuff so that actually literally is your love
that's that's the level of love you have one percent
so how do you become more loving well you open
yourself up to loving other stuff you become less picky
less biased huh biased less biased if you're too biased
you're only going to love one dish and not the
other ones so your love will be limited literally your
love is crippled because there's all these dishes to explore
house you can kind of think of it like how
sad that a person is so picky and so biased
and so close-minded that he can only love lobster and
nothing else isn't that a limited way to live life
imagine if you only ate lobster for your entire life
and nothing else that would be kind of sad even
though lobster might be great you don't want to eat
it every single [ __ ] day you want to
explore different all the the the the cornucopia the full
cornucopia of taste buds and uh and pleasures that you
can experience right so so you open your mind some
more you drop some of your biases and you learn
to love other dishes and you actually literally can do
this you can you can open your mind in the
world of cuisine to love dishes you didn't previously love
and learn to enjoy them and then when you do
your experience blossoms and becomes richer for doing that huh
maybe you've experienced that hopefully you have so um and
if you haven't you actually you can actually practice this
go to a sushi buffet restaurant or something and start
to order sushi you've never had before and actually try
it and then learn to appreciate it or whatever restaurant
doesn't have to be sushi um sushi's just convenient because
it's little bite-sized pieces you can order you know a
la cart rather than order entire dishes that fill you
up so maybe you've tried that go to a sushi
by the way in vegas we have some great sushi
buffets check them out if you're in town so um
but now imagine what would be the maximum love in
this example maximum love would be to surrender all of
your biases and to open yourself up to every single
experience at this buffet all 100 dishes if you could
do that you would be at a hundred percent love
that's maximum love we would call that infinite love in
this example of course it's still finite in this example
but you know analogously we'll extend this to become infinite
love in a minute so there you go that's infinite
love now um what is stopping you from accessing infinite
love your biases and what is stopping you from surrendering
your biases your closed-mindedness and your fear and your unwillingness
to experience certain experiences maybe you're biased against sushi because
you think it's all you it's raw fish see your
mind is closed have you even ever tried raw fish
it's like well no because it's disgusting it's raw fish
i don't want to eat anything raw but you eat
raw tomatoes and you eat raw lettuce and you eat
other things raw so why not raw fish it says
my culture tells me it's wrong or something see that's
a bias that's a that's a closed mindedness that one
has if you let that go then you're more open
to trying the raw fish but still you try it
and it kind of tastes kind of weird to you
it's it's unfamiliar to you you don't like the experience
of it you haven't yet learned to adjust your palate
and your sense of taste it's too unsophisticated you haven't
learned to enjoy it yet so you might try a
piece and you might not like it so actually you
have to train yourself to like it you do that
enough times then you actually start to love it and
then you say oh my god i was so stupid
and close-minded for not liking the sushi i spent my
whole life dismissing sushi and now i love sushi it's
my favorite food okay great so you've got sushi down
what about pig intestines are you open to pig intestines
like oh no that's gross i hate pig intestines that's
some nasty stuff i'd rather eat filet mignon but have
you tried the pig intestine no it's just yeah i
don't like it but try it maybe you'll like it
now this is i'm mixing metaphors now this is reminding
me of the dr seuss green eggs and ham but
that's exactly how it is green eggs and ham here
so see you're resisting the whole process you're resisting the
process of love and a lot of times you resist
it out of fear it's like you fear eating the
green eggs and ham you fear eating the pig intestines
do you want to try to try some some [Music]
some some crickets maybe you'll enjoy those you want to
try some eyeballs maybe you'll enjoy enjoy those it's like
no oh that's gross and you fear what that cricket
is going to taste like in your mouth where those
eyeballs can be all squishy and nasty in your mouth
and it looks gross but what if it tastes good
how do you know you haven't tried it see you're
you're stubborn you're closed minded you have your biases you
have your prejudices and this prevents you from exploring the
entire buffet and and and so there's a lot notice
that there's fear there there's fear that well but if
i eat this i'm gonna i'm gonna throw up or
if i eat this i'm gonna hate it i'm gonna
spit it out or if i eat this then uh
maybe i'll like it and then that means i was
wrong in the past and i don't want that you
see you have so many excuses and so um but
if you're if you intuit that you should push yourself
through this process you push yourself you expand yourself you
love more and more and more you surrender all your
biases and eventually you reach maximum love you love the
entire buffet you have no more biases and now you
look at and you say my god what an ordeal
all this resistance and finally i've reached heaven i've reached
paradise now i can eat anything and i love it
all now i don't have to worry when i go
to a buffet i don't have to worry that oh
they're not going to have my my one only favorite
dish it doesn't [ __ ] matter i love them
all can you see how powerful that is contemplated god
is not biased towards any experience or part of itself
because it is an infinite mind as an infinite mind
it must embrace and accept all of the things it
can imagine since it is itself god can have no
biases and the reason that is is because literally the
physical differences or distinctions that separate all objects are imagined
by god therefore they have no real existence or objective
reality that means that literally in the mind of god
the difference between a kangaroo and a sushi and a
piece of turd doesn't matter it doesn't exist these differences
only appear to exist within the human mind therefore god
can embrace all of its forms all forms are embraced
within the mind of god and arise from the one
mind of god after all why would god have any
biases if everything is one if all difference is imaginary
how can any one part of reality be better or
more important than any other part here's an analogy to
help you to understand this because see there's a there's
a isomorphism between god's infinite mind and your mind because
actually they're they're literally identical but anyways you think they're
different so we're taking it from your point of view
from your point of view still there's there's isomorphism a
similarity an analogy we're going to draw here right so
your mind can think thoughts and it can think any
kind of thoughts think some thoughts right now notice that
your mind is seeing thoughts whatever they are you can
think of a of a cow of a kangaroo of
a sushi of a turd of an apple of a
tree of a house it doesn't matter these are all
thoughts now notice when your mind is thinking thoughts the
actual mind space within which thoughts arise your mind space
we might call this pure mind free of any thoughts
or forms that empty mind space does it care which
thought you think like you can think of a kangaroo
right now close your eyes think of a kangaroo notice
that it freely enters into your mind into the mind
space now now clear that image and now think of
a of a dog turd that in image that form
has entered into your mind space and notice that it
entered as freely as the kangaroo now maybe you have
a little bit of squeamishness you don't like thinking of
a dog turd you might even have a little bit
of revulsion towards it well that's some resistance notice that
that's some bias you might have but if you're truly
open-minded then literally your mind can think any kind of
thoughts like your mind doesn't care whether you're thinking the
number one two three four five it doesn't care all
of these thoughts are are equivalent within from the perspective
of sort of the empty mind space and so now
you can just extrapolate and notice that since no thought
is better than any other thought literally within your own
mind all of these mental forms or images are arising
they're arising from an emptiness and as they arise they
separate themselves from each other that's what it means to
arise from emptiness like literally from emptiness uh a kangaroo
the form of a kangaroo is is differentiating itself and
holding itself as a mental image and then dog turd
and then a piece of sushi or an apple or
whatever that's what's happening when you're thinking thoughts if you
introspect that's what you'll discover and if you're truly open-minded
you can love all those thoughts equally there's no reason
that one thought is better than another thought now you
could say well but leo some thoughts are kind of
gross and i don't like them like i don't like
the thought of uh having sex with my mother whereas
i love the thought of having sex with some person
that i find attractive again those are your biases if
you remove those biases and you're just very neutral about
it stop playing games stop being emotional and just be
neutral and you'll notice that you can think any kind
of thought without getting attached to it or without any
you know prejudice for or against it and you can
enjoy that you can you can literally enjoy sitting there
thinking different kinds of thoughts it's just interesting like i
can think of a kangaroo right now that's kind of
cool i can think of a of a dog turd
and i can even appreciate you know the thought of
a dog turd uh i mean it doesn't it's not
like i like it or anything but it's like i
don't have to hate it either it's just kind of
interesting that i can do that you know it might
be useful to be able to think of a dog
turned once in a while you know if i gotta
clean up some [ __ ] it's useful to remember
that so you know i'm not talking about the utility
of these thoughts some thoughts have more utility to you
than others but again notice that that's only because you
have certain biases which determine what the utility of a
thing is but if if you have no utility for
anything and after all does god have a utility for
things does god need a [ __ ] hammer to
hammer in a nail you see in the mind of
god anything that arises in the mind of god has
no utility in the same way that thoughts in your
mind they really have no utility you could use them
but um you don't have to and so anyways the
analogy we're drawing here is that just like your mind
is free to have all these different thoughts likewise god's
mind is free to imagine literally any physical form that
it wants and it doesn't love one form like god
doesn't love a kangaroo more than it loves a dog
turd lying on the street so in a sense we're
we're realizing what mind is mind is an infinite field
that's completely open and unbiased which is open to creative
imagination that's what mind is it's open to any figment
of itself any part of itself and since it's infinite
it has all the possible parts in other words what
mind is is mind is self love you get it
love is not an emotion love is the actual substance
of your mind before it has been corrupted with attachments
and biases now notice as soon as your mind wants
some imaginary thing to persist it has to acquire a
bias for example if you want your dog to live
a long life you got to be attached to that
dog and have a bias towards feeding your dog saving
your dog from a fire and other things like that
if you want your child to live same situation if
you want your body to be healthy and to survive
and to persist you also have to develop biases for
your body you gotta feed the right things avoid eating
the wrong things and so on avoid jumping into a
fire avoid jumping into a pit of lava if you
want your pleasure to persist let's say you're having an
orgasm or whatever and you want that to just continue
over and over and over again you have to be
biased towards doing the activities that will produce that pleasure
again and again and again and in this way you
become biased you become biased towards pleasure and biased away
from from pain and from suffering so now you can
see the connection between bias and attachment anything you become
attached to as a form will then create a bias
in you and then even if you get detached from
that form that bias can still remain for example you
could get attached to your dog that develops a bias
for caring for your dog then your dog will die
in 10 years you'll be sad but you'll get over
it you'll lose your attachment for that dog you'll let
go of the dog but you will still maintain your
bias for taking care of dogs instinctively and then even
your neighbor's dog you will take care of it and
then if you get a new dog or if your
kids get a dog you'll take care of that the
bias can remain now you've heard it say i'm sure
you have that spirituality is about letting go of attachments
but do you understand why that is most people don't
understand but now that you've heard what i've been talking
about now you're in a position to understand see because
every attachment you have is a bias and bias prevents
you from realizing the truth that everything is equally good
literally the more attachments you have the more limited your
perception of reality is the more biases you have the
more uh the more limited your capacity for love is
and the more you suffer as a result because you
are separated from your highest potential see your mind's highest
potential is not just to love a few dishes at
the buffet your mind's highest potential is to love all
the dishes at the buffet likewise your mind's highest potential
your we might say your soul's or your spirit's highest
potential is to love everything in the [ __ ]
universe not just the few things that you've selected up
to this point and so the more attachments you have
when you're attached to your house to your car to
your children to your dog to getting sex to avoiding
pain to this to that to money to blah blah
blah you are investing your love into those things in
a limited capacity which is preventing you from expanding your
love into the full infinite capacity because to have infinite
love the love needs to be completely equal and unbiased
do you see why that is you can't love one
thing more than another thing otherwise your love is not
going to be infinite infinity has to be perfectly symmetrical
that's the key intuition here symmetry i'm talking about a
sort of a absolute symmetry to the actual metaphysics of
reality and consciousness why is deeper love linked with a
lack of bias because how can you love a thing
if it threatens one of your attachments you see if
i invest my love into my child or my dog
that becomes my attachment you might wonder well leo why
can't i just love my child and my dog and
still have infinite love well because if you're attached to
your dog and your child surviving as a finite form
what happens if your child or dog gets run over
by a car can you love the driver of that
car no because they killed your child or your dog
so anything that threatens your attachment you're gonna hate do
you see that do you see the problem with asymmetry
in one's love when your love becomes asymmetrical all of
a sudden you're playing the sort of pick and choose
game now you're forced to cherry pick and you're forced
to get defensive about the stuff that you love you're
forced to freeze reality into a certain state like when
you love something you want to freeze that thing and
maintain it like if you love your child you want
your child to live forever you don't want to die
if you love your dog you want to live forever
if you love your business you want to live forever
if you love an orgasm you want to last as
long as possible and as soon as something interferes with
your orgasm lasting as long as possible you get frustrated
and angry your child might catch a disease and then
you get angry at the disease and you start to
believe [ __ ] that disease i hate that disease
why does that disease exist it shouldn't exist there's something
wrong in the world for that disease existing why did
god create that disease that's how you think this twists
your perspective you see whereas if you didn't get attached
to that child you could look at the situation you
could say the child is beautiful the disease is also
beautiful the disease has as much right to exist as
the child maybe the child will conquer the disease maybe
the disease will conquer a child either way it's okay
it's all part of the majesty and beauty of the
entire universe of what the mind is and i surrender
to whatever's going to happen but when you get attached
to something you're not surrendered to how it's gonna you're
not open you're not open enough to let reality do
what it needs to do you literally are trying to
contravene god's will by imposing your egoic will your finite
will on the will of god you think you know
what's best for the universe you think that the universe
would be better if your child didn't die from this
disease that's the delusion you only think that because you're
attached you're not looking at the situation objectively you've actually
convinced yourself that there's something wrong with this disease and
that your child should be getting special treatment that's your
selfishness that's ego that's attachment and when you do that
you diminish your capacity to love and what's so tricky
about it is that while you're doing that in the
midst of doing that because you're just the perception is
distorted and your consciousness is not infinite you manage to
convince yourself that actually you're doing it out of love
so when you are bad-mouthing that disease and demonizing it
and when you are being selfish and unequal in favor
of your child you've actually convinced yourself that this is
love well it is love but it's a finite limited
selfish form of love it's not infinite love and so
in this way you have literally severed your connection to
infinite love and you don't even know it exists because
you've got blinders on you've got filters on that are
filtering out infinite love to get you your twisted form
of partial love you've traded infinity for finite love can't
you see that the highest power in the universe is
to love everything equally if you love everything equally nothing
can be hated and nothing can be bad if you
love everything equally then literally everything is perfect absolutely perfect
if you love the disease as much as the child
if the disease conquers the child you will still be
fine you'll be happy you'll still be in love and
notice this dilemma exists this existential little a corner that
you've painted yourself in as long as you're biased and
attached reality will always be less than perfect for you
can you notice that always so that's the mind [
__ ] people think that all reality is just this
this horrible world is so imperfect why couldn't it be
if god is real why didn't he design it perfectly
when actually god did design it perfectly but you're so
biased that you literally filter out the perfection because your
definition of perfection is a finite selfish form of perfection
your definition of perfection is having lobster every single day
for the rest of your life but that's not true
perfection that's your bias true perfection is having all the
food that could ever be invented all the time that's
true perfection loving it all equally that's true perfection but
you're too squeamish for that there are certain experiences that
you don't want to experience for example from god's point
of view torture is a part of perfection from your
point of view you hate torture you're biased against torture
and so therefore you consider as evidence of imperfection if
torture occurs that's because you don't want to experience torture
you're afraid of it you don't like it now what
i'm saying here is extremely radical i'm talking about opening
your consciousness up to literally every single possible experience that
could occur including all the most horrific ones you could
imagine all the worst stuff in your worst nightmares i'm
saying that god is open to that the question is
are you open to that the extent to which you're
not open to that is the extent to which you
are not god so some people say oh leo but
you know we humans we're not god we're just a
part of god yeah you're just a part of god
as long as you're maintaining those fears and attachments and
biases that's correct if you want to literally become god
you have to surrender all of your selfishness because god
is perfectly selfless so that is the trade-off now we
got to tie this in this attachment story tie it
in with impermanence the concept of impermanence from buddhism this
is a pillar of buddhism is the recognition of impermanence
i have an episode about that called what is it
called understanding impermanence i believe it's called go check that
out tie that in now with what we're talking about
here so see one of the features of reality as
the buddhists like to teach is impermanence that means reality
is fluid and it's nothing is permanent it's always changing
in fact the only permanent thing is impermanence itself we
might say a bit of a paradox there but anyways
so forms is like you're in the middle of a
sea of shifting forms all the time so you see
the problem is that if you get attached to something
if you develop a bias for one thing you're effectively
like i said before you're trying to freeze reality which
means you're trying to go against impermanence but since everything
is impermanent that's a recipe for hell because your happiness
is contingent on permanence and nothing in reality is permanent
your children's not permanent your dog is not permanent your
orgasm is not permanent your life is not permanent your
youthful appearance is not permanent you're not going to be
pretty forever so a lot of suffering comes from that
because you've set yourself in opposition to reality you've set
yourself up in an adversarial relationship with the highest truth
which is one of which one of the fastest of
which is impermanence all form is impermanent so that's why
this is so important in buddhism [Music] this is why
spiritual teachers and and ascetics have talked about surrendering attachments
to the material world and not chasing pleasure or not
getting too tied down with your relationships and your family
and all this sort of stuff it's called they're called
renunciants renunciation you renounce the world what are you renouncing
you're renouncing attachment and why are you renouncing attachment for
infinite love materialists think that all those aesthetics and renounciants
and monks uh they're so stupid you know renouncing all
the material pleasures in life like what why are they
doing all that they're doing it for some sort of
stupid moralistic puritanical reason ideological reason no i mean some
who are brainwashed are doing that who are fundamentalists yeah
fundamentalist religious people do it for stupid reasons but the
true monk the true yogi the true renunciant the true
ascetic he is renouncing all of that because he's so
intelligent and wise that he sees in renouncing that he's
actually making the most counterintuitive and intelligent move to access
infinite love so the joke is on you the materialist
who's clinging to all these things so you think you're
clinging or chasing after orgasms you think that having a
hundred orgasms is ever gonna amount to something great but
it's not because nothing is gonna match infinite love the
bliss you experience the ecstasy you experience when you access
infinite love free of all biases and attachments is literally
infinite it it it makes the pleasure of an orgasm
seem like a like a candle flame next to the
radiant sun an orgasm gives you the amount of light
generated by a candle flame infinite love that i'm talking
about here free of all bias is like launching yourself
into the middle of the sun that's how much the
pleasure differential is but you're too scared to experience that
much pleasure it's literally so much pleasure it'll kill you
and you're too attached to the candle flame see you're
so you're so empty you're so spiritually bankrupt it's so
it's like you're so blind that even to to get
a glimpse of a candle flame to you is so
amazing that's what you're that's what your orgasm is and
you and you you cling to that little candle flame
and it's like it's like the one thing that keeps
you going it's a little bit of candle flame because
that's all the light you know how to get whereas
the mystic and the ascetic and the monk and the
renunciate in the yogi they go straight for the sun
and you don't have the courage to do that so
you remain stuck with your candle flame at least for
this life here's another explanation of why the impermanence is
operative here is that the infinite mind needs to be
able to dream without getting attached to its dreams otherwise
it can't dream forever and what infinite mind is what
god is here's a definition of god is that it's
an infinite dreamer an infinite dream how can you have
an infinite dream if it's frozen it has to be
fluid to dream every possible dream you need to keep
dreaming more and more and more forever with no end
that means you can't get stuck on any one dream
it's sort of like if you have one movie one
favorite movie you can keep looping that movie over and
over and over and over again forever this would be
a very shallow experience of what film is if you
want to explore the entire domain of film what you
have to do is you have to keep playing new
movies every single time don't watch any movie twice in
fact this is a rule i've adopted in my life
is that i don't watch any movie twice anymore i
used to in the past i don't now if i
watch a movie it's only a new movie i refuse
to watch any movie i already watched why is that
for this reason because i want to maximize the diversity
of of movies that i watch replace movies with dreams
and you got now you understand how god works all
attachments are finite and ultimately false because the highest truth
is oneness and lack of difference so again i want
to underscore here's a technical definition of love love is
the realization that all difference is imaginary write this down
tattoo it on your forehead probably don't take that last
recommendation too seriously but it's that important the realization that
all difference is imaginary that is the definition of love
now you might say but leo if i had no
biases then wouldn't everything be neutral no everything would be
love i can't really explain this to you in any
logical way um [Music] but it wouldn't be neutral it
would be love love is not neutral love is an
embrace of everything it's a metaphysical self-embrace now also don't
make the mistake of thinking that love necessarily means you're
going to be feeling blissful all the time right so
love metaphysical love that i'm talking about transcends positive feelings
and emotions it can even include negative feelings and emotions
too it's an absolute it transcends everything it transcends and
includes and incorporates and embraces everything that's what true love
is so if your notion of absolute love doesn't include
the pain of the the feeling of torture then it's
not true love so make sure that you don't just
buy this sort of new age hippie version of love
which is all positive rainbows and butterflies that's not what
i'm explaining to here so i want you to matt
to become a master at noticing bias with the hope
that you're going to clear up your perception over time
and let go and surrender various kinds of biases which
will inch you closer to love but you have to
be careful not to weaponize this ability because what's going
to happen here is that for many of you you're
gonna say aha yeah leo told me to to be
a keen observer and a master of bias so what
i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go walk around and
criticize everybody else's biases and not observe my own no
first and foremost start by observing your own biases and
then also notice the biases of everybody else too uh
you're going to be doing both these in tandem and
start noticing existential biases within various kinds of thought systems
and worldviews and ideologies such as christianity islam science atheism
rationalism libertarianism progressivism conservativism capitalism socialism and so forth in
fact now let me help you more practically to do
that we've we've gone through the heavy metaphysical theory here
now let's get into some applications so this one's going
to be focused on science let's focus on the domain
of science what i'd like to do is i'd like
to articulate every most important bias that science has to
illustrate what i'm talking about so i want you to
become so good at spotting bias that you can look
at a system like science for example and identify all
of its biases so what are the biases of science
there's quite a few and i could talk about this
for an entire episode all on its own there's so
much to say here but let's go through it quickly
so one of the biases that science has is being
rigorous and factual believe it or not that's a that's
a bias you might say oh but leo you know
being rigorous and factual that's good we want that we
want that we don't want to be all fantastical and
then loosey-goosey that would be bad that's a bias notice
that i'm not interested in your rationalizations for your biases
i'm also not interested in your fear-mongering about what'll happen
if you surrender a bias i don't care part of
this work is facing your fears be courageous here and
be very honest and neutral so you might you know
people don't question this but like a lot of scientifically-minded
people they just think that like you know living life
in a factual rigorous way is the best way to
live life or how life should be lived but that's
not true at all what's to say that you can't
live life in a totally imaginative fantastical way where you
are not a factual person if you think about it
for a moment like really open your mind try to
imagine what it would be like to live life in
a non-scientific manner in a non-factual manner where you didn't
care about the facts you didn't care about being rigorous
in fact you you lived your life in such a
way where you leaned into and you embraced the fantasy
the illusions the hallucinations the uh wishful thinking the woo-woo
stuff the the um the magical thinking you actually enjoyed
this stuff and you you knew it was magical but
you played into it anyways almost like like you're an
actor on stage in a shakespearean play you know it's
not you're not really hamlet you're just playing hamlet for
a little while here while you're alive and so you're
going to be playing up you're going to be fantastical
and you're going to be buying into all this new
agey stuff and it's okay that's not scientific or that
it's even real or factual it doesn't matter you just
enjoy it and that's how you want to live your
life see if you tell this to most sam harris
types they are going to uh [ __ ] their
pants in horror to them this is their worst nightmare
but actually it's just a different mode of living there
is no one to say that this mode that i
described is any worse than the scientific mode now see
a sam harris type here would come in and say
oh leo but but but but you know um there
is an important difference because you know the factual people
we make all the technology and we let them in
on the moon whereas the hippie uh magical thinking people
the deepak chopra people all they do is just talk
about stuff and they don't do anything and and uh
and whatever and they they have sex and they smoke
weed and they get into into cults and they brainwash
each other so so what that's your bias landing a
man on the moon having technology that's your nerd [
__ ] bias recognize your [ __ ] nerd you're
addicted to it and that you're stuck on that frame
of living that is not necessarily the best way to
live but here's the real kicker and this is what's
really going to sting uh someone like a sam harris
type is that the sam harris type is going to
run a retreat here he's going to want to do
sort of a a very sneaky maneuver he's going to
want to try to retreat into truthfulness and say ah
leo yeah okay fine maybe you're right you know people
can live however they want but in the end you
know we value truth and science is just more truthful
and this nerd way of living is just a more
truthful it's a yeah i have a left brain way
of living but that's more truthful than the the more
artistic romantic way of living and in fact all that
romantic stuff that's all [ __ ] that's falsehood and
that this here this science and rationality this is the
actual truth this is the objective truth but that's a
lie that is not objective truth because by definition consciousness
is infinite therefore consciousness includes within itself both the rational
and the irrational both the uh left brain nerdy and
the right brain artistic and creative and the mystical and
the mystical and the new agey and the and the
and even the fantastical even even lies and stories even
pure fantasies of imagination flights of fancy poetry all of
this sort of it's as real it's as much a
part of consciousness as is the logical factual stuff and
this is what the scientific mind cannot fathom fundamentally they're
in denial about this so i'm not saying that santa
claus is real in the sense that you can go
to the north pole and knock on his door and
talk to santa claus what i'm saying that santa claus
is a feature of infinite consciousness not as a guy
in the north pole as a physical guy santa claus
exists as an idea as a as a fantastical archetype
as an abstraction as a fantasy as an illusion not
in the physical realm and who is to say that
the abstract realm is any lower than or less important
than or inferior to the physical material realm see that
is a bias within the scientific mind but it gets
worse than that because you as a scientist might say
well who cares fine leo who cares about that i'm
just going to do my science and be very factual
and i'm going to develop my theory of everything and
i'm going to understand all of reality while you guys
you know stay there and play around with your elves
and [ __ ] the santa claus and all this
sort of [ __ ] the flying spaghetti monster i'm
gonna while you're doing that i'm gonna do some sort
of newton [ __ ] here and figure out everything
figure out the truth but here's where it's really gonna
sting is that you will never figure out the truth
because the truth includes everything and you by definition have
cut yourself off from half of reality by your method
you have a methodological bias and you're not aware of
this bias and you're not aware of how deep this
runs and how it disconnects you from reality and furthermore
it disconnects you from love see you're not able to
love half the world or even more because more than
half the world are not nerds like you they're not
factual they're not objective people they're not rigorous people they
are fantastical people they are artistic people they are sloppy
thinking type of people they are religious fundamentalists they are
new agers they are types there are mystics and so
forth and you can't love those people in the same
way that you know like for example richard dawkins cannot
love that he cannot love that aspect of infinite mind
because he's in opposition to it fighting it because that's
his shadow he's demonized it and because of this richard
dawkins i'm not just saying that he's going to have
a bad life i'm not just going to say he's
going to be miserable i'm not just saying that he's
going to be depressed i'm not just saying that um
what i'm saying is is that he will not understand
what reality is he will not understand what consciousness is
and he will not access the highest ultimate truth and
he will actually corrupt and distort science itself so it
ends up boomeranging like i said every bias boomerangs and
here's the boomerang now it hits in the back of
the head so what happens is that actually science itself
is now corrupt because material of science is literally unable
to make sense of what consciousness is as a result
of this sort of methodological bias it's unable to make
sense of ufos unable to make sense of paranormal phenomena
unable to make sense of telepathy of mystical experiences healing
enlightenment awakening um psychedelics and many many many other things
in fact the majority of the universe is not able
to make sense of so ironically the the the bias
the rationalist scientific skeptical bias that a scientific mind has
it has that bias and justifies that bias out of
a just with with the justification that it's a love
of truth and a love of science and it's a
you're protecting science as you would protect your little child
in a selfish fear-based attached way that mind is attached
to the biases of science the methodological biases of science
and therefore it's unable to let that science grow and
flower into incorporating more of consciousness and just like with
your little child in the previous examples this bias ends
up backfiring and undermining the very spirit of science the
spirit of science is to understand everything but you can't
understand everything when your method is so biased that it
excludes the majority of reality from its investigations do you
understand how [ __ ] profound what i just said
is your jaw should be on the floor when you
realize what i just said and i've only touched upon
one bias within science another bias within science is a
sort of conservativism scientists tend to be very conservative about
their predictions about their theories they want to over qualify
everything they don't want to speculate they don't like to
speculate they don't like to theorize they want to have
rigorous proofs for they want to overprove they want to
have it over abundance of evidence so that something is
so overproven that it's just beyond any kind of possible
denial but this creates a methodological bias also because when
you're when your filter is set so strict it's almost
like setting an email filter in your email you know
a spam filter in your email software if if you're
if you have no filter at all and it's too
loose then you get a bunch of spam and it's
a problem so what the scientist does is the scientist
is almost someone like who's so paranoid who got so
much spam he sets all of these filters and he
sets filters even for like you know normally you set
a filter for a word like porn or [ __
] or dick or something like that you set these
filters and those emails go straight to your junk box
but this scientist has become so paranoid he's so sensitive
that now he sets filters for words like experience and
sensation and emotion and feelings and uh consciousness and so
anytime one of those words appears in an email which
very common many good emails contain those words all those
go straight to the junk box so the scientist has
overcorrected and as a result his method is actually missing
a lot of things that are valid and true that
should belong within science but that he has just uh
thrown into the trash uh other methods i i mean
there's so much to say here um i mean sort
of sorry other mythological biases there's so much to say
here we're not gonna have enough time to cover them
all so i have to go through them quickly is
the avoidance of marketing poetic language and hype now again
what's tricky about these biases is that most scientists actually
say to themselves rationalize to themselves why these biases are
good therefore they're not even biases but they are biases
most scientists do not care about marketing this presents a
problem scientists say that well that's good i don't want
to care about marketing i don't want to care about
poetic language and hype but when you don't care about
those things that means that your scientific discoveries do not
properly translate into the community at large who are not
nerds like you are not going to read your research
papers they need marketing the discovery of new scientific truths
needs to be marketed it needs to be written in
poetic language it needs to be hyped up certain truths
for example the majority of mankind even though this has
been well known for 100 years since albert einstein discovered
it uh still don't fathom the significance of general relativity
einstein's general relativity says that literally time and space and
distance that these are relative things they don't exist as
absolutes they're not objective in the way that humans ordinarily
conceive and this has been so poorly marketed and so
poorly explained and hyped up the significance of this has
been so poorly taught to people that the majority of
people on the planet don't understand that our reality actually
doesn't have objective distances most people in the world think
that you know if someone is six foot tall they
think well they're just a six foot tall object no
that's not true that's not true even according to science
to modern material and science it's not true it's just
been very poorly marketed and that's what happens when you
have a method that is limited by a bias another
bias within science is proving things trying to make things
objective or rational i can see the good intentions behind
behind trying to prove everything but the problem is is
that as i've talked about in my metaphysical and complete
metaphysical implications of google's completeness theorem is that truth is
a larger concept than proof and that as kurt goodall
proved in his incompleteness theorems and then alfred tarski later
expanded is that you cannot prove everything that is true
so if your method only relies upon proof by definition
you will never have all the truth so by definition
science cannot be truthful because uh by its methods it
only relies upon proof and proof is a second order
a smaller subset of the first order phenomena of truth
if you want a more detailed explanation of all that
go check out that episode about google's incompleteness theorem spelled
g-o-d-e-l google another uh bias of science is it's very
left brain is very analytical reductionistic and it expects explication
i've talked about this in my episode called uh um
implicit versus explicit a very powerful episode go check that
out very foundational basically what i tell you there is
that infinity cannot be explicated because infinity is that which
is infinitely implicit it is endlessly explicatable but the scientific
mind tries to explicate everything it thinks it can explicate
reality completely it thinks it can just write reality down
as a formula or as a set of formulas or
as a set of propositions and you can't do that
because reality is infinite other of these biases are like
the analytical function of the scientific approach and the reduction
the reductionistic tendency and attitude scientists tend to believe they
can reduce everything down to subatomic particles and things like
that or to mathematical equations this turns out to be
false as i've talked about in my holism episodes go
check out the holism stuff see we're really interconnecting everything
here the analytical left-brained approach to studying reality is just
one way of looking at reality there's also the right-brained
approach which is actually more holistic and can actually get
you better results in mary in many ways so in
many ways modern science is suffering from too much analysis
and not enough synthesis because it's biased towards analysis rather
than synthesis and when you do that you get a
distorted picture of what reality is so all of these
biases that i'm pointing out here notice these biases are
actually preventing science from having an accurate picture of reality
another bias of science is the use of language models
and quantification there is the assumption that all of reality
can be quantified and if something can't be quantified it
isn't even real this is baloney it's laughable also all
science is done within language and language itself presents a
set of limits upon ways of accessing interfacing with consciousness
and with reality so there's language if if languages is
a circle like this then all of reality and truth
is like outside the scope of the of the camera
frame in fact it's infinite so language is just a
tiny piece of an infinite larger pie and so you
can't actually use language to understand the entire situation uh
uh other biases within science are a bias against contradiction
paradox and confusion this is actually a point i'm going
to go into deeper soon uh i have to publish
my second part to the goodle's incompleteness theorem episode which
is actually going to be called what is paradox i'm
almost done outlining that one so that that's coming um
in the weeks and months to come look out for
that where i will explain the biases science has up
on contradiction paradox and confusion that's going to be important
but this this creates problems in short the problem here
is that basically science assumes that reality is non-contradictory and
that it's not paradoxical it assumes that every paradox is
a mistake whereas actually in truth infinity must be paradoxical
and must be self-contradictory when it is put into dualistic
language or thought or as a model or when it
is formalized in any way or explicated and so therefore
paradox is actually a feature and not a bug the
way that science assumes other biases of scientific method include
the avoidance of first-person experience in psychedelics the avoidance of
consciousness and intuition the avoidance of mystical methods and the
whole idea of demystification so basically scientific method tries to
demystify reality because it assumes that reality is non-mystical that
turns out to be a false assumption and this leads
to corruptions of science and a misunderstanding of reality um
other biases include avoiding emotions psychology and philosophy there's a
huge aversion to epistemology and metaphysics and philosophy within hardcore
sciences and this is much to the detriment of those
sciences there's an avoidance of religion god and wisdom within
modern science this is also to a huge detriment for
those who are trying to for example develop a theory
of everything there is bias in terms of the bureaucratic
and social and collective nature of scientific work scientific work
is institutionalized it's academic it's collective it develops a collective
ego it has aspects of social matrix within it go
check out my episode called the social matrix which explains
some of that so this creates biases the fact that
science has to be done as a bureaucratic process with
a group of people with whom you're collaborating and building
consensus this already is a bias in the method which
science is not conscious of other biases include pragmatism utilitarianism
and the survival oriented nature of science so science is
very much focused on the pragmatic aspects of figuring out
how to manipulate reality how to measure reality rather than
actually understanding what it is or caring about truth or
caring about consciousness or caring about love and this is
a misplaced [Music] priority i discussed this in my series
called deconstructing the myth of science part one two three
i think in part two or three i talk about
very much about the problems with pragmatism and the limitations
that come with that it it creates a divergence from
truth um because truth is not just that which is
pragmatic or helps one's survival or utilitarian in general one
of the hugest biases of science is that it's what
i would call constructivist what i mean by that is
that science is trying to construct something is trying to
construct a model a theory a system a technology a
way of manipulating reality it's trying to construct a a
body of knowledge and what has always shocked me since
i was maybe 16 years old i started questioning this
aspect of science this is what really led me to
ultimately deconstructing all of science is that i saw that
science was constructivist and i intuited that that's a bias
and i saw sort of the opposite of it which
was deconstruction and i was a skeptic back then and
i was into deconstructing everything being skeptical about everything and
so i started to become skeptical about the activity of
being constructive and i noticed that you know the books
that were being published the uh the research studies that
were being published the stuff that was being done in
university in academia it was all constructivist in the sense
that to get a good grade to um to get
your research paper done to get funding for some research
project it has to be a constructive project but it
never occurred to anybody how about could that be a
bias though what if truth doesn't lie in the direction
of construction but lies in the direction of deconstruction and
most hard scientists don't care about deconstruction they're biased towards
construction and in this way they cut themselves off from
truth they cut themselves off from deconstructing science because science
itself is a giant construction it's a meta construction it's
a world view it's an epistemology it's an epistemology that's
been constructed over the last five hundred years and really
more like two thousand years another bias that science is
technology focused it's way overly nerdy and geeky and it's
a lot of sciences is about doing research that will
help to build better technologies now that's great in a
certain practical sense but again just because you can build
technology with some sort of research or understanding does not
make it true and also does not make it the
thing that we should be pouring billions of dollars into
nobody pours billions of dollars into paranormal phenomena research normal
nobody pours billions of dollars into awakening or psychedelic research
yet they pour hundreds of billions into battery technologies and
all sorts of other technologies which are more practical which
can be monetized and this creates a corruption within science
i've also discussed this in in i believe part two
of my series deconstructing the myth of science of course
the elephant in the room with science as a bias
is materialism and realism both of these aspects of science
are deeply problematic and i've discussed them elsewhere so i
won't go into here here too much here and then
the final bias of science um is it's simply too
serious most scientists are way too serious you might say
well how is that a bias but it is it
actually is a bias when you're more playful when you're
willing to play with words with concepts um that's a
different epistemic attitude it's a different way of understanding reality
in a way different way of relating to your own
ideas about the world than it is being dead serious
and clinical like a [Music] like a lab technician the
lab technician to epistemology is only one finite very biased
way of interfacing with reality so there you go i
mean i could talk about that stuff for hours there's
so much there if you're a scientist what i just
said to you is gold you will not hear this
anywhere in university you'll not hear this from any scientist
i'm just i've literally just deconstructed all of science for
you your jaw should be on the floor right now
if you can intuit the significance of what i just
said i breeze through it as though it's nothing i
breeze through it like it's just like a laundry list
of [ __ ] this what i just told you
here you could study this for 10 years when i
just told you this list and still get more juice
out of it and use it to revolutionize all of
your scientific work you could revolutionize all of mankind's science
from this simple list if you wanted to but most
people they just skip over it see part of the
problem here is that i'm presenting you with such gems
and diamonds that um a seer and i'm kind of
non-serious about it i'm kind of playful with it that
most serious people like a serious academic watching this or
listening to this will not even take what i just
said seriously because they'll just say like well but surely
somebody like leo can't possibly know these things surely this
can't be real surely this can't be like like this
can't really deconstruct all of science could it surely some
guy on youtube couldn't just do this willy-nilly like off
the cuff while he's also talking about 50 other things
surely that can't be real anyways we're moving on we
got bigger fish to fry than your stupid scientific dogmas
see people will say here oh but leo science is
objective and unbiased what are you talking about said who
a scientist look at what you're doing you're believing a
scientist when he tells you that science is objective and
unbiased how stupid are you how gullible are you you're
[ __ ] fool of course a scientist is going
to tell you that science is objective and unbiased does
that make it so no not at all you should
be suspicious as [ __ ] of that because you
see it's a feature of almost every paradigm and ideology
in epistemology that it claims to be objective truthful and
unbiased this has been a problem in every field of
human sense making and knowledge it's been a problem within
philosophy science religion morality politics medicine culture all of these
have always been biased and they've always claimed that they're
objective and unbiased and furthermore every new generation clings to
new biases surrenders the old but clings to the new
what you need to recognize is that listen to this
this is profound this should blow your mind recognize that
the pursuit of science itself is a bias in itself
and because of this science cannot ever encapsulate or understand
all of reality or truth just by the very fact
that you want to do science and you have become
a scientist you've already disconnected yourself from absolute truth you
will already never understand the entirety of consciousness because the
entirety of consciousness includes science but it includes way more
than just science science rationality objectivity proof reductionism quantification formalization
mathematics these do not circumscribe the entirety of existence this
is a tiny subset of infinity it's a tiny it's
a speck it's a [ __ ] speck of infinity
if you want to understand how tiny of a speck
this is imagine how many stars there are in the
night sky in the universe there are like a trillion
stars in our universe science the entirety of science that
will ever be done by man is like a single
star what about all the other stars those are not
circumscribed by rationality science quantification mathematics proof or any of
those other things so as we're getting to the end
here sense making requires a completely unbiased mind the more
unbiased your mind the bigger picture you can see of
reality every bias you have will become a limit of
perception imagination and understanding even a innocent seeming bias such
as like i want to be objective and factual you
think that's not a bias that is a bias and
that will prevent you from making sense of all of
reality you have to let that go if you think
well leo i'm just i'm just trying to be like
uh uh you know uh like a like a good
lab technician that's a bias or it's like leo but
i just want i'm a mathematician i only study mathematics
that's a bias that means you won't understand reality not
all of it because mathematics is not limited to i
mean reality is not limited to mathematics alone every single
bias you have will become a limit upon your consciousness
making your consciousness less than infinite meaning that you will
disconnect yourself from god and this is why scientists have
such a difficult time with god because the scientist has
chosen the lesser rather than the greater the scientist has
chosen to observe ants down on the surface of the
earth rather than living in a space station up in
the sky looking down on the whole earth choose which
one you want if you want to see the totality
of the earth you have to zoom out to zoom
out you have to remove all your biases in this
example and if you're biased towards studying ants all you'll
understand is ants if you're biased towards studying kangaroos if
all you care about are kangaroos and nothing else then
all you'll know are kangaroos if all you care about
are numbers all you'll know are numbers if all you
care about particle physics all you'll know is particle physics
i mean isn't this [ __ ] obvious and yet
we have particle physicists and mathematicians and psychologists and whoever
else pretending as though they figure out all of reality
through their little sub domain it's absurd it's [ __
] absurd it's pure idiocy all of that is bias
recognize that every subfield of science is self-biased see the
mathematician thinks that reality is fundamentally mathematical the physicist thinks
that physics is most fundamental the biologist thinks that actually
biology is fundamental there are books written by biologists who
say that physics is not what's most important actually it's
biology consciousness is biology of course that's delusional too um
now there are computer nerds and computer scientists who think
that all of reality is fundamentally a simulation it must
all be a computer why is that because all they
[ __ ] know are computers when all you have
is a computer everything looks like a keyboard perhaps that's
a that's a bad way of stating the the old
uh mark twain quote that uh when all you have
is a hammer everything looks like a nail the astrophysicist
thinks that the big bang is what explains everything is
most fundamental the psychologist thinks that psychology and psychological archetypes
jungian archetypes and so forth that's what's most fundamental myths
are most fundamental which of them is right it's the
old situation of the five blind men trying to describe
the elephant none of them are right they all have
a little piece of the elephant they don't have the
whole elephant now you might say here but leo okay
but but what about you what about you leo the
mystic thinks that consciousness is fundamental so isn't that the
same trap aha how is that any different the computer
nerd reduces down reality to a computer the physicist to
particles the mathematician to numbers the biologist to biology the
psychologist of psychology the mystic to consciousness and therefore consciousness
isn't the fundamental thing right wrong because the mystic is
doing something fundamentally different than all the others the mystic
is going meta and mystic is going holistic that means
the mystic is incorporating everything mysticism is not another sub
domain it is not a siloed subfield of any kind
of science the mystic goes after truth and truth is
consciousness and love and it incorporates all of the mathematics
the physics the biology the computer science the astrophysics psychology
all of that is incorporated and included within the larger
system of consciousness consciousness imagines all of those things so
while it might seem like i am as a mystic
reducing all of consciousness down i mean all of reality
down to consciousness in sort of in the same way
that a materialist will reduce it down to atoms there
is a difference the difference is that consciousness is imagining
matter atoms and the materialist whereas matter is not causing
consciousness that is the difference and you can become directly
conscious of that because you are consciousness and because conscious
is all there is how convenient right it's perfect so
what i want you to really deeply understand here is
that whatever finite method you use to study nature that
method will be biased because nature is actually infinite your
method will always crack under the strain of nature it's
as though you're trying to wrangle a an infinitely sized
elephant using some lassos and some rope which is made
out of grass and it tears and it rips because
this infinite sized elephant simply cannot be tamed it cannot
be wrangled in any way i want you to further
notice that even the questions you ask of nature are
themselves biased every question you ask is a bias itself
what kinds of questions you ask these are manifestations of
your biases if you ask the question is reality mathematical
that's the kind of bias you have and you might
get a certain biased answer and if you ask the
question like um um how does the brain create consciousness
see that's a bias when you ask that question you're
assuming the brain craves consciousness you're not you're taking it
for granted that it could be the opposite it could
be conscious that creates the brain but you're so biased
you don't recognize that and you don't even care also
your curiosity for nature is biased when you love kangaroos
but you hate elephants that means you're going to study
kangaroos but you can't study elephants properly when you love
particles but you hate consciousness you can't study consciousness properly
when you hate meditation you can't meditate properly instead if
you love thinking you're gonna be lost in monkey mind
all the time if you're passionate about numbers all you'll
see are numbers so beware of narrow passions in this
pursuit of ultimate understanding your passion has to be very
wide your your passion literally has to be universal not
narrow and you might say well leo but isn't conscious
as a narrow passion it might seem that way but
if consciousness is all that there is then by definition
a passion for consciousness is a passion for the whole
universe see now you might say but leo if i'm
passionate about particles particles is all that that there is
too so if i'm passionate about particles as a physicist
doesn't that mean that i'm passionate about the whole universe
actually no because particles is not all that there is
that's an assumption that's part of your paradigm you got
a question you're locked into that paradigm now you say
but leo but isn't consciousness also a paradigm saying that
consciousness is everything that's also a paradigm that also could
be wrong no it can't be wrong because consciousness is
every paradigm what imagines all paradigms consciousness consciousness is not
a paradigm consciousness is meta paradigmatic it's meta everything it's
infinite you can't be conscious see you materialists and rationalists
and skeptics you're trying to like weasel your way out
of consciousness somehow you're trying to come up with some
sort of theory or idea or scheme or some sort
you're trying to find some sort of loophole within within
reality so you can avoid consciousness facing it directly but
you can't because there's only one thing in in the
universe and it's consciousness you can't escape consciousness only through
delusions and mental gymnastics which is what you love to
do your attitude towards psychedelics is a bias you have
a lot of people argue with me that oh leo
but how can you trust psychedelics psychedelics are are you
know uh intoxicated state and then the sober state is
the real state this is a bias you have you
have a bias towards a sober state you should realize
that now people will accuse me of having a bias
towards a psychedelic state i actually don't have a bias
towards a psychedelic state i spend most of my time
in a sober state first of all um the percentage
of my time that i spend in a psychedelic state
is like less than one percent of my existence uh
but also the thing you don't realize that the the
difference between a sober and a psychedelic state this is
an imaginary difference imagined by consciousness so there actually is
no such difference between these states you take that difference
for granted i realize that difference is something i'm imagining
that's the difference between us so actually i don't have
a i don't have a bias towards psychedelic states i
have a bias towards truth you might say um and
the truth is that there is no difference between a
psychedelic and a sober state but anyways that's that's a
topic for another time you can watch my episode how
how psychedelics work if you want to know more about
that another bias is your preference for thinking versus feeling
that's a bias you can have another bias you have
is a preference for vision for example versus sound if
you're a visual person visual thinker that's one way of
interfacing with reality sound is a very different way of
interfacing with reality now you might say well leo so
what all these biases what does it all matter in
the end well look here's why it matters if you
overlook your biases then don't come crying and acting shocked
and horrified when others do the same and then it
bites you in the ass because you see when you
ignore your own biases you're so selfish you don't see
the collateral damage your biases cause to others and so
you're fine with it but then when others are biased
towards you you hate it and you come crying and
you come asking for government to help you and you
cry foul and you cry how unfair it is you
don't like it when religious fanatics for example or political
partisans and ideologues are flagrantly biased when they present biased
news information for example or biased narratives about reality you
don't like that you could even consider that lying and
yet you're okay with your own biases with your biases
of science for example you make excuses for those because
you think they're good well yeah those religious fanatics think
that their biases are good and so all of us
think all of our biases are good that's called selfishness
and then collectively what that leads to is a dysfunctional
shitty hellish social situation which we find ourselves in today
and the ultimate reason that bias matters is because when
we say bias what we're really talking about is a
bias in love bias is the bias of absolute love
into something finite so if you ever want to reach
the highest love if you ever want to realize that
reality is love if you ever want the ultimate toe
the ultimate theory of everything then you need to drop
all of your biases you need to be deeply concerned
with ridding your perception and your world view of all
bias and you need to start treating things in an
unbiased even-handed manner in the way that god would imagine
if you committed yourself over the next 40 years of
your life to purifying your perception and your worldview and
your mind of as many biases as possible what would
happen your perception would become gradually more and more godlike
until one day you would literally realize that you're god
because your mind would become as pure as spotless as
as even as gods now on a practical point you
might ask is it even possible to drop all of
one's attachments and biases and this is important because the
answer is no not if you want to survive you
see survival is bias and attachment you can't survive otherwise
you need to be at least attached to water air
food other things shelter in order to survive and you
probably even want to be attached to more than just
those things in order to survive well because you don't
want to just basically survive you want to thrive a
bit too you want to have some abundance too which
requires some bias and attachment so i'm not saying something
super naive here where you just throw away all your
biases i'm not telling you to like stop loving your
kids and whatever or stop sending him to good schools
i'm saying something actually here um you know before you
start removing biases such as those around your kids and
your shelter and your career uh you know first there
are many there are many smaller less important biases that
you can remove like for example you might have some
racist biases you can remove those and that will improve
your life so don't get too perfectionistic here i'm not
asking you to be perfect i'm not expecting you to
remove all your biases i'm just looking for improvement i'm
looking for you to become more conscious of your biases
first of all even before you remove them just become
more conscious of them that alone will help greatly at
least know what they are if you're a scientist by
all means remain a scientist but at least [ __
] know your what your bi your own biases are
so you don't embarrass yourself when you're talking to me
stop making excuses stop making rationalizations admit that what you're
doing is biased notice how it is that in and
of itself alone will be curative remember awareness is curative
i have an episode about that check it out it's
called awareness security um so you can't really get rid
of all your attachments and biases but you can improve
and this explains why virtually all humans are so biased
and so selfish and blind to it because they have
to be in order to keep existing realize that those
humans who were the most selfless and the most unbiased
and the most truthful and honest those humans were killed
millennia ago they lie buried in unmarked graves nobody remembers
their names that's what happened to the most selfless among
us and what remains today is the most vicious the
most ruthless the most selfish the most egotistical the most
narcissistic the most partial the most biased humans of all
our ancestors they are who are alive today and you
are the descendant of the most selfish [ __ ]
who have lived on this planet for the last four
billion years congratulations now you understand why you're so [
__ ] selfish and so biased and why it's so
difficult for you to attain god realization or to love
this also explains why truth is so well hidden and
why people are so full of [ __ ] all
the time while they're always why they're always lying see
my episode called mankind is full of [ __ ]
or um what would i call it mankind um something
about [ __ ] mankind and [ __ ] search
for that i have so many episodes i can't remember
all their titles so anyways you can become less biased
less attached and as you do so this will allow
you to access deeper understanding more truth clearer perception less
suffering tranquility love and better science and the last warning
that i'll give you here to wrap all this up
is beware of your bias against bias itself once you've
taken on this project of shedding yourself all these biases
and noticing all these biases then the final bias that
will remain is your bias against the biases of others
so you will want others to stop being biased and
if you fall into that bias you're going to be
in for a world of hurt because even if you
become very unbiased everybody else around you is still going
to be biased and selfish as [ __ ] and
you might say well leo then what's the point if
only i'm going to do it and nobody else is
going to do it what's the point that's unfair yeah
becoming a highly conscious god-like individual amongst the human chimps
that are walking around on this planet is very challenging
and it's ultimately very unfair they're not going to treat
you fairly these chimps that's the difficulty of the mystical
path of spiritual work you're not going to be very
well understood and maybe even one day they'll crucify you
just because you rid yourself of all your biases don't
expect everybody else to alright that's it i hope you
