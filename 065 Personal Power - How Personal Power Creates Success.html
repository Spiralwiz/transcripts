            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition and Importance of Personal Power</b>: Personal power refers to an individual's ability to control their environment and themselves including willpower and the ability to accomplish tasks. It's inevitable for living a fulfilling life, achieving both external rewards and experiencing internal feelings of happiness and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Low Personal Power Characteristics</b>: Individuals with low personal power are typically financially unstable, unhealthy, have tumultuous relationships, lack direction in life and goals, have lower career status and are in a constant state of worry and anxiety. They are often stuck in unfulfilling jobs, carry a history of broken relationships, and have little or no sense of contribution to the world.
</li><li><b>High Personal Power Characteristics</b>: People possessing high personal power exhibit excellent financial status, nurtured relationships, career success, and a positive mental state. They lead fulfilling lives, making more money than they spend, working on numerous self-improvement aspects, and contributing significantly to the world. 
</li><li><b>Mitigating Low Personal Power</b>: Leo advises individuals with low personal power, suggesting they found the right video content to drive self-improvement. This implies that cultivating personal power is a driving force behind his content creation at actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Development with Personal Power</b>: Individuals with personal power are characterized by a continuous self-development process which results in improved relationships, career growth and satisfaction, health consciousness, and mental balance. They often exhibit traits like willpower, confidence, minimal procrastination and overthinking, and the ability to achieve ambitious goals.
</li><li><b>Relationship between Personal Power and External Success</b>: Though personal power may not be the desired goal for most people, it's the foundation of the external rewards that many yearn for. This power leads to self-masterycontrol over thoughts and emotionsthat positively reflects on various life aspects like health, career, finance, and relationships.
</li><li><b>Approach to Personal Power Development</b>: Personal power is developed gradually, and can't be attained through shortcut methods or techniques. Starting with a desire and a vision of personal power, following through with an ambitious long-term goal, and willingness to improve and evolve, are all crucial steps in the process.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Transformation Through Personal Development</b>: Leo Gura cites his own journey from poor health, relationships, financial condition, and negative thinking, towards significant overall improvement through personal development as evidence of the transformative power of such self-guided growth.
</li><li><b>The Ultimate Goal for Personal Power</b>: Personal power translates into the ability to create a fulfilling life, achieve ambitious objectives, make significant changes in the world, and finally, to live without any regrets.
</li><li><b>About actualized.org and Leo Gura's Offerings</b>: To assist others in understanding and attaining personal power, Gura created actualized.org.
