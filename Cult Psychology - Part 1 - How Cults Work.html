[Music] welcome to this two-part miniseries on cult psychology I'm
really excited about this topic I've been doing a lot
of research on it because there's so much that we
can learn from cults so many broader lessons so we're
gonna have to first start by talking about the foundation
what are cults and how do they work most people
don't know what cults are and how they really work
so that's what we'll be doing today in part one
and then in part two we'll be looking at the
broader applications we're gonna zoom out take a big-picture look
at the epistemic lessons that we're gonna learn from cults
and how that's visible everywhere in society and this is
where it's gonna be really practical and this is where
the whole payoff of this mini series is gonna be
so you want to make sure that you stick around
for part two in part two we'll be looking at
for example how we see cult-like behavior in business in
marketing in politics in religion even in science in universities
in your family in your personal life and your relationships
so it's gonna get very very practical so if you
are under the impression at all well Leo I'm too
smart to get suckered into a cult and there's no
lessons there for me to learn for my self-improvement I'm
just an ordinary person I don't care about joining a
cult well watch out first of all many of you
actually are foolish enough to get suckered into cults because
these cults are extremely deceptive and they will sucker you
in so we want to be able to inoculate you
against that that will be valuable in and of itself
but beyond that what's going to be valuable for you
even if you never join a cult or even think
about a cult or even experience a cult recruiting you
in your whole life then what will be really valuable
is part 2 where we look at the broader epistemic
lessons so the first reason that this topic is so
important is because we're gonna inoculate you against cults and
this is something that is quite important actually if you're
watching my content because my content is heavy heavily conceptual
and theoretical and philosophical so if you're watching my stuff
then your priority already leaning in that direction and if
you're gonna be studying spirituality self-improvement various kinds of New
Age topics that I talked about enlightenment non-duality all of
this then you're very likely to run to cults over
the next 10 or 20 years of your self-development journey
there are a lot of cults that are built upon
this information this is very powerful information that can get
very easily corrupted and abused by the ego and so
you can unwittingly get sucked into one of these cults
even though you don't intend to because generally speaking we're
not taught about how cults work in school so we're
all extremely susceptible even in university they don't teach you
how cults really work unless maybe you take a very
specific psychology course on that topic which most people don't
and even then it's not gonna be very practical it's
gonna be mostly theory so we need to inoculate you
against cults because these cults can destroy your life they
can suck you dry of your entire life savings in
all of your possessions they can abuse you mentally emotionally
spiritually even physically they can lose you decades of your
life these are extremely dangerous and toxic ideologies and they
can be very very appealing to people who don't know
any better so that's why this topic is so important
but also it's important because someone close to you might
join a cult even if you don't a friend or
a family member and wouldn't it be nice to be
able to recognize those signs and to know what to
do to be able to give them advice to know
where to go find solutions for for this kind of
problem because of course as soon as they get sucked
in they're gonna try to suck you in and they're
gonna try to suck in more of your friends and
more of your family so it can it can really
turn into a [ __ ] if you're not careful
with these cults and the last reason that why is
so important to talk about this topic besides all the
epistemic lessons here is that you yourself could become a
cult leader and that is perhaps the worst case scenario
and in fact a lot of very intelligent people fall
into this trap here is they think that themselves as
being too intelligent and too independent minded to ever join
a cult but then they themselves go in start a
cult especially if you're the type of person that resonates
with my content and watches me a lot then you're
probably interested in personal development you might be interested in
in teaching you might be interested in becoming a life
coach you might even become a spiritual teacher at some
point in your life and if you're not careful you
could start a cult of your own so watch out
so let's begin at the very beginning what is a
cult now this word cult is a little bit tricky
because it's usually used in two different ways there's the
loose colloquial usage that we use casually throughout society where
people will just call stuff a cult even though it's
not really a cult basically what they mean when they
say the word cult normally speaking is they just mean
some sort of ideological system that they don't agree with
that's by definition to them a cult but that's not
really what a cult is there's a more technical definition
and that's what I want to share with you today
so what is a cult technically it is a hierarchical
organization created by a charismatic narcissistic leader which uses mind-control
techniques to amass money power and sex you got all
that there's a lot there that we need to unpack
so firstly one of the most important characteristics of a
cult is that it's a hierarchical structure a pyramid scheme
quite literally which leeches resources from the bottom of the
pyramid up to the very top to the leader and
to his top lieutenants depending on the size of the
cult if it's a small cult it's usually run by
just like one leader and a few of his top
lieutenants so it's this kind of structure and the entire
structure is designed to serve the narcissistic leader at the
very top it's an authoritarian power structure sort of like
a little tyranny or a little despotism or a little
monarchy but the leader builds for himself and he's doing
it for rather very shallow reasons very materialistic reasons because
he's got an ego and he wants to feed all
of his lower Bay needs the needs for security survival
attention approval love power over other people and of course
sexual gratification good food luxury all this kind of other
otherwise very low cost and stuff now these cults are
often started by Zen Devils and if you don't know
what a Zen devil is go check out my episode
becoming a Zen devil it's pretty important so basically a
Zen devil is someone who has had some mystical insight
maybe has had an enlightenment experience or two but he's
still immature and his enlightenment is half-baked and so whatever
mystical States he's attained he hasn't fully embodied them and
he still has an ego remaining and saw as a
shadow remaining and overall his level of development on the
spiral spiral dynamics wise is quite low oftentimes it's staged
read or staged orange so it's sort of like a
half-assed version of spirituality somebody goes and does some spiritual
practice then they think that they've understood the whole world
they think they know more than they actually do they
misinterpret many of these mystical insights maybe they have a
vision or two maybe they have an enlightenment experience or
two then their ego seizes on that and says aha
look I am God I know everything this kind of
idea they're still very immature as a teacher and as
a leader they have many aspects of themselves they still
need to develop and work on but because they have
this silly idea that all well if I just had
this one enlightenment experience that's it that must mean that
I'm now incapable of error and I'm capable of misleading
people and my incapable of deluding myself they they get
sucked into that and then they create this sort of
authoritarian pyramid scheme in order to serve all of their
shadow egoic needs and really if you want to think
about essentially what function does does a cult serve really
what it is is an egoic distraction created by the
leaders ego in order to not fulfill his full spiritual
journey see it's very sneaky it's very sneaky how the
devil works as I've talked about before in my episode
what is the devil that's also very important one to
go check that one out see the devil loves to
co-opt legitimate spiritual insights teachings and techniques and to use
those towards his own devilish purposes and what I mean
by the word devil is not some demonization of somebody
really I'm using the word metaphorically and really when I
say the word devil what I really mean is ego
or selfishness that's what I mean I don't mean a
creature with horns and a pitchfork so you see as
you're going on this spiritual journey and you're having insights
and experiences and you're developing yourself all of this is
good but it can always turn pathological there can always
be a point where your ego even though it's seen
something big with some enlightenment experience then it tricks itself
because the mind is so self deceptive see my many
series on self-deception the mind is so self deceptive that
it tricks itself into thinking that it's already arrived when
in fact it hasn't and that's really just a distraction
from continuing the journey you see so the ego creates
this cult and now it's so busy externalizing its actions
rather than turning inwards and self reflecting and developing itself
further having more enlightenment and realizing still how much more
growth it has to do the ego thinks it's done
and now it thinks that oh it needs to go
out there and spread the gospel proselytize people convert others
and transform the world awaken the whole world see and
really what that is is just a self-deception mechanism and
you need to be wise enough to be able to
see through that otherwise you will start one of these
cults if you're doing this work so what's tricky about
cults is that cults are not all bad it's not
all delusion it's not all self-deception the way that most
people think most people in mainstream society things like Oh
a cult is just some crazy fringe phenomena that I
would never get involved with because you know I don't
believe such such crazy things but what you're under estimating
is that nobody joins a cult under those reasons the
cult always lures you in with genuine spiritual insight and
self-improvement techniques which are valid but what it does is
it twists them around and so it's a it's a
mixture a cult is a mixture of genuine spiritual teachings
and insights and self-improvement techniques with toxic narcissism egotism hierarchy
this authoritarian pyramid structure the leaders shadow and then heaps
of ideology and this just creates this very toxic brew
which can lead down a very dangerous road if you're
not careful so the thing you have to really understand
about cults is that on the surface they will seem
very appealing you're not even gonna know that you're joining
a cult when you join a cult there's not gonna
be like a big sign on the front of the
building saying come join our cult it's not gonna be
like that you're always gonna feel like you're joining some
legitimate organization which genuinely wants to awaken the world or
to help you or to help others the way that
a cult really works is that it tries to create
a reality distortion bubble a collective fantasy so together a
group of people come together and they create an ideology
such that they don't have to actually do spiritual work
but they can just coexist in this bubble of self-deception
and each one of the people in the group reinforces
the self deceptions of all the other people and so
it feels to them as though they have awakened but
really they haven't and they actually become very blind very
unaware to all of the egoic self deceptions that are
running within this collective fantasy and they're always constantly having
to fight the external world to maintain their fantasy because
it's a fantasy because it's false and so falsehood always
has to struggle against the truth because in the end
the truth always wins out so every cult eventually self-destructs
because every cult is ultimately false but until that happens
it could take 50 or 100 years or however long
and in the meantime a lot of people get hurt
a lot of lives will get destroyed as they suck
more and more people into this collective bubble of delusion
and of course it's precisely because it's a collective bubble
of delusion that the cult members have to become such
radicals mm-hmm and have to resort to such desperate means
sometimes including violence and other criminal acts in order to
maintain their fantasy because otherwise their fantasy will eventually burst
the bubble will burst and then they will realize that
the whole thing was just a sham really a cult
you could think of it as a psychological cange AAB
a con job that you bet you play on yourself
and then a con job that you then play on
others it's like an infection it's like the plague it
infects you and then you transfer it over to other
people unwittingly unlike a traditional scam or theft where the
thief just wants your money a cult is a little
bit more than that a cult doesn't just want to
use you for your money although of course it will
they also want to use you to control your mind
the ego gets off on the power the authority the
status that it builds the self righteousness that comes with
being part of a cult so be careful about that
if you're in your 20s or 30s or you are
thinking of following some spiritual or self-development teacher who is
in his 20s or 30s you have to be very
careful because the default tendency is that for a person
in their 20s or 30s without special care the default
tendency is that these immature leaders will start a cult
even if they don't want to they will follow through
this trap unwittingly because they're still so young still so
inexperienced still snowy egotistical and underdeveloped still so arrogant and
at this age you think like well yeah I'm gonna
go out there and I'm gonna conquer the world and
I'm gonna I know how to save the world I
know how to awaken the whole world I have high
ideals and I've had a few enlightenment experiences therefore I
know what to do and then you go out there
and then you start a cult unless you're very very
careful and you pay very careful attention to the epistemic
issues here that are at play which are very subtle
and take a lot of self-awareness to understand cults range
in size from tiny to giant some cults can have
as few as four members or ten members a cult
can literally be as small as one family or cults
can be larger with hundreds of members - even thousands
or tens of thousands of members and when these cults
become very very large they become very dangerous to society
actually as a whole to mainstream society because what they're
going to try to do in their egotism is because
they think they know best they're gonna actually try to
take over the levers of power they're not going to
be content just maintaining their own little authoritarian pyramid they're
gonna actually want to take over the entire government if
they can and that's why a lot of these cults
have political motives oftentimes they don't tell you about them
but they have them and they actually will try to
infiltrate political parties organizations universities and take the levers of
power because the ego needs to do that in order
to protect its bubble of delusion see so the cult
is all about self survival at all costs so we're
talking about the collective ego here go check out my
episode about collective ego it's also a very important one
there's different types of cults there are religious cults new-age
cults educational cults self-improvement in psychology cults political cults and
commercial cults like MLM schemes and labor trafficking rings but
of course often a cult will be a combination of
all of these pillars because the cult is purely interested
in self survival and it's going to do it using
any means necessary so often a religious we'll also incorporate
some psychological techniques in order to better manipulate people and
it'll also be political and we'll have political ambitions and
it'll also be commercial of course because it needs money
and money is power so usually a cult will be
a mixture of all this stuff now it's very important
to clear up one very common misconception is that people
equate religion with cults and cults with religion but this
is too simplistic we need to draw a distinction between
these two firstly because cults can be secular for example
I could create a cult strictly around self-improvement without ever
mentioning God or spirits or anything religious like that or
without affiliating myself with Christianity or Islam or Buddhism Earnie
mainstream religion I don't think use any of those words
to create a cult but more importantly yes it's true
that mainstream religion is full of self-deception and delusion and
yes it's true that it doesn't doctrine eight children and
even adults into its ideology and it can become very
fundamentalist generally speaking though the difference between mainstream religion and
a cult is that the mainstream religion is not run
to serve one authoritarian individual also a mainstream religion does
not physically hold you from leaving the religion now of
course they can look down upon you they can try
to convince you not to leave in certain very fundamentalist
sect so maybe of Islam or something they might have
been threatened to kill you if you leave but generally
speaking you can leave mainstream religion and they won't like
physically lock you in a room to prevent you from
leaving whereas a cult will a cult might beat you
for trying to leave a coat will psychologically manipulate you
to keep you from leaving which is also other important
difference between mainstream religion and cults is that cults generally
use a lot more mind-control techniques than mainstream religion now
of course many of you atheists and rationalists in the
audience and materialists and scientists will say Oh leo but
I mean religion uses all sorts of mind-control techniques that's
how it in doctrine needs children and yes of course
that's true and we'll be looking more into that commonality
in Part two when we're looking at the broader epistemic
lessons but generally speaking religion doesn't use mind control and
nearly to the same extent that a real cult will
and also another important difference is that mainstream religion has
ethical standards and checks and balances unlike a cult now
of course many atheistic lis minded religious is rationally minded
people will say here leo but but I mean look
at the Catholic Church they don't have any ethical standards
or checks and balances look at all the shenanigans that
they're up to look at all the corruption that's in
in the church well actually that example sort of proves
my point because they do have ethical standards regardless of
their certain criminal misconduct that might happen regardless of some
rotten apples and regardless of corruption there's yes there's plenty
of corruption all most or all organizations including all religious
ones but there are checks and balances they are reforming
themselves they do take some of these criticisms seriously and
they have to address them in a cult there's no
checks and balances whatsoever so if you think the Catholic
Church is bad wait till you see what it's like
inside of a small little cult run by one tyrannical
leader it's way worse way worse also it's important to
distinguish communes from cults communes are not strictly speaking cults
now of course some of them can be but many
of them aren't the difference is that a commune is
generally not a hierarchical and authoritarian pyramid structure a commune
is much more of a flat network rather than a
hierarchy and that's quite important communes also don't generally have
a rigid doctrine of course they have certain sets of
values and principles that they follow but generally it's not
a rigid ideology it might just be some loose values
some loose hippie values like love and peace and equality
and fairness for all and I mean that's that's very
different from the kind of very rigid fundamentalist ideology that
tends to come with a cult communes will generally not
use mind control techniques to manipulate you communes are usually
pretty honest about their agenda they don't try to conceal
they don't have like a secret political motive most of
the time communes generally expel power seekers and narcissists communes
don't spend a lot of time and money on recruiting
unlike cults communes will not hold members captive so you're
just free to leave the community time you want no
hard feelings and communes generally pose little danger to society
so what are some examples of cults here's a list
I'm gonna give you you might have heard of some
of these but you might have not heard of other
ones so you might just want to google them look
at their Wikipedia pages although watch out because these cults
are very manipulative and they will modify their Wikipedia pages
to make themselves look better than they actually are and
to try to convince themselves that they're not cults of
course you might disagree with some of the stuff that
I put an honest list especially if you're a member
of one of these cults you will definitely disagree with
me that is a cult but nevertheless here we go
Scientology the unification Church otherwise known as the Moonies the
Hari Krishna's the Mason family fundamentalist strains of Latter day
Saints and Mormonism I don't consider mainstream Mormonism a cult
waha BISM al-qaida boko haram Isis suicide bombers terrorism really
terrorism terrorism is not a religious problem it's not an
Islam problem terrorism is a cult problem terrorism comes from
cults now of course they could be Islamic cults but
terrorism also comes from white nationalist cults and other kinds
as well um Shan Rico this is the Japanese cult
that was in the news back the late 90s for
a gas attack in the subways in Tokyo I think
it was the ralien Church Heaven's Gate seventh-day adventists Jamestown
the Branch Davidians Jehovah's Witnesses children of God Aryan Nation
the LaRoche organization Rajneeshpuram or Osho's commune and Transcendental Meditation
that's a small list there are really hundreds and even
thousands of cults just in the United States alone most
of them you don't know about most of them don't
have a Wikipedia page or a book written about them
because they're usually so small most cults will probably have
20 30 50 members in them so you won't know
about them now these last two on my list Rajneeshpuram
and trans no no meditation you might object that Lee
oh these aren't really cults and in a certain sense
I would agree with you in a certain sense they're
not cults but in a certain sense they are for
example with Rajneeshpuram I do consider Osho to be a
legitimate enlightened master I don't know if I would go
as far as calling him a cult leader per se
I think he was a pretty pretty decent teacher but
it's also pretty evidenced that he was a pretty poor
leader and he was pretty irresponsible in the way that
he led his commune and he let he get way
out of hand in them even though he himself might
not have been a cult leader his uh his right-hand
lieutenant Sheila she was definitely fitting into the mold of
a traditional cult leader very egotistical very narcissistic didn't actually
do any spiritual work was just in it for the
power in it for the approval in it for the
all the materialistic acquisitions and then Osho let that get
way out of hand and and that led to all
sorts of craziness and calamity go watch the Netflix special
documentary called wild wild country about all the shenanigans that
went on at Rajneeshpuram very interesting and it shows you
just how bad this stuff can get and Transcendental Meditation
while I think Trane's no meditation can be effective and
I know people who have had enlightenment experiences using that
technique and all that the way that it's structured is
very cult-like and is rather manipulative so there you go
of course there's a spectrum some of these cults are
better than others some of them were crazier than others
some of them have less spiritual techniques than others so
strictly speaking an ideology alone is not sufficient to qualify
something as being a cult so as much as I
would like to call the alt-right a cult or in
sells cult or libertarians a cult or the KKK even
a cult they're not really cults Mormonism is not a
cult Islam's not a cult Christianity is not a cult
Freemasonry is not a cult Alcoholics Anonymous is not a
cult pick up is not a cult Burning Man is
not a cult the US Army is not a cult
so a lot of these organizations are very ideological and
they behave in many cult-like ways but for example Alcoholics
Anonymous is not a cult because even though they have
a certain value system they teach you a certain ideology
when you enter it generally speaking they're honest about their
agenda you can leave anytime they you want they don't
really charge you much for anything they don't try to
mind-control you the US Army is also not a cult
because even though it does have a strict hierarchy and
it doesn't have a chain of command and you do
sign up you sign a contract to join the army
for five years or something like that and in that
sense you might think well it's very cult-like and you
know they're getting doctrine at you when you go to
boot camp so Leo doesn't that make the US Army
a cult no it doesn't not under the strict technical
definition because first of all the US Army is not
serving one authoritarian individual secondly the US Army is very
open about its agenda you know what you're getting into
when you join the US Army there's not a lot
of trickery going there you know that you're gonna be
learning how to shoot a rifle you know that you
will be called into a war zone if there's a
war you kind of know what you're fighting for what
you'll be asked to do now of course there are
certainly abuses within the army certainly corruption within the army
it's not perfect no organization is perfect so be careful
not to confuse corruption within an organization for it being
a cult there's corruption almost every organization under that definition
that everything is a cult and in the US Army
yes you sign up for five years but you know
you are making that a deliberate commitment you know that
that's how it works and then you get to leave
after those five years are over they're not gonna force
you to stay there's also checks and balances within the
US Army they have like their own court system they
have ethics boards you could even sue the army if
they do something criminal or wrong in some way so
there's a certain accountability and ethics and standards no not
perfect but it's there unlike in a cult and of
course the Army's not gonna suck you dry of all
your money and yes it will indoctrinate you but still
it won't really use the same kind of mind control
techniques on you that a cult will so all of
the organizations that I mentioned above the libertarians and all
right I mean these sorts of movements yes they exhibit
a lot of cult-like qualities and we'll be talking about
those in part two you have to be careful that
if you're gonna call these sorts of ideologies cults then
you know that cuts both ways if you're gonna do
that then I can also say that science is a
cult and that universities are cults and that atheism is
a cult and rationalism is a cult because those also
exhibit many of these kinds of ideological tendencies and the
reason that's something like if you're wondering why they alright
is not a cult it's because you can leave the
all right the all right is not organized by one
particular individual it's a very loose movement no one cares
if you come or go into the alt-right you know
they're not gonna physically lock you in they're not gonna
try to extort you of your money or anything like
that as much as I would love to call the
alright occult technically it's not so we have to understand
about cults is that they use very sneaky recruiting tactics
unlike almost any other kind of organization such that you
never even know that you're joining a cult because these
cults often create fake front organizations with totally different names
that have these lofty mission statements usually involving saving mankind
so the way that it a cult might recruit you
for example if you're a university student on campus they
might hold a little kiosk inviting you to a free
lecture and they're gonna give you cookies and brownies and
punch and they hey they just say hey look do
you want to improve your life are you interested in
learning meditation are you interested in learning how to be
more loving in your relationships come to one of our
lectures or free trainings or are you into equality and
fairness for all how about we help disabled people our
organization helps disabled and sick people and hungry children and
and abused animals come come to one of our meetings
and we'll show you how you could contribute it's a
positive loving community the name of the organization is save
the world or save mankind or save the animals and
you you're like hey that sounds great I love that
kind of stuff you know I've been watching actualised org
and I becoming more conscious and I'm becoming more loving
so why shouldn't I help the animals and the disabled
people of the world and so you go and join
and the first meeting you go to it's a great
meeting the guy he comes up there and he tells
you about how they're helping these people he shows you
a video about how many animals they save last year
and ask you for a $5 donation and then gives
you some some hugs and says some some things about
Europe here and says how nice you look and says
how how evolved you are house of actualised you are
tells you all this sort of stuff and then you
sign up for the second meeting and the third meeting
and slowly they suck you in they're never honest about
their true agenda you don't even know you're joining a
cult you don't know the name of the cult you're
joining you don't know the cult leader yet in many
cases and they often lure you in with legitimate self-help
techniques that's what people don't understand a lot of the
techniques that I teach in actualised org like meditation visualization
and and basically all the advice that I give you
can take this and you can sprinkle it in to
any kind of cult-like entity and then that will make
your cults seem very legitimate because people will use some
of these techniques and sure enough the technique will work
it'll help you to calm your mind it'll help you
in a relationship it'll help you with your life purpose
or whatever but that's just the hook that sucks you
in see oftentimes when cults recruit they will use a
sort of psychological analysis they're very sophisticated this way and
they will analyze what kind of profile you are as
a human being oftentimes they break it down into four
categories you're either a thinker a feeler a believer or
a doer and they will find the perfect fit for
you in their organization and they will pitch their cult
to you to match one of those four categories so
for example if you're a thinker if you're a philosopher
if you love intellectual stuff if you're a scientist and
you love ideas and logic and reason and all this
then I is the cult leader if you come to
me one of my meetings then I will I will
assess you I will I will understand that oh yeah
you're a philosophical type of person you're a thinker so
for you I'm going to present all of the sophisticated
models and theories and maps I'm gonna draw stuff on
a whiteboard for you connecting dots showing you all the
systems showing you how all the spiritual stuff works and
how you can improve yourself and how you can improve
the world and I'm gonna present scientific evidence and studies
and oh I can I could be making it up
but I'll be presenting it as though it's the real
thing and you will be a sucker and you'll buy
into it and then you will also play that role
in my cult you're gonna become one of my lieutenants
and then I'll train you to do the same thing
and to recruit other thinkers you're going to be the
the cult philosopher on the other hand if you're a
feeler and oftentimes we and fall into this category feminine
women they're feelers and what they really want feelers want
love they want a sense of community they want to
join a family they want to be helpers they feel
that role in society they love to be nurses or
to help disabled children physical therapists these types of people
doctors if you're a feeler then I'm gonna push those
buttons in you to recruit you I'm gonna give you
hugs I'm gonna shower you with praise and love and
adoration such you're gonna feel so a part of this
little community that I've built you're gonna feel like you've
found your new family you've finally found people who accept
you unconditionally who understand you as a feeler understand that
it's the heart that's the most important thing and I'll
show you techniques for how to open your heart and
how to be more loving and all of that you're
gonna think it's all legitimate it's gonna be so wonderful
for the first month or two but as that's happy
that's just a hook for me to get my claws
into you if you're a believer then I will appeal
to your faith maybe you're a Christian or you're a
Muslim or you're a Jew or Hindu I will I
will see that I will then use that in order
to hook you in and I will try to align
my philosophy in the way that I'm explaining things with
your belief system and I will tell you precisely what
you want to believe and you'll believe it and then
you'll become one of my Believix and I will use
you to proselytize others you're gonna be the one that
goes up there and gives the speech who convinces others
to really believe in our cause because you yourself will
believe in it so much for believers for them life
is about serving a larger purpose having a kind of
an ideology that runs them and a lot of times
these are staged blue spiral dynamic stage blue people they're
believers they're really ullevål they're really easy to hook all
you got to do is you gotta align the beliefs
with what they're wants to hear and bam you got
him that's a lot of what's going on and in
the Middle East if you're a doer if you don't
like to think and you don't like to feel you're
an action-oriented person you're kind of entrepreneurial you like to
get your hands dirty and get stuff done well there's
a role for you to play in my cult as
well we got so much stuff we need to do
we need to organize marketing campaigns we need to run
drives we need to we need to build housing need
to build gardens we need to build cities and a
community there's so much stuff for you to do come
and I'll give you all this work to do and
you'll be the manager you'll be organizing stuff for me
and you'll be doing computer stuff and you'll be doing
marketing stuff so we got tons of that for you
as well and you can manage people who'd like to
be a manager oftentimes doers are good managers and so
you might not even really buy into the whole philosophy
of my cult but as a doer I'll hook you
in as well you see so these cults they're very
sneaky and how they recruit where do cults recruit very
commonly in schools and universities because people in their early
20s are very very vulnerable they're very idealistic very inexperienced
that immature and they're so easily hooked in especially because
they know nothing about epistemology they don't know anything about
how the mind works and how self-deceptive all this is
so watch out if your student at seminars workshops lectures
campus events nursing homes also retirement centers cults love to
prey on the elderly why is that because a lot
of times the elderly are sort of past the peak
of their life their life is starting to go downhill
they're losing their sense of purpose they feel like they're
alone now and nobody really cares about them but also
they have a savings but have a life savings they
have 401ks they have retirement accounts they have pensions they
have houses that can be mortgaged they have cars and
property that can be sold and cults love this they
can exploit these old folks run circle around them brainwashed
them and then robbed them of all their assets see
the problem with with a young college student is he
he or she has no money they don't have a
large credit card line they don't have a substantial investment
in their house that can be sold they don't own
their car but older folks tend to and older folks
love being part of a community because you know oftentimes
they're alone and they're lonely and they don't have a
lot of friends their family has sort of abandoned them
left them in a retirement home or something and so
to a elderly person it can feel like oh they're
getting a second renewed chance at life by joining one
of these cults but of course it never pans out
that way they can recruit at parties dances raves and
burns meditation and yoga classes are great recruitment opportunities for
cults clubs clinics rehab especially people in rehab are very
vulnerable and they're desperate for self-help advice and spirituality Bible
groups study groups grassroots organizations sales schemes sales seminars weight-loss
programs ads and posters around town around campus or even
just on the street you can be cold approached by
a recruiter why are cults so appealing because they feed
off the minds ideological nature which we've talked about many
times before when I talked about epistemology what I'm basically
talking about is all the ways in which the mind
clings to ideas and perspectives and how it gets paradigm
locked so the cult will exploit this tendency of the
mind and watch out about this common misconception if you
think that all Willie abut I'm too intelligent to ever
fall prey to joining a cult no you're not you're
not it has nothing to do with intelligence or IQ
no matter how smart you are your mind is still
your mind still has these self deception mechanisms within it
which can be easily activated if you know what you're
doing your mind is still always ideological it always loves
to cling to perspectives it's very easy to delude yourself
even if you're intelligent in fact in certain sense intelligent
people are even easier to dilute so all I have
to do is appeal to their intelligence cults love to
prey on the emotionally vulnerable especially when you are feeling
depressed or lonely or you just got a divorce or
you're you've got an illness or you're dealing with a
substance addiction problem or you're just feeling like you're in
a slump and you're stuck in life and you have
no sense of purpose or direction that's when you are
the most vulnerable to be recruited into a cult and
that's so common these days that pretty much that's everybody
right thinner most people have one of those problems so
also these cults are so appealing because they do offer
valid spiritual insights they actually can feel like they're helping
you at first they're also very appealing because they offer
an easy sense of life purpose so instead of taking
my life purpose course and really working through the exercises
and wracking your mind trying to figure out your life
purpose and spending years developing and building your life purpose
and developing mastery in something and figuring all that out
rather than doing that the legitimate way to get a
life purpose instead what people do is they just find
some cheap easy shortcut to a life purpose through a
cult and that's a really easy way to lure people
in because the ego needs a sense of purpose and
a sense of meaning it's life that's what gives it
a sense of direction and motivation and so if you
want to motivate somebody very easily offer them a cult
they'll become so motivated at least at first of course
they'll what are they going to be motivated towards towards
good or towards evil well with the cult it's going
to be towards evil or devil devilry as call it
when I say evil all I mean is just selfishness
and also cults are so appealing because our epistemic education
is so poor we're not taught about any of these
ideas in schooler and university think about what a cult
offers you psychologically a call offers security status friendship family
community meaning purpose financial support spiritual connection approval love feeling
special a sense of identity especially if you don't like
your old identity and escape from responsibility and work and
legitimate wisdom think of how that that appeals to the
mind that hits every button you have that right there
that list of stuff is basically what you want right
isn't that why you're listening to me in the first
place you want some of that you want some security
in your life you want some connection you want some
higher purpose you want love you want to feel special
you want a new identity because you're not happy with
your old one you want wisdom well I can very
easily exploit that if I want to satisfy all of
my personal needs so now let's get to the master
list of all the characteristics that define a cult this
is what you want to take notes on the cult
makes you totally dependent on them for financial and emotional
support that's one of the defining characteristics of a cult
they want to make you dependent they want you to
join them and to quit your old job and cut
off all your old friends you don't need them anymore
you're part of this loving family now it's your second
family the family you've never had before you know your
old family they didn't love you they didn't appreciate you
but we as the cult we will and so as
we're as we're showering you with approval and love and
a sense of purpose and you're buying into all that
we also make you financially and emotionally dependent on us
such that then if you want to leave well you
quit your old job you're working for us I'm paying
you as the cult leader I'm gonna be paying you
some tiny amount or we're gonna be exchanging some Goods
like maybe you get to stay in my in my
cabin or something and live on my compound and that's
kind of nice right if you're like a college kid
you don't know how to support yourself you don't want
a lame nine-to-five job where you have to go work
it Walmart or something you don't want that come come
join my compound stay on my stay in my cab
and you can have all the free food and stuff
you want just you don't eat from the compound cafeteria
will have free snacks for you and brownies on Fridays
and all this free weed come come join you know
that's gonna look very appealing because to you you're thinking
well damn you know why go work at Walmart when
I can just like live here so like a little
spiritual community everyone they're so loving and nice this is
kind of like self-development right and of course then that's
how we get you financially and now you want to
leave my compound well you can't you don't even have
enough money to buy a bus ticket unless I approve
it and buy it for you because you're so dependent
on me and then you're also going to be psychologically
dependent on me as well because now as your new
surrogate family and circle of friends this cult will be
giving you approval and opportunities for relationships and friendships and
sex all of that stuff that you want that you
can't get usually and and so are you gonna leave
all that just on a whim you know it's gonna
take something serious a serious epiphany for you to be
able to pull yourself out of that we're gonna try
to addictive a cult is gonna undermine your ability to
think independently like hyper conformity we're gonna try to replace
your authentic identity the one you've had your whole life
with a new false identity oftentimes this will be a
spiritual identity or an identity of an awakened person and
we will use various kinds of mind-control techniques to program
that into you of course the identity that we will
be programming into you is precisely that one that serves
me as the authoritarian leader so everything you're gonna be
programmed with will subtly try to reinforce that authoritarian pyramid
scheme that I want to build a cult is usually
focused on acquiring power for its top leaders most cult
members are true believers first they delude themselves into believing
in the mission of the cult and then they delude
you and then you delude others and so in that
sense it really is a pyramid scheme and because the
cult is always losing members because people are getting disillusioned
with the cult and leaving after wasting a few years
in it and losing a bunch of money and being
abused emotionally and physically and sexually in all this eventually
they leave so the cult is always losing people so
it always needs to recruit more people which is why
cults places a strong emphasis on recruitment because without recruitment
they would basically lose their members and the entire pyramid
would collapse just like any other pyramid scheme oftentimes in
a cult the cult leader genuinely believes that he is
the Messiah he is the chosen one that is there
to save mankind that he is special he is the
Anointed One and a lot of times this can come
from legitimate mystical experiences maybe he did see vision on
a you know a vision of Jesus on the mountain
and Jesus told him that he is like some reincarnation
of Jesus or whatever you know some something like this
about a lot of times what's happening there is that
the ego because the ego is not fully purified because
it's still a relatively low level of development and it's
not aware of the self deception mechanisms what it does
is that misinterprets a narcissistic ego with the big shadow
will misinterpret mystical insights and visions and then use them
towards egotistical purposes this is the modus operandi of the
devil so of course the devil will always think of
himself as an angel as the savior of mankind that's
what allows them to be so effective and so confident
in his devilishness almost always the lieutenant's that serve the
leader of the cult are themselves very underdeveloped immature power-hungry
materialistic fearful and greedy which makes them such good pawns
to be manipulated into becoming lieutenants and they become very
loyal because they're they're also leeching and benefiting from this
pyramid structure almost always the cults mission is portrayed as
benevolent in order to give a sense of divine purpose
to its members a sense of confidence and direction a
sense of motivation oftentimes you will start to think of
yourself when you join this cult as the savior of
mankind and that you have a special place in history
it's like our cult has has arisen right now at
this perfect intersection within human history where you know the
world and the environment is all collapsing capitalism is collapsing
and right now this cult it's like humanity's last chance
to save itself and you can if you just join
the cult and you just pay me some money and
you in you buy into my ideology then you will
take this special place beside me in history and you
will go down in the history books as having helped
awaken mankind redeem mankind that's kind of how it's phrased
and this sort of sense of divine purpose and power
becomes very very addictive this is what I would call
a pseudo life purpose it's a bastardization of what life
purpose is really about rather than going and finding your
own personal inner life purpose which is what my course
is about with a cult you're gonna join some sort
of collective conformist life purpose which is really just going
to be a bunch of fantasies and illusions and it's
true motives will always be materialistic and very shallow you're
not actually going to be saving mankind in fact you're
gonna be contributing to mankind's demise but it's gonna be
very addictive because so few people have life purpose that's
one of things I discovered with creating my course is
just how few people actually have a sense of life
purpose that I can see how susceptible they are to
this stuff especially if you've got nothing else going in
your life you've got no good relationships no interesting career
prospects what do you got to do join a cult
get a quick sense of life purpose BAM you're ready
to go you're motivated you're engaged life feels like it
finally has juice it feels exciting you're excited to wake
up in the morning and there you go you're hooked
like we already said a cult has no internal checks
and balances because it's basically like a small monarchy and
the Marr monarch has absolute power gets to say whatever
he wants and basically the cult is usually run on
the whims of the leader so whatever my whims are
if I want to have sex with you if I
want to take money from you if I want to
have you fly somewhere that's how the cult is gonna
work cults have a total istic ideology that's one of
their characteristics which means that they try to sell you
on one perspective which purports to solve all of life's
problems with this ideology a cult will blend doctrine with
reality doctrine becomes reality which is really the opposite of
what true spirituality is about true spirituality is actually getting
you to realize the distinction between reality or actuality and
your concepts and ideas and beliefs about it whereas the
cult does the exact opposite for the cult reality doesn't
matter reality flies out the window the doctrine and the
concepts they become the reality that's what we mean by
that creating a this bubble of delusion or fantasy cults
almost always push a dualistic a dualistic view of the
world as a battle between good versus evil of course
we as the cult members were the good guys and
people out there who are trying to interfere with our
cult activities they're the evil ones they need to be
stopped they are the enemy and so a cult will
usually spend a lot of time demonizing certain elements of
society other people other races other groups creating an external
enemy that's what the ego loves to do because then
it's busy fighting the lesser jihad and never has to
really fight the true jihad the energy HOD the greater
jihad by going inside and self reflecting and actually conquering
the ego so it's a very sneaky distraction mechanism also
characteristically cults tend to engage in a lot of black
and white thinking us versus them there's very little room
for interpretation or considering multiple perspectives or really being holistic
and integral cults tend to reduce complex issues to cult
cliches in order to prevent you from thinking independently and
often this is done using jargon language which is very
effective at reducing independent thinking what do I mean by
jargon language well a cult will almost always have certain
words and labels that it attaches to Outsiders verses insiders
the labels attached to the insiders the good guys will
be all positive and the labels attached to the outsiders
the enemy the evil ones they will always be derogatory
and have negative connotations and also they'll be very simplistic
so for example a really really great example this is
with social justice warriors this label is basically a cult
mind-control technique so people who are against the social justice
warriors they will just call anyone that they disagree with
some liberal or whatever they'll say oh look look at
a social justice warrior see and this is becomes part
of the lingo of the alt-right and others who oppose
biodynamic sage green and so they just label the whole
thing they smear the whole thing is social justice warriors
and just those three letters are enough you know sjw
to never even think about what is the perspective of
the social justice warriors what do they want now I'm
not saying that social justice warriors are perfect in every
way and if they don't have their own delusions and
problems they certainly do I'm just saying that using these
kinds of labels simplifying entire world using perspectives are just
simple three words three letter combinations and then just rejecting
out of hand that entire perspective this is precisely what
cults do this is how they engage in black and
white thinking of course cults try to squash all diversion
points of view just in the way that you would
expect an authoritarian or a tyrant to do you know
tyrants will censor tyrants don't allow a free press tyrants
don't want criticism they don't want to be humiliated so
the outlaw comedy right so you would expect the same
sort of stuff in a small tyranny of this cult
and that's exactly how it works the cult seeks to
monopolize the truth so even if it does glimpse the
truth through some meditation technique or through a mystical experience
on psychedelics the problem is that if the ego is
not fully transcended the ego will want to seize on
that truth monopolize that truth package the truth make the
truth its own make the truth exclusive to itself the
truth is not something Universal that everyone can access the
truth is something that I have accessed that now I
need to deliver to you now I can sell it
to you because I have the truth and do you
think for example that someone in a cult like in
a Christian cult or Islamic cult if they actually have
a mystical experience how are they gonna interpret that are
they gonna interpret that as a universal truth that applies
to everyone that everyone can access through different means and
different perspectives and their different ways of interpreting this no
of course not they're gonna interpret it as a validation
of whatever ideology and doctrine they had so when a
Muslim experience you know fundamentalist Muslim experiences some mystical experience
that's gonna be Allah the validation that that Allah is
true that is that Islam is the one true faith
and that all others are delusion that's how he's gonna
interpret it and what a Christian has a mystical experience
he's gonna interpret that as the light of of the
Christian God the one in the Bible is gonna be
Jesus it's gonna be an angel or something like this
and in his mind that's gonna justify demonizing all the
other religions Buddhism and Christian action but Judaism and Islam
as being the false ones see so in this way
the ego misinterprets valid mystical insights and visions in a
cult because they have this sense of benevolent self righteous
purpose this will be used to justify any means towards
reaching their ends and they will have no ethical qualms
or standards so in a cult lying cheating stealing violence
blackmail rape even murder becomes acceptable for the greater good
of the mission of the cult because our mission is
the best mission there is and we're actually gonna save
mankind so what does it matter if we if we
steal some some money here or we cheat somebody there
or we even blackmail this person here we even rape
this or murder that person there it doesn't matter in
the grand scheme of things according to how the cult
thinks the cult believes themselves to be above the law
oftentimes a cult will have apocalyptic overtones in order to
help motivate action there will be this sense of impending
doom the world is ending capitalism is collapsing the environment
is collapsing it's all unstable come join our cults come
work for us because it's gonna happen in the next
three to five years why three to five years because
that's the perfect timeframe because if it's gonna in one
year that's too soon people will catch on that it's
not actually gonna pan out but you know if I
say 10 or 20 years that's that's your mind can't
deal with those time frames it's not relevance I gotta
motivate you so to motivate you I say three to
five years is when the apocalypse will come now what
happens if you're in my cult four or five years
and the apocalypse doesn't come that's only better because look
how I'll all spin this cults use all sorts of
spin and reframing techniques so let's say you come to
me and say hey Leo where's the apocalypse it's been
five years it's not here and what I'll tell you
is of course it's not here because you guys have
been working so hard for five years you've been recruiting
more people and you've been meditating so hard you've been
visualizing and you're really serious your intention is pure for
saving mankind and awakening the world and it's because of
that that we have been granted five more years to
recruit more people in five more years who recruit so
many people that actually our cult will make a difference
in the world so it's your hard work that has
bought us these extra five years that's how it's reframed
and that just makes you buy into it even more
all the errors of prophecy only make the true believers
even stronger true believers through this kind of the spin
doctoring cults will use sophisticated and subtle psychological mind-control techniques
and a lot of times what makes this tricky is
because these techniques can be legitimate spiritual techniques a lot
of these techniques I have episodes about and I tell
you that you should do them for example chanting mantra
prayer affirmations singing meditation visualization hyperventilation fasting sensory deprivation these
sorts of techniques these are powerful techniques these are legitimate
techniques that can be used to improve your life to
attain enlightenment and so forth but they can also be
bastardized and misused for example I could have you visualize
how good our cult is and how divine our purpose
is and let's say I get you to do something
unethical and shady for example I tell you to go
rob that people's house over there rob those people's houses
and get more money for our cult and you go
and do that but then you start to feel bad
about it of course because you have a conscience and
you feel guilty so you come to me as the
leader and you say well leo but I feel bad
I think we're doing something wrong here we're violating some
ethical standards maybe maybe we're not as good as we
think we are and I will say no that's just
a psychological and spiritual weakness within you see you haven't
finished your self-development work what you need to do is
you need to take this visualization technique that I've been
telling you about and you need to go visualize how
actually this theft that you've been doing this is actually
all in the greater good of our purpose yes you
might be harming a person here there but in the
larger scheme of things none of that matters because we're
gonna awaken all of society if we just keep going
down this direction so go visualize that see go do
some mantra and some affirmations about that hyperventilation that's the
common techniques that cults use otherwise known as shamanic breathing
I have an episode about shamanic breathing well you know
that can be misused in order to then program you
with all sorts of doctrine which will perpetuate the cult
you see that's what that's what it means for the
cult to be all about its own survival is that
really everything the cult is doing all of its work
all of its activity all of its ideas will be
designed first and foremost not to reach the truth not
to really awaken you not to really save mankind but
to save itself and that's selfishness 101 everything you do
is really for your own survival but then you rationalize
it in your mind as being something loftier than that
that's the self-deception often times the cult will appeal to
very low consciousness emotions within you in order to motivate
you and manipulate you this is very characteristic of cults
and the top emotions that they will try to appeal
to is fear guilt and shame they're not going to
appeal to your to your highest consciousness emotions they're gonna
try to fear and guilt you into doing what needs
to be done oftentimes they will use the technique of
public confession of sins where we all get up in
a circle and I ask you all to be honest
and to confess your sins and of course you do
it because everyone else is standing up and doing it
it's just conformity and then you maybe confess a sin
from from your past or maybe you had sex with
someone you shouldn't have or maybe you were abused when
you were a child or maybe you did some drugs
that you're embarrassed about telling your family about but as
you're confessing all that of course I have a tape
recorder secretly under the table I'm recording a whole conversation
I have video cameras I'm videotaping the whole thing I'm
gonna put all that all these into my library of
blackmail material which I will use against you if you
ever decide to leave the cult or if you ever
question me or if you ever refuse to give us
a donation you know the yearly donation that your do
you refuse to give it well hey you know maybe
your parents will find out about that bad stuff you
did maybe somehow this this audio tape will end up
in their email see that's how that's why it's so
sneaky that's what makeup makes cults differ from traditional organizations
traditional organizations would never do that but in the cults
mind that's all totally acceptable because the mission of the
cult is so noble a cult will try to destroy
your self-esteem that's one of the ways how we get
you to be emotionally dependent on the cult we robbed
you of your self-esteem we make you feel bad we
make you feel like you won't be able to survive
without us that you need us very common techniques that
cults use is gaslighting where they will actually blame the
members for the sins of the cults so for example
if the cult gets public criticism in the media or
something like that and then maybe maybe you come to
me and say leo we're getting we're getting bad publicity
and the media bla bla bla bla bla I'm rather
than admitting that yeah maybe you know maybe we do
deserve some criticism what we're gonna do is we're gonna
reframe all of that we're gonna Gaslight I'm gonna say
no it's actually the media who's the evil one or
it's one of the members we're gonna take a member
in the cult I'm gonna skate Goldman scapegoat them and
say look it's that guy it's it's it's Mary it's
because Mary hasn't been doing her job and she hasn't
been praying hard enough and she hasn't been faithful enough
and she hasn't been recruiting hard enough and she hasn't
doing been doing the marketing properly that now we had
an ex-member leave and now that member ratted us out
to the to the to the media and now we
have this problem on her hands so really it's Mary's
fault oftentimes a cult will train to suppress negative emotions
and feelings and train you to reject all criticism of
the cult so this is a deliberate indoctrination that happens
because this needs to happen otherwise you will be facing
criticism from the outside you too have tools for how
to deal with that how to kind of block it
off in your mind to keep your bubble of delusion
going a lot of times cults will give you techniques
for suppressing negative thoughts for example if you have a
critical thought of the leader the leader will tell you
look you're just not doing your spiritual work hard enough
because if you were truly spiritual you wouldn't have negative
thoughts so go do that mantra and remove all the
negative thoughts and feelings that you have this feeling of
guilt that you feel for robbing that person over there
that's just a lack of your spiritual development go do
some more techniques cults try to enforce extreme conformity and
one of the ways they do that is everything is
done together as a group we eat together we meditate
together we sing together we do mantras together we recruit
together everything together to the point where some cults will
actually force you to be with a partner I don't
mean sexually I just mean with a partner like 24/7
you sleep in the same room you eat in the
same room you go out together you go make food
together you go shopping together like all of that so
that you're always under the watchful eye of somebody who
then can recruit you know report back to the higher-ups
also conformity is a reinforced through praise and Punishment so
really it's kind of like training a dog that's how
they'll train you as soon as you stand up and
you question their dogma or their doctrines or their activities
they will punish you and they will withdraw their love
from you and then as soon as you do something
in conformity that they like that serves their survival agenda
then they will praise you and then that becomes how
they hook you often times cults will have indoctrination camps
and training camps and often times these will be held
in faraway places isolated from your social network and environment
so oftentimes they will do a a retreat up in
the mountains where it's cold and far away or in
the desert in the middle of desert or you don't
have a cellphone access you can't call your friends or
your parents you're outside of your environment and you know
spending a few weeks there they can really brainwash you
such that then when you come back you're you're gonna
have a new sense of identity and you're not gonna
be connected to your social network anymore because your social
network and your old environment is really what keeps you
grounded in what you call reality so if we want
to brainwash you and create a new sense of reality
this fantasy bubble we need to snip all those cords
that attach you to your old reality and your old
identity and a lot of times that's done for example
by asking you to change your name change the way
you dress change what you eat change what time you
wake up change all this stuff and through this we're
gonna create a new fake identity for you that serves
the cult another very common technique in cults is that
they keep very tight schedule you kept too busy to
think or ask questions you're literally engaged activity from morning
to sunset you don't really have time to truly meditate
truly self reflect or to read a book or to
consider an alternative perspective or to really question what you're
doing because it's just like it's all cylinders firing full
steam ahead to prevent the apocalypse sort of mentality another
trick that they will use is they will make you
recruit other members and in doing so that helps your
mind to convince itself that what you're doing is good
because in order to recruit somebody you have to become
a true believer in the stuff that you're preaching it's
a very sneaky self-deception mechanism you know why people proselytize
so passionately it's because they themselves actually don't believe deep
down the thing that they're preaching they themselves are doubtful
about it they themselves have not actually done the work
to embody it so instead what they do is they
externalize the spiritual journey to proselytize others without actually having
themselves attained the spiritual fruits that they're supposed to attain
it's a it's just a red herring cults will teach
you to ignore your inner hearts and inner voice because
those are an obstacle to living in the fantasy bubble
they will teach you to stop paying attention to your
perceptions which is which is very disastrous because if you
think about it perceptions are the only thing that grounds
you to reality if not for your perceptions you really
have nothing but fantasies and concepts and beliefs but that's
exactly what they want to Santa sees concepts and beliefs
not perceptions so unlike in true spirituality where we actually
do the opposite we try to get you to pay
hyper attention to your perceptions that's really the point of
meditation is to ground yourself purely in perception without any
interpretation filtration concepts beliefs or doctrines ground yourself in actuality
remember my episode what is actuality that's what that episode
try to do but a cult will do the opposite
they will try to get you to deny perceptions and
ignore them in order for the doctrine to really run
your whole life common tactic they'll use when recruiting is
called love-bombing they will shower you with love and praise
and approval they will tell you how nice your smile
is how nice your clothes are how wonderful of a
human being you are and how much amazing stuff you've
done in your life and they'll be really interested in
you they'll listen to you but only for like the
first few weeks for the first month during the honeymoon
period in order to reel you in and then once
you're hooked and reeled in then they get to work
on you and they suck you dry and they have
used you and they manipulate you and the love stops
but for that first month during the honeymoon period it
will feel like oh my god for the first time
I'm I'm fully accepted by this group of people unlike
my old family no because chances are you had a
mother or father or a brother or sister that didn't
accept you that bullied you that criticized you and so
that that hurts that hurts and you're still living with
those wounds so now when you come into a community
that love bombs you all you're so susceptible to that
but it never lasts because they don't really love you
they're just manipulating you to serve their ego the ego
is not capable of love the only thing the devil
loves is really himself and even that he can't really
fully do he loves himself in a neurotic sort of
way fellow members in your cult will be in denial
that this is a cult so in a sense talking
to a cult member using the word cult as if
like I could say to a friend let's say I
have a friend who joined a cult now say look
dude you're in a cult that's not gonna work because
in his mind he doesn't think of it as him
having joined a cult he's part of a religious organization
or he's he's saving mankind or he's pursuing enlightenment or
he's you know he's doing something he's part of a
business scheme but he's not in a cult no member
of a cult thinks of themselves as being in a
cult they're in denial about it of course they are
oftentimes you will be asked to live in group housing
this group housing will have cameras and microphones in it
to get nice juicy blackmail material on you and also
while you're in this group housing they can monitor you
very easily to see if you're conforming oftentimes cults will
force you to do long hours of grueling work without
pay or with very little pay because they want you
dependent and to the point where you can be working
14 16 hours a day seven days a week you
know pulling in 80-hour workweeks for this cult destroying your
own health driving yourself crazy thinking that you're doing something
very important for the mission of this organization when really
is just a way to explore you to get what
they need done without having to actually pay people to
do it a common red flag and cults is loose
and careless polyamory and multiple wives if you see the
cult leader adopting multiple girlfriends multiple wives that's a huge
red flag right there that you need to leave that
organization that never goes well and you can clearly see
that they're doing it for egotistical purposes even though of
course they're gonna rationalize it all as part of spiritual
awakening and all of this but that's just all more
self-deception oftentimes a cult will use physical abuse and threats
of violence if you don't do what they say or
if you try to leave they have very irresponsible leadership
the cult leader usually has a shady background he has
a criminal record in the past he's a liar he's
a thief he's a con artist he's a phony he's
a rapist he he was kicked out of a other
cult or another organization he was kicked out of the
country this kind of stuff so research the backgrounds of
the people that you're following oftentimes almost always these cults
charge exorbitant membership fees where they have some kind of
tiered system of courses seminars books workshops trainings that you
need to pay thousands of dollars sometimes tens of thousands
of dollars just like these ridiculous fees in order to
join this cult and to be part of this cult
I think I was reading a book about Scientology and
in that book it said some amazing figure like do
you know what it costs to go through all the
different levels of achievement in the in the in the
hierarchy of Scientology like they become the highest level of
Scientologists I think you have to spend like four hundred
thousand dollars if you add up all the courses all
the seminars all the trainings all the workshops all the
books all the manuals all that stuff all of it
it's like four hundred thousand dollars to get to the
top that's that's how they get you and believe it
or not slowly you know it's kind of like boiling
a frog in water you know if you do it
slowly enough then you sucker people in nobody's stupid enough
to pay four hundred thousand dollars up front but they
will sucker you in and they will leech you of
all your money and not just your money but even
your assets anything valuable you own paintings computers cars houses
you know whatever they will get that from you of
course the cult will try to manipulate your relationships with
your friends and family that's another dead giveaway that you're
inside of a cult you know in a legitimate organization
they won't try to manipulate your relationship with friends and
family they won't tell you what to think about your
friends and your family they won't ask you to disown
your friends and your family on ideological grounds so watch
out for that a lot of times your friends and
family will be demonized as the unawakened ones the ones
who don't understand us and therefore you shouldn't call them
shouldn't talk to them you shouldn't see them anymore because
they just they're not awoke enough to understand our lofty
mission and our purpose and they they're just gonna drag
you back down to your old bad sinful ways oftentimes
the cult will ask you to quit your career or
education to join them that makes you very dependent that
makes sure that you don't have any other alternative routes
in life and that can be especially bad for for
young people make sure you finish your education and get
a solid career going so that you have financial independence
and you have a sense of self-efficacy that you can
you can pay your own bills in the world so
you're not dependent on others then you're much less likely
to be manipulated and controlled cults engage of course at
information control which all tyrants and dictators must do to
maintain this reality bubble this reality distortion bubble they try
to prevent exposure to new perspectives books videos the internet
news telephones this sort of stuff they want to try
to get you to force to be forced to rely
on the cult for all of your key information of
course inside of a cult very little time is actually
spent on true spiritual work because all of your attention
is externalized outwards cults will try to control who you
can date and marry they will try to control your
children if they can they will try to of course
indoctrinate your children because that's a really great way to
hook in parents is indoctrinating the children a dead giveaway
that you're inside of a cult is if they don't
give you freedom to leave the organization if they physically
try to coerce you to stay if they try to
brainwash you that leaving is bad and sinful and wrong
often times is exactly what a cult will do is
they will subtly plant seeds in your mind plant little
phobias that then blossom into larger phobias that if you
leave the cult you're never gonna be happy you're never
gonna find love you're never gonna awaken you're never gonna
get enlightenment you're never gonna be spiritual are never gonna
find a life purpose you're never gonna be able to
support yourself or to to overcome your addictions and bad
habits you're never gonna be able to progress in life
you'll be depressed and suicidal and eventually your whole life
will collapse cults will program that into you such that
you never want to leave and that if you even
think about leaving already there's so much pain thinking about
all the repercussions they programmed you with that you don't
even consider it a a real possibility such that even
though the door might be open you or you're free
to walk out but it doesn't even occur to you
to walk out because how much fear and guilt and
bad Association they have programmed you with about leaving cults
discourage health fitness good diet and proper medical care so
oftentimes cults will suck people dry they will make them
work long hours without break for weeks and months and
years on end until they run themselves down and then
of course as soon as you become a liability to
the cult by developing a health problem maybe let's say
you you break your leg while working for this cult
are they gonna care for you are they gonna provide
you with medical care are they gonna give you time
to rest in all of this no of course not
they're probably gonna kick you out of the cult because
now you're a liability caring for you paying for doctors
fees you know tending to you while you're while you're
hurt and suffering and ill they don't want that because
they're so selfish so of course they kick you out
as soon as you become a liability you should be
so lucky you'd be lucky in that case because at
least then you leave very commonly they would demonize and
harass ex-members that's not their very common dead giveaway that
you're in a cult they need to because the ex
members will usually try to expose the inner workings of
the cult to the outside public which of course is
terrible for recruiting which of course they need in order
to sustain the whole pyramid scheme so they will try
to demonize and use blackmail to harass these ex members
and of course cults will spend a lot of time
manipulating their public self-image with massive PR campaigns to try
to dis inform the public that their image really is
just good and innocent so you got to watch out
for that and of course if you're inside the cult
and you're probably gonna spending a lot of your time
working on these massive PR campaigns so that's the general
list of characteristics of a cult there now as you
can see it's not enough that an organization just exhibits
one or two of these characteristics that won't make it
a cult you need a combination you know a significant
number of these on the list is what really determines
if the group is a cult or not because any
general organization will have a little bit of some of
this stuff going on for example they might have your
responsible leadership or they might force you to work long
hours but you know just because your boss forced you
to work long hours doesn't mean you're inside a cult
necessarily also what I want you to see here kind
of zooming out a little bit the bigger picture is
what's happening with what this cult is doing all these
four tactics is that this is a massive collective ego
and a collective shadow at work see my episode about
collective ego to understand what that really means but there's
also sort of like I could have a shadow here
like I said you're gradually boiled alive like a frog
you don't know that you're really getting sucked into any
of this stuff until you're really deep in it and
it's kind of too late you're probably gonna be a
few years into the cult before you realize that maybe
I joined a cult and even then you're gonna be
in denial about it and as you can see here
all of these techniques this is the epitome of how
devilry works this is the epitome of what the ego
does it's blind self-preservation you should be familiar with many
of these methods and slights of hand already because I've
covered them so much in the past and many of
my epistemology episodes so what do you do if you
find yourself in one of these cults maybe you're in
one right now how do you get out first of
all what I recommend is that you educate yourself you
need to read some books about cults and how they
work and how to escape and there are many great
books available I'll be adding three new ones to my
book list already have one there I'll be adding three
more new ones with a lot of great information written
by authors who themselves were ex cult members and who
escaped and who now work to help other people escape
and they they offer a lot of great advice so
I'll be adding that to my book list in the
next week or two so look out for that read
those books or find other books if you like whatever
just to educate yourself because even though the information I
provided here is quite good it's not enough if you
yourself are actually in a cult you need you need
to really understand the phenomena that you're dealing with also
as you're reading these books you're gonna realize that there
are many recovery options available to you there are people
you could call their accounts lers or trained cult deprogramming
experts who could help you to understand and how to
take back your life take back your old identity also
research your cult if your cult is on large side
it probably has X members that you could contact you
can talk about you could share your stories with you
can get advice about you can get some solidarity there
but of course if you're in a very small cult
then it'll be difficult for you to research your specific
cult if you're in a small cult your cult probably
doesn't have a Wikipedia page probably doesn't have documentaries and
books written about it but many other cults do like
various strands of Mormonism Scientology the Moonies and so forth
there have been many books written about how those organizations
work how manipulative they are and you could find ex
members who you can get some solidarity with so try
to do some of that research next make sure you
actually admit to yourself explicitly that I am in a
cult that's very important because otherwise you're still gonna be
in denial about it after doing the research admit to
yourself okay now I'm sure that I'm in a cult
and as soon as you say that then now you
know you're gonna have to leave that's not a sustainable
situation don't think that you can just like somehow make
this work I'll I could just I could just suck
it up and and just kind of keep going with
it it'll all work out no it's not gonna work
out you got to leave the sooner the better just
leave yes there will be some cost and pain associated
with that just leave but even before you do that
make sure that you forgive yourself for having joined this
cult don't lay on the guilt don't tell yourself how
how can I've been so stupid for joining this cult
why why was that why more self conscious and self
aware and why didn't I understand epistemology hid this is
very common it's very common for people get too sucked
into this kind of stuff you just weren't properly educated
and that's okay because our education system is very dysfunctional
right now we're still developing our education system so that's
totally understandable love yourself love yourself for who you are
for who you were for the good that's inside of
you all right don't let them rob you of your
self-esteem remember to listen to your heart and to start
to think independently research stuff for yourself ground yourself back
in your perceptions and in your Higher Self and your
inner voice spend time alone thinking and self reflecting as
much as you can try to reclaim your old identity
go back to the old name you were using go
back to your old style of dress your old way
of speaking go back to your old friends at least
for now now of course your old identity wasn't really
your true identity anyways all of these identities whether your
old one or the new one that you got in
the cult it's all fake ego identity anyways but at
least the old one was more healthy than this cult
one that they try to program you with that one
is really fake that one was just designed to serve
them so reclaim your old identity then you can go
back and work and improve that old identity of course
just leave walk out and leave oftentimes it's just as
simple as walking out and leaving getting into a car
just leaving change cities change states change countries you know
whatever you got to do to leave cut it off
cold turkey cut off all your relationships with people in
that cult your friends even if you have family members
that are cut it off at least until you can
get back on your own feet and remember nothing bad
will happen to you for leaving I mean not inherently
I mean the cult could be after you for whatever
reasons but nothing bad like you're not gonna be depressed
or suicide or any this kind of nonsense that they
programmed you with in fact by leaving you are gonna
be restarting your life this is the most optimistic and
hopeful thing you can do and really by leaving now
you finally have a foundation upon which you can do
real personal development and spirituality on your own independently of
any cult and really when you get it to true
spirituality and true personal development on your own the way
that I talk about with all of my content on
actualised org and you sort of do some of these
techniques for real not as part of a cult then
you see the power of it and you see how
much you can transform your own life and that gives
you a sense of hope and optimism so that whatever
issues you had before any kind of childhood traumas addiction
problems self-esteem issues maybe didn't like how you looked you
didn't like how your family treated you you didn't have
friends or you couldn't find someone to to lob or
have sex with all of those issues can be addressed
your financial insecurities those can be addressed your sense of
life purpose you can create a beautiful sense of life
purpose for yourself all of this can be done without
a cult and you'll see you'll progress so much faster
and you'll feel so much better doing it on your
own which is sort of what I teach with actualize
that work so cheer up about that and what I
recommend you do is also some self esteem exercises because
chances are if you've been in a cult that had
you have a low self-esteem and you need to work
on that I recommend doing Nathaniel Brandon's self esteem sentence
completion exercises you can find those in his books or
in his courses so go check that out do some
of those for a year or two that will help
to get you back on your feet and lastly what
I recommend is that you make a serious study now
after having left the cult of epistemology and metaphysics in
the way that I teach it which is not as
a Dogma or as an ideology but rather it's becoming
more conscious of the self-deception mechanisms of the mind becoming
conscious of how ideology works how happens it belief work
how paradigms work and just what reality is you start
questioning reality you start self inquiring you question everything you
question all of your beliefs you have no sacred beliefs
until all of it is questioned away and then eventually
you purify yourself through this process and that's how you
truly free yourself that's how you truly become happy and
in that process you will also deprogram all of your
cult brainwashing you both have cult brainwashing in your mind
and you also have mainstream cultural programming that brainwashed you
as well and you're gonna have to deprogram both of
those things we'll talk more about the second one in
part two so next week we're going to be looking
at part to the broader epistemic lessons we want to
take a look at all the stuff we talked about
here that we see in cults and we're gonna start
to notice how all of that also exists everywhere in
society and that will be really exciting that's really the
whole point of this miniseries is to talk about part
two like I said I will be adding those three
cult books to my book list soon so check those
out those are great very eye-opening lots of interesting antidotes
and stories and and more detailed explanations of how sneaky
these mind-control techniques of cults really are and how dangerous
they can be in many case studies of how lives
were destroyed and also how people escaped successfully and how
they deprogram themselves successfully and the last thing I'll say
is just kind of a warning that right now in
the 21st century we're entering a new era the Internet
age the social media age were actually I predict a
rise in cult activity over the next 50 years because
there's still so many easy ways to exploit search engines
social media Wikipedia pages in order to draw people in
also YouTube a lot of cults these days are getting
started on YouTube so watch out watch out who you're
following what kind of people you're listening to be very
careful there's a lot of movements now which are pseudo
cult-like the alt-right red pill this insel phenomenon with Jordan
Peterson some of the people that follow sam harris is
kind of new atheism stuff like there's a lot of
very dogmatic stuff which poses itself as not dogma of
course which which the devil always does so be very
very careful and also watch out for those self development
teachers that you're following any spiritual teachers that you're following
really assess them carefully can be careful with these online
forums that you can get into these social media rabbit
holes these 4chan rabbit holes and these reddit rabbit holes
you can go down because this is how cults will
be started in the 21st century online not probably through
a brick and mortar front organization but through an online
sort of front organization so be careful and now of
course I have to address the issue of but Leo
isn't actualized org a cult well take a look take
a look at all of my work and see how
does it stack up against this list of characteristics that
I talked about with cults what you should see is
that from the very beginning I place a very strong
emphasis on epistemology I placed a very strong emphasis on
trying to go deep with you into the mechanics of
how belief systems work and the dangers of that the
dangers of ideology the dangers of collective ego the dangers
of paradigm lock I've even criticized academia and mainstream science
for having cult-like qualities that's how strict my standards are
from the very beginning I knew that actualize that org
could easily be turned into a cult and that's precisely
what I did not want because I know that that's
the minds default tendency and I have to be very
hawk-like to watch myself such that I don't become a
cult leader you know if I wanted to I could
easily turn actualize that org into a cult I could
create a whole pyramid structure with myself at the top
I can get so much more money I could make
millions of dollars I could create my own compound I
could recruit people I can recruit lieutenants I could get
multiple wives all this stuff would be so easy for
me to do at this point and yet I spend
a lot of my time shooting videos talking about basically
how to help you to avoid doing that and even
though I'm playing my part you also have to play
your part because even though I don't want actualize I
don't de turn into a cult you in the way
that you handle this material in the way that you
philosophize about it and mentally masturbate about it and trying
to turn these ideas into into some sort of doctrine
or religion you could easily turn it into a cult
and I don't want that and that would really go
against all of my teachings so I'm actually very deliberate
not to create a hierarchical organization out of actualized org
now sure we have a forum but no one's forcing
you to be there it's a very loose organization structure
you know I've actually I've had many opportunities over the
last five years of running actualized at org to really
ramp up my business ramped up my marketing hire people
hire a PR person hire a business development person hire
salespeople you know I could have easily done that I
deliberately didn't and that has cost me hundreds of thousands
if not millions of dollars by this point I could
have easily created expensive courses a whole series of expensive
courses to to suck you in and charge you tens
of thousands of dollars in the end I could have
easily done all that so so there you go I
hope you appreciate that of course I have no desire
to do it so I'm not just doing it because
because I shouldn't I just don't have a desire to
do it hmm and you know it was funny when
I was like younger when I was like 15 years
old or something like that I was really into philosophy
but I was against religion and one of the things
that like one of my worst nightmares was like oh
whatever what if I ever become one of these people
who starts a religion and in my mind I'd be
like now religion is so stupid I would never do
that and then and then now after a various enlightenment
and mystical experiences that I've had now basically like I'm
looking at actualize I don't I'm like yup this is
basically a religion this is how religion starts you see
people to understand about how religion starts is that no
religion starts as some fundamentalist rabid crazy doctrine of ideas
that you need to believe in some supernatural weird outlandish
stuff that's not how religion ever starts it always starts
with genuine insights about the nature of mankind and life
and how to be happy and how to relate to
other people how to be more conscious and how to
understand what reality is it always starts that way but
of course that's not what we call a religion so
what you see with actualize that already is really the
kernel that was there in every single religion in Judaism
in Islam and Christianity in Buddhism in Hinduism in yoga
and Sikhism and anything else like that every major strand
of religion it all started like this but then after
hundreds of years thousands of years a lot of corruption
a lot of ego individual ego collective ego it all
devolved and ossified into dogma and ideology and that's precisely
how it works and so I sort of expect the
same thing to happen with actualize that org at some
point it's just a question of like will I ever
become famous and well-known enough for that to actually happen
or I'll just be forgotten in the annals of history
it would actually be better almost if I was forgotten
because otherwise if if actually that org becomes too successful
after I'm long dead people will turn this into a
cult and into a religion like it's guaranteed to happen
which is precisely why I'm spending so much time trying
to inoculate people against doing that but even though I'm
saying all this it will still happen see that's the
crazy thing about it it's not enough to say it
because these words they fall on deaf ears to an
ideologue because really you have to be at a certain
level of development and consciousness in order to be able
to actualize and embody these teachings in a way that's
not cult-like because if you have too much ego and
too little development and too little consciousness you will inevitably
no matter what I say turn all these ideas into
mental masturbation and just fuel for the ego your ego
we'll we'll weaponize all this so watch out alright that's
it I'm done here please click that like button for
me and come check out actualize that org that's my
website you'll find my blog on there you'll find a
life purpose course you'll find the book list with some
of those cult ebooks I'll be adding soon there's one
already there and and come check out the forum where
you can get some help if you're stuck in a
cult come on the forum explain your situation we might
help you out and give you some emotional support and
advice and the last final thing that I'll say is
I hope you appreciate the rarity of listening to actualize
that org now I know that sounds very self-serving and
egotistical but that's not what I mean what I mean
is I mean the following specific thing I know people
in my life who are close to me friends and
family members who know about actualize that org who know
that there's hundreds of hours of video about advanced stuff
on here but nevertheless they're too lazy to just click
the play button and to even listen to a couple
hours of it let alone two three hundred hours of
it it's very rare that somebody finds actualised org in
the first place it's rarer still that they find it
and then stick around long enough to actually watch a
good two to three hundred hours of it's such that
you really start to see the big picture that's how
long it takes you're not gonna understand all of life
and how everything interconnects and how to become happy and
how to find your life purpose and how to avoid
all the psychological and and egotistical traps that exist in
just a couple of hours or in a couple of
five-minute videos it's never gonna happen this is a very
deep and broad area of study you could have an
entire ph.d program on this thing where you study this
stuff for ten years I mean I basically have been
studying this stuff for 10 years now and I still
feel like I'm ignorant and have much to learn and
if I think about where I was five years ago
when I started this this whole thing I was just
totally it's it's cringe-worthy how ignorant I was so my
point is that if you found this resource make sure
you actually utilize the resource which means you actually have
to watch the episodes and take notes on them and
kind of piece it together in your own mind it
all starts there I'm not even talking about right now
taking a bunch of action going to a bunch of
meditation retreats and doing a bunch of psychedelics before you
even get there most people will never even get there
because they haven't just watched 200 hours of the content
such that they can see how it all interconnects and
why they should be doing all that stuff if you're
struggling with installing a meditation habit or eating healthy or
finding a life purpose or or whatever the reason that
is because you don't yet understand the significance of the
things that are being taught here it's way more significant
than you ever possibly imagined or conceived asking 200 hours
of you is not too much really it's just like
the bare minimum in my mind think of how many
years you've spent in school learning math learning English learning
history you spent 12 years basically doing each of those
three things in school and never once did you say
or raise your hand in the class and say well
isn't this a waste of time should we really be
spending thousands of hours learning math and English in history
but now all the sudden when you come actualize that
organ now you're being you know your mind is being
blasted with all this psychological and metaphysical and epistemic stuff
and it's complicated is it's nuanced and it's all interconnected
and it's kind of messy and it connects with your
own personal life so now when you're learning all this
practical psychology which of course they never taught you in
school or in university now that you're learning all this
now all the sudden you help with the objection is
like well Leah but a hundred hours 200 hours that's
a that's a waste of time this is philosophy man
that's mental masturbation dude it took you 12 years to
learn how to do [ __ ] math and you
still suck at it how many hours how many thousands
of hours do you think it's gonna take you to
master the things that I'm talking about here to master
your entire life your psychology your motivation your emotions your
how you relate to other human beings your life purpose
financial independence understanding what the hell is going on here
in life do you think you're gonna do that in
a hundred hours no way forget it never never ever
ever all you will do 100 hours is delude yourself
with half knowledge half truths and then you can go
start a cult you need to delude other people so
you need to appreciate the the importance and the depth
of this work and you need to apply care and
time and energy to it this is serious work this
is not some ten minute YouTube video about some obscure
quantum mechanical topic or some psychological factoid here or there
some some stupid video like that there's tons of these
kinds of videos on YouTube you can watch as many
of those you want and they're addictive and maybe they're
fun and maybe if you feel like you're you're getting
somewhere watching those but you're not you're not really understanding
what's going on you're not understanding what life is you're
not understanding how to really master yourself now of course
actualizing is not the only resource you should use there
are other good channels out there that teach you self-improvement
and spirituality so by no means am i trying to
monopolize these insights here but but by and large most
videos you're watching are not serious most of the books
you're reading you're not serious they don't really have a
grasp of what's going on at the big picture level
of life and even if they're giving you some self-improvement
tips here and there it's all surface level mostly it's
not really gonna change your life it's not really gonna
address the issue of your depression of your ennui of
your um your sense of lack of direction your your
your lack of satisfaction with life these are very deep
issues you're in authenticity your inability to be authentic around
other people these are very deep issues that require that
you go beyond the psychological level beyond self-help and to
the metaphysical level to the epistemic level so that's why
my videos are so long of course it's also very
convenient excuse I do also love to I hear myself
talk so that's also why they're long so don't feel
bad about spending time watching these videos these videos are
way out of the matrix they are part of the
matrix but they are the part that will help you
to break out of the matrix and before you can
break out of the matrix first you got to learn
about how the matrix works and you're not gonna learn
how the matrix works in just a couple of hours
it takes 200 hours or even more why is that
because the matrix is very complex there are so many
traps so many ways to deceive yourself so spend some
time educating yourself you know education is the key to
your to your ultimate liberation stay tuned with me over
the next year I have a lot of deep topics
yet planned that have not been talked about in 2019
I plan to talk about very fundamental topics we're gonna
talk about evolution we're gonna talk about science we're going
to talk about emotions there's so much more I need
to say about emotions about fear about anger about we're
talking about survival we're talking about self bias we're talking
about self justification we're gonna talk about how brains work
and neuroscientist of that hasn't been covered yet so I
hope you're excited about that listen to this content make
use of it because man I'm blown away I'm blown
away that friends of mine who know about this stuff
they're just too lazy to watch it and I can
see that they're struggling it's like they're trying to understand
all this stuff but slike do just watch to hundreds
of videos psych no I don't want to do that
that's too long well well good luck with your life
then good luck with your life alright that's it I'm
out you
