[Music] welcome to understanding duality part three existential dualities finally
we've reached the end of our list we've reached the
most important part after part 1 and part 2 which
I assume you watched go watch those if you haven't
now we're ready to really dig into the most important
stuff and we're gonna jump right in this is the
realm of metaphysics and spirituality this is the most important
stuff that you need to understand in order to understand
all of life how humanity works and what reality is
and really you also need to understand this to have
a proper understanding of the foundations of science we're gonna
be talking a lot about absolutes here and transcending relative
into absolute and so try to keep an open mind
and try to stay with me because we are going
to be talking about things which are very paradoxical and
counterintuitive and now we're going beyond what the ordinary human
mind is capable of understanding and yet at the same
time you can still understand it but you need to
approach it from higher realms of consciousness so let's begin
first on our list is the duality between subjective and
objective or subject and object this is a very tricky
duality that is at the very heart of science and
materialist metaphysics and just the conventional dualistic way of seeing
the world so conventionally we're born and then we start
to think like well there's me and there's the rest
of the world I am the subject the rest of
the world is the object and I can have my
own subjective personal experiences but then there's like objective facts
the objective universe out there which is separate from me
the subject and then let's go about doing science and
then when we start doing science of course we run
into this problem of like well is is this evidence
that we have for some scientific theory is this evidence
subjective evidence or is it objective evidence and then of
course within science we like to privileged the objective over
the subjective somehow if it's a subjective piece of evidence
than somehow that's not really true or valid because it
must be objective of course not realizing that all objective
evidence or any notion of objectivity whatsoever that you might
have and any objective objects even you know take a
physical object like a chair or a table it is
only accessible to you as a subjective experience and so
ultimately if you want to get technical the only thing
that there is is subjective experience there's no such thing
as objectivity in the way that science or mainstream culture
holds it as so in fact objectivity is couched within
subjectivity in this sense this makes the entire enterprise of
acquiring knowledge and figuring out how reality works very very
tricky and very counterintuitive and twisted in unexpected ways so
for example a hundred years ago with the development of
quantum mechanics what good physicists realized the ones who were
actually working on quantum mechanics and had an open mind
and who were visionaries people like Niels Bohr and Schrodinger
Einstein plunk and others what they realized is that wait
a minute the way we were doing physics before and
science as a whole before where we were assuming that
our measurements of the universe can be separated from ourselves
and our instruments as if there's like a physical object
out there and I can just measure how long it
is using a ruler and it doesn't matter whether I'm
a human or what kind of instrumentation I'm using or
consciousness doesn't play any role to this know what they
discovered is it's all instrument intimately entangled and interconnected and
most people today a hundred years later still don't understand
most scientists today still don't understand just how radical quantum
mechanics is if you want to understand that more depth
go check out my multiple part series called quantum mechanics
debunks materialism where I go to a lot of depth
about the details of that it's a little tricky but
basically what they discovered is that when you're making a
measurement of a molecule or an atom or some some
type of particle the very fact that you're measuring it
itself affects the object that you're measuring such that you
can't even say that there's a you and an object
or a measuring device and an object there are literally
one it's all entangled and that was of course a
radical and very important discovery that still hasn't percolated through
mainstream culture people don't realize the significance but in particular
the metaphysical ramifications and the epidermal logical ramifications of this
discovery but the the but the hope folks who are
working on it they they understood it was extremely radical
extremely radical so what happens as you're going deeper into
personal development and ultimately spirituality is that you start to
realize that the line between subjects and objects literally starts
to disappear where once you thought it was unquestionable such
that literally a physical object that you're looking at a
table a car a cat or your parents somebody you
love another person a clerk at the grocery store you
look at them and you actually are so conscious now
beyond ordinary human consciousness you're now entering a non-dual state
of consciousness where you literally perceive that person's face or
that physical object as being not just an object but
also simultaneously a subject so in a sense every physical
object in the universe is self-illuminated self-knowing self-aware awareness is
not localized within a human being or a human brain
or within yourself awareness is omnipresent and it's literally everywhere
and everything such that you weren't looking at the table
you are the table now of course it might not
feel to you that way right now if you're only
beginning this journey that's because you haven't done enough concentration
work and you have shifted your state of consciousness enough
to realize this it's a very radical shift requires quite
a bit of concentration work to be able to access
it and so ultimately what you realize with spirituality and
the reason we call it spirituality at all and why
we call it spirit is that the entire universe is
one subject it's a subject of itself the subject and
object are one you can't split them apart and this
is quite counterintuitive because you might wonder well how could
there be a subject without an object or how can
there be an object than a subject well it turns
out it can you can transcend subject and object into
an absolute third kind like we talked about in parts
1 & 2 which is absolute subjectivity absolute subjectivity so
that's absolute with capital a subjectivity with a capital S
and when you realize that you realize holy everything is
spirit everything is God everything is a subject the subject
was never located inside of a body the subject was
the entire room the whole time everywhere you go is
the subject you are the subject there is only one
subject in the entire universe and that subject is God
that subject is looking through every being every human being
every animal every bacteria every sentient and non-sentient creature across
the entire universe and if there are multiple universes it's
looking through multiple universes there's only one subject and you
are that subject in this human form that you're in
right now and that's what you realize and there you
have transcended the subject and object with a lowercase s
and a lowercase o next on my list we have
the duality of of esoteric versus exoteric this relates to
how we understand religion so when we talk about religion
in common parlance mainstream parlance usually people when they hear
the word religion they think of exoteric forms of spirituality
which just means that it's sort of a materialistic externalized
version of spirituality where God is some bearded man sitting
up in the clouds there's an actual physical heaven you
can go to after you die there's a physical hell
there's a physical devil there's a physical good and evil
the Bible is inerrant and absolutely true and you must
read the Bible because it contains the truth all this
sort of stuff so it's a very externalized gross form
of spirituality and of course it turns a lot of
rationally minded people off because you have to be pretty
naive to literally believe in things like Noah's Ark and
certain other mythical type [Music] stories that you can read
in various kinds of holy books you have to be
pretty naive to take those literally but what people don't
realize that there's the esoteric version of spirituality or religion
which is actually the kernel that is responsible for the
existence of an exoteric so what people don't understand is
that you can't have an exoteric religion without an esoteric
one first and so that's how every religion began every
exoteric religion including Islam Christianity Judaism Buddhism Hinduism and so
forth they all began as esoteric esoteric means going inside
as Jesus said find the kingdom of heaven within that
means it's inside of you it's something you are God
is not out there in the clouds you are God
that's mysticism that's as esoteric but of course these two
are intimately connected together and so it's not so easy
to actually separate the esoteric from the exoteric and so
various kinds of pathologies result when people don't understand this
distinction and all so they're unable to to transcend it
and to realize that it's not like one is right
and the other is wrong it's just that you have
to you have to put the exoteric practices of religion
into proper context and so ultimately when you do transcend
the subjective objective duality that is present within exoteric religion
you discover esoteric with a capital e true religion religion
of the capital r and that religion looks almost nothing
like what you imagined religion to be all those negative
qualities that you attributed to religion like dogma and fundamentalism
and violence and bigotry and ethnocentrism and racism and tribalism
and versus them thinking and morality and all these sorts
of negative things that you attributed to religion of the
lowercase R you discover that a true religion is the
opposite of all those things and then you really discover
what people like Jesus or the Buddha or Muhammad taught
and it's the opposite of what you think they taught
and the only way you can realize that is by
actually transcending transcending these dualities next on the list is
the duality of metaphysics versus epistemology this is huge I've
posted some videos about this on my blog where I
talked about how a metaphysics and epistemology are connected it's
very important to understand if you're if you're doing any
kind of philosophy or intellectual activities if you're doing any
kind of serious science this is so crucial to understand
and yet nobody really understands it so what is the
relationship between metaphysics and epistemology as it turns out they're
deeply and intimately connected and so what you can realize
is that epistemology or the pursuit of knowledge is intimately
connected with being metaphysics is the question of being and
then if a small Jesus question of how do we
know anything well these are into connected as it turns
out you can't separate them at all the way that
Western philosophy tries to do sometimes and so what you
discover is that actually metaphysics is absolute and that it's
more fundamental than epistemology and so literally the distinction between
knowing and being gets transcended such that you discover being
with a capital B or metaphysics with capital m and
you discover that it's actually by being things that you're
able to know them at all there's a lot more
I could say about that but we have to keep
going because there's so many other items I need to
cover on this list but that's that's a super profile
that's a life-changing a career-changing insight if you have that
if you understand what I just said there but don't
think that you'll grasp it in just a few minutes
this dis of study and and practice to be able
to transcend the duality of metaphysics and epistemology into metaphysics
with capital Emma now when I know something I don't
just know it with the mind I actually become it
like physically so I don't just know a chair I
am the chair I don't just know God I am
God and of course so are you next on the
list is chaos versus order or disorder versus order oftentimes
these are pitted against each other and oftentimes religious people
they will put order up on a pedestal while demonizing
and devaluing chaos or disorder but actually these two are
just like the yin and the yang they're completely interrelated
and you can't have one without the other and so
you can transcend this duality to discover order with a
capital o everything in the universe is exquisitely ordered including
all the disorder and all the chaos you can't just
have order with a lowercase o that excludes disorder and
chaos you need to transcend that and realize that there's
a delicate interplay between the two for example one of
the most important scientific developments in Western science in the
last hundred years was a development of chaos theory and
chaos theory which I'm gonna have a vote on in
the future dedicated episode because a complex and advanced topic
what science has discovered in the 1960's and 1970's is
that there's like a whole new branch of science the
science of of complex nonlinear phenomena and what they discovered
is that in fact most phenomena that science studies is
chaotic and chaos doesn't mean complete randomness no no no
what chaos means is that actually there is a delicate
order but it's unpredictable even though it follows very strict
physical laws and rules and yet it's still chaotic and
some of the most interesting phenomena in the universe are
chaotic phenomena for example like like the way the human
brain works it's a chaotic system or the way that
weather patterns work it's a chaotic system and it's quite
difficult to predict and that allows it to be creative
and new and fresh and not just some rigid mechanical
system even though it still is a mechanical system but
at the same time there's a certain eerie spookiness within
the chaos within the chaos there's sort of a deeper
layer of order and that's something we'll talk about in
the future next on list is destruction versus creation people
like to pit these against each other and of course
creation tends to be elevated as the good one and
destruction as the bad or the evil one but of
course you can't have creation without destruction these are intimately
connected and people just don't understand the profundity of this
connection see to create a new life an old life
has to die has to create space the only way
there can be a new generation of human beings for
example created is if an old generation is destroyed otherwise
there's going to be too many human beings and of
course if you create too many human beings that lease
a destruction of lots of human beings overpopulation leads to
destruction you see so there's always this delicate balance you
need to create but then you also need to have
an outlet for all your creation to them get cleared
out so that a new space is created you create
emptiness so to speak through destruction which then allows for
new creation so it's the circle of life and even
if you know let's say you're you're painting on a
canvas or you're you're writing with a pencil let's say
you know it's very nice to have an eraser so
that you can erase what you've written or it's nice
to have some sort of whitewash where you can whitewash
your old paint away so that you can repaint something
that you painted see that's that's very useful for example
within a computer program if you're using something like Adobe
Photoshop or whatever software you use to create stuff there's
an undo button that's one of the most useful functions
in the software is the undo button it lets you
destroy the thing you just created which ultimately leads to
a greater creation in the ultimate end you see how
much worse would creations be on a computer if the
undo button was destroyed see but some people they yes
so hell-bent on destroying destruction they see you see the
paradox here it's it's totally hypocritical because people who value
creation really what they do is then they hate destruction
and by hating destruction they want to destroy destruction so
of course they're hypocrites but they're not aware of this
but even if they got their way and they were
able to destroy destruction what would that mean that would
actually weaken creation because their notion of creation is creation
with a cat with a lowercase C and you can
transcend this duality by realizing creation with a upper see
which is the whole of creation which of course encompasses
both creation and destruction together into an absolute creation is
an absolute so when we say that God is a
creator what we mean is of course that God is
both a creator and a destroyer at once God is
a creator with a capital C got that good moving
on love versus hate as a duality I think we've
touched on this in the past but let me touch
on it again because this one is so counter intuitive
it it really throws people for a loop love versus
hate you might wonder Leo why does God allow hatred
in the world why didn't God just make everybody loving
and if God allows hatred doesn't that mean that God
actually hates and that God isn't all loving why does
God allow racism and genocide and murder and dictators and
corruption all this evil well it's because the way you
that you're conceiving of love and hate is in there
lowercase forms you're thinking of love as a lowercase L
love which is a very selfish form of love so
what you mean when you say love is you mean
love that's good for me it's like I want to
love the stuff that's easy to love so I will
love rainbows and butterflies and unicorns I will love money
when it comes my way I will love sex when
it comes my way I will love when people love
me so you know very selfish form love but then
anything that happens in reality that doesn't suit my agenda
or that impinges upon my survival needs that I hate
that's bad stuff if some dictator comes to power or
someone enslaves me or whatever then that's all bad I
gotta hate that but see that's what you're doing you're
hating but God is all loving love as an absolute
God is absolute love love is not something God does
love is something that God is and of course you
are God but you're not conscious that you're God so
you've separated yourself from God and you did this because
you are incapable of loving everything about yourself see you
hate yourself you hate your face you hate your belly
you hate that that mole on your back you hate
that hair that you have somewhere you hate this and
that you hate everything if you look how much stuff
you hate of the world that's why you judge and
you constantly criticize see you're incapable of being all loving
love is an absolute love with a capital L if
you want more information on that go check out my
in-depth episode called what is love where I go into
a lot more detail so it's possible to transcend hate
and love into love as an absolute love with a
capital L this is the very being of God love
is synonymous with truth and you can become directly conscious
that you are loved and that's a hell of an
insight transforms your entire life if you can transcend this
duality in fact this is perhaps one of the most
important aspects of non-duality is to realize not just that
your emptiness but that emptiness is identical with love and
that love is an absolute and that everything that happens
happens out of love including all the hate so what
this means when you transcend the duality of love IRS's
hate into absolute love is you realize that all the
murder and rape and slavery and corruption and genocide that
has ever happened has happened out of pure love it's
such a twisted mindfuck that completely reorients your attitude towards
other people in the world because what it does it
demonstrates to you that all of your judgments are utter
delusion and lack of lack of sight so when you
become so conscious that you become conscious of an infinite
number of causes that lead to the creation of everything
that has ever occurred then you become conscious that all
of it happened out of love and that all of
it including all the bad stuff had to be there
see God is so loving that it even loves hate
that's how big it's love is so if you really
want to put your love to the test and to
see whether you're capable of absolute love don't love the
easy stuff test yourself by trying to love the hard
stuff find a person that you really hate and try
to realize that that person is not separate from you
but actually that you are that person literally physically metaphysically
existentially you are that person because you're all of creation
and so you can't hate anything because you are everything
otherwise you're hating yourself which is idiocy and delusion see
so to really be totally conscious of God is to
be conscious of yourself as God is to be conscious
that you are loved that you are everything by this
point you've transcended all these dualities and and at this
point your heart completely melts all of your judgments disappear
they become utterly untenable because what you realize also is
that love is just not some wishful thinking it's not
just some hippy new-age notion now oh yeah that's nice
it's nice to love bad people no no what I'm
telling that's not what I'm telling you I'm not just
saying it's nice to love that people I'm saying you
are all the bad people that you hate and that
literally you are creating them as God so to hate
them is falsehood and complete delusion and it drives you
crazy and it makes you suffer you see but anyways
let's move on next on the list alone versus together
as a duality seems like these are opposites right either
you're alone or you're with other people but not so
fast as it turns out this can be transcendent you
can discover that because everything is precisely non-dual all dualities
merge the distinction between self and other also must collapse
which means that there's only one being or thing in
the entire universe which is the universe itself universe is
right there in the word uni one verse word one
word all of creation is one word one thing one
object so when you realize this you discover that God
is absolutely alone alone with a capital A this is
a stark realization where you discover that all of your
friends and your family and all human beings that you've
ever known those you loved and also those that you've
hated have all been you the entire time figments of
your own imagination in the same way that in a
dream when you're sleeping at night all the people you
encounter in the dream are actually your own mind just
fragments of your own mind and then you wake up
from the dream and you realize like oh yeah I
just I I dreamt up the whole thing it was
all me well that's the case with your mother your
father your family your friends and everybody you hate it's
all you and you're totally alone which is why even
when you're with your friends you get the sense sometimes
that you're with people but you still feel alone and
no matter how much time you spend with people no
matter how intimate you get with your intimate partner how
much how much deep sex you have how many experiences
you share together how close you get in the end
you still feel alone that's because the ultimate truth is
that you are completely all alone and that's something that
you've been denying your whole life that's something that is
difficult to face you need to face it at some
point in your life and it's not easy to face
is emotionally difficult to face that you are all alone
you are so all alone that when you realize that
you're all alone you won't even be able to like
call your mom and ask her hey am i all
alone because you're so all alone and you're so conscious
now that you realize that by picking up the phone
and calling your mother actually you're just asking yourself am
i all alone and the only answer of course when
you're conscious is that yes of course I'm all alone
so if I asked my mom am i all alone
and she says no no I have I have I
have your back I'm here I don't worry I'll support
you but that's me talking to myself because I am
my mom so I am all alone and so that's
that's you know that's hard to stomach are some people
but at the same time if you do stomach it
and transcend it what you realize is that it's beautiful
to be all alone God is all alone God is
playing with itself God is masturbating to itself all the
time everything God does everything that happens in the universe
is just God's self masturbation that's all it is if
you're going to work if you're if you're having sex
with somebody if you're running a business if you're hanging
out with your friends all of that is just you
can think of it in a very sort of abstract
high-level way as being God masturbating to itself pretending pretending
to play all these different roles to entertain itself and
to experience itself in its fullness so part of God's
fullness is that it can split itself and splinter itself
into an infinite number of fragments and then also it
can reunite them through communion and through communication so that's
literally what's happening right now see who we are in
communion right now I am God communicating to God I
am shooting this episode for myself that's one way to
look at it simultaneous other way to look at it
is that you are God communicating with yourself right now
creating and imagining me and you created this episode to
teach yourself these valuable insights about your own self your
own true nature you see and so right now we
are we've fragmented ourselves you've kind of created a fragment
of you I've created the fragment of me and now
though as we're becoming conscious of these fragments that we
created now we are unifying them together and we're transcending
and we're realizing that now we're in communion and we
do that through communication we got through intimacy through bonding
through sex and so forth see so there you go
that answers that the next duality is uniformity versus diversity
often these are pitted against each other in our politics
today you see a lot of people either pro diversity
or anti diversity and then they bicker back and forth
with each other what hardly anybody realizes is what the
structure of reality is doing at all what is sort
of the purpose of this reality to be this way
that it is well if you transcend diversity and uniformity
ultimately you discover diversity with a capital D so the
genius of God's design of reality of your own design
so don't hold God is something separate you designed it
this way the reason you designed this reality this way
is because you wanted to ensure maximum possible diversity infinite
diversity so that's one way to think of reality is
just infinite diversity so think of some design you know
think of a bunch of different designs that God could
have used to create the world and you might wonder
well how would he choose which one to go with
and and then what you discover is that he chose
the one you chose the one which maximizes the diversity
of everything maximum diversity because what you want to do
as God is to fully experience every possibility of yourself
so every way you could be you want to be
and you are and that results in the multiplicity and
diversity of the animal life on this planet and the
human beings you know think about all the diversity and
human beings that we have people with different personalities different
quirks different psychology different genetics different heights and different sexes
and genders and like all sorts of weird stuff you
know there's enormous diversity in humanity alone but then you
look at the animal kingdom look at the diversity between
cats and dogs and dinosaurs and beetles and insects and
dragonflies and birds and bacteria and viruses just it's just
a multiplicity there's too many to count there's billions of
them trillions of them you couldn't classify them all we're
discovering new species still scientists are discovering new species every
week we're discovering new species and we will be for
centuries to come because new species are literally getting created
every month and every year there's not a fixed number
of species on this planet and that's just one planet
out of billions of solar systems out of billions of
galaxies in one universe and there's probably billions more universes
beyond our own so you see it's infinite diversity so
to understand this is very important because in order to
love all of this diversity you need to have a
very big heart because part of the problem is that
we get so identified with being one particular thing like
this particularly 'men or a black person or a white
person or a Buddhist or a Christian or a nationalist
or a globalist or whatever you're identified with we get
so stuck on that that we close our hearts down
and we're not able to embrace all the infinite diversity
that exists and so the point of spirituality is to
open your heart and your mind and and those go
hand in hand you can't you can't do one really
without the other open your heart and your mind become
so conscious that you embrace all of yourself and all
of this beautiful diversity and then you discover what true
love is true love is not it's not just you
being able to accept and tolerate diversity it's literally you
being the the physical being of you spread through all
of the infinite life forms and creations of the universe
you being all that is synonymous with absolute love so
absolute love is equivalent to absolute diversity and so it's
not really possible to love fully without really appreciating the
diversity of life and the diversity of humanity and it's
only by being able to appreciate this diversity that then
you are at peace and you are able to let
people be themselves without having to change them or criticize
them or judge them demonize them or murder them ultimately
see most most murders that happened by human beings happen
because the person doing the murdering is not appreciating the
the full diversity of him or herself because if he
did then he would not need to murder anybody see
next on the list is the duality of dumb versus
intelligent these are often pitted against each other as opposites
with of course intelligence elevated on a pedestal and being
dumb is stigmatized and seen as being very negative and
bad and we strive to not be dumb to not
look dumb to be more intelligent than we really are
of course intelligence is an absolute I've talked about that
in my episode called what is intelligence go look at
that it's pretty profound insight that you can realize so
intelligence with the capital eyes and absolute so you can
become conscious that even all the quote-unquote dumb stuff in
the world he's actually thereby an infinitely intelligent design so
you know if you take some sort of dumb animal
like a donkey you might think well why did God
create this dumb but then you look at it from
a higher elevation higher perspective and you realize that yes
the donkey is dumb compared to let's say a human
but it's serving us function perfectly and even those dumb
human beings who are dumb relative to more intelligent human
beings they are serving their function perfectly in the whole
you got to understand this you got to really zoom
out and take the absolute perspective and so there really
isn't anything dumb in the universe the universe is absolutely
intelligent infinitely intelligent and this is hard for many people
to understand it sounds crazy because you attribute intelligence to
just being something that your brain has that's not what
intelligences intelligence is omnipresent and it's it's a facet of
the absolute so intelligence is everywhere in your body in
that rock in that chair and that tree is all
intelligence but when I talk about intelligence that's a very
different notion than IQ being able to pass some tests
or even being able to do some logical reasoning these
are very very narrow notions of intelligence our science and
our psychology departments and our psychology experts they don't really
fully understand the significance of what intelligence is because fundamentally
they assume that the universe is dumb they assume that
matter is dumb and therefore they are not open enough
to app to discover absolute intelligence and the reason that
it's possible for the universe to be intelligent is because
it's a mind it's not a dumb machine it's not
some molecules bouncing around in a box it's a mind
it's consciousness one of the characteristics of consciousness is intelligence
and consciousness of course is omnipresent but we'll get to
consciousness in a in a moment let's move on to
the duality of freedom versus limitation these are so often
pitted against each other freedom I'm for free to maximum
freedom but what you don't understand is that these are
two sides of one coin especially the libertarian types and
certain conservatives who love to tout themselves as champions of
freedom they have such a dualistic notion of freedom that
it's silly here's the key thing that they don't understand
if you have maximum freedom what that means is that
you're free to do anything which now that means that
you can create limitations so for example if we create
a government that allows total freedom absolute freedom to every
individual you might think well that would be the ideal
situation right wrong because what you're not understanding is how
it's gonna circle back around and work as such if
you give everybody in a society infinite freedom then what's
gonna happen is that there's gonna be a free-for-all battle
because everyone's free to do whatever they want so you're
gonna have just a clash of agendas everyone's gonna be
fighting everybody else because hey everyone's doing whatever they want
you know like I can come and take a on
your front lawn that's freedom I could come and and
slit your throat in the middle of the night that's
freedom I can be a terrorist that's freedom I can
build a nuclear bomb and blow it up on your
front lawn that's freedom that's what freedom means total freedom
so if you give every individual total freedom certain of
those individuals the strongest ones they will come out on
top and they create all sorts of limitations so for
example if you give everybody in this country total freedom
the most powerful people will use that freedom to enslave
the rest of the people thereby creating limitation upon everybody
else you see and so what started out as freedom
for everybody sounds like a utopia now has turned into
a nightmare hell scenario where 99% of the population is
enslaved that's profound contemplate that one right there that will
with your mind but that's still just a tip of
the iceberg of how deep this issue of freedom limitation
goes so you can actually transcend freedom and limitation to
realize freedom as an absolute freedom with a capital F
this is the freedom of God so what this means
and this is what God is this is the very
structure of God is absolute freedom it's infinite degrees of
freedom so that means that God is free to do
absolutely anything with no restrictions whatsoever god is not constrained
by logical or physical laws not constrained by time by
energy by by anything there are no restrictions to God
it has literally absolute freedom so therefore because it's absolutely
free it of course now creates an infinite number of
limitations because if you're totally free that means that you're
free to create limitation because if you exclude limitation from
freedom then you're not actually free you see if God
couldn't limit itself it wouldn't actually be free so sometimes
people ask Leo why would God put himself into a
human body which is so limited you know as a
human I can't just like go flying through walls and
using Jedi force powers to you know to force choke
people and stuff like this I can't lift physical objects
with telepathy I can't do all this stuff why am
I so limited if God is so unlimited why don't
have these freedoms these powers you don't understand it's actually
precisely because God has infinite freedom that it also chooses
to limit itself and to experience life from all the
limited forms so to be a human being is to
be limited in certain specific ways that's literally what makes
a human being certain limitations you have two hands two
feet a mouth a nose you can speak you can
think this these are the limitations and also simultaneously abilities
of a human a human can't fly we don't have
wings you might say well wouldn't be better if humans
did have wings why didn't God create a human with
wings because you see the God is not interested in
creating some ultra super human that has all capabilities God
is more interested in experiencing living through life from all
the possible limitations that there are like God is interested
in being a human and then being a donkey and
then being a cat and then being an ant and
then being a bacteria and experiencing life from all these
different perspectives God is interested in not just being strong
but also being weak because God doesn't differentiate and put
preference on being strong as being better than being weak
you see to God it's all the same God is
an embrace of everything it doesn't discriminate and it doesn't
pick and choose based on your subjective criteria that you
use it as a human being you see so you
might think that limitation is this terrible curse and it
sometimes does seem that way from the relative perspective but
ultimately it's just literally what God is God is infinite
freedom which of course entails an infinite limitation if you
were absolutely free can you see how you can't have
a form you actually can't have a physical form because
any physical form that you have will still be limited
even if we take a human being and we give
him horns and wings and 25 legs and arms and
a brain as ten times bigger even if you give
him all that he's still gonna be very very limited
they're still gonna be a bunch of stuff he can't
do given his physiology given his form so to have
absolute freedom what that means is for lessness so be
careful what you wish for if you want absolute freedom
what you're talking about is becoming completely formless which is
basically death that's what you'll get when you die you'll
get infinite freedom that's what you had before you were
born you were infinitely free then you as God you
precipitated yourself and gave yourself limitations what then here's life
in a rose you get all these limitations you're living
in some particular country on some particular planet in some
particular universe within some particular dimension during some particular era
in history and so you're experiencing a very small sliver
of the entire infinite spectrum of possibility and therefore you're
limited so appreciate your limitedness because actually absolute freedom is
is quite terrifying when you experience it it's quite terrifying
it's very empty there's nothing there it's gonna feel like
death to your ego next duality is part versus whole
people think of these as opposites but actually every part
in reality is simultaneously also a whole which brings us
to the notion of whole Lon's which will require an
entire separate episode to explain but I'll touch on it
here so what a whole lawn is it's it's a
thing which is both apart and a whole simultaneously and
this is everything in the universe is a whole on
so for example a carbon atom you might think that's
a part but actually as a whole because a carbon
atom contains parts it contains protons neutrons electrons you might
say well but a but a proton that's a whole
no it's a part I mean I mean it is
a whole but it contains parts he's a whole line
so it contains parts you can break it apart even
further and so on but as we move up the
chain for example that carbon atom is present within some
moly some molecule which is a whole but also has
parts which is present within some protein a protein is
a is a whole lawn which is a whole which
is made up a bunch of parts like carbon atoms
and other atoms and then these proteins can make up
an animal like an ant a creature so a creature
is hold on or a hole which is made out
of parts cells and molecules and proteins and so forth
and then ants they make up an ant colony an
ant colony is a whole which is made up of
parts different ants and other things like the earth out
of which the ants build their colony and then that's
all part of the larger unit called the rainforest let's
say which meta parts you know the rain fourth made
up of trees and so forth and animals and then
that's part of something larger the planet and the plan
is part of something larger the solar system part of
something larger the galaxy part of something larger the galaxy
cluster a part of something larger the entire universe and
so forth see so everything point to anything take your
finger right now point to anything in the room anything
you point to is going to be a hole on
or both apart and the hole and ultimately when you
become fully conscious of non-duality you're going to transcend the
the duality of part and whole and you're going to
realize wholeness with a capital W wholeness is an absolute
in which you become conscious that all there really is
is one universe all of creation the entire cosmos and
and that of course includes any multiverses all of it
it's just one unit because there can't be any boundaries
separating things and this is when you discover of course
that you are all alone it's all alone it exists
by itself there is no opposite reality the universe existence
God you cannot have an opposite because an opposite implies
to and in fact there's only one which moves us
on to the next duality which is one versus many
you might wonder Leo how do you know that there's
only one reality what if there more that's because you're
thinking dualistic aliy you have a duality that you're not
conscious of yet which is the duality between oneness and
many nests there is no difference between one and many
everything can be subdivided an infinite number of times your
mind is the one that's doing the subdivision and the
one that's counting so if you want you could look
at this hand as one object one hand but at
the same time you can also look at it as
five fingers at the same time you can zoom in
further and you can look at it as billions of
cells at the same time you can zoom in on
each cell and look at it further and say well
this hand is actually trillions of molecules and so forth
so how so so what's the actual count here who
says how many of anything there are here you do
you do so are there are trillion molecules here or
is there one hand is there any difference between the
two see it's all the same oneness and many nough
circles back around it goes full circle such that what
God is is an infinite number of men enos --is
so God is billions and trillions of atoms and molecules
and cells and creatures and beings and humans and aliens
and planets and galaxies and universes and realities dimensions is
all of them at once so it's one and many
simultaneously and when you realize that you transcend the duality
of one versus many to oneness with a capital o
and that's when you realize you're alone miss next is
the duality of mundane versus divine these two seem like
opposites when you start doing psychedelics or you start experiencing
some mystical experiences through yoga through meditation through concentration practice
through self inquiry common thing that happens with newbies is
that they get this divine mystical experience it's a mystical
experience that happens it usually lasts for only a few
seconds or a few minutes when it first starts it
takes you by surprise and it's amazing because you you
realize that everything in the room is divine you realize
your body is divine the air is divine everything is
pure radiant self-illuminated self-aware divinity whereas before you just thought
of it as some dumb physical universe now you realize
the divinity of your own self and the physical world
but then you lose that experience and you're back sort
of in the mundane grind of life where you have
to go take care of your kids and you gotta
do your laundry and all the sorts of stuff and
it seems like man I just want to get back
to that divine place where I'm in that mystical union
and so you might want to try some more psychedelics
or some more yoga or whatever to get back there
but then as you keep doing more psychedelics more yoga
and you become more and more conscious of the non-dual
nature of everything what you eventually realize is that the
divine is not some magical realm that you escape to
to escape the grind of everyday life is that literally
the mundane and the divine are one and so you
don't need to go anywhere to experience divinity divinity is
right here right now just become conscious of it become
conscious of it and so when you do that that's
sort of the fruition or the culmination of your spiritual
path is that you walk down the road and all
you see is divinity everything you see is divine it
radiates with divinity and you're conscious of it all the
time that's sort of your ultimate goal with the spiritual
path and that's divinity with a capital WOD divinity with
a capital D and so we have we have this
very interesting split that happens between people who do spiritual
practices and those who don't those who don't get stuck
in the mundane grind of life and then of hating
their life and being depressed and miserable and then they
they curse they curse god it's a god how could
God have created such a terrible mundane existence is so
dreary and boring and so lame and so terrible full
of misery and suffering why couldn't it be magical and
radiant and divine why couldn't it be heavenly well that's
a pipe dream or so such people tell themselves but
then those who actually do the spiritual practices and they
do them a lot eventually they break through they discovered
infinity everywhere and to them they're walking around and they're
there looking at the exactly the same stuff that the
ordinary person is looking at but they are conscious of
the divinity of everything whereas the ordinary mundane person takes
everything for granted even all the good stuff that he
has in his life he takes completely for granted and
can't see the divinity of it so he's constantly bitter
and bitching and moaning about everything criticizing and judging and
hating and that's a consequence of not having enough cautions
to see the divinity of it all you can start
though by by maybe taking some mushrooms or some LSD
and getting a little taste of divinity getting that little
taste of divinity is is your first real introduction into
spirituality when you realize that it's real and it's not
just a theory or a belief or some wishful thinking
but that is real next on the list is imminent
versus transcendent this is closely related to the one I
just mentioned so within Christianity there's this debate that sometimes
happens amongst theologians is God imminent or transcendent and what
that means is is God in the world or is
God beyond and outside the world and of course the
answer is both both God is both simultaneously you can't
separate immanent and transcendent nor can you separate mundane and
divine because you can't separate subject and object and you
can't separate God from its creation God is the creation
the way God creates is by being a chair a
couch a dog your annoying neighbor or somebody you hate
on television your political opponent that's how God creates next
is holy versus unholy a lot of Orthodox religious people
get this wrong they try to pursue holiness with a
lowercase H holiness as opposite of unholiness what they don't
realize is that holy is actually an absolute there is
holy with a capital H which means that you realize
that everything is holy you know an Orthodox religious person
is very careful to look out for sinful behavior and
so he's very careful not to you know like go
to a brothel a priest doesn't want to go to
a brothel and if he goes to a brothel then
he's gonna think that he's gone to some unholy place
but of course what is this brothel but a creation
of God and all those in the brothel what are
they but God so the mistake the priest is making
when he's going to the brothel is that he's not
realizing the brothel is holy holy with a capital H
and if he realized that he could go to the
brothel enjoy himself and actually he could convert if he
wanted to some of those into uh into religious seekers
and help them awaken but he can't do that because
he himself is not truly awakened to the holiness of
everything it's not that God created some things which are
holy and some things which are unholy it's all holy
you just need to have the right vision to see
it it's a very common mistake of religious people this
of course leads to moralization this leads to the whole
divide between good versus evil so it's very problematic it
also leads to a lot of deaths and war and
genocide because once people get in their mind that something
is holy with a lowercase H as opposed to unholy
then you know they they wage a holy war against
the unholy stuff you know Muslims wage a holy war
against Christians Christians wage a holy war against Muslims but
both Christians and Muslims are creations of God they're both
holy with a capital H they're both not realizing it
some of them are but many of them are not
next we have unconscious versus conscious these are often pitted
against each other and you have to be very careful
because you know I use the word consciousness a lot
and also unconsciousness a lot as I teach my material
and there's two ways in which I use those words
sometimes when I say consciousness I'm talking about caution with
a lowercase C as opposite of unconsciousness but also sometimes
when I'm talking about consciousness I'm talking about consciousness as
an absolute conscious of the capital C this is the
consciousness that has no opposite so when you actually awake
him what you'll discover is that all of reality is
one thing consciousness it's a field of infinite consciousness that's
what everything is you are that field and this field
has no opposite so there actually never was such a
thing as unconsciousness it's a total mind and so one
of the problems for example within psychology within therapy especially
because it stems from people like Sigmund Freud and other
early psychologists who really didn't have non-dual awareness so they
created various kinds of duality is one of the most
dangerous of which is this duality between consciousness and unconsciousness
there is no such thing there is no such thing
as the unconscious mind really that's an abstraction all there
is is consciousness there's degrees of consciousness consciousness can do
various things consciousness can pretend that it's unconscious so what
we call unconsciousness is actually consciousness being and acting as
though it's unconscious in the same way that you might
have an actor playing dead on screen that doesn't mean
he's dead he's playing dead tricky very very tricky then
we have the duality of knowing versus not knowing these
are often pitted against each other not knowing is demonized
and everyone tries to avoid admitting that they don't know
everyone tries to it and everyone tries to be in
a position of knowing but actually not knowing is a
more powerful position in a certain sense than knowing and
they're deeply intimately related in order to know something you
first have to not know it you know or maybe
you don't so you can transcend knowing versus not knowing
to realize and we could label this in different ways
you could realize knowing with a capital K or you
could realize not knowing with a capital N or you
could realize mystery with a capital M what you realize
is that actually it's not possible to know anything precisely
because you're being everything so there's a sort of a
collapse of the duality between epistemology and metaphysics like I
said before and so what you realize that literally you
don't know what anything is so in a sense when
you awaken you become totally conscious but at the same
time as you have infinite omniscient godlike consciousness you don't
know anything because knowing is a conceptual thing and being
is prior to knowing and so what you're left with
is this irreducible mystery mystery with a capital M mystery
is an irreducible aspect of reality you cannot demystify reality
and if you try you're going to be deluded which
is one of the mistakes that rationalists and materialists make
is they try to demystify reality through reason logic and
science and that cannot work it's always partial and it's
always untenable there's always more mystery and even the stuff
that you think you've unraveled the mystery of you actually
haven't all you've done is you've tricked yourself into thinking
that you know something that you actually don't know it's
quite a mindfuck especially if you're really attached to knowledge
especially if you're an academic scientist intellectual philosopher theologian yeah
you've got a real big problem with knowing and not
knowing you've created a duality out of these two next
on a list is meaningless versus meaningful these seem like
opposites people want to have a meaningful life people are
pursuing meaning but what they don't realize is that they
create meaning so ultimately what you can become conscious of
is that everything as an absolute is meaningless meaningless with
a capital M but the trick with it is that
it goes full circle so when you realize meaninglessness most
people think like oh no leo but if everything is
meaningless that's terrible that's awful that sounds like nihilism it
sounds like depression it sounds like suicide it sounds like
that's gonna destroy civilization no you don't realize yet how
total and absolute meaninglessness is meaningless is so absolute in
total that your judgment of meaninglessness as being bad is
itself a mean that you're creating so you're not actually
there yet you're not at absolute meaninglessness you're imagining what
it is but you haven't actually become conscious of it
when you totally become conscious of absolute meaninglessness what you
discovers at a ghost full circle and it's the most
meaningful discovery you could possibly be that's the that's the
twisted irony of it there is nothing more meaningful than
to discover that the entire universe is totally meaningless and
when you realize this then you realize that you have
infinite freedom to create whatever kind of meetings you want
because you realize that all meanings are fabrications so you
can still participate in the creation of meaning but now
you can do it consciously you can create your own
life purpose whichever kind you want whatever you find meaningful
you can still pursue but this time you're doing it
consciously rather than expecting Society or some sort of external
authority figure to tell you what is or isn't meaningful
and also what you realize is that being is way
more meaningful than meaning this is one of the paradoxes
of awakening is that you lose all meaning but at
the same time you can say in a metaphorical figurative
sense that actually for the very first time your life
now suddenly feels meaning meaningful spirituality is so meaningful precisely
because it's totally meaningless and this is what a lot
of religious people don't understand religious people are busy chasing
meaning and purpose in their life and this actually paradoxically
is the chief obstacle to them discovering meaninglessness and just
surrendering to it and therefore discovering God so if you
want to discover God destroy all meaning and all that
will be left is God pure God is the Godhead
but how many religious people want to do that they
don't they're in denial about it because really it's the
ego that creates meaning the devil creates meaning not the
Godhead the God huh the Godhead just is it doesn't
need meaning the ego needs meaning as a function of
survival I think I've discussed that elsewhere I have some
older episodes about meaning and purpose go check those out
next on the list is life versus death and clip-ons
the big life people hold these as opposites but of
course you should know from from The Lion King from
the circle of life how life and death are intimately
connected and you can't have one without the other and
also well let me explain that one a little more
um because some people might not still know might not
even get that what do I mean by this well
look I mean for you to live you need to
kill a lot of vegans and vegetarians are in denial
about this but you're a killing machine you're killing all
the time even if you're eating plants you're killing all
the time a human being cannot live no organism can
be alive without creating death no matter how careful you
are no matter how compassionate and loving you are no
matter how socially responsible you are no matter what you
eat you're gonna have to kill to live even if
it's just as a result of walking down the street
to pick up your groceries let's say that in the
future some company invents some sort of like chemical formula
you can just kind of sit out of a straw
and you can replace all your food with this there
are some companies that already doing this let's say so
let's say a company does do this you might say
believe if somebody saw six sips this chemical out of
this straw for his whole life then he's not gonna
kill anybody and that contradicts what you just said so
we can solve this problem with science and technology is
what I'm telling you and what I'm telling you is
no you can't because see when you get in your
car to drive to pick up your sippy cup of
chemicals you are gonna drive over ants you are gonna
slam into butterflies and dragonflies and fruit flies and other
moths and other creatures as you're driving on your way
to pick up to pick up your chemical see so
to be alive you have to kill kill by the
thousands and by the millions so every human being was
ever lived he's responsible for the death of tens of
thousands if not millions of creatures and life-forms even if
you put yourself into a bubble and you never drive
a car and you try to completely isolate yourself and
be totally harmless to the world even for you to
live the bacteria that is present by the millions within
you that will kill you if you don't kill it
first is this battle of life versus death is constantly
being waged inside your body inside your sinuses in your
stomach you have viruses that your body is fighting off
all the time funguses and and so forth so you
can't be alive without killing millions of things this is
this is just a fact of life and it must
be this way because of the non dual nature of
life and then of course you can transcend the duality
of life versus death to discover life with a capital
F or life or the capital L and what that
means is a couple of things first of all you
discover that death is just an idea it's a concept
there's no such thing as death and of course this
is this is when you awaken you will discover immortality
this way there's only life also what you'll discover is
that contrary to what material science tells us life is
not limited to biological entities life is not a property
of creatures life is omnipresent the entire universe is alive
so there's no distinction between life and death or living
and non-living which sort of helps you to resolve that
sticky problem within science about what is the origin of
life well of course there was no clear line that
molecules crossed to go from nonliving molecules to living molecules
there was no such a line it was just I
mean they got more and more complex until eventually we
started calling them alive but they were alive from the
very beginning that's life with a capital L sounds crazy
I know but you gotta wake into that to understand
it mortal and immortal are pitted as opposites of course
you can transcend this duality to realize immortality with a
capital I immortality is when you realize that reality has
no opposite in that you are all of reality so
of course you're immortal and you can't die you've been
alive for ever and you will be alive forever your
true nature cannot die and that is ultimately how you
gain liberation and freedom from suffering is by realizing your
own immortality you realize that you are the entire universe
who just happens right now to be living through a
human form but you're gonna live through all forms so
it's that's no big deal there's an infinite number of
forms you live through and even if you become formless
it still doesn't matter because your true nature is formless
then of course that brings us to the very big
one the big duality of real versus unreal these seem
like opposites but actually you can transcend these to discover
reality with a capital R which is reality that has
no opposite so the truth is that there is nothing
unreal everything that is is real now you may say
Oh Ilya Bora what about Santa Claus Santa Claus is
unreal no Santa Claus is real otherwise it wouldn't be
in your experience right now it's just that you have
to be very clear about what Santa Claus is so
Santa Claus is real but it's real as something in
your mind something you're imagining or some bearded man you
know sitting in a mall wearing a costume that's Santa
Claus that's what Santa Claus is now that's real but
of course the problem is that your mind imagines that
what Santa Claus really means is it means some actual
mythical figure who lives in the North Pole and actually
delivers presents to people no that's a myth so a
myth is real in the sense that it's a myth
so the only problems that you're getting lost in concepts
that's the only problem so unreal only exists as a
concept you see and of course we should broaden this
out this category of real and unreal it can be
it can be talked about in different labels so you
could have a duality of reality versus fantasy or reality
versus imagination or reality versus dreams or reality versus hallucination
or even reality versus a video game or reality versus
fiction so all of this is part of the duality
that I'm calling real versus unreal so in our culture
and within science and within philosophy even and even within
religion we make a distinction between real and unreal stuff
fantasy and reality dreams and waking life but actually there
is no such duality you could transcend this which is
why I call reality a hallucination which is why gurus
call reality just a dream it is because you can't
distinguish the two so right now I'm sitting here and
I'm hallucinating a body and I'm hallucinating that I'm talking
to you and you're sitting over there hallucinating listening to
me that's what's happening you've hallucinating your entire life you're
hallucinating that you were born tah-dah the word hallucination is
a beautiful word I love this word because the technical
definition of hallucination is an appearance without any substance to
it and so that's exactly what's happening so this body
is an appearance with no substance behind it all we
have are appearances which is the same thing as saying
reality is identical to hallucination you know when you become
really conscious you can play a video game like a
Super Mario or maybe a more sophisticated one what's popular
today you know these 3d video games Legend of Zelda
we're here running around in this beautiful 3d open-world now
and all this right elder scrolls Skyrim whatever you like
these open-world RPGs are really popular these days and you're
in it and you're like you're playing it and you're
loving it and it's ah this beautiful immersive world and
in video games what are we talking about immersion you
know a huge selling point of video games is immersion
and of course that's why we need photorealistic graphics and
all this sort of stuff and VR goggles and you're
so immersed in this new VR simulation to the point
where what you start to lose yourself to it and
you can't distinguish it from reality anymore people think well
that's just because the graphics are getting so good no
no you don't understand it's much more profound than that
literally there is no difference between this physical reality here
and the one in your video game it's the exact
same reality but you have to be conscious enough to
realize that that is a video game what a video
game me means is pixels but those pixels are still
real all the characters are still real Mario is a
real thing it's just not like a human all right
so don't confuse it that way but literally you can't
tell a video game from reality in fact in the
future what this what this means is that we'll actually
be able to create video games which are so sophisticated
and complex and self-involved that the characters in the video
games will not be able to know whether they're inside
of a video game or inside of reality how's that
for a mindfuck so you see Mario when Mario was
running around the screen in a certain sense you might
say that he doesn't know that what he's doing isn't
reality to him it seems real you of course Mario
is not sophisticated enough to have this sort of reasoning
or cognition but in the future you can actually imagine
a sort of a supercomputer which actually gives Mario sort
of cognition to the point where Mario actually starts to
believe that Mario world and his own body are actually
real and not a video game and the reason that
will be able to happen is because there is no
distinction between reality and a video game so in a
certain sense he won't be wrong but in another sense
he will be deluded in the same way that you're
deluded in that you think you're real what actually you're
not so that will be an really interesting I look
forward to the days when we have video games where
our video game protagonists will be able to awaken to
the fact that they're inside of a video game and
I want to see us some some screen screen captures
of the look on their face when Mario awakens to
the fact that actually he's God that'll be awesome but
I might take a while to get there not in
our lifetime so don't don't hold your breath the next
duality is being versus non being these seem like opposites
actually what you can discover is that being is an
absolute being with a capital B there no there is
nothing but being everything that's happening right now is being
everything that's ever happened in your life is being even
all falsehood and delusion and what you might call hallucination
is still being untruth is still being you can't speak
it on truth without it being to to make a
lie it has to be that uh but this is
being with the capital B it's an absolute you can
well let's move on to the next item here the
next two ality actual versus potential or actual versus virtual
these seem like opposites but actually they're not you can
transcend actual versus potential to discover that you have actual
with a capital A everything is actual everything potential becomes
actual and everything actual in a sense was potential and
what God is is just infinite potential which of course
is indistinct from infinite actualization so everything that God could
be God becomes and in a certain sense because there
is no difference between actual and potential here we are
if you want a real mindfuck imagine this imagine that
see you're sitting here right now and you're thinking that
well okay this is actual my body is actual this
room is actual but flip that around and try to
think of it and try to see it as this
room is potential it's not actual your body is potential
now you might say Billy oh no it's not potential
it's actually here but how would you know the difference
between actual and potential really think about that don't don't
be so quick to say that I I can easily
tell them apart you can't tell them apart actually potential
are identical this is all potential everything that's ever happening
is potential in a certain sense you might say that
none of it exists really or it exists as potential
which is the same thing that as saying that it's
actual same thing for the duality between actual and conceptual
these might seem separate and different but all concepts are
actual you can't have a concept that's not actual even
a concept of like energy yes energy is conceptual but
at the same time that concept is actual next we
have the duality of self versus other or self versus
world I've already touched on this but there's a lot
that could be said about this because this is this
is the perhaps one of the most fundamental dualities that
you hold it's the duality that is responsible for running
your entire life is the distinction you make between yourself
and everything else in fact this distinction is how you
were born you were not born biologically or physically you
were born the moment that a distinction between you and
not you occurred see I said in the past I
think I said in the last part part 2 of
this series that what a duality is it's a division
within consciousness so when we make a division like if
we cut a an apple in half simultaneously we're creating
two parts that's what a division is a division always
creates two parts now of course you can have multiple
divisions creating more than two parts but each cut each
division is making two parts so the very first division
that you made to come into existence is the division
between me and not me me and world me and
another person the only way that you exist as a
self as an ego that you imagine yourself to be
is because you tell yourself that you're that and not
the rest of the world if you told yourself that
you were the rest of the world and you remove
that would remove the division between world and self literally
you would become the whole world you see but you
can't even fathom what I'm saying right now in your
present state of consciousness unless maybe you're already enlightened because
you are so certain that you're real you're so certain
that your actual you're so certain that division between self
and other and self and world is actually real but
you have to realize like we said earlier that the
duality between actual and real is itself untenable and must
collapse so when you realize this you'll die when you
realize that there's no difference between self and the world
you'll die which is precisely why you're going to do
everything in your power not to realize it so even
though I'm telling you all this and you're understanding it
intellectually you're not actually going to realize it if you
realize that you'd be dead and then you'd be awake
and then you'd be immortal and then you'd be God
and then you'd be absolute and then you'd be infinite
but of course your entire life is predicated upon you
not being that your whole life is devoted to you
being finite and limited and your particular self that's all
that you've been doing in your whole life so are
you gonna give that up simply because you watched one
of my videos of course not you're terrified of doing
what I'm telling you to do it is totally terrifying
because you think it's going to destroy your entire life
because you think that death is actually real you see
how this duality works your entire sense of reality and
self and life is completely corrupted by these dualistic divisions
that you've made and that's as it should be because
if you didn't have those you couldn't be alive so
as it should be but also realize that it's possible
to transcend that if you want that's what Awakening is
about so yeah it's a very very tricky stuff I
mean like work this is this is some of the
most advanced and subtle things that could ever be communicated
to a human being from one human being to another
I'm making it sound kind of easy I'm being kind
of flippant I'm going through it kind of fast and
I'm kind of smiling through it because you know once
you get on the other side of it and you
understand it you have a lot of familiarity with it
like I have at this point then you know it
just becomes it becomes totally normal to you and there's
nothing there's nothing weird about it nothing crazy about it
but when you're first hearing it for the you know
for the first time or even for the hundredth time
before you've actually done any practices or had any direct
experiences of it it sounds like lunacy and it sounds
dangerous and crazy and like yeah people don't realize how
radical this work is and how radical awakening is and
how radical non-duality is people think that all non-duality is
just oh just some interesting theory I I listen to
on YouTube no no no hadou ality is is it's
the end of your life it's the end of your
life it's the end of the it's the end of
the world in stand of reality as you realize that
all those things were conceptual the entire time alright let's
take a quick intermission right here I got to catch
my breath and we'll be back to wrap it all
up the next duality on our list is one that
we've already kind of spoiled by talking about us so
much which is the duality between self and God so
of course because the duality between self and other and
self and world is untenable and must collapse also the
duality between god and worlds must collapse and so you
can see how if god is the world and you
are the world then you are God and this is
something I've talked about quite a lot so I don't
want to elaborate it on much more here but of
course the thing you have to understand about God is
that there's sort of two versions of God there's God
with a lowercase G and there's God with an uppercase
G God is an absolute God is the absolute most
religious people or most people ever who talk about God
talk about God with a lowercase G not the actual
God but some idea of God some image of God
or some story that they have about God or a
belief in God but not the actual thing and they
don't know that there is an actual thing because they've
replaced it with a belief but in fact you can
transcend the duality between self and God to realize that
self is God self with a capital S the self
is God which leads us to the next two ality
of selfish versus selfless this can be transcended to selfless
with a capital S or the self with a capital
S the self of the capital S is the same
thing as selflessness with a capital S so usually people
think of these things as opposite but what you discover
when you become totally selfless free of ego is that
what remains is emptiness or nothingness or absolute subjectivity and
that absolute subjectivity is the non self self it's the
self which is prior to there's a human biographical biological
physical self that you conventionally think that you are so
if you surrender that identity to your physical and psychological
being if you surrender that then what you discover is
that you're the entire universe and the entire universe is
that that self and it's totally selfless so God is
totally selfless and this is where love comes from absolute
love with the capital L is that absolute love with
capital L is just total absolute selflessness and of course
by being absolutely selfless you become all the individual selves
that populate the earth and all the other planets and
universes that are out there the next to alley is
meditation versus life when we start meditating we have this
duality it's like when I'm meditating for 30 minutes a
day or 60 minutes a day that's my meditation practice
I'm sitting on the cushion I'm putting a lot of
effort into it I'm concentrating meditating and good okay but
then when my timer rings and I'm not on the
cushion anymore now I'm back to ordinary life and it's
like the opposite of meditation but then of course as
you practice meditation more and more and more ultimately you
get to a point especially after a few awakenings where
your entire life becomes one seamless constant meditation and then
you live that way and that's what mindfulness practices your
trying to be mindful all the time not just doing
some during some formal sit or do it during some
formal retreat so it's okay if right now for you
meditation is just this limited confined thing that you do
formally but just realize that over over the years and
decades it will start to spill over into everyday life
such that you can't distinguish them anymore and in fact
you're gonna stop using any formal techniques after a certain
point and all that meditation will mean for you is
just sitting and being or not even sitting just being
no matter what you're doing you could be walking talking
eating looking at a TV doing your work and sort
of in the background you'll be meditating that's when you
get really good the next duality is existence versus non-existence
this is a tricky one that confuses a lot of
people a lot of cosmologists and astrophysicists and scientists and
PhDs they don't understand they don't understand that existence and
non-existence is a duality so actually you can transcend these
two to discover that what there is truly is existence
with a capital E as an absolute so existence actually
has no opposite conventionally it seems to us that there
is an opposite to non-existence you might say Malia what
are you talking about like Santa Claus doesn't exist so
isn't that evidence of non-existence no actually it's not because
Santa Claus exists as Santa Claus as that fictional character
that's what it is that's not non-existence that's existence a
unicorn exists as that magical mystical animal whether you're imagining
it or you draw on a piece of paper that's
what a unicorn is that's existence now you want to
a Leo but the real unicorn it doesn't exist but
that to exists your image of a real unicorn or
a real Santa Claus that exists it's just not what
you think it is so you're getting lost and concepts
and so what you need to realize ultimately by transcending
this duality is that there is no opposite to existence
if something is even if it's a falsehood or a
delusion it still exists you just need to not be
deluded by it and to understand what it is accurately
this trips a lot of people up and so the
reason that you're able to attain immortality through Awakening is
because you realize that with poedel non-duality by the transcending
of all these divisions that your own mind created we
were able to realize that actually there is just existence
as an absolute with no opposite and so therefore you
literally cannot die or go anywhere because it's just existence
forever its eternal existence as an absolute and of course
that's why God can't be destroyed because God just is
existence existence can't go anywhere because it just exists when
I when I talk about existence I'm talking about existence
in its pure form existence without any content so a
lot of people confuse the content of existence for existence
itself but actually these are two distinct things there is
existence which is independent of all form forms can exist
within it or it can just be empty existence with
no form now most people call that non-existence but actually
it's still existence it's just empty of form so that's
what trips people up next to ality is true versus
false hood seems like totally opposite right but no they're
deeply related in fact you can transcend these two to
realize truth with a capital T of course absolute truth
which is it's identical with God identical with love identical
with selflessness identical with everything so what truth is is
just absolutely everything that is and when you become conscious
of what truth is you'll realize that falsehood doesn't exist
and never has existed because falsehood isn't true in a
sense to tell a falsehood it still has to happen
within the domain of truth or within the domain of
existence as I've talked about before so really there is
no such thing that's falsehood there's only pure truth pure
truth is consciousness or awareness and there is nothing opposite
of truth has an absolute this is a real mind
that a lot of people just don't understand because you're
not able to understand this using rationality or conventional thinking
you need to become deeply awoken to realize this the
next duality is a really important one which is the
duality between duality and non-duality this is really tricky because
you probably have been wondering Leo will you talk about
non duality but isn't that you creating a duality between
duality and non-duality and my answer yes I'm sorry my
answer of course is yes of course you need to
understand that this is inescapable when I am communicating this
is inescapable because like I told you in the very
beginning of this series all human communication and thought is
dualistic which does not exclude my own communication and thought
so I'm not being a hypocrite here I have acknowledging
that all of my own communication is dualistic even when
I'm talking about non duality my communication to you is
still dualistic and that can't be avoided so actually there's
two duality - uh sorry there's two there's two versions
of non duality so this this is uh this is
going to get even trickier now try to stay with
me there's two versions of non-duality there's non-duality with the
lowercase n and non-duality with an uppercase n as an
absolute so actual absolute non-duality the thing that I'm pointing
to but the thing that I cannot say and no
human being will ever be able to say no money
no matter how much they speak or write or think
that non-duality with a capital n that I'm pointing to
that thing is the whole purpose of this communication and
yet that thing will never be part of this communication
in a certain sentence you see it cannot be communicated
to you because if it could you would become awoke
and you can't become awoke until you're awoke so the
problem here is that you need to transcend language thought
and symbols and so on the one hand we need
to transcend language thought and symbols but on the other
hand we have to use something to communicate it has
to be language thought or symbols so you need to
be conscious enough to realize that what I'm talking about
non-duality and you're thinking about non duality that is still
duality you still haven't really grasped what is being pointed
to that transcendental absolute cannot be put into words so
that's ok that's not a problem per se you just
need to be very very mindful of that and you
to do practices and you need to grasp that true
ultimate absolute non duality with the capital n for yourself
see and also you need to be careful that as
you're practicing non duality who don't turn non duality into
a theory into an ideology into a philosophy or into
a doctrine that you cling to which is opposed to
duality so newbies who spend a few years studying on
new ally and practicing it they commonly fall into this
trap of pursuing non-duality with a lowercase n which means
that they are like striving to be super non-dual but
at the same time as they're doing that they're also
demonizing and judging and criticizing and trying to move away
from duality as though duality is bad wrong deluded false
and so forth and somehow separate from God but of
course what you need to realize is that even duality
is part of God even though it's not absolutely true
it's still relatively true and part of all of creation
in the same way that delusion and illusion are part
of the creation so this becomes a problem because if
you demonize delusion illusion and duality you're gonna still be
stuck in self-hatred and you're not gonna do a full
embrace of everything you you're not gonna really transcend it's
the same thing as chasing holiness with the lowercase H
or chasing goodness with a lowercase G you're not transcending
the two and embracing everything and that becomes a very
big problem so this is a very important point if
you want to get to the highest levels now you
might wonder what Billy oh I'm confused now it sounds
that sometimes it sounds as though you're saying that reality
is of course non dual and then at other times
it sounds like you're saying that reality is dualistic so
what are you really saying here that's right I have
some videos where I stress and say that reality is
non dual I have other videos where I talk about
the dialectical nature of reality and how the world of
form always has these polar opposites that are in tension
with each other so which one is it it's both
you see you can't distinguish them really you can't separate
them it's both look at the yin-yang symbol again look
at how it is you've got the white you've got
the black you've got a dot of white in the
black you've got a dot of black and the white
and you've got the entire thing all coming together seamlessly
the absolute so so it's very useful to be able
to have like these lenses that you can put on
and off as you're looking at the world you need
to have a lens we're able to look at the
world do dualistic aliy and to appreciate and to study
deeply the the polar opposites and how they interplay with
each other and the various kinds of distinctions and categories
that we can create so this is the realm of
the of the relative you can't just dismiss that and
then at the same time you need to have another
lens which is the non dual lens that you can
put on and you can look at all dualities and
all the distinctions in all categories and see it has
all just part of oneness the next duality that were
brought to here is relative versus absolute and this is
also very tricky we say that there's a relative truth
there's an absolute truth which one is ultimate well of
course the ultimate is the absolute absolute with a capital
A when you are in absolute consciousness it has no
opposite and you're in total consciousness you might say and
so that is like the ultimate truth and it's in
fact such an ultimate truth that you even completely forget
there was a relative truth it's so absolute it eclipses
relativity but when you're sort of functioning in everyday life
using conventional language within human society and culture dealing with
science and politics and religion and sociology and your family
and business and all this stuff this is the realm
of the relative and so again you need to have
sort of two lenses that you can use to look
at the world in a relative way in an absolute
way and not try to exclude one or the other
so a mistake that people make is that they become
conscious of the absolute and then what they do is
they think oh well only the absolute is true and
the relative world is all false and it's all illusion
and I want to stay far away from it but
if you do that you've created a new division see
now you're dividing relative from the absolute true absolute the
true embodiment of the absolute is that you yes you're
fully conscious of the absolute but at the same time
you also embrace all the relative stuff so that's a
very sophisticated a sort of a nuanced approach to this
also understand that there is the absolute with a lowercase
a and an absolute with the uppercase a the absolute
with an uppercase a cannot be communicated to you you
need to have a mystical experience of that whereas the
absolute with a lowercase a is what I'm talking about
whenever I'm talking and what you're thinking whenever you're thinking
about the absolute so you can't actually think about the
absolute with an uppercase a whenever you're thinking about the
absolute that's a lowercase a it's tricky it's still confusing
contemplate back the next duality is division vs. unity some
people are focused on dividing the world some people are
focused on unifying the world the problem though is that
most people who try to unify the world are doing
it in a lowercase you sort of way you can
transcend this duality to unity with an uppercase u which
means it's a unity that embraces division not divides itself
from division you see the hypocrisy and contradiction of trying
to unify people but then excluding those who want division
see those who want division most unifiers will try to
exclude those people from their Unity Party so it will
be like the Unity Party against some other party and
this is all happening within the relative domain this is
not yet unity within an uppercase u unity with an
uppercase you realize is that we unify by also accepting
that there will be division and that's okay and in
fact that's absolutely necessary and reality cannot be otherwise another
duality is saying versus insane people think that all that
person is crazy that person has insane beliefs and ideas
they're not normal and rational like me but how do
you determine what is sane and what it's not and
what it's not saying if you understand what I'm teaching
you here then you should realize that that boundary between
the two is not going to be sharp if you
investigate a deeper and deeper you're gonna realize that the
two actually bleed together and there's no way to really
distinguish them who gets to say what is saying or
what is insane you do so if you say that
some belief is sane how do you know that you're
not insane and just saying that from your insanity you
don't and you can't and that's the nature of reality
is that you can't distinguish sanity from insanity the things
that we call sane are really just convention you believe
it's sane because it's practical for your survival it works
for whatever you need it to do and other people
around with you around you generally agree and don't call
you insane for it that's really what we mean when
we say something is sane and of course as you
see by studying different cultures during different eras and studying
different peoples and different religious movements and scientific intellectual developments
and philosophical debates you see that people have and calling
other people insane since the dawn of time you know
there there are many scientists who think other scientists are
insane so there's no safety here don't think that by
being a scientist or by being a rationalist removing a
mathematician or by being anything that's somehow you're gonna save
yourself from the possibility of insanity you won't all you're
doing is you're sure you're surrounding yourself with social conventions
that's all it is that's all it is so in
fact by trying to create the distinction between sanity and
insanity actually you're behaving in an insane manner because you're
making that up and yet now you're confusing your own
mental fabrications with ultimate reality or with truth and that's
just not the case and so the reason that a
lot of people struggle with psychedelics is they take some
LSD some mushrooms some DMT or whatever else and one
of the things these psychedelics can reveal to you which
is very threatening and scary and shocking is they can
blur the line between sanity and insanity where you can't
tell the two apart anymore and this freaks a lot
of people out in fact this is one of the
most freakiest kind of trips you can have is where
you go down this sort of insane rabbit hole where
literally you start to have thoughts and ideas which become
so indistinguishable from physical reality that you literally can't tell
whether you're sane or insane anymore and this is very
very scary because in the in the moment when you're
in this trip it can feel like you're stuck in
this sort of insane thought spiral that never ends forever
and during that time it's it's scary it's freaky and
all you want is just get to get back to
a same place but at the same time you realize
there is no same place to get back to which
only makes you feel even worse and so you just
go down this infinite rabbit hole of insanity until the
trip wears off and then you're kind of back to
normal and then you recollect yourself I'll recollect yourself but
but man that can be a very bad trip so
I've had some of those as you could probably tell
and on the one hand it's bad on the other
hand it's actually great because it it's important for you
to to face this truth and most people just have
never faced this truth it's a very shocking truth with
with very serious ramifications it undermines all of science all
the philosophy all of culture everything you believe it undermines
it so it's it's crazy but at the same time
it's true this will mean bye-bye mind this is the
definition of mind right here and so see a lot
of people who do psychedelics they don't have any kind
of theoretical foundation they haven't heard these sorts of clear
lectures like I'm giving to you explaining all this stuff
in all this excruciating detail they haven't study any of
this so they just pop some mushrooms or LSD at
a party somewhere in a terrible setting at a rave
or something loud music blaring and then they have these
crazy insights like sanity versus insanity can't be distinguished and
then and then that totally freaks them out and then
they blame the psychedelic for it as if the psychedelic
did something wrong no all the psychedelic did was show
you the truth but of course as a Terence Mckenna
says it's not enough just to discover the truth the
real trick is facing the truth can you stomach the
truth the truth is a very radical thing also these
trips give you a real profound compassion and empathy for
people who have mental instabilities who suffer from quote-unquote insanity
who are in this a insane asylums hmm who have
these sorts of neurological brain disorders that that doesn't make
their mind function quite normally you empathize with them like
that so that's a very terrible way to live if
you're stuck in that and you can't break free of
it imagine that your whole life is just one bad
trip where you can't distinguish reality from fiction and you're
confusing the two all the time and your mind is
is taking down these insane vortexes that you can't break
out of yeah that's so that's a very hellish existence
the next duality is matter versus spirit people tend to
hold these as opposites a lot of times people hear
me talking about spirituality and instantly they they recoil in
this a level spirituality that's all fluffy stuff matter is
what's real without realizing that true spirit is the transcendence
of the distinction between matter and spirit and so when
you transcend the two you get spirit with a capital
S everything is spirit atoms and molecules and trees and
cars and minds human beings all of it is spirit
this is spirit right here right now you can be
conscious of it or you cannot if you're a materialist
then you're not conscious of it and so to you
it seems like spirit is absurd impossible hocus pocus superstition
wishful thinking where really you're just not conscious of the
obvious because you haven't done the spiritual practices and you
also haven't questioned and deconstructed your materialist paradigm you know
one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century
with quantum mechanics was the discovery that there is no
such thing as matter matter doesn't exist science itself has
debunked the notion of matter Einstein showed that matter and
energy are interchangeable so there's no distinction between matter and
energy but even even beyond that when you look with
quantum mechanics into what is matter what is an atom
you discover there is no particle there there's no such
thing as discrete particles all particles entire universe are all
entangled into one quantum field it's an infinite quantum field
and quantum physicists use quantum field equations to talk about
these fields will this feel that they're talking about is
just consciousness or spirit it's one field they just don't
realize what they're really studying yet of course some of
them do but men next we have the duality of
form versus formless these seem like opposites but actually you
transcend these two when you get really really awoke and
you realize that form and formlessness are actually identical so
the transcendence of form and formlessness really has no name
you could call it form with a capital F or
you call it formlessness with a capital F but really
the two are just literally identical that's probably one of
the highest and deepest forms of awakening when you have
moderate forms of awakening you still have a semblance of
a duality between form and formlessness and you tend to
prefer one over the other a lot of people when
they start to awaken they start to identify with formlessness
and they start to exclude or denounce form as though
form is somehow bad or unnecessary or separate from them
but then if they have deeper awakenings they realize oh
no wait a minute that was a mistake because I'm
still creating a subtle duality between form and formlessness actually
they're literally identical so I can't denounce or criticise form
I can't move away from form I can't escape form
form is formlessness so there's nowhere to escape there's also
a duality between shiva and shakhty this is similar to
form and formlessness shiva is another way to say formlessness
and shakti is energy or form and so in the
in the Hindu and various yogic traditions there's there's this
mythology that they have about how Shiva is at play
with Shakti and the two are coming together she was
supposed to be the masculine shock he's supposed to be
the Anna the feminine and their inter playing with each
other and so that's a beautiful little metaphor that you
can use so everything that's happening around me right now
including my body and the sounds that I'm making this
is all the Shakti and all of it is occurring
with an emptiness which is Shiva but at the same
time shiva and shakhty are actually identical because form and
formlessness are actually identical so while all of this form
is going on this is actually all completely formless but
you got to become conscious of that it's not enough
to just talk about it another duality is something versus
nothing people hold these opposites actually they're the same it's
impossible this thing to distinguish something from nothing when you
transcend that you realize nothingness with a capital n nothing
is with a capital n is not separate from somethingness
but actually identical to something is it's at Absolute and
this is what you awaken to with enlightenment and of
course nothing is identical to everything that's not there duality
here that trips people up nothing and everything r1 and
also there's the duality of zero versus infinity these are
held as opposites when actually they're identical zero is infinity
infinity is zero how can this be because when something
is infinite is completely boundless and therefore formless and therefore
nothing because everything within it cancels out sort of like
all the positive numbers cancel out all the negative numbers
and you're set up with zero and zero is also
unbounded it stretches out forever everywhere it's omnipresent it's everywhere
and it's nowhere and that's exactly infinity there's also a
duality created between the finite and the infinite so here
you got to be careful again and you got to
distinguish between infinite with a lowercase I and infinite with
an uppercase I so infinite as an absolute is uppercase
I infinity with an uppercase eyes and absolute that's God
does not separate itself from the finite so what God
is is an infinity an absolute infinity which includes within
it every finite possibility you see and that's the transcendence
of finite and infinite then we also have something related
to that which is limited versus unlimited that's a common
duality but if something is unlimited must it not include
also limits because if a thing is unlimited but it
excludes limitation then it's no longer unlimited is it it's
limited in that it can't produce limitation this is a
whole trick of God so God is unlimited with a
cap of capital u unlimited with a capital u means
that it's unlimited in that it allows infinite limitation it's
sort of like that example of of freedom and limitation
that we talked about unlimited it just means infinite freedom
next we have the duality of enlightened versus unenlightened people
who are unenlightened think that enlightenment is some separate thing
from unenlightened but when you become enlightened because enlightenment is
an absolute enlightenment with a capital e you realize that
actually there is no difference between enlightenment and on enlightenment
which is why sometimes teachers tell you that you're already
enlightened and yet while there's a certain truth to that
it's also very misleading for those who are unenlightened so
if you're unenlightened I actually highly recommend that you make
a firm distinction between being unenlightened and being enlightened otherwise
you'll trick yourself thinking that you're enlightened when actually you're
unenlightened there is a difference between someone who's genuinely enlightened
and someone who isn't but after you become enlightened you'll
realize that you in a certain sense always were enlightened
it's a mindfuck it's a paradox you have to distinguish
between enlightenment as we talked about it and as you
imagine it seven light meant and actual enlightenment with a
capital e that thing actual enlightenment we can't talk about
it that's something you only experience during your moment of
enlightenment you can't preview it you can't imagine it and
nothing you imagine about it is even close to what
it is that's what makes this work so tricky if
if it wasn't for that this would work would be
very very easy and we wouldn't need all this explanation
and people wouldn't get so confused and deluded the next
duality is no God versus God and also we're gonna
lump in here the devil versus God and also we'll
lump in the devil versus angels people hold all these
as total polar opposites but in fact they're all the
same so no God and God is the same as
sort of saying atheism versus theism well you can transcend
atheism and theism to realize that what there is is
actual God God with a capital G which is not
the same God as the theists imagines actually God with
a capital G is very similar to two to the
atheists conception of God which is just nothingness emptiness but
it's still not the same as atheism and then you
have the devil versus God so people hold these as
opposites but actually how could the devil be separate from
God because God created everything therefore God must have created
the devil if the devil created himself that means the
devil is God as well from that perspective you see
so either you admit that the devil crated himself in
which case he's God or you admit that he didn't
create himself in which case God created him in which
case because God is his own creation God is not
separate from his creation God must be the devil so
really the devil is just a facet of God that's
what we mean by that word go check out my
episode what is the devil it's one of my most
important episodes so you can transcend the devil and God
to God with an uppercase G God with an uppercase
G includes the devil within it and that's very very
important for you to understand same thing with angels the
devil according to mythology is just a fallen angel the
devil is an angel and also we should address here
the the duality between gods and God or polytheism and
monotheism these are often presented as opposites and often time
atheists will use other cultures which were polytheistic has some
sort of argument against monotheism because suppose it like Leo
will how can you tell whether monotheism is true or
polytheism true doesn't this show that your belief in God
is somehow um relative just something that you know you
happen to pick up from your monotheistic culture oh no
no God is not a belief you got to understand
unless it is if it's a belief then of course
you're right but if God you're talking about the actual
God with capital G it's not a belief and so
really polytheism is not in conflict with monotheism at all
so you can have multiple gods that's not a problem
it's just that you got to realize that ultimately they're
all unified together under the Godhead under formlessness and this
is exactly what you see in Hinduism for example they
have many different gods and avatars but then there is
the ultimate which is Shiva which connects them all or
Brahman connects them all see and that's not a contradiction
because the very nature of God is to incarnate itself
into various forms so there might be multiple gods out
there I don't know I haven't encountered all the possible
gods that might exist but what I am conscious of
is God as an absolute which would incorporate all those
see so polytheism doesn't shake you and even the existence
of other lesser gods doesn't shake you when you are
conscious that you are God and that God is an
absolute and that God is infinite including all forms so
if there is some superhuman intelligence some artificial AI to
some aliens constructed in some universe or in some galaxy
far away across the universe you might almost call that
a God but of course it's not the God it's
a lesser God you might say it's a lesser intelligence
it's still not absolute which is why the existence of
aliens also doesn't shake non-duality it doesn't matter if there
are aliens it doesn't it matter how smart they are
or how technologically sophisticated they are or how godlike they
are because they are still not absolute because they're formed
and they're limited in some fashion if they weren't then
they would be the absolute they be ultimate God which
is of course what I am and what you are
already you can become conscious that next is a duality
between temporal and eternal this can be transcended to discover
eternity with a capital e actual eternity this very moment
the now right now is an absolute it's absolutely eternal
which means it exists outside of time or another way
to say it is that exists forever for trillions of
years this very moment right now that's happening it has
existed for an infinite number of years which makes it
eternal and it makes it immortal that's a very radical
state of consciousness to become conscious that you need to
become conscious of what absolute now is and right now
you're not conscious of it because ordinary human consciousness is
temporal its dualistic and temporal but time is just a
concept time is relative time is not absolute as Einstein
demonstrated next we have the division and duality between samsara
and Nirvana Buddhist terms which some of you might be
familiar with samsara is the formed world the mundane world
of stuff Nirvana is sort of the heaven realm where
you are liberated and free of suffering and people sometimes
when they get into spirituality in Buddhism they hold these
as opposites and at the point of enlightenment and Buddhism
is to escape into Nirvana but of course this is
misunderstanding you can't escape into Nirvana because Nirvana is identical
to samsara form is formlessness so there is sort of
Nirvana with a lowercase n which is Nirvana as someplace
that you escape to but if there's a place that
you can escape to that means there's a place you
are escaping from which means that there's two places that
means - that means duality that means you're not actually
non-dual that means you're non duality is incomplete so to
truly attain nirvana is to realize that Nirvana is everywhere
and that you can't escape Nirvana because there's only one
place here now this is Nirvana if you can't realize
Nirvana now you never will and then closely related to
that is the duality between heaven and hell people think
that these are opposites in fact heaven is an absolute
heaven with a capital H heaven is here right now
heaven is nirvana heaven is ever-present you can't escape heaven
you can't go elsewhere to heaven because heaven is everywhere
but the problem is that you're creating a hell within
your own mind so even though you are in heaven
you don't realize you're in heaven because your ego creates
its own hell that's what the devil does the devil
is a fallen angel which creates its own hell right
in the middle of God see because the devil is
not separate from God the devil needs to imagine that
it's separate from God by creating a separation where within
his own mind by imagining it and therefore he creates
his own hell crystal clear alright we've gone to the
end of the list that is over 250 dualities for
you explained reconciled and transcended so there you go now
let's issue some concluding room ARC's to wrap all of
this together what is the significance of all this well
hopefully you're starting to see it hopefully you're thinking through
these examples and you're seeing just how radical it is
the stuff that I'm saying I'm saying very radical stuff
here if this isn't shocking to you if this isn't
threatening to you if this isn't triggering emotions of anger
and sadness in you then you're not getting it you're
not getting it yet this is heavy heavy heavy stuff
this is all the stuff they didn't teach you in
school all the stuff that science and philosophy doesn't understand
this is all the stuff that mainstream culture doesn't teach
you and the reason it doesn't is precisely because it's
so radical it's so twisted it's so paradoxical and it
requires lengthy explanations and it's very nuanced and sophisticated and
subtle as you can see you can easily fall into
various kinds of traps for example between duality and non-duality
or samsara and Nirvana and so forth so you know
yeah it took it took hours how many hours did
it take to explain all this a lot and you
still don't really understand what I talked about here we're
still just scratching the surface of all the ramifications of
non-duality so what I want you to understand is that
the world is not made out of atoms the way
you've been taught the world is made out of dualities
an atom is one instance of a duality if you
say that only I will not atoms maybe it's man
of quarks well a quark is also a duality not
only if not not quarks just made out of energy
energy is also due out no no Lily it's made
out of strings super strings that's also do well no
Leo its made out of something else some quantum foam
stuff that's also a duality anything that you say reality
is that's a duality so what I'm telling you here
is prior to more fundamental than and transcends any kind
of scientific explanation of reality that you can give now
you might say but Leo aren't dualities mental and not
physical that's the duality you have to grasp something here
which transcends language and thought I'm asking a lot of
you to understand this it takes a lot to be
able to understand what I'm saying here it's tricky stuff
you have to actually work through it you can't be
sloppy about thinking about this stuff the mistake you're making
if you're struggling to understand any of this is you're
trying to ground reality into some dualistic category such as
physical or non-physical body or mind matter or energy life
or death real or not real existence or nonexistence and
that is your fundamental error that will never work because
what's your assuming tacitly assuming is that reality has a
ground and what I'm telling you is that reality has
no ground that's what non duality means it's the collapse
of all grouts leading to the absolute which is what
the Buddhists call the Zen Buddhists call the groundless ground
groundless with the capital G ground with a capital G
the groundless ground is the realization that reality has no
ground and that is the ground you get it it's
beyond words and beyond thoughts and beyond symbols now you
might say well Leo aren't you contradicting yourself all the
time you're speaking and dualities everywhere every video of yours
I watch you're speaking dualities yes of course I speak
in dualities that's my point it's impossible to not speak
in dualities as long as your speaking speech is dualistic
all speech contradicts itself when taken far enough non-duality cannot
be spoken or written and if you do speak a
write about it it will always devolve into contradictions and
paradoxes it must because it's all inclusive and it's infinite
and unlimited so you can't formalize it all attempts at
formalizing reality at mapping it at modelling it ultimately must
fail because all maps and formalizations all equations all symbols
all systems all images all ideas all philosophies all doctrines
all books are finite things occurring within infinite reality so
all of those tools that you're trying to use are
too small the problem is that you're not realizing just
how vast reality is it's absolutely infinite and you need
to directly realize that rather than attempting to encapsulated into
some system some symbol or some formalization or some equation
which is why science will always fail as it is
done today because science right now is mostly done through
equations and all equations are finite and limited so you're
never gonna have a true unified theory of everything it's
always gonna be a finite theory that doesn't mean it's
wrong or bad it just means it's partial and not
complete you can have partial theories which are practical and
useful and that you know they they understand some very
narrow facet of of reality but they don't understand the
whole thing you have to really appreciate that there's a
big difference between understanding one part of reality in isolation
versus understanding the totality of it to understand the totality
of it you can't use the same methods and equations
and language even that you used for understanding a little
part of it there are two different kinds of thing
so understand that any time that you speak or write
non-duality instantly you've turned into duality and of course therefore
don't expect my speaking to be non dual my speaking
is dualistic and I'm honest about that I told you
from the very beginning many many episodes ago I told
you that everything I say is ultimately false because what
I do with actualize that already as I create maps
and models and theories various kinds of simplifications and that
really my teachings are pragmatic don't expect my teachings to
be the absolute truth my teachings are trying to guide
you towards a personal realization of the absolute truth and
I do claim that that's possible but my teachings are
not themselves apps of the truth nor will they ever
be nor have I ever been from the very beginning
from my very first video nor have I ever been
under the impression that anything I say is absolute truth
never have I been under that impression because I realized
back when I was still in university that that's not
possible so I've never even attempted to do that with
my work for the last 20 years I've known that
even long before I became a woke I understood that
the truth cannot be spoken so there's a very interesting
paradox here is that anything that your mind will say
will be dualistic including any refutation or affirmation of duality
or non duality you got that so for example if
I say that reality is dual is that true or
false it's false technically speaking if I say that reality
is non dual is that true or false it's also
false technically speaking at the same time there was a
hint of truth in both of those statements but yet
we can't really say anything about what reality is because
the nature of reality is such that is everything and
therefore you can't pin it down to any one thing
therefore anytime you say that reality is anyway technically you're
wrong so if you say reality is big you're wrong
because reality is also small if you say reality is
red you're wrong because it's also blue if you say
reality is human you're wrong because it's also not human
if you say reality is alive you're also wrong because
it's also not alive see are you getting that so
anytime that I say that reality is some way you
need to understand that I'm pointing to something I might
be getting at some partial truth but I'm not telling
you the whole truth it's a partial truth and that's
okay partial truths are valuable and useful you just have
to understand that they're partial you'd be surprised at how
many people confuse partial truths with total truths so the
whole trick here is not to exclude anything accidentally because
some people get stuck on this idea that there is
a god and other people get stuck on this idea
that there isn't a god and some people get stuck
on the idea that life is unfair and other people
get stuck on the idea that life is good and
it's all fair in the end who's right well it's
all of that and more and none it's everything see
the mistake is believing that you can say reality is
blank you can't say that the truth then you could
say is that reality is blank and leave it a
blank because that's what it is that blank signifies nothing
and everything you could fill that blank in with whatever
you want that's the nature of reality it gives you
total freedom it's like a it's like a variable that
is allowed to be anything that it wants to be
I eat like a universal variable so one thing you
should take away from everything in this series is that
from now on do not let anyone ever again fool
you with dualistic categories people will try to fool you
because they themselves are fooled and operating from duality so
your teacher or your professor or some book that you're
reading or some guru you're listening to or some political
person commentator that you listen to they will try to
frame reality in some sort of dualistic fashion using their
categories without being conscious that they created these categories and
they will try to foist these categories upon you they
will try to get you to accept these categories as
absolute truths and I want you to be wise enough
to realize that they are deluded and not to buy
into their categories because reality cannot be categorized because it
is infinite at the same time this is very very
important I am NOT saying that various categorization schemes are
useless and are bad I'm not saying that in fact
to navigate life effectively you need to be able to
wisely create categories that are functional in various kinds of
domains so it's not about rejecting all categories again it's
about being aware of the trickeries of how categories work
and being skillful at navigating them being skillful at drawing
them and redrawing them constructing them and deconstructing them you
see so again anything that you think I'm saying which
is exclusionary is you misunderstanding what I'm saying so if
I'm bad-mouthing science I'm not saying we need to exclude
science I'm saying we need to go beyond science if
I'm bad-mouthing categories I'm saying to abandon category I'm saying
we got to go beyond categories if I'm if I'm
bad-mouthing some political ideology that I don't agree with I'm
not saying that it's it it has no function or
that shouldn't exist I'm saying that we got to go
beyond it and it's partial all divisions are limited partial
and temporary all divisions are creations which must ultimately collapse
back into source which is emptiness or the groundless ground
let's quickly go over one more time what the absolutes
are let's sort of unify all the loot absolutes together
that we mentioned throughout this whole list we had all
of these terms and I'll be speaking right now are
gonna be uppercase letters so for example truth with an
uppercase T that's an absolute actual with an uppercase a
is an absolute existence being consciousness goodness love intelligence beauty
fairness power order mind selflessness the self wisdom unlimited unity
oneness wholeness infinity absolute of course non duality heaven life
creation enlightenment spirit God happiness peace perfection divinity eternity immortality
and mystery all of these are absolutes but the trick
is that any ideas that you have about what these
are are not the absolute they're just ideas relative ideas
but what you can do is you can do practices
like meditation self inquiry psychedelics yoga and so forth to
become conscious of the actual absolutes which I cannot communicate
to you here other than in this dualistic relative fashion
which I'm doing got it good but you still are
probably wondering but leo there's so many of these absolutes
how many of them are there shouldn't there only be
one absolute are you saying there's only one but then
what these they all seem different you know what what
does love have to do with infinity and what does
that have to do with with Eternity and so forth
well of course when you ask the question how many
absolutes are there you're bringing in you're sneaking in an
implicit duality of one versus many because you're asking the
question is there one absolute or than many absolutes and
the answer is oneness is identical to many Ness as
we've mentioned up above so the absolute is tricky in
this sense and that it is one the absolute is
one but at the same time it's also many it's
a whole that contains many parts or a good way
to think of it it's like a diamond with many
facets to it and so when you're doing psychedelic trips
or you're doing yoga or whatever you're become conscious various
aspects of the things that I said you're never going
to become conscious of everything that I said all at
once it's way too much way too much you're gonna
be glimpsing facets kind of like looking at a diamond
and only seeing one or two or three facets at
once but not the whole thing and you have to
kind of like spin it around look at it from
every angle to get a full sense of what it
is you see and a good metaphor that they have
in the Hindu traditions and in Buddhism as well I
think is the the blind men and the elephant parable
where you have an elephant and you have these five
blind men and each blind man is it's feeling some
different part of the elephant one of them is feeling
the foot another one is feeling the tail another feeling
the tusks another Fela is feeling that the snout or
at the nose another one is feeling the side and
each one explains what he's feeling but he can't see
because he's blindfolded so the one groping the tale says
it's like a rope the one groping delay says it's
like a tree trunk the one feeling the side of
the elephant says it's like a wall the one feeling
the Tusk says it's like some pointy thing and the
one feeling the nose says it's like a snake so
who is correct well of course they all are in
a sense because they're describing a part of one whole
elephant it's one elephant but they're scribing different parts to
really understand an elephant you got to really like exam
and all the different parts closely and it would be
a mistake for you to carve up the elephant in
two parts like you know get a butcher knife kill
the elephant and then cut up every part of the
elephant because you don't have the full elephant at that
point you split it up into into divisions you fragmented
it that might be useful if you want to learn
about each individual part but if you want to understand
the whole elephant in its totality you got to stand
far back and get a good overall view of the
whole thing and that's what we're doing here so you
might wonder at this point well leo but what's the
point of all this philosophy the point is that your
mind and your culture has fragmented reality just like carving
up an elephant with a butcher knife and now it's
time to put all these pieces back together and no
one is gonna do it but you your culture your
society your family your friends they're not gonna do it
for you science is not gonna do it for you
your guru is not gonna do it for you only
you can do it because ultimately you are the one
who created all these divisions not somebody else but you
you need to take responsibility for all the dividing that
you've done and you need to repent for your devilish
division divisionary ways and you need to awaken to unity
with a capital u so your job in this life
is to embrace all of yourself all of yourself not
some parts that you like all of yourself especially those
parts of yourself that you hate those parts of the
world that you hate those parts that you don't believe
are you you need to especially embrace those and become
conscious that they're you so the trick though is that
you need to do this unification without actually destroying the
forms and the opposites because it's possible to do a
simplistic naive sloppy unification wherein you reject division you reject
evil and hatred because you think that everybody should just
love each other there should be peace and no war
and there should be happiness and no sadness and there
should be good politicians but not bad politicians and there
should be unification but not division but if you do
it that way then you fail to actually unify the
divisions because a true absolute unifications means that you accept
division your tolerance of it because your nature is division
you see also it's very important that as you're doing
this unification that you don't remove distinctions unification is not
a lack of distinction you can have infinite distinctions and
unify them all so I'm not saying that you become
some simple-minded fool who can't tell the difference between a
man and a woman a cat and a dog a
a murder and some charity work or your right hand
and your left hand yeah you can still distinguish all
these things but at the same time you can realize
that all of them are part of the full bouquet
and diversity of your self and you could embrace them
all without hating them you can even embrace hatred without
hating the hater such that when you see people on
TV who are hateful and racists and terrorists and dictators
and corrupt politicians you look at them and you say
that's me that's what reality is that's truth that's God
now also it doesn't mean that you can't stop them
or vote against them in an election or that you
have to condone their actions and support their actions by
contributing money to them you can stop them so if
there's some politician you don't like you can vote against
him that's okay the point is that you don't hate
him and the point is that you understand why he
is the way he is and that you understand that
he is you you see your unification needs to be
so all-encompassing that you even embrace division and evil that's
how deep your love needs to go you need to
love indiscriminately which does not mean that you will by
devilry and that you tolerate people doing evil stuff around
you and that you become a do a doormat for
Devils that is not what I'm saying get that out
of your stupid mind awakening doesn't make you stupid and
simple-minded awakening actually makes you a more sophisticated and careful
thinker it increases your capacity to make distinctions but at
the same time it frees you of all distinctions and
it makes you aware of unity that's true non duality
let's do an exercise right now for unification of duality
think of any duality where you favor one side over
another side so for example masculine versus feminine maybe you
favor one over the other capitalism versus socialism maybe you
favor one over the other people versus corporations science versus
religion logic versus emotions good versus evil and so forth
find one example right now where you have a preference
for one over the other and where you tend to
discredit judge hate and demonize the other poll for example
you might think that masculinity is good and that femininity
is bad feminism has been ruining men and setting men
back and so forth so you find that example for
yourself good now unify them together realize that one is
intimately related to the other one is defined in terms
of the other and that actually both of them are
you your true nature includes both so if you hate
feminism then you need to acknowledge that actually feminism is
you you created feminism there's nothing wrong with feminism it
shouldn't not exist because it does feminism is true because
it exists and you need to embrace it as part
of yourself now does that mean that you need to
go put on lipstick if you're a man and high
heels and walk around outdoors and high heels no you
can still distinguish masculine from feminine you could still act
feminine I mean you can still act masculine if you
want to that's fine people have preferences there I'm not
saying that you need to be a half-man half-woman hybrid
or some you know someone who doesn't act masculine when
it feels right for you if you're a man I'm
just saying you need to you need to realize the
deeper unity between these things acknowledge the value and importance
of that inferior marginalized half that you've been hating judging
and rejecting that's difficult to do I'm asking your mind
to do something he doesn't want to do because we
get our attachments you know to one pole or another
pole like we're really attached to capitalism or socialism or
to science or to religion to the exclusion of the
other one but this is where real growth happens is
when you learn to do this unification this is how
you transcend hatred this is how you transcend having a
shadow this is how you transcend pathologies within spirituality and
personal development is by doing these sorts of unifications so
remember this exercise is not something you just do once
this is something you can keep doing for months every
single day you can find some new thing some new
duality and you can unify together using this exercise so
I highly recommend that you spend some time really working
with this in your journal in your commonplace book this
is something you'll you want to keep returning to again
and again because this is this is actually a part
of shadow work and I'll talk about shadow work in
the future because I know you guys want that episode
but here's the beginning of shadow work right here to
integrate your shadow unify all dualities the key mistake of
spiral dynamic stage blue religion and morality is that the
ego is so eager at that level of development to
grasp the absolute truth that in fact it turns the
truth into an absolute belief clinging to some relative human
categories so the whole tragedy of dogmatic religious people whether
they're Buddha Hindus Jews Christians or Muslims is is that
they have mistaken their beliefs in the absolute for the
actual absolute and it's precisely that clinging to their belief
which is keeping them from actual izing God Christ Shiva
Allah Yahweh or whatever else you see with this clinging
it leads to absolute istic behavior authoritarian tribal devilish behavior
and it leads to an int a fundamental inability to
understand evil and of course if you are not able
to understand evil that means that you will commit evil
so the the tragedy is that those people in the
world who are most passionate about eradicating evil are precisely
the source of the majority of the evil in the
world tada wishes why spoil dynamic stage Bleu is so
dangerous and so problematic and right now upwards of 70%
of the entire population on earth is spiral dynamics stage
blue or lower that's a big problem that's where a
lot of evil comes from so of course we can't
demonize them for being at stage blue they're not wrong
for being a stage blue it can't be helped it's
just evolution its development it has it's how it has
to be but but at the same time we do
want to help them to evolve upward out of blue
we need to help the rest of the world evolve
out of blue otherwise there's going to be a lot
of evil and a lot of devilry and the entire
world might ultimately collapse so from now on when you
think about the world I want you to be hyper
aware of the dualities and you're thinking I want you
to question every category and attempt to deconstruct it at
least as an intellectual exercise just to begin with ask
yourself some of the following questions when you're trying to
deconstruct a category what is this category grounded in for
example the category of masculine versus feminine what's it actually
grounded in what's its substance what's its reality notice that
whatever you grounded in will itself be another duality in
category so you're gonna want to ask then about that
one what's that one grounded in and what's that one
grounded in and so you keep going down the chain
until you get to the very bottom until you realize
that it's grounded in nothing and that's correct it's grounded
in nothing also ask yourself this question how does this
category contain aspects of its opposite for example with masculine
versus feminine you might say leo the masculine doesn't contain
any aspects of the feminine but of course it does
they're deeply interrelated because the more masculine you are for
example the more attracted you are to feminine and females
so isn't it ironic that some of the most masculine
men who oftentimes have a hatred for femininity and for
feminism on some ideological level at the same time they're
actually in love and get sexually excited by the most
feminine females and you see how how twisted and fucked-up
that is also ask yourself this question how are both
sides of this category good with an uppercase G so
for example if you think that feminism is bad and
evil and so forth ask yourself but how is it
good how is it good in the larger scheme of
things and what you might discover that is you might
discover well you know if I have a daughter in
the future it's gonna be good that there was a
feminist movement that gave her equal rights so she can
like open a bank account have her own credit card
so that she can drive her own car so that
she's not wearing some burqa like they do in Saudi
Arabia so that she can get a divorce if she's
married to some who abuses her because our legal system
gives her the right to do that whereas for example
in in certain countries like in Saudi Arabia you know
a woman she can get raped and she can't even
report it to the police or to the court system
because they're had her their culture and their and their
law is so backwards that actually they will blame the
woman for the rape and they will say well if
she got raped then she's actually she's she's like the
frivolous one she used the indecent one and so she
deserves punishment for the fact that she got raped you
see so isn't it nice that we have a feminist
movement here in in America or in Europe that has
done away with some of those really crude archaic gender
differences within society isn't that nice if you have a
daughter see that changes in your perspective a lot or
if you want to go even more radical consider this
in the next lifetime after this lifetime is over you
have a 50/50 chance of being born as a woman
so wouldn't it be nice if you're born as a
woman the there is such a thing as feminism see
so try that another question you can ask yourself is
how am i clinging to this category you should be
able to go inside of yourself introspect and feel an
emotional attachment or clinginess to whatever pull of this duality
that you're clinging to so if you're a male you're
gonna have this sort of need this need to argue
with me Leo Leo I got a bunch of arguments
for why feminism is evil and bad and all of
your arguments are wrong and Leo you're you're bad you're
deluded you're stupid and you're social just we're all let's
see that's what I mean that's a clinging that you
have feel that rather than being carried away with it
feel it and observe that clinginess realize that that's not
healthy it's not true that's your attachment and that's your
ego that's your delusion that you got to work through
and lastly ask yourself the question how am i trying
to ground all of reality into some kind of duality
what is the most fundamental duality for you is it
a duality between self and world between God and the
devil between matter and mind and you just keep insisting
that matter is what's true Leo it's matter everything's matter
or Leo everything is rational or Leo everything is everything
is just a energy that's how your grounding reality look
at that very very carefully in conclusion I just want
to stress that you will not transcend duality through thought
you cannot access the absolute through thought now that doesn't
mean that it's not useful to think about this stuff
you got to start somewhere you can't just go from
hearing this lecture and then jumping straight into full God
realization of the absolute like that like it's not gonna
happen you got to start to think about this stuff
because thinking is all you know how to do at
this point so yeah so think about it contemplate it's
all gonna be really good it's gonna be part of
a deconstruction process you're loosening up your mind you're opening
yourself up and then you can do meditation concentration yoga
psychedelics to to really access the absolute so you're going
to need both this is extremely tricky stuff extremely tricky
stuff if you're a psychedelic user and you like to
trip I recommend that you spend a lot of time
contemplating these dualities prior to your trips and then when
you go into your trip try to actually work on
one of these dualities pick one to focus on maybe
the one of like devil versus God or saying versus
insane although that one's tricky mmm good versus bad or
or you know matter versus energy pick one that appeals
to you that you're most fascinated by and then try
to work with that and contemplate it while you're in
the middle of your trip and what you should discover
that your trips become so much more profound and you
they become much more practical and you can grow so
much from them and then also you have now a
road map for hundreds of trips into the future how
many trips you want to do you wanna do 100
trips where every trip you dedicate to one of these
dualities I have 250 dualities for you here that's 250
trips worth at least and actually some of these dualities
are so profound that you'll need to trip multiple times
on each one like for example the duality between self
and other or self and God that one you can
do 10 20 30 trips just on that duality to
really fully plumb the depths of of what that really
means and if you do that you'll be one highly
woke if you succeed in that of course be careful
it won't be easy to transcend all these dualities will
be a the work of your lifetime it is the
reason that you're here on this earth is to understand
this stuff to understand yourself as God so there you
go but the question is did you actually fathom the
depth of what was said here in this series be
careful well don't assume that you did this is very
advanced stuff I don't know anything more advanced than this
this is a very profound topic it's not enough to
just talk about it you really gotta experience it you
have to really do some serious deconstruction on yourself conceptual
understanding will not be enough but it's a good place
to start so let's start there as always don't believe
what I said verify for yourself don't treat me it
as any kind of authority figure nothing I say hinges
on my authority it all hinges on direct experience so
my claim is very empirical my claim is that if
you explore these dualities for yourself you will find that
they will collapse and many of the things that I
said here will seem very true for you that's my
claim I could be wrong so verify for yourself you
know hey maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm deluded maybe I'm
crazy you don't know from your point of view you
don't know don't trust me verify do the research do
your own experiments and be a good scientist be a
good philosopher and that is the end all right but
of course as we've talked about the end is always
a new beginning so there's much more to come please
click that like button for me come also check out
actualize that org look at my blog I'm posting new
stuff there all the time check out the life purpose
course check out the forum ask your questions there I
spent a lot of my energy and time on the
forum answering people's questions so they make good use of
it and the last thing that I'll tell you is
that yes these are very long-winded episodes multiple parts but
you will be rewarded for sticking through it this work
takes dedication this is not something you do by just
browsing through YouTube randomly watching a video here or watching
a video they're screwing around this really takes serious work
this is radical and cutting-edge stuff and I know that
at times it can seem impractical and very abstract and
philosophical but there's a there's a method to the madness
there's a deeper wisdom here that I'm trying to guide
you towards and you have to have a certain kind
of vision and faith that it's gonna pay off the
work the time that you spend studying taking notes just
even listening to videos maybe listening to them multiple times
contemplating for yourself all of this is a lot of
work yes the distraction from your business and from your
family for whatever stupid stuff you do every day but
on the other hand what else is there to do
in life you got something better to do you got
somewhere else to be that's more important than this who
else is talking to you like this who else is
teaching you these things who else is explaining this stuff
at this level of depth to you this is rare
stuff so don't take it for granted remember that our
goal here is to build a massive skyscraper we're not
just building a simple little three-story house we're building a
massive skyscraper with your personal development and your spirituality so
that's what your life is going to be is gonna
be a massive skyscraper and that's gonna take a big
investment a bigger one than building a three-story house and
that's gonna require time to really dig and lay a
proper foundation which is gonna be able to bear the
weight of this massive structure you're gonna build on top
of it in this work so don't get discouraged console
yourself and your toughest times when you feel depressed when
you feel lazy when you feel like you're not getting
the results that you've been expecting that it's taking longer
than you thought when you're struggling when you're frustrated when
you've got some emotional issue that you're struggling with and
just keep reminding yourself that you're doing all this for
some very large vision in the end you know we're
not working towards something small here we're not just working
towards a million dollars we're not just working to some
relationship well we're working towards omniscience of the entire universe
we're working towards immortality we're working towards total God realization
we're working towards sainthood we're working towards infinite love we're
working towards infinite understanding this is what we're working towards
so yeah it's gonna take some work it's gonna take
some time be patient hold the vision learn how to
motivate yourself pace yourself build momentum over time invest in
the practices gradually it's a lot of stuff it's very
easy to get overwhelmed because I share so much I
can see how this would be so overwhelming for most
newcomers so you're gonna have to break it up into
piece by piece and eat the elephant one piece at
a time as they say um and of course understand
that everything that I've talked about so far is still
just the tip of the iceberg there's so much more
which is why you should stick around there's many new
topics that are coming stuff that I haven't ever said
before so don't just think that I'm a broken record
and that all I talk about is duality and non-duality
know there's a ton of other stuff you'll be amazed
and shocked by all the practical and useful stuff that
I'll have for you in the future so make sure
you stay tuned for that you
