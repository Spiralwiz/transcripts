Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about the big picture of
self actualization, the essential components of this path. So maybe
you've been wondering, and you've been asking yourself, like Leo,
give me a high level overview of self actualization. Because
this word self actualization, or personal development, these are abstract
labels, who really knows what it means? So is there
something more concrete to it? Or is it just as
abstract label? What is the essence of self actualization? If
there is such a thing? And what's it really going
to look like if I undertake this process over the
next 1020 30 years of my life, and I change
myself? What will I be changing myself into, because I
want to get a good idea of that before I
really commit to it and pull the trigger. So that's
what we're going to cover here, I'm going to give
you the high level components of this path. So because
they're high level, they're going to be a bit abstract.
Stay with me, though, there's value in abstraction, because you're
going to get to see a very big picture overview
of a lot of stuff here. And this will save
you years, literally years of dead ends, going down various
rabbit holes that you don't need to go down, because
this is the essence of it right here. And I'm
going to be talking about various components here, there's going
to be quite a bit, they will all gel together
for you, you'll probably recognize many of them already that
you've been doing. And maybe you didn't even know you
were doing them. But also, what I want to stress
here is that the order of the components is going
to be different for everybody. And even though I'm going
to be articulating them in a linear sequence, that's not
necessarily how it's going to work for you, right, I
just need to speak them in some sort of sequence.
So the sequence is rather arbitrary. But let's begin from
the top, basically, where all this starts is with the
component of a deep need for growth. So you need
to recognize there's a deep need for growth in you.
That's sort of the beginning of this path. And how
you come to that recognition could vary, it could be
that you just intuit that there's a lot more to
being a human being, then society has told you that
your family has demonstrated to you that your friends have
been able to actualize so you sense that there's something
more you Intuit it with your right brain, and therefore
you want it and that's why you're here. Or the
other alternative is suffering. Maybe you've tried all these different
dead ends, you've tried becoming successful, you've tried earning a
lot of money, you've tried having sex, and you've tried
getting married, and all this stuff, somehow it felt flat,
didn't really work for you. And now you need a
in fact, not only their fall flat, but really, it's
created a lot of misery for you, and you're so
stuck in this misery that you're looking for any way
out, and you're very desperate, and you'll take whatever you
can get. So either way, you're recognizing a deep need
for growth there, then what has to happen is the
component of taking 100% responsibility for your life, so that
you can't play victim games anymore, so that you can't
blame other people for your problems anymore. So that you're
taking control, you're taking ownership. And you're deciding, basically, that
everything that happens in your life has been created by
you, even without maybe you being aware of it. It
was created by you, and that your life is pretty
much a reflection of how you think, how you act,
and the desires you have, and your entire emotional and
psychological makeup. And that you have the power to change
this stuff. If you take ownership of it, even though
it might be difficult to change some of this stuff.
So taking ownership doesn't mean that it's going to be
easy. But that's an important component. The next really big
component is to discriminate reality from appearance. This is a
huge component. So this component we might call finding the
truth, or undertaking a pursuit of the truth. Now, there's
various levels of truth. There's truth to the lowercase t
which is important. There is truth with the capital case
T. The absolute truth that's also very important for this
work. You're going to need to pursue both of those
levels. And it's going to begin first of all with
just massive self education. You need to commit yourself to
lifelong learning and to be learning every single day, to
be reading, to be studying to be taking notes to
be getting the theory. Because see, the problem is, some
people will say, well, Leo, getting the theory isn't, isn't
important. In fact, it's a distraction. No, you see, it's
very important, because without even the theory, you are like
the average person, which is you're completely clueless, as to
what you need to be doing in your life, you
have no vision for your life, you can't envision anything,
you don't know what self actualization means, you don't know
the process that you're going to be going through, you
don't know any of the traps that you're gonna be
falling into. So you're just going to be stumbling around.
To successfully navigate a landscape that is foreign to you,
it helps to have a map. And the way you
get a map is through massive self education. You need
to figure out why the stuff in your life that
you've been trying to do hasn't been working. There's very
deep and good psychological reasons why not. And you need
to start to learn to discriminate reality from appearance. Because
see, most people are pretty naive. And they take appearances
to be reality, then after a certain amount of time,
the appearances don't work very well for you get lost
in the appearances. And then you start to learn the
importance of discriminating the appearances from reality. That means you
have to take a sort of analytical process, to your
appearances, all the appearances of life, appearances in relationships, appearances,
in business appearances, existentially all these different appearances are everywhere.
And you need to sort through that stuff, and discover
how reality actually works. Discover how your mind actually works,
how happiness actually works, how emotions actually work, how finances
actually work, how relationships actually work. A lot of this
stuff is very counterintuitive and doesn't work the way that
you think it should work. You see. And that's a
process. And no one can do that for you. And
your teachers are not going to do that for you.
I can't really do that for you. I mean, I
try with actualize that org, this is what we're here
for is to is to help you to build this
conceptual understanding. Now some people say, well, conceptual understanding is
just going to lead to delusion. Now, I'm not saying
that conceptual understanding is where you stop. I'm not saying
that conceptual understanding is sufficient for all your growth needs.
No conceptual understanding is just the foundation. It's the launching
point. So you know, the destination, you know, the right
things, you know, the wrong things, you know, what you
should be doing, what you shouldn't be doing. And then
you can go deeper and further and then you can
start to embody those things. But you can't embody these
things unless you know them first. You see, unless you
recognize all the appearances and all the stuff you've been
doing wrong in the past. So a big component of
self actualization is understanding how reality actually works, rather than
how you've been told, or how you think, or how
you want, or how you believe, based on your ideological
predilections. That another important component, which is part of this
discrimination of reality, for appearance is epistemic and metaphysical questioning.
So not only do you need to learn the practical
aspects of how reality works, like relationships, and emotions, and
so forth, but then you need to get existential on
this stuff. And you need to really ask some deep
questions about what is the very fabric and structure of
reality of myself of other people of life? You need
to also be asking yourself epistemic questions, which I've covered
a lot in the past in various episodes, about what
it means to know things. And you need to really
study various epistemic traps, and how your mind deludes you
into closed mindedness into paradigm locks into various webs of
belief and ideologies which prevent you from educating yourself and
being able to discriminate between reality and appearance. It see,
if you don't understand epistemology, you're going to have a
really tough time just sorting through the wheat and the
chaff of all the material all the information that's out
there, because there's a lot of information out there these
days. A lot of conspiracy theories and various religions and
cults and and this and that, how do you know
what's true, and what's worthwhile to pursue and what's not.
It could take years for you just to discriminate that.
See. After you've done that, and if you're doing a
lot of metaphysical questioning as well, eventually you're going to
break through to a glimpse of the Absolute, there is
such a thing as truth to the capital T, it
can be called the absolute. There's many other names for
reality, God, and so forth. What that is, I'm not
going to go into here, but suffice it to say
that you're gonna get a glimpse of this thing. And
it's going to be the most mind blowing thing you've
ever encountered in life. And it's going to be the
most rewarding thing. And you're gonna have an instant recognition
that this is what life is about is the absolute.
And that's a big component of self actualization is glimpsing
the absolute. Usually, when you first get it, it's just
a glimpse, it leaves you, then you need to pursue
it deeper, that's when you get serious about this work,
because you see just how amazing the potential here is.
So once you've glimpsed the absolute, and even maybe if
you've grasped the absolute for a while, then the work
becomes about getting the truth, this absolute to penetrate through
into all of your everyday experience. So that it's not
just some state that you inhabit when you're meditating. But
that it's your living being, you're embodying it, everything from
the way you walk to the way you talk to
the way you think, to the way that you relate
to people, all of it is permeated by this absolute.
That's the ultimate place that you want to get to.
And then it's a matter of how do you actually
do that. So let me give you some components that
will help you to understand what it really means to
get the truth to penetrate into your everyday experience. This
truth is transcendent, you see, so really, this is what
spirituality is about is getting transcendence to penetrate into your
everyday experience. And this is why spirituality gets criticized a
lot is because a lot of people who act spiritual
or pretend like they're spiritual, don't actually manifest it or
aren't able to embody it. Because they just, you know,
they talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.
So the other component here is growth. What is growth,
as far as self actualization is concerned, it basically it's
raising the quality of your consciousness. If you want to
boil everything down to this is basically the quality of
your consciousness. Because what is the absolute, the absolute is
consciousness, it's the one thing amidst all the vastness of
all the appearances. So you're discriminating reality from appearances. And
ultimately, you discriminate everything down to just one thing. And
that one thing is consciousness. That's it. That's the only
one thing that's reliable, everything else is appearance. You know,
it's easy to state it that way. It's a very
simple formulation. But the ram of the full ramifications of
this will take years to percolate through your entire life.
And it'll take work. Another component here is unconditional love,
the ability or the capacity to have unconditional love in
all situations, with all people. This is a tall order
to fill. This is actually a very good litmus test
of your growth. So as you're growing, if you're developing
more and more capacity to be unconditionally loving, especially with
people in situations that go against your agenda, that go
against your ego, that go against all your selfish drives
and motives. This is a real test of how much
you've grown and how much you've self actualized. This unconditional
love not only applies to other people in situations, but
also of course applies to yourself. So a big component
of self actualization is self acceptance. self acceptance is unconditional
love apply to yourself. And what that means is that
you accept yourself not in the way like some people
think like well, I'm going to, I'm going to do
all this personal development work and then my life is
gonna be perfect. And I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna
have my relationships and my business and my finances and
my career and everything is going to be is handled
and then because of that, you know, because now I
get some some new haircut and I dress nice and
I drive a fancy car and you know, I'm, I'm
attractive to the opposite sex or whatever, that now because
of that, now I can accept myself finally. No, that's
not self acceptance. self acceptance means you accept yourself warts
and all. Without needing to create a certain external circumstances
for yourself all that stuff I was describing, that's all
external circumstance. So that's unconditional love with yourself. You'll notice
that as you're truly growing, if you're truly growing you
accept yourself more and more and more and more and
more, you care about what other people think of you
less and less and less and less, until you feel
complete, without needing to do or be anything at all.
That's the ultimate level that you're trying to get to.
Another component is detachment. This is a huge, very important
component, and a very misunderstood component. What this means is,
you will be detaching yourself from all experience, all thoughts,
all emotions, and all actions. That means you're not attached
to the fruits of your actions. A lot of people
misunderstand attachment, which I'll have to shoot a new episode
on in the future, because this is very counterintuitive. People
will immediately object and say Leo detached, but that's not
what I want. What I want is I want more
feeling. It sounds like when you say detachment, I'm going
to become some sort of like, Terminator cold hearted robot.
And that's not what I want to grow into. But
no, you see, that's a, that's a confusion right there.
This is a very counterintuitive point. Actually, when I talk
about detachment, that means feeling deeper, feeling more fully than
you currently feel. It means lots of empathy and lots
of compassion, but in a detached way. See, actually, the
reason that you can't feel fully is because you're attached
to stuff you're attached to experiences to having particular experiences
the good ones, and you're attached to particular thoughts or
ideologies, or belief systems, you're attached to certain emotions, of
course, the good ones, not the bad ones, and you're
attached to your actions producing particular results, because the reason
you're taking action is so that you can manipulate yourself
and your life and your circumstances so that you can
then experience the emotions that you're attached to. And that
whole mechanism of delusion has to be broken down and
seen for what it is. And when you do break
that down, then the next component is going to be
being the capacity simply to be versus doing or having.
And this is a 180 degree switch in your orientation
towards life. Right now, if you're like the average person,
your orientation is doing and having, you're doing stuff, and
you're trying to acquire stuff, so that you can get
those emotions, or those thoughts or those experiences that you're
attached to. If you let that go, then you'll be
able to actually be the the other orientation is just
the being orientation, where you derive a lot of satisfaction,
pleasure from just being in the present moment. And here
you're able to deep to deeply feel, and really savor
existence. And this is the most beautiful and rewarding and
satisfying thing that there is, this is where true satisfaction
comes from. You don't get satisfaction from doing it from
having, even though you might think you do you do
but only for a very short period of time. And
then you always crash. It's like a sugar high. So
instead, what you want is you want to steady consistent
satisfaction derived from the being level. And then also, this
feeds into the self acceptance. Because when you're just being
you feel complete, you don't need to do anything to
accept yourself. Whereas when you're doing and having that becomes
a never ending cycle of you doing stuff in order
to feel valuable, to feel worthy to feel significant, to
feel lovable, to feel complete. And that never ends because
the only way to end that cycle is to end
it with being. But that requires some counterintuitive thinking. Because
that cycle generally never ends, it keeps going to doing
cycle the doing and having cycle never stops. You see
people who are in their 70s and 80s and are
still caught in the doing and having cycle. See. The
next component is developing the capacity for observation. This is
very important. And this dovetails with that component about discriminating
reality from appearance. The way that you do that fundamentally
and the way that you learn and the way that
you understand is simply really through observation. very precise, very
objective, very dispassionate and careful and steady, long term observation.
You just sit there and you observe whatever you're interested
in. You observe it very carefully. And you especially most
of all, observe yourself, your own Self, you very carefully
watched yourself as if you were studying a chimp in
a zoo. Like a scientist would study a chimp in
a zoo. And you carefully observe how your mind works,
how your emotions work, and you especially watch out for
all your self deceptive, mental tendencies and your self biases.
So your self agenda, what is it that the ego
in you wants out of life, and all the little
sneaky stuff that it does to manipulate you, and getting
you to go along with that. So you have to
just carefully observe that and you have to become a
very good observer. So a sub component of this is
developing mindfulness. That's why mindfulness is such an important component.
That's why meditation is such an important component, because what
are these things, also self inquiry, also contemplation in a
sense, these are all ways of building your capacity for
just observation. Not for analysis, per se, but observation. There's
a big difference. A lot of academics are great at
analysis, but are poor at observation. And they go astray.
Si, B, because when you get caught in analysis, you
get into mental masturbation, you come up with all sorts
of theories about how reality works. But you haven't observed
the facts enough, yet, you haven't really studied direct experience
enough yet. And you haven't done that, because it's not
easy. These are capacities that need to be developed and
cultivated over years and decades. You don't just sit down
and observe yourself for 10 minutes, and then you're done.
You need to observe yourself over and over and over
again, day after day after day for years, to see
what's really going on with you, with society at large
with people that you relate to, and so forth. The
next component is undermining selfish impulses, you have all these
selfish impulses, once you observe them, for a long time
you become aware of them, then it becomes time to
start to undermine them. restrict yourself and all your lower
consciousness tendencies and desires. And ultimately can be purging and
weeding those out. The next component is honesty. Honesty is
huge. When you're trying to pursue truth and sought out
reality from appearance. Honesty, not just with other people. But
with yourself, especially this work requires brutal self honesty, you
need to be really honest about how you deceive yourself,
how you lied to yourself, all your secret desires, all
the ways that you manipulate people and situations. And why
you do what you do, why you really do what
you do. Not the excuses that you give yourself. Which
leads to the component of surrendering control and giving up
manipulation. So most people, when they do personal development, when
they first start for them, it's a process of hey,
let me get more control over my life. Because the
problem has been the reason I'm not happy is because
I don't have sufficient control. If I had more control
over my finances, and over my career, and over my
relationships, and over myself, then everything would be solved. But
that ends up being wrongheaded. Because this is a very
counterintuitive process. So instead, you need to surrender control. If
you're really growing, it's not about acquiring more control. It's
about recognizing that really, there's no one in control, and
that the more you try to be in control, the
less satisfied you're going to be. Because control feeds into
that whole attachment cycle of the doing and the having
When you surrender your changing orientation into the being. surrendering
control and manipulation, why you control and manipulate well, to
get the emotions and experiences that you are attached to,
that you want to cling to. And then of course,
you suffer because you realize, ultimately that you can't have
control and you can't cling to those things forever. Everything
great that you're clinging and chasing is going to end.
I hate to break it to you. But you got
to face that. And that's another important component of this
path is facing some harsh truths. Facing your death, facing
boredom facing emptiness. And not getting depressed and bummed out
about it. facing them in a in a sort of
stoic and sober way. Another component here is identifying fear
barriers that you have and your characteristic defense mechanisms. All
of us have different It's mechanisms. It's the way that
we keep ourselves stuck where we are. And we all
have fear barriers, fear about money, fear about losing security,
fear about losing a relationship. And our defenses are like,
well, but I have certain ideologies and certain beliefs that
I have about how life works, all those are a
part of my defense system. So you need to identify
those and then just start dropping them, or undermining them
in some way. Because those are all keeping you stuck.
Another component here is raising the quality of your motivations
and desires. So most of the things that you're motivated
by, and that you desire are low costs and stuff
that you've been programmed with by culture and society. And
it's not healthy. And there's no way that you're going
to become happy when your motivations are things like money,
sex, success, fame, popularity, approval, getting love from external sources,
security, these low consciousness sort of desires, also the motivation
and desire for stimulation. That's a big one. That right
there in a nutshell, describes most people's lives, those five
or six motivations that I just listed. And even there,
they're motivated in negative ways to pursue these things. It's
terrible. Not only do you have low consciousness desires, but
you're also trying to use negative motivation to pursue them,
it's completely absurd, this will never work. Another component is
becoming a creator. Which means for me, what that means
is life purpose, finding your life purpose, getting clear about
what you actually want to contribute to this world, what
impact you want to have, specifically with your career. Because
like it or not, you need to be here, you
need to be productive as a human being, otherwise, you're
not going to be able to pay your rent and
feed yourself. And so that's a very practical matter. But
also you want to be able to pay your rent
and feed yourself in high consciousness manner, in a way
that is allowing you to fulfill your full potential, and
to experience the joy of being a creator of being
an artist. And I use the label artists here pretty
broadly. So that's finding your life purpose, I have a
whole course about that. So I can't go into it
here. It's a very deep topic. But basically, you want
to become a creator. Because if you don't become a
creator, what's going to happen is you're going to get
something by default. And what you're gonna get by default
is just a lame, boring nine to five job, which
is really low consciousness, where your boss, guess what your
boss, he's not going to be a high consciousness enlightened,
you know, Buddha, your boss is just going to be
some jerk who wants to drive a Lamborghini, and who
wants to, you know, bang more girls, and he's going
to be running his business in that fashion. To get
him more girls and more Lamborghinis. And when you are
able to discriminate the truth, from appearances, you will see
through that whole thing through that illusion. And so at
that point, you don't want to be working for that
person anymore. You want to be doing something meaningful with
your life. See, another component of this work is reconciling
evil, suffering and ignorance. This is an important component for
unconditional love. See, a lot of people really get hung
up on misunderstanding, evil, suffering and ignorance. They think that
other people out there are evil. Well, you need to
discover through careful self observation, and brutal self honesty is
actually that you are the evil one. Nobody out there
is evil or than you. You see, you're the evil
one. And that takes, that takes a lot of guts
to swallow that. To start to understand what evil really
is. To start to start to understand what other people's
suffering really is, where suffering comes from, where ignorance comes
from, see, it's easy to be hating other people, calling
them evil and ignorant and so forth. When you haven't
really looked deeply within yourself to see the evil, suffering
and ignorance that is residing within you. Once you see
it deeply within yourself, you're never ever going to criticize
anyone else for it. Because you're really going to have
a holistic understanding of the whole evil suffering ignorance mechanism.
That's what I call reconciling these things. It'll take you
years to really think about this stuff. And puzzle it
out. Another important component here speaking of holistic understanding, is
pursuing big picture understanding. So part of this process of
discriminating reality from appearance is that you're going to need
to go for the big picture, to really understand things
at the big picture level, in life, in relationships, and
in psychology at the existential level, you know, big picture,
holistic understanding. It's not enough just to discriminate in some
little narrow analytical fashion. No, you need to get the
big picture, where a lot of intelligent people go wrong
is that they lack holistic, big picture understanding, because they
don't really pursue it, because mostly, they're pretty left brained
in their approach to understanding reality. Which leads to the
next component of this path is that as you develop,
you're going to notice yourself going more from your left
brain, to your, to your right brain, in the way
that you operate. Left brain thinking is very logical and
analytical and calculating, and right brain is more emotional, it's
more holistic, it's more integrated, it's more spiritual. In fact,
there's a lot of interesting neuroscience that's been done. But
your ego basically resides in your left brain, the left
brain is inhibiting the holism potential of the right brain,
and enlightenment. Where does that occur? Well, enlightenment itself is
an absolute doesn't really occur anywhere. But insofar as it
permeates your mind and your brain, it occurs in the
right brain. Right? Because enlightenment is the ultimate, the ultimate
form of holism, non duality, everything is non dual, everything
is one to see that requires the use of your
right brain, not your left. That doesn't mean you never
use your left brain anymore, you can still think and
you can still be logical when you need to be.
But you don't use logic to run your life. See,
use your intuition to run your life. And you use
your logic to serve your intuition. That's going to happen
to you as you grow. There's no way that can
happen to you. It's a good metric. And then another
very important component is what I'm going to call creating
a sonic lifestyle. Sonic what does this mean? This is
a Hindu term basically. The way it's how can I
describe this? Well, basically, it means living a sober sort
of lifestyle. That's what it means. Because most people what
kind of lifestyle we live in these days, we're living
an intoxicated lifestyle, the opposite of a saatvik lifestyle, which
is where you're always distracted, intoxicated by all this stuff
in our culture, our culture is very decadent. And it's
very easy to lose yourself in video games, movies, tabloids,
the news, conspiracy theories, so on and so forth, you
know, food, drugs, alcohol, stimulants, stimulation of every kind, this
is what we mean by intoxication. To create a psychotic
lifestyle, it means you have to let go of that
stuff purify your mind and your physical body. This means
becoming addiction free, free of all the different chemical addictions
out there. And of course, by addictions, I don't just
mean chemical substances. I also mean, a lot of the
stuff that are stuff like addiction to porn, addiction to
video games, addiction to YouTube and social media, in your
smartphone and all that you also need to become distraction
free. Because right now your mind and your life is
so distracting, that you can't sit down and you can't
discriminate the truth from appearances and toxicity free. So you
put so much toxic stuff into your body and into
your environment, from your food, to your water to the
things that you are drinking, to the things that you're
watching to the things that you're listening to the information
that you're receiving, to the people that you surround yourself
with. There's a lot of toxicity there that needs to
be eliminated. And also your physical body and your energy
body. We might call it your energy body. But there's
a lot of there's a lot of blocks in your
body that are psychosomatic in the sense that it's sort
of like the physical and the psychological coming together. So
you actually right now probably if you're like most people
carry a lot of energy blockages, physical energy blockages in
your body, which will be removed if you do deep
psychological work, because you carry various stresses and tensions and
fears and anxieties and neuroses and all that stuff it
manifests physically in your body. Don't think that all that
stuff just is held here in the brain? Not at
all. So some people are so blocked up energetically, that
they they actually destroy their bodies. They can't even function
physically, they can't get out of bed in the morning,
or they can't go to sleep at night because they're
so stressed their mind and their body is so overstimulated
and toxified. That, how are you going to really grow
yourself and do all this subtle discriminating work? How are
you going to develop all this understanding and have the
discipline to really change yourself, if you are living this
intoxicated, decadent sort of lifestyle, it's just not going to
happen. Another important component here is undoing social conditioning. There's
a lot of stuff that your culture has filled your
mind with various ideas, beliefs, various paradigms, various morals and
standards, and rules that need to be questioned and done
away with. And that means overcoming a lot of childhood
programming, a lot of school programming. A lot of the
stuff that I'm talking about with actualize that org runs
counter to many of the things that you've been taught,
with your spiritual tradition, with your religion, with your school,
with your family, and so forth. And you need to
really sit down and question a lot of that stuff
that's really part of your ability to discriminate the truth
from appearances. Another very important component here that we shouldn't
forget is non manipulative, relating. You need to, at some
point, become very honest with yourself about how much you
manipulate other people in your relationships, and that most of
your relationships are a manipulation games. I don't just mean
intimate relationships, I mean, your family, I mean, your, your
children, I mean, your co workers, your boss. I mean,
where does it end, every person that you're relating to,
you're relating to in a very manipulative manner. And it's
gonna take you a lot of self observation, work to
realize all the ways in which you manipulate because your
manipulations are sneaky, they're so sneaky, that you yourself are
not aware of them yet. But as you grow, you
will become aware. And as you become aware, you will
need to let that stuff go. Let it go, let
it go. Let it go, let it go, let your
ego go let yourself agenda go so that you're not
manipulating everybody around you. That's not easy to do, requires
a lot of awareness to do that. requires courage to
because as you stop manipulating, if you're a relationship oriented
person, you derive a lot of satisfaction and pleasure from
relationships, then you're probably going to want to this is
going to be threatening to you, right? Because, hey, the
reason that I'm manipulating people is so that I can
keep I'm in relationships intact. What happens if I stopped
being manipulative? Well, maybe there's a risk of me losing
some of my important relationships. But see, I'm caught in
a trap in the cycle of being attached and cleaned
to all my relationships. So I need to keep being
manipulative. And so it just becomes this never ending cycle
of manipulation. And very ironically, this ends up souring and
ruining all your relationships. Your relationships can only really flourish,
when you stop using them for social for selfish gratification,
and in a manipulative fashion. That requires a lot of
awareness and self honesty to accomplish. So those are the
components that I really wanted to share with you. I'll
just throw out a couple of final ones. Basically, as
you're self actualized, and you're going to be coming, you're
going to be becoming very strategic, very decisive, very proactive
and visionary in the way that you approach your life.
Most people are not these things at all. They're the
opposite of strategic, decisive, proactive and visionary. There's going to
need to be a deep recognition in you that this
growth takes serious work. This is not going to happen
spontaneously. It's not gonna happen. By accident, one day that
bam, you have some sudden epiphany, and all of a
sudden, you're in line and everything is fixed and boom,
you got all taken care of, it's not gonna happen
like that. There's no pill you can buy there's no
you know, there's no secret meditation technique that will fix
it all for you. This is going to take some
discernment, some real digging into the details, right? The devil
of this work is in the details. And also, you're
going to need to be building your infrastructure, which I've
talked about before setting up the right environment for you.
Make sure part of your being strategic means set up
your environment so that you have the resources and things
that will enable you rather than hinder you to accomplish
all these things that I've been talking about above. And
that's it That's the essence of this path. Now, like
I said already, it's not necessarily going to happen in
this order. This is a messy process, I laid it
out in a sort of linear fashion. It's not at
all going to happen in this order, all the components
could happen simultaneously, or one by one, or they can
be spread out 10 years, across time, you see, it's
all going to depend on you where you are, what
your capacities are, what your resources are, what your environment
is, you know, a lot of different factors go into
this. Now, I know that what I said here is
rather abstract. And what you would like is you would
like more specific ways of accomplishing these things. So for
example, you might be wondering, well, Leo, this sounds good.
And I have a sort of a big picture understanding
now. But how do I become more unconditionally loving? And
how do I face my death and emptiness? And how
do I reconcile evil and ignorance? And how do I
pursue holism? And how do I have a more Sofic
lifestyle? How do I do all this stuff? Well, I
have a lot of episodes that do cover those in
detail. But also, there will be more in the future
where I get a little more specific and concrete. And
I give you the low level details. Here, I wanted
to keep it abstract. For the purposes of the big
picture, the value of having the big picture is that
now you can use this to really guide yourself, you
can go find the techniques, there are many, many, many
hundreds, hundreds of techniques out there that can be used
to accomplish all this stuff. I don't even know all
the techniques, it would take decades to study and research
all the techniques. So that's going to be part of
life. Part of your process is researching and trying different
techniques and seeing which ones work for you and which
ones don't. Different techniques work for different people. What I
want to conclude with is just I want to underscore
here that you are not a special person, you are
not some unique snowflake, who has special needs that are
different from all other human beings. You need to recognize
that you are a machine, you're a biological, human machine.
And as this machine, this body and this brain and
this mind, and everything that comes along with it, the
psychology of a human being is pretty well understood, it's
been pretty well understood in certain parts of the world
for 1000s of years now. It's just that culture has
done a terrible job of informing you. Your culture, mass
culture, mass media, Western society does a terrible job of
informing you of what the needs are, of this machine
that you are of what's best for it. It doesn't
give you an operation manual. In fact, culture does worse
than not give you an operation manual. It seduces you
into doing all the wrong stuff, It intoxicates you not
just in the chemical way. But in a lot of
psychological ways that intoxicates you. And unless you seriously make
an effort to go against this trend, you're just going
to go with the flow. And if you're going to
go with the flow, you're going to do what 99%
of people are doing, which is that they're just continuing,
continuing this cycle of intoxication that our culture has filled
them with. But here, you have gotten the keys, you
know better now, this is a rare opportunity for you.
Most people never get this big picture. They never really
understand what growth is about what their potential is what
they should be doing. And so now you have been
informed, but of course you're still intoxicated. So this is
a problem because now you need to start to work
on removing your intoxication, and aligning yourself with this process.
By the way, it doesn't really matter whether you are
a Christian or Buddhist or Hindu or a Muslim, or
an atheist or whatever fashion wish you want to be
growing and developing yourself spiritually or otherwise, doesn't matter. All
of this is going to be basically following this path
that I outlined for you. There's a lot of different
ways to grow a lot of different schools and traditions
and techniques out there and they will use different language,
metaphors and descriptions to explain what I just basically explained
here. If there is a tradition out there with just
generating true growth for you, it's going to be having
these key components, which I mentioned here, it might be
talking about them in different language, it might be emphasizing
different things, it might be giving you very different techniques,
you might not see that all these techniques are basically
pointing towards the same thing, until you do a very
deep and broad holistic survey of all the stuff that's
out there, and then you start to see the commonalities.
But it doesn't matter. If you're going to be growing
yourself as a human being, then this is basically how
it's gonna work. These are the components. If you ignore
some of these components, you're gonna be missing important pieces.
And a lot of teachings out there, they are missing
important pieces. They make you think like they're complete, and
that they're whole, but they're actually not, they only give
you a partial perspective, which is why I really like
the approach of studying many traditions, many schools, many different
techniques, many different teachers, I study hundreds of different sources,
so that I make sure that there are no gaps
in my understanding, and I have the biggest possible picture
that can be assembled. And so basically, what's going to
happen is that you will either follow this process, and
you will install these different components into your life, or
you won't. And if you won't, then I'll guarantee you
one thing is that you're going to fail as a
human being. And by the end of your life, you
will know that you have failed as a human being.
And there will be a lot of suffering for you.
So that's just the reality of how this works. Because
you are this human machine and this machine has certain
needs, not just physical needs, but certain psychological and spiritual
needs. And there is a proper way to run this
machine. And mostly the way that you're running it is
not the proper way. So take that to heart. And
get excited by the possibilities here. Might seem sort of
negative. But in accepting some of these harsh truths, there
was a surrender that happens. You surrender to them, and
then you get to work, you take responsibility, you start
to do the work. And as you start to do
the work, you start to experience the true satisfaction that
comes from this work, not the flimsy satisfaction that you're
getting from your attachment cycle that you're running through. See,
and when you start to get glimpses of that at
first, it's sporadic it's rare. You want to stabilize it,
but you can't it just it's a little glimpse. But
even those glimpses those are what hold you over while
you keep doing working hard every single day. All right,
that's it. I'm signing off, please click the like button
for me, post your comments down below. And come check
out actualize that org right here. This is my website.
On the website, I have various resources for you. You
can browse the videos easier. There is a mp3 downloads
of all my content. You can get it for free
there. There's the life purpose course by bookless. There's a
forum, there's my blog. So there's a lot of stuff
and I'm going to keep adding more content there. So
go make sure you use all these resources. But most
importantly, just stick around with actualize that org because in
the future, we'll be going deeper into the specifics of
how to actually follow through on this high level. process
of self actualization. In fact, I'm planning a new episode
in the future, which is going to be specifically called
something like how to get started with self actualization, because
a lot of people have been asking me, well, Leo,
you talk about a lot of this stuff, but I
don't really know where to start. You have hundreds of
videos that I need to watch, you know, where do
I start? What are the first things that I should
do? What's the order of priorities? And how do I
really get the techniques down? So I'm going to have
a practical episode which will take this abstract, abstract stuff
we were talking about today, and really drill it down
into concrete details so you know how to get started.
Alright, that's it. Hope you stay with me and I'll
see you soon with more.
