            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/TyDoJThWvAw' target='_blank'>How To Stop Being A Workaholic</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Workaholism as a challenge</b>: Leo shares his personal struggle with workaholism. He highlights symptoms of the condition such as consistently working over 8 hours daily or 40 hours weekly, personalizing work, not taking vacations, and working weekends and holidays. 
</li><li><b>Negative impacts of workaholism</b>: Leo outlines the harmful effects of workaholism which include chronic agitation, reduced creativity, burnout, potential health problems, limited self-actualization, and a diminished appreciation for life's beauty.
</li><li><b>The root issue of Workaholism</b>: The core issue behind workaholism according to Leo is a deep-seated belief of worthlessness or incompleteness, often resulting in the individual attaching their identity to their work. This can elicit negative emotional reactions when forced to stop working as they feel they lose their sense of identity.
</li><li><b>Perceived fulfillment from work</b>: Leo explains how workaholics create an illusionary cycle of fulfillment, where they work on projects for years, reach a certain completion point, briefly experience satisfaction, then immediately refocus on the next project. This cycle prevents them from experiencing long-lasting peace and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Avoiding being Present</b>: According to Leo, workaholics often avoid being present as they are uncomfortable with the present moment. They believe their life must be worked upon to have meaning. This belief ties their identity to work, which serves as a defense mechanism to prevent them from facing the void of feeling worthless and incomplete. 
</li><li><b>The illusory nature of value and worth</b>: He points out that value, worth, and meaning are illusions created by societal constructs. The feelings of worth and accomplishment associated with work are fundamentally artificial constructs that do not inherently exist.  
</li><li><b>Transforming workaholic tendencies</b>: Leo encourages introspection to understand the root causes of workaholism. He recommends enlightenment, brought on by practices such as meditation and mindfulness, to bring about a realization of personal completeness independent of external achievements. This could lead to a more balanced life, free from the claws of workaholism.
</li><li><b>The necessity of constant activity</b>: Leo Gura discusses the perception among workaholics that continuous activity and productivity are necessary for fulfillment and internal validation. However, this constant motion could be distracting from underlying issues and evading existential realities. 
</li><li><b>The concept and illusion of worth</b>: Gura emphasizes that worth does not inherently exist. All efforts to generate worth, value, and meaning through work are illusory since these things fundamentally do not exist. He suggests the pursuit of work as being a defense mechanism from facing this existential truth, referred to as 'the void'.
</li><li><b>Work as an escape from existential truths</b>: Workaholics often employ their work as a means of evading uncomfortable truths about life, such as its inherent meaninglessness and the illusory nature of personal worth and value. They dress themselves up in achievements and recognition to feel real, akin to the Invisible Man putting on clothing to see himself. 
</li><li><b>Realization of life's meaninglessness</b>: Gura proposes that realizing and accepting the meaninglessness of life can lead to liberation from workaholism. This acknowledgement should not be perceived as depressing or nihilistic. Rather, it signifies the freedom from societal constructs and the unnecessary pursuit of illusory worth and value.
</li><li><b>Comparing worth</b>: Gura challenges the common perception of relative worth, arguing that no one individual has greater intrinsic worth than another. He uses the analogy of a professionally successful person, a homeless person, and a dog to highlight the perspective that all beings hold equal worth.
</li><li><b>Exploring the concept of worth</b>: Leo explains that the perception of worth is largely manufactured by individuals, arguing that it's not an intrinsic quality of the world around us. He suggets it's a social fiction we create to assign value to things within specific societal contexts, such as when we compare the worth of different car brands. Worth, he suggests, does not inherently exist in any object, person or situation in the world.
</li><li><b>Self-examination on the notion of worth</b>: Leo encourages viewers to examine their own conceptions of worth, and consider whether they have been setting up unnecessary obstacles to increase their own sense of worth. He suggests that upon deep reflection, one might find that they have been trying to fill an unfilled void that originates from negative self-perceptions. This realization could lead to a shift in life priorities, allowing one to focus on other aspects such as family, health, or travel.
</li><li><b>Understanding the feeling of worthlessness</b>: He proposes the feeling of worthlessness often stems from our childhood experiences of trying to seek approval from someone significant. People might find that they are still trying to live up to these standards set by someone from their past, which could be fueling their drive to work excessively.
</li><li><b>Embrace completeness now</b>: Leo asserts that the idea of being incomplete until certain milestones are reached is an illusion, and that we are all already complete. He discourages delaying self-fulfillment, urging viewers to acknowledge their completeness in the present.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and No-Self</b>: He suggests that the ultimate solution to feeling complete is to achieve enlightenment and realize the concept of 'no-self'. This requires raising one's awareness and embracing the void of worthlessness without trying to run away from it.
</li><li><b>Practical solutions to workaholism</b>: Leo provides a series of practical solutions for viewers - practicing mindfulness of one's workaholic habits, reducing work hours, taking real vacations where one isn't constantly checking work-related tasks, and focusing on discovering aspects of life they might have neglected, such as spiritual, romantic, artistic aspects, travel, and self-discovery.
</li><li><b>Capacity for personal growth</b>: The growth of one's psychology can be incredibly rewarding. Leo encourages viewers not to miss out on realizing their own potential and growing beyond their current limitations. He welcomes viewers to sign up for his newsletter for continuous learning and self-actualization.
