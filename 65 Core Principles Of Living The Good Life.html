[Music] in this episode I want to lay out the
core principles of actualized org what are we doing here
at the biggest picture level what is my style of
personal development if we think of actualized org as a
school or as a teaching or as a style or
as a philosophy as a system then what are the
core tenets of this system I wanted to lay those
out for you it can be very useful to be
able to zoom out from all the individual stuff that
we talked about you know sometimes I'll spend an hour
two or three talking about some very narrow topic which
is important but that's only covering like maybe one principal
out of many many principles so here we're gonna talk
about close to sixty five different principles for creating the
good life this is what I feel is necessary for
a human being to live a good life now of
course this is informed by my life experience and my
own biases my own perspective my own experiences in life
and my own style so in an important sense there's
a sort of a stylistic component to any teacher that
you're gonna be learning from any spiritual teaching any philosophical
system any political theory you know there's there's a sort
of like a idiosyncratic style that comes along with it
so you have to also determine for yourself whether this
style is gonna resonate with you now even if it
doesn't fully resonate with you you can still learn stuff
from it so it's not like you should only listen
to teachers or teachings that are fully aligned with your
style but do recognize that of course the things I
say come from certain biases and experiences that I have
and that doesn't mean that they're absolutely true for everybody
but at the same time I must say that some
of these principles are such rock-solid principles that I'm very
tempted to say that they should be true for a
large percentage of human beings so it's not just purely
style there's there's a lot of profound wisdom in these
principles now it can take years to be able to
fully implement one of these principles sometimes these principles sound
very simple just they can be stated in one or
two sentences but to really be able to embody it
and to have this principle functioning in your life and
even just to be able to understand why this principle
is so important can take years can take decades which
is why I have a lot of individual episodes devoted
to each one of these in many cases not all
of them in the future I'll be releasing more to
make sure I cover as much these principles as I
can in a lot of depth because we can't go
into a lot of depth here because here we just
have to kind of like list them all out and
give you a big picture perspective now I'm not gonna
go into explaining why each of these principles is true
that would be way too much work and way too
much detail for this overview though that we're doing here
but if you're curious about why these principles are true
and you want me to like prove it to you
well first of all I'm not gonna prove anything to
you that's that's your job is to figure out what
actually works in life and what doesn't I'm just offering
these as suggestions not as Dogma not as beliefs that
you take blindly but ultimately why they're true how do
I know that they're true it's because of all of
my life experience all of my experience doing business all
of my experience trying to figure out my own life
dealing with my own neuroses and problems and sticking points
my own pathologies all of the enormous research that I've
done theoretical research reading hundreds of books studying with advanced
teachers and light masters traveling around the country traveling around
the world to various places to learn studying hundreds of
different perspective literally hundreds of different perspectives hundreds of different
traditions from Easter ones to Western ones for modern ones
to ancient ones reading lots of self-help books trying to
experiment with all these techniques myself and seeing what works
what doesn't work what's important what's not so important right
so from all of this and all of my meditating
and contemplating and journaling and thinking about this and all
of my five years of teaching all of this and
getting feedback from people and coaching people professionally as I
used to do working with clients one-on-one seeing what they're
sticking points are talking with friends around the country about
what their various sticking points are you know working on
improving various limitations in my own life like my my
health and my nutrition and my fitness and my inability
to socialize when I was younger and my introversion my
shyness so working through all of this stuff right all
of it is sort of getting compiled together and is
informing my understanding of reality and what's important to live
the good life and of course very importantly I forgot
to mention my pretty deep experience with psychedelics at this
point has been very instrumental in informing me about what
the most important principles for living a good life are
and this is something that I really been interested in
for probably close to 20 years all the way back
to high school I was just interested in what are
the principles of living a good life so without further
ado let's get into these principles core principle number one
and I'm not going to list them in any particular
order here but but this one is so important maybe
it does deserve to be number one is no ideology
and no dogma of any kind this is one of
the things that makes actualize that work unique among many
other teachings and schools is that most teachings and most
schools are filled with a lot of ideology and a
lot of dogma stuff they they just want you to
accept and I have a whole episode called how ideology
works which goes into a lot of depth about the
dangers of ideology the dangers of dogma do not make
the mistake of thinking that ideology and dogma is just
a mistake that religious people make no no no this
is mistake that almost everybody makes scientific people make this
mistake atheists make this mistake skeptics make this mistake political
people make this mistake very intelligent people make this mistake
it's very easy to fall into some kind of ideology
because that's what society feeds you as various kinds of
ideologies and one of the most difficult things to do
in life is to question and undo all the ideologies
and dogmas that you've been filled with growing up in
whatever culture you grew up in whatever family you grew
up in whatever school system you went to you know
they all filled your mind with various kinds of programming
and beliefs and ideologies and so questioning and undoing all
of that and living a dogma free ideology free life
that is very challenging and it can be a little
difficult to understand why that's even important but the reason
that it is is because the thing you're ultimately after
is you're after the highest truth and you're after you
you're after freedom freedom of your mind and so the
problem with ideology and Dogma is that it it sort
of anchors your mind down and it doesn't allow your
mind to explore all the nooks and crannies of reality
that it needs to be able to explore to understand
what reality is and to live the good life you
see these ideologies are like grooves that your mind gets
stuck in and then it keeps going down these grooves
it keeps thinking down these grooves and looking at the
world through these lenses and that shapes and distorts what
you're able to see and how flexible you're able to
be and how you're able to change your life people
who are very ideology ideological and dogmatic they're not actually
able to change themselves which is what we need to
do we need to massively change ourselves in order to
create the good life and all of my research and
and philosophizing into the topic of epistemology or the theory
of knowledge if I could boil all of that down
to just one simple principle it would just be do
not be ideological it's just that simple that's a very
very simple principle and this grounds pretty much everything that
I ever talked about ever in any of my content
and I stress this over and over and over again
because it's so important and it'll take you years to
realize how important this is but if you can follow
this one principle in your life this will save you
a lot of misery and trouble and a lot of
going down dead ends and various kinds of ideological traps
the next core principle is that big-picture thinking is greater
than technical knowledge and always Trump's technical knowledge that's another
thing that I stress in my work all the time
is big-picture thinking do you understand what's really going on
at the highest possible levels and are you concerned about
that over all the technical details that's like one of
my greatest strengths this big-picture thinking the technical details of
of things I'm not really that good at that's actually
sort of a weakness of mine and sometimes when I'm
delivering some piece of content or I'm talking about some
topic it's in the technical details that I can screw
up and get something wrong here there I've certainly done
that plenty of times in past episodes but I'm never
too concerned about that because my focus is always on
the big picture and that's because what I saw when
I was younger is I saw the opposite of that
I saw everybody around me including my teachers and society
and culture at large and my professors and so forth
they were so focused on the technical knowledge and yet
they had very little of the big picture and because
of this they were living the wrong kinds of lives
see you can have all the perfect technical knowledge you
can be an expert in your technical field but have
no idea of the big picture and your life will
be miserable and highly dysfunctional and pathological whereas if you
get the big picture right and you're focused on nailing
the big picture the technical details you don't need to
waste a lot of time energy on that it doesn't
matter and if you get a few technical details wrong
here or there it doesn't really matter so the big
picture like in this example with this episode is we're
gonna we're gonna give you all these sixty-five principles for
creating the good life that's a very big picture so
if you just follow these principles intelligently not robotically then
you should make very good progress to creating a great
life and notice that these principles they don't depend on
technical knowledge we're talking about very broad ideas here the
next core principle is that direct experience is king direct
experience is king experience is really the only thing that
exists and the only thing that is real right now
your experience whatever you're experiencing right now that's what's real
that's what's actual that's what exists everything else is fantasy
everything else is imagination this is a very powerful principle
for cutting through all the [ __ ] that culture
and society and people feed you and also for cutting
through your own [ __ ] the [ __ ]
that your own mind feeds you your own imaginings and
musings and theories and philosophies and ideologies how do you
cut through all that by grounding yourself in your present
direct experience that's what's King if it's not present in
your direct experience it's not real that's very powerful and
you need to use this principle over and over again
as you're inquiring into reality to help you to to
sort the wheat from the chaff to sort the actuality
from all the concepts and beliefs that you will be
learning from books and so forth and coming up in
your own mind the next core principle is self experimentation
actualized org is all about self experimentation how do you
discover what really works what is true and which principles
will lead to the good life by believing me by
reading a book by listening to some PhD professor who
has a Nobel Prize and trusting him or some guru
who's sitting up on a pedestal no it's through self
experimentation you won't know what techniques will or won't work
for you or will or won't resonate with you until
you try them and this principle really is a corollary
of the idea that direct experience is king so it's
because we realize that direct experiences is king that we
also realize that we do a lot of self experimentation
because it's only by going out and experiencing different things
trying different techniques that we will discover what really works
for us so what this means is if you have
some kind of problem let's say you have a consistent
relationship problem in your intimate relationships so self experimentation this
principle is what it means is that you're gonna go
out there and you're gonna experiment with various solutions you're
not gonna come and trust me or somebody else or
try to get the answer from someplace you can experiment
now of course this means you can you can listen
to people you can get advice from people you can
read books of course and you should but self experimentation
means that your to solving any problem is always gonna
be one of okay let me experiment and troubleshoot this
and try different things until something works so you're gonna
go maybe read some books on relationships maybe you're gonna
go hire a therapist and talk to them maybe you're
gonna go see a life coach maybe you're gonna go
to do some psychedelics and contemplate the nature of your
relationship and your sticking points while you're on psychedelics or
maybe you're gonna do some journaling or maybe you're gonna
have a serious one-to-one conversation with your loved one or
your spouse or whatever to try to resolve this relationship
thing or maybe you're gonna go do a solo retreat
in the woods for a week and contemplate the nature
of your relationship you know so all of these are
different things you can experiment with and and your approach
is gonna be looking let me try this stuff out
and see what's gonna what's gonna solve it and if
you have money problems same thing you're gonna try various
self experiments to resolve your money problems and if you
have some depression you're gonna do more self experimentation and
so forth and this is how basically you solve all
of your problems in life is through self experimentation the
next core principle is radical open-mindedness I've talked a lot
about this in the past I have entire episodes about
open-mindedness and I'll have some more in the future but
the reason radical open-mindedness is so important is because we
we recognize that we enter this world not knowing anything
and that we need to be able to fully explore
every nook and cranny of reality without prejudging it so
that we don't accidentally cut ourselves off from great discoveries
and amazing insights and truths see and we also recognize
that the mind the ego mind tends to love to
be closed-minded to new experiences and to challenging new ideas
and so therefore we take the opposite step the counterintuitive
move and we open ourselves up radically so radically that
it would shock most people that were this open this
means you have to be open to any ID any
perspective any teaching no matter how ridiculous or crazy and
untrue it might sound at first this might seem dangerous
but actually it's the opposite open-mindedness doesn't mean that you
are gonna believe a bunch of ridiculous things it just
means that you're open to exploring different ideas and perspectives
and the reason that we accept this principle and we
follow it is because we recognize that if we're not
radically open-minded then our mind is going to judge prematurely
and cut us off from all these other avenues that
we can explore and we also recognize that a lot
of the deepest truths in life are counterintuitive and seem
ridiculous and silly on the surface until they are deeply
explored and it can take a lot of time to
deeply explore these various truths and topics before we realise
just how true and powerful they are which means that
we need to remain open-minded during that time otherwise if
we're closed-minded then what's gonna happen is that we're gonna
just gonna say oh well that thing is stupid that
thing is crazy that can't possibly be true that thing
is irrational that thing is silly and religious and that
thing is criminal and we're gonna do all this but
we're not actually gonna explore all of that it's much
better to go and actually explore all of that which
again is not the same thing as becoming dogmatic about
any one of those things or clinging to any one
of those things we're interested in exploration genuine exploration exploration
means you don't know what you're gonna find sometimes you'll
find great stuff sometimes you'll find ugly bad stuff the
next core principle is that you do not judge things
which you have not experienced personally this again is sort
of a corollary to the radical open-mindedness principle but it
bears making explicit here because I can't tell you how
many times I've fallen into this trap of judging things
that I hadn't personally experienced and talking about it as
though I knew about it and I understood it but
really that was just a self-deception and I didn't really
understand it because I didn't have any experience with the
thing and this is something that the mind loves to
do all the time it loves to judge things especially
when it has zero experience with it so maybe you
judge Middle Easterners or Middle Eastern countries but the question
is have you actually been to a Middle Eastern country
how many middle Easterner friends do you have or maybe
you judge psychedelics have you ever even done psychedelics see
but of course the mind is very tricky so the
mind will say olio but I don't need to do
that I don't need to go to Middle Eastern countries
I don't need to do psychedelics I don't need to
try that food I don't need to explore that culture
I don't need to study this religion because I already
know it's [ __ ] that line of reasoning itself
is the [ __ ] so be very careful about
judging things you have not experienced you need to become
very good at recognizing when your mind is about to
judge something and then you ask you to wait a
minute have I actually experienced this thing that I'm gonna
be talking about here in a second oh I haven't
then I should keep my mouth shut and I keep
my mind open that's a very powerful skill to develop
very few people have developed that skill and I still
struggle with that one myself the next core principle is
question everything question everything there is no idea too sacred
not to question in fact anything that is sacred needs
to be questioned even more so doubly so triply so
question especially the most obvious stuff the stuff that people
with think that you're crazy or insane to question question
that question the world even exists question whether you even
exist question everything the more fundamental your questioning the better
and especially become very good at questioning assumptions what are
the assumptions of this philosophical system what are the assumptions
of this scientific model what are the assumptions of this
spiritual teacher you have to get very very good at
sussing out assumptions and questioning them and of course questioning
all of your own assumptions and all of your own
ideas so you don't just question skeptically on the outside
you also question even more so on the inside question
every teaching question everything I say but of course be
careful not to turn this into a weapon where you're
just questioning and you're putting the burden of understanding on
others the burden of proving things on others you need
to question in a way where you still assume the
burden and responsibility of finding the truth for yourself the
next core principle is care about philosophical and metaphysical matters
most people do not care about these because they think
that there's no practical application there is it's just that
philosophical and metaphysical matters are more abstract and therefore it
takes more effort and more study to find the applications
there are very practical applications but it takes a little
bit more work if you fail to follow this principle
it's gonna happen that you're gonna get lost in the
transactional pragmatic nature of mundane everyday life of business of
doing chores and you're gonna get so lost in that
and there's really no soul or spirit to be found
there there's nothing deep or profound to be found in
just doing business just earning money just being transactional in
your relationships the depth in life is found in having
philosophical and metaphysical matters questioned and resolved that's where the
really juicy and powerful work lies so you need to
care about that you need to cultivate a certain curiosity
a philosophical metaphysical curiosity which means that you're not just
chasing practical self-help advice like how to get laid how
to earn a million dollars how to cure my depression
all of that it's fine to a certain degree but
you need to go away beyond that something deeper and
you'll notice that that's one of the things that differentiates
actualizado work from a lot of the other self-help material
that's out there is that most of it tends to
be just very very strictly transactional and pragmatic about having
have how to get you a particular specific result and
while that that's sort of appealing on the surface it's
hollow on the inside it doesn't go deep enough into
addressing your root issues in life because most of your
surface level issues stem from your deeper existential metaphysical problems
that you're not even aware of yet the next core
principle is genuine intent for truth at whatever cost you
need to genuinely care about the truth with a capital
T as one of your highest priorities and values no
matter what the cost is to get at this truth
it doesn't matter if you need to move to a
different city break up with all of your friends pay
tens of thousands of dollars work overtime you know whatever
you got to do if that's what's required to get
at the truth then that's what's required and you're going
to accept that cost because you have a genuine intent
and desire and curiosity for the ultimate truth without this
what's gonna happen is that you're gonna keep falling into
falsehood and delusion you see because if you're not willing
to accept the costs that come with seeking the ultimate
truth you're gonna get sucked into the lesser things in
life you're gonna pursue money and sex and comfort and
luxury and these sorts of things and all of that
is best pursued with falsehood see and you're gonna end
up deluding yourself very deeply in life you're not gonna
really understand what life is at the highest level because
you never made it a genuine intent your priorities instead
were chasing material stuff which has nothing to do with
truth and often is actually aligned with falsehood oftentimes the
easiest way to make money is through falsehood not through
truth the easiest way to attract a sexual partner and
oftentimes us through falsehood not through truth the next core
principle is you need to have a genuine intent to
understand every point of view one thing you notice about
life is that there are so many different kinds of
points of view people have all kinds of points of
view different groups of people different cultures and nations and
ethnicities have all sorts of different points of view and
usually what what the average person does is they just
stay in their point of view and then they criticize
and judge the other points of view without genuinely caring
to look at the world from the perspective of all
those other people and you need to do the opposite
of that you need to get very curious and good
at jumping into other people's shoes and looking at the
world from their perspective and that's because you recognize that
the world really is nothing but different points of view
there's no such thing as a understanding of the world
without a point of view and your own point of
view is not the most important or the best you
recognize that so when you recognize that you understand that
hey I can learn a lot from looking at the
world from many points of view and that's one of
the things that you become passionate about is exploring different
points of view the next core principle is integral thinking
you need to think integrally and what that really boils
down to is the realization that every point of view
or perspective contains some kernel of truth no matter what
it is even some of the most atrocious perspectives Nazism
radical Islamic terrorism and others that you would think have
no redeeming qualities you can find a kernel of truth
even in those points of view and less radical ones
especially and so this is where open-mindedness comes in right
you need to be able to integrate all these different
points of view would and bring them all together and
to see okay what's really going on here what's sort
of the meta perspective the meta point of view when
we combine all these other points of view what does
that tell us about life what does that tell me
about myself what does that tell us about humanity what
does it tell us about society and so forth and
from that you get so much more than just sticking
to your own points of view and defending your own
points of view this is really the opposite of ideology
and dogma because what ideology and dog would try to
do is they try to limit your point of view
and defend a rigid perspective on the world so it's
the opposite of integral the opposite of holistic and therefore
people with with this limited perspective they they understand so
much less of life then the otherwise could and so
just I want you to keep this core principle in
mind that every point of view contains some truth and
it's your job to discover what that is it's not
the responsibility of the other person to tell you or
convince you of that kernel of truth for example it's
not the job of a Nazi or a radical terrorist
to convince you of their truth it's your job to
go study them and discover what is the truth that
they are so passionate about what is that and very
importantly just because you're doing this does not mean that
you have to become a Nazi of course or a
terrorist of course not you're exploring points of view you're
gonna be exploring hundreds of points of you throughout your
whole life that doesn't mean that you have to get
married to any one point of view in fact integral
thinking is the recognition that every point of view is
partial never the ultimate truth always partial so that's why
we're exploring so many of them is precisely because it's
just a little piece think of every point of view
as like a 1% perspective on reality so 1% is
not a lot so you know we need to explore
hundreds of them for all those individual ones to add
up to something substantial the next core principle is that
everything basically boils down to inner game the quality of
your life boils down to your psychology this means that
all problems and all suffering is self created and self
inflicted and this is very difficult for many people to
believe because it runs counter to the idea that we
are living in some sort of rigid fixed external reality
a material reality with unbreakable physical laws where it seems
like all the problems are out there in the world
and all the suffering is created by the world outside
of me and then I have nothing to do with
it so this is flipping that on its head upside
down 180 degrees and realizing that actually all of those
external problems that I think exists out there all the
suffering that's created by the world all of that external
material physical hard stuff that can't be changed what is
that but actually an aspect of my own inner game
that's actually a belief that I have that's a paradigm
that I'm in and that itself is not an outer
thing but an inner thing this is like the master
key that unlocks all of your potential in life because
it's only when you realize that the most important thing
for determining the quality of your life and everything you
do and solving all of your problems and suffering is
mastering the internal software of your mind when you realize
that now you have so much power now there's all
this potential that opens up now you're no longer a
victim whereas in the other case there's very little you
can do you get stuck very easily the next core
principle is lifelong learning and self education you need to
become a lifelong learner you need become passionate about learning
and your education you've got to take full responsibility for
it and take ownership of it and be proactive about
it don't wait for a teacher to get you to
do some homework assignment or to read a book don't
wait for some program or some training to teach you
something go out there and proactively learn about life and
the reason this principles is so paramount is because when
you're born you have no information about the world you
don't know how the world works or what it is
or what you're doing here so you got to start
to learn and this process of learning will continue for
the rest of your life it's not just school it's
not just University in fact all of that was just
the beginning of your entire educational career which only really
takes off after you graduate University so of course this
means reading lots of books you should expect to read
a hundred or 200 books over the next five or
ten years this is gonna be absolutely essential it's through
these books that you will learn various perspectives techniques traps
mistakes lessons principles you'll be exposed to new ideas to
new cultures to history things you haven't ever heard about
anywhere else the quality and and detail of information that's
presented in books the quality book will be much greater
than what you see in a video or on television
or on some social media website and you need that
you need that solid high quality reliable information to get
you started these are like your leads these books are
the source of leads for you as to what you
should be pursuing and what techniques can work for you
and so forth and these books help you to understand
what your problems are see part of the challenge is
that you have problems that you don't even understand you
have yet takes a lot of reading just to realize
that but also don't stop at books you also need
to take courses seminars workshops there are many online courses
that are available these days on almost any topic that
you would want to learn about you could find in-person
seminars and workshops which are super important to go to
there's a very big difference between watching a workshop or
a seminar online in video form and actually going to
one live in-person you'll get 10 times more from going
to the exact same workshop or seminar live rather than
watching it as the video do not be cheap with
your self education it's because you recognize that this principle
is so important lifelong learning that you are willing to
invest in your learning you're willing to pay hundreds and
sometimes thousands of dollars for courses seminars workshops you're willing
to invest 500 to a thousand dollars every year in
buying a bunch of new books and an additional point
about this lifelong learning we're still talking about just this
one principle of lifelong learning is you need to develop
a system for taking notes and for organizing all of
this stuff that you're going to be researching and learning
because you're gonna have various techniques and ideas and principles
that you're learning vocabulary words all of this and you're
gonna have to compile it together in some way a
system if you want an idea for how to do
that check out my episode about how to keep a
commonplace book that's my system that I use the next
core principle is observation observation is one of the keys
to life the essence of learning is observation how do
you learn anything by observing it for a long period
of time very patiently very methodically over and over and
over again the power of observation is enormous way more
than anyone would ever imagine which is why you can
spend years and decades doing very careful and painstaking observation
an observation is the solution to the problem of ideology
and dogma and various kinds of belief systems that you
get trapped in observation is the antidote to being lost
inside your own mind what you need to do is
to observe and that's why science to the extent that
science is successful and has some good benefits for society
is because science focuses on observation but now you need
to take that on as a principle for yourself it's
not enough to have science observed for you and then
to report the results to you you need to become
a keen observer of life and of reality observe everything
observe people observe animals observe nature observe trees observe your
own behaviors observe your own thinking process observe your motivations
your fears observe your problems and neuroses observe when you
suffer observe when you're in pain observe when you're happy
observe what makes you motivated observe what makes you depressed
carefully observe all of that and through this process you
will learn about yourself you will learn about the world
you will learn about mankind you will learn about business
anything anything you observe you will make finer grained distinctions
in and you will learn how that thing works so
observation is related of course to our earlier principle of
direct experience as King observation goes hand-in-hand with direct experience
and the opposite of that is believing what other people
tell you so to really be able to embody the
things that I teach with actualize or you need to
do an enormous amount of observation years of observation on
everything that I talk about so the things I talked
about in the episode then you got to go and
actually observe it in your own life and see that
oh yes this is exactly how it works or maybe
you'll realize no it's not quite how Leo said it
works maybe he was only half right but the other
half I have observed that it works differently what he
said see and that could happen because you know what
my observation is not perfect by any means there's there's
so much to observe about so many different facets of
reality that it's hard to observe a hundred percent of
all of it so you're bound to if you're gonna
be seriously observing observe some things about the things I
talked about that I was not able to observe and
it's through observation that insights come the next closely related
principle is plan to meditate for one hour every day
for the rest of your life do you have a
meditation practice yet why not how many times have I
told you that meditation is one of the most important
things you can do for your personal development it's a
cornerstone have it you need to install this habit don't
start with an hour start with 10 20 minutes whatever
you can but eventually you got to build up and
you should already have the expectations in place that you're
gonna be meditating for one hour every day for the
rest of your life this is not negotiable you're just
gonna do it and you're gonna enjoy it it'll take
you a while before you start to enjoy it but
you should already be envisioning that you're going to be
enjoying it now why meditation well because meditation is really
just observation when you're meditating you're just sitting there and
you're observing the present moment and again that ties us
back to the earlier principle of direct experiences King what
is meditation it's just your direct experience of whatever is
happening in the present moment that's all that it is
and you're just observing and you're observing the function of
your own mind various body sensations and emotions that you're
having and it's only through this observation process through meditation
that you're going to be able to understand yourself and
how your body and mind work through years of careful
and painstaking observation and this is why most spiritual teachings
cannot be directly related to people and why you can't
sell spiritual advancement and you can't sell psychological maturity and
you can't sell wisdom you can't sell these things to
people because the only way they can get those things
is by doing the observational work that's required to have
those insights and understandings to have that base of experience
you see it's like no amount of money could you
give me to be able to make you into like
a master piano player the only way you can become
a master piano player is by going through all the
direct experience and practice and observation that a master piano
player has that makes him a master and so now
apply this dough to your body and your mind in
your life no amount of listening to me or paying
me any amount of money will get you the experience
the observational experience that you need to understand the functioning
of your own mind and body this is absolutely critical
this is why spiritual growth is so difficult because most
people just don't do the observation work it takes a
lot of time and energy and it's difficult and it's
boring and sometimes it's painful and you suffer through it
and sometimes you observe things which freak you out you
observe things about reality which run counter to all your
ideologies and beliefs and all the programming you got when
you were younger and that freaks you out and then
when you become really good at meditation that that enables
you to access mystical States higher states of consciousness non-ordinary
states of consciousness which is where all the really powerful
gains lie and which is absolutely essential for developing a
good life but it takes years to get there years
of practice to get there for most people the next
core principle is that ego is the root of all
human problems and suffering and ego is just that sense
of you ego is the sense that you were born
as that human being right there and that you will
die one day that your identity with that biological body
in mind that you have and your personal story about
the fact that you were born you went to school
and you you had all these problems and now here
you are sitting there as this material creature that's ego
and from that stem all human problems and suffering both
individual and collective this is a super powerful principle this
one principle basically explains all of yourself and all of
mankind and there's so much to be said about this
and I have said quite a lot about it throughout
many episodes in the past and basically every episode I
talk about touches upon this principle in one form or
another the next principle which is closely related is self-deception
self-deception is the biggest thing you need to be worried
about in life how your own mind lies to you
and tricks you and deceives you the ego mind corrupts
everything that it comes in contact with and even more
so than you lie to others and that you deceive
others you deceive yourself and I have a whole three-part
episode series called self-deception where I list many self-deception mechanisms
that I've been studying over the last five or ten
years it's how your own mind trips you you need
to get very very very good at seeing your own
self deceptions not so much the stuff deceptions of others
but of yourself because you see if we're trying to
get to the truth if we're trying to really understand
reality at a big picture level that means that we
have to contend with the biggest obstacle which is self
deception because self-deception leads to delusion into falsehood city so
that's your greatest obstacle is your own mind and of
course this connects with the earlier principle of the inner
game is the most important thing for solving all of
your problems because all of your problems basically stem for
various kinds of self deceptions that are running inside of
your mind which you aren't conscious of yet the next
closely-related principle is self bias you need to recognize and
be able to see within yourself your own selfishness and
your own self biases you need to see how your
ego mind or the self lowercase s self distorts everything
that it perceives because the whole purpose of the self
is to survive and therefore you're always going to be
looking and interacting with situations and manipulating situations in such
a way that it's gonna serve yourself and therefore your
perceptual system is self biased filled with conflicts of interest
and double standards so a very simple example of of
self bias is that you know if if I'm a
criminal and like I robbed a grocery store I can't
be allowed to be my own judge and jury at
the trial because I would have a self bias of
setting myself free I would create all sorts of justifications
and excuses for why I didn't commit the crime scene
which is why judges have to recuse themselves if they
have any kind of mature real connection with the case
that they're trying because otherwise self bias is gonna creep
in there but of course this is just one little
tip of the iceberg of how self bias works these
are some gross examples there are very subtle examples of
house of bias works basically all of your ideologies and
beliefs and everything you you perceive out there is always
biased by your own needs your ego ik needs your
survival needs so your relationships are self biased your business
is self biased your your attitudes politically ourself biased and
so on and so forth and all of this is
preventing you from being able to access the truth which
you need to live the good life so you need
to unwire all of those self biases or at the
very least become very conscious of them the next core
principle is that all fear all judgment all evil all
anger and all suffering are delusion and falsehood this is
huge this is a huge principle which will save you
so much suffering all fear judgment evil anger and suffering
is delusion that means anytime you're experiencing those and of
course you don't enjoy experiencing those and you want a
way to not experience those anymore well you start to
have to become more conscious and realize just how much
of all of that is falsehood and it stems from
falsehood so the reason that we want to pursue truth
so much aside from the fact that we're just genuinely
curious about it but it's also because if we do
discover the truth then we will realize that fear judgment
evil anger and suffering have all been false and that's
precisely what we need to live the good life you
can't live the good life while you're in fear while
you're judging all the time while you see evil out
there in the world while you're angry and while you're
suffering by definition that's the bad life so the bad
life goes with falsehood and the good life goes with
truth another closely related principle here is do not demonize
anyone all demonization is delusion as well anytime you think
somebody out there is evil you're wrong this is one
of the self deception mechanisms of the mind is to
try to demonize others or groups of people or entities
or organizations somewhat of a related principle is that reality
is perfect there is nothing at all wrong with reality
if you think that something is wrong in the world
it's because of your inner game and how you're looking
at it not because it actually is wrong or it
actually is bad or it actually is evil reality is
literally perfect but you can only appreciate that and it
will only start sounding like something that's real and not
just rule wishful thinking at enormous ly high levels of
consciousness so it'll take you years and perhaps decades to
have enough mystical experiences to ultimately realize that reality is
perfect until then well you're sort of just got to
take my word for it but this is a powerful
principle because you can use it to change and grow
yourself so any time in your life that you're finding
something that is bothering you or annoying you and you
think it should be otherwise and that this is wrong
and that person is doing something wrong you can always
remind yourself wait a minute but I know in the
back of my mind that reality is perfect maybe I
haven't had the mystical experience yet to experience that like
Liam says but I but I can Intuit something about
that and and so maybe maybe there's something wrong with
me the way that I'm looking at this situation the
way I'm looking at this person how am i creating
the imperfection out of the perfection that's already there it's
powerful principle that you can use to to change your
feelings about things now the next four principles that I'm
going to give you are very important ones and there
are going to be four different ways of looking at
the purpose of life what is the purpose of life
so the purpose of life there's a lot we could
say about this and I've said stuff in the past
about it but basically here are four different purposes of
life these are very overarching big-picture purposes which help to
orient you as to what you should be doing in
your life so the first purpose of life is to
raise your consciousness that should be something that you're concerned
with every single day of your life from now on
the second purpose of life is to raise your capacity
to love to embrace the full spectrum of experience not
just the good experiences and the sweet and pleasant ones
but everything raised your capacity to love everything and everyone
the third purpose of life is to take in the
beauty of life have you noticed how beautiful it all
is but of course there's also a spectrum of beauty
and it's very easy to to see the beauty when
you go to a museum and you look at a
fine Picasso painting or you go to some national park
like Yosemite and you look at the beautiful mountains and
trees and the sunset and that's beautiful that's the kind
of beauty that's sort of easy to see but can
you see the beauty of everyday life of the most
mundane things can you see the beauty of your body
of your hands can you see the beauty on the
wall can you see the beauty of that pencil of
that lamp of the carpet of this room the beauty
of society the beauty of mankind the beauty of even
the ugly things that really is if you think about
it the essence of a good life to live the
greatest life possible is really just none other than to
see Beauty everywhere all the time and to be conscious
of that but you have to train yourself because Society
has trained you to be judgmental in to pick and
choose and to not like the ugly stuff and to
only like a like 1% of the full spectrum of
all this stuff that there is to love that requires
surrendering your ego see the ego doesn't want to love
and see the beauty of everything it wants to cherry-pick
and so your job is to surrender that more and
more and more and to take in more of the
beauty all the time so that you don't have a
day where you go by in your life or you're
just going through the motions just going to work just
punching the clock just earning some money just doing some
business just taking care of the kids just cooking a
meal but you're disconnected from the beauty of it all
and that's what very careful observation and meditation will ultimately
teach you is they will teach you the beauty of
the most simple things just like looking at your hands
and seeing the enormous beauty in the design of your
hands and how they function you know you can sit
there for hours marveling at this but only after enormous
training that doesn't come to you from a diet of
playing video games and watching Netflix for your whole life
yeah you're not going to be able to do that
it'll take years to untrain yourself from from that Netflix
video game diet to be able to see the beauty
of very simple things you know the average person when
they're walking on the sidewalk and they see some dog
poo they can't see the beauty in that and you
need to train yourself to see the beauty in that
and whatever it takes that you need to surrender to
see the beauty in that that's your work that's one
of your highest purposes in life you know I was
driving yesterday late at night like I like to do
I Drive around Las Vegas late at night just looking
at the at the lights and just contemplating and meditating
while I Drive actually I love to meditate while I
Drive the most so I Drive I do this whole
loop around Las Vegas it takes about an hour and
a half it's probably like 80 miles or so I
Drive around the entire city late at night and I
was driving and there was like some part on the
road where I usually drive where there was like construction
going on and I got annoyed by that I'm thinking
like oh I got this peaceful Drive and I have
to deal with all this construction nonsense that's happening late
at night but then I also realized like oh wait
a minute why am I not taking in the beauty
of all of this I mean it's beautiful like the
construction signs are certain Beauty to them and people working
you know the way they're constructing this this off ramp
or on ramp or whatever it is like there's a
certain beauty to that and then and then you kind
of just see that all this is a society it's
sort of like almost like ants working on the little
ant colony you know building something on the road and
so like you see that beauty whereas normally I would
get annoyed by that here I saw the beauty of
it and it completely transformed that experience so you need
to get good at doing that all the time in
more and more difficult situations you know it's very difficult
to see the beauty when you're dealing with a situation
that is affecting your survival needs so that's where most
spiritual work happens right there and the fourth purpose of
life is to feel alive every day to live proactively
to not have a single day where you're just like
I said going through some boring motions just kind of
doing another typical day just kind of phoning it in
and being robotic to actually feel alive that feeling of
engagement you want to be passionate and alive so whatever
that takes that that takes you doing more travel then
do that and if if that requires you have a
better job in order to finance your travel then do
that but of course to feel alive also what that
means is being more conscious being less robotic and less
mechanical in the way that you live the next principle
is to build your metaphysical connection to reality I've talked
about this explicitly in my video called what is spirituality
so we can rephrase now this principle as just pursue
spirituality or be spiritual and what that means is developing
your connection to reality but your metaphysical connection and what
that means is that means realizing that you're not just
some creature some mammalian meatbag who is living on this
rock that's rotating around the Sun but rather that you
are the entire universe you're not an object that is
within existence you are existence itself to realize that I
am the whole universe as I stand here that is
only possible through all of the metaphysical contemplations and various
meditations that I have done for many many years and
that is starting to develop within me and it's only
going to develop more and more and more and the
more that happens the better your life becomes because now
you feel like life is not just about living and
surviving and doing chores for people but it's it's really
just about connecting more and more with yourself as the
entire universe and be more conscious to that the next
core principle is counter-intuitive 'no such a profound point and
topic I'll have a whole episode about in the future
what it means is that reality is deeply counterintuitive almost
every facet of anything worthwhile that you want to accomplish
in life you're gonna notice the counterintuitive nosov it that
means that reality is gonna work the opposite of how
you think it will work until you get a lot
of experience with it so for example if you're a
man trying to attract a woman a beautiful woman attracting
a beautiful woman is very counterintuitive because you have to
do the opposite of what you think you would have
to do to attract her you would think that you'd
have to go up and brag to her and show
off your big muscles and all that and counter-intuitively if
you do that you're actually going to repel her and
that takes a lot of experience to unlearn that naive
intuition that you had and to learn how it really
works and other examples for example business in business to
earn money and be successful you have to do the
opposite of what you would think like for example you
might think in business the best way to earn a
bunch of money is just to to market to everybody
as many eyeballs as possible make my message as most
generic as possible so it appeals to absolutely everybody but
if you do that in business these what's gonna happen
is that actually you're gonna fail it's much better to
to narrow your niche and your focus and to only
target your advertising and sales and your product to a
very narrow specific group of people like less than 1%
of the entire population and you would think that but
below that means I'm alienating 99% of people yes but
you're gonna convert that other 1% whereas if you try
to appeal to everybody you're gonna convert nobody and that's
just one of the many counterintuitive things that you'll discover
in business relationships are also very counterintuitive happiness the pursuit
of happiness is counterintuitive fear is counterintuitive emotions are counterintuitive
like I said I mean literally like every aspect of
life is so counterintuitive it works the opposite of what
you would initially think how it would work and so
actually a corollary principle to this is and this is
a very powerful principle as as almost stupid as it
sounds do the opposite of what everybody else is doing
I can't explain to you just how much leverage I've
gotten out of following this one principle in my life
sometimes I will literally just see what is the common
thing people do and I'll just do the opposite just
based on this principle purely on this principle and the
reason that is is because I know that what most
people are doing isn't making them happy nor is it
making them successful what most people are doing is they're
getting very mediocre results in all areas of life and
so if I do what they do I expect I'll
get mediocrity so almost as a default what I do
is I just try to be a contrarian to the
opposite our most people meditating know so I'll meditate are
most people taking psychedelics no so I'll take psychedelics our
most people you know working hard to discover their life
purpose know so I'll do that now of course you
can find exceptions to this so I wouldn't recommend you
know applying this in an in a in a robotic
way like well leo so by this logic does it
mean that you know most people aren't taking heroin so
I should take care no of course not so you
have to be intelligent in how you apply this principle
but generally speaking it's because reality is so counterintuitive it's
pretty smart you know after you realize how counterintuitive things
are the next time you go into a fresh situation
you almost start to expect that well I expect the
situation should work like this but I also know that
reality is so [ __ ] counterintuitive and I've been
burned so many times before by the counterintuitive things let
me just now do the opposite thing first and see
if that works and oftentimes it will work the first
time see you learn that lesson hmm the next core
principle is that non-duality is the ultimate truth reality is
non-dual which means that all boundaries all categories and all
distinctions ultimately collapse they're all relative there is no distinction
between inside/outside physical non-physical me other good bad black/white human
non-human living nonliving organic inorganic scientific versus religious so all
of these dualities all of these will ultimately collapse they
don't hold if you follow them all the way this
is a super profound truth and this one principle can
help you to cut through so much [ __ ]
and to see how the mind constructs all these categories
and distinctions very very helpful to see how most of
the things you were taught as a child all the
way up through university have just been categories that were
constructed by the human mind by the human race and
that many of these distinctions are purely conceptual they're not
absolute in any sense and that they will ultimately all
collapse as you keep observing deeper and deeper keep meditating
keep contemplating keep having mystical experiences all this will ultimately
collapse into one unity one ultimate absolute truth which leads
us to the next core principle which is that absolute
truth exists but it cannot be thought believed imagined communicated
spoken written proven or argued this is very difficult for
most people to accept especially many scientifically minded rationally minded
people they tend to assume that if absolute truth does
exist then it must be possible to prove it or
argue it or communicate it or write about it or
imagine it or think about it but the fact is
that it's not because all those are limited and the
absolute truth is unlimited it's absolute that's what makes it
so interesting and special and important so this is just
a brute fact of reality mm-hmm you can go test
it for yourself and if you discover the absolute truth
what I'm claiming is that if you do the practices
one day you will discover the absolute truth and once
you do you will realize that it cannot be thought
believed imagined communicated spoken written proven or argued and yet
you will know about it more certainly than you know
anything else in the world how is that possible well
it can't really be explained or imagined or communicated but
it is possible through mystical experience through lots of observation
again that's that's very important it's super important principle because
a lot of people get stuck arguing and trying to
communicate and imagine and think about absolute truth and you
need to just know right off the bat that that's
just not possible so stop wasting your time doing that
you waste a lot of time doing that you waste
years and decades doing that just stop it your life
will go a lot better another core principle is that
reality is not Material reality is not a physical object
of any kind reality is a giant mind everything you
think is physical like walls roads cars planets solar systems
it's all one mind these are all imaginings within a
mindscape and there is nothing outside of mindscape mindscape is
all that there ever is and again this is not
something you believe this is something that you experience through
direct observation lots and lots and lots of observation psychedelics
help a lot as well the next closely related principle
is that life is a dream and I have a
whole episode called life is a dream or I explain
this but it just basically is what it sounds like
life is literally a dream what you have here is
just a dream there is no external world beyond this
dream that you're in it's a dream just like the
dreams you have when you're asleep at night and just
like those it's possible to awaken from the dream so
you can awaken from life this is a super important
principle because it helps you to dis identify from all
of your attachments that you have to this dream you
start taking the dream less seriously and that's very important
for living the good life to live the good life
you must awaken from the dream otherwise you're always gonna
be haunted by this dream and the stuff that happens
within it in the same way that you know a
nightmare terrifies you only because you're not aware that you're
inside of a dream but once you realize that it's
just a dream the nightmare is no longer a big
deal and you know here the next core principles that
reality is infinite and that god is a real thing
not the Christian God sitting up in the clouds with
a beard judging you but the word God points to
something that's very real it points to infinity and just
what that is and how it works that's complicated I
won't get into that here it's also very controversial it's
also much misunderstood with many traps uh this is also
the same as talking about the absolute so you can
see that there's a problem talking about or communicating about
it because it's the absolute but I have I have
episodes I have a two-part series called what's it called
it's called um understanding absolute infinity part one and two
go check that out that explains a lot of what
infinity means and how reality could be infinite and what
God is and I'll have future episodes about what God
is explaining that the next very important principle is that
you are God so God is not something separate from
you literally you are God not in the egotistical sense
that you are a God and you can do anything
you want in the world and you can be an
[ __ ] and be arrogant not not that way
I mean literally you created yourself you created the entire
universe you are the entire universe this is a very
advanced mystical insight that you will only get from years
and years of meditation and spiritual practice but you can
get there and it's very important that you do realize
that you are God because only then will you take
full responsibility for your life and only then will you
really understand how profound life is and what existence is
closely related follow-up principle to this is that God is
the devil there is absolutely no difference between God and
the devil they are the same thing because again what
non-duality tells us is that every duality including the duality
between god and devil is ultimately gonna collapse into a
unity so God and the devil must collapse into a
unity which tells you you know what's the what's the
value of knowing that God is nil well the value
of it is that you stopped seeing evil and being
bothered by evil so much because you realize that all
the evil you see out there there's a higher intelligence
behind it it exists for a reason it's part of
infinity it's part of all the stuff that you need
to love in to embrace and also calling it the
devil the reason understanding the devil is so important by
the way I have a whole episode about what is
the devil really good episode go check that one out
I think it's one of my best one they will
change your whole understanding of this this this duality is
that you know you need to understand selfishness you need
to understand where evil comes from you need to understand
why reality is so deceptive you need to understand Maya
in other words and you need to understand that this
is part of God God is the one to self-deceptive
[ __ ] and in fact that's how reality comes
into existence is through various forms of deception and that's
why we say it's all one mind it's all a
dream and so one aspect of this dream is that
it's very hypnotic and it's very self deceptive and it's
very twisted and it can be very neurotic and pathological
at times that's all part of the entire whole that's
not something to cut out and to ignore that's something
to understand into a brace otherwise you you will actually
be yourself pathological by denying those aspects of reality another
very important principle is that all identity is relative and
fluid so literally there is no identity within reality other
than oneness so any limited identities that you create like
you as a body you as a biological organism you
as somebody who was born to certain parents or maybe
you identify with your car or you identify with your
house you're dead or how is your job all of
these identities that you have they're all relative they're all
constructions of your mind they're not absolutely true and they're
fluid and they can change and in fact they have
been changing for all of your life and that's very
very significant to understand and any identity that other people
take out there whether they're individuals or entire cultural identities
or political parties take identities companies created and these all
of these identities that are being created this is all
part of ego the ego mind individual ego mine collective
ego mind and this is all part of how God
and the devil work is through creating these identities it's
why you feel that you're a living creature but all
these identities are rather arbitrary and they're they're are malleable
they're changeable and this is uh this is a very
good news because it means you can change what you
identify with which means you can actually dis identify with
your physical body and also your mind and identify yourself
with the ultimate with the absolute which ends up being
the trick for overcoming death and attaining immortality as preposterous
as that sounds it is nevertheless possible and it is
true the next core principle is at 99.999% of people
are deluded and asleep and they don't know about any
of the things that I am explaining here today and
that's extremely important to understand because otherwise what's gonna happen
is that you're gonna get lost in the delusions and
a sleepness of all the other people who are surrounding
you it's precisely because all the other people are so
asleep that you can't look to them for advice or
for guidance because you look over here you look over
there you see people doing stupid stuff you see people
not doing this work and then you think that oh
well that means I should be doing what they're doing
I'm weird for not doing what they're doing but actually
no they're the weird ones there to dilute it once
so keep that in mind this is why you won't
get a bunch of confirmation from science and from medical
community from other traditional sources about the things that I
talk about because they're not there yet which leads us
to the next closely related principle which is that society
is still in the dark ages yes we're the 21st
century but stop thinking of the 21st century as being
some kind of like highly advanced society no no we
are still adolescents as a species we are very very
immature very unconscious very emotionally stunted very repressed very neurotic
very pathological very dysfunctional as a species and our understanding
of reality and consciousness and how to live the good
life is very crude akin to the kind of medical
knowledge that existed in the dark ages or they would
use leeches and other sorts of crude techniques in order
to cure people they actually ended up killing many people
rather than curing them that's the state of current society's
understanding of spirituality psychology philosophy science and many other things
so do not get seduced by this facade that's directed
by society where we tend to think that all well
we've already gone through the dark ages and now we're
out of the dark ages now we're very technologically advanced
than we have planes and cars and phones and all
of this computers and stuff and because of this we
know everything that's just a facade don't get tricked by
it and the reason it's important to realize that we're
in the dark ages is because again that explains to
you why you're not getting all this confirmation from your
society it's because you're assuming your society is far more
advanced than it actually is see so don't expect society
to just give you these answers while you're on social
media or watching cable TV the kind of advertisements you're
getting there have nothing to do with how to live
a good life it's actually all the opposite again this
is one of the counterintuitive elements of life is that
the things that you're taught mostly in school and through
the media and in the culture or precisely those things
which lead to living a mediocre miserable life which of
course explains why everyone or most people are living such
a mediocre miserable life the next core principle is development
and Awakening not either or both you want to awaken
from the dream that you're in but also you need
to learn how to mass stur living in the dream
and develop yourself within the dream these are sort of
like two core avenues of growth that you're working towards
in your life you're developing yourself and then you're also
awakening from the dream if you only develop yourself but
you don't awaken you will get lost in the dream
and you will suffer if you only awaken but you
don't develop then you're not gonna have any mastery or
excellence in living in the dream and so you might
be awake and that's great but then your development is
stunted in certain ways and that's also not you living
up to your full potentials and getting the most juice
out of life you want both and you're gonna need
a certain amount of development before you can even think
about possibly awakening to really seriously awake and you already
need to be very developed in most cases it's very
rare that someone just awakens while they're completely undeveloped that's
gonna be hard for you to accomplish a few rare
people one in a hundred million maybe could do that
but I wouldn't count on that the next core principle
is figure out who you are and what you want
out of life this is super important and it's not
as easy as it sounds you're not just gonna sit
down for ten minutes and in ten minutes figure out
who you are and what you want in life this
is something you have to work on think about contemplate
journal about talk with coaches about talk with therapists about
for four years for decades you're gonna keep honing and
honing and honing and refining your understanding of who you
are and what you really want from life you need
as much clarity as possible about what you want from
life absolutely important this allows you to make decisions and
allows you to to channel your energy and your focus
towards those things that you want if you're not clear
about what you want if you're wishy-washy vague and ambiguous
you're gonna get nothing that's the default thing that you
get is nothing and mediocrity you're not just gonna randomly
get a bunch of good stuff and a good life
by not knowing what you want you to be very
clear and decisive about what do you want you want
to awaken then be [ __ ] clear about it
I want to awaken do you want to have a
house what kind of house where should it be located
how much should it cost be clear about that you
want to have a girlfriend or a spouse what kind
do you want where are you gonna find them how
is it gonna really work do you really want them
if to be very clear about all these things and
about your career and everything which leads to the next
core principle which is authenticity you need to be striving
every day to be more and more authentic in your
life it's only when you're being authentic that you're truly
satisfied and happy and a lot of a society programs
you with is reasons and incentives for being inauthentic you
see all throughout school and university and when you were
dating people and when you were at work trying to
get a job and with your family and all this
you were you were taught to be inauthentic as a
survival strategy such that you don't even know what it
means to be authentic how that really feels you're so
out of touch with who you are and and what
you really want and how you should all your body
how you should behave how you should speak how you
should smile like all of this is so fake for
many people so you need to get more and more
in touch with your authenticity strip away all the layers
of of social conditioning that is preventing you from being
authentic and all the fears that you have and worries
that are preventing you such that you're able to express
your deepest being your deepest values need to be able
to express that effortlessly to have a good life and
your career needs to be authentic your speech needs to
be authentic your eye contact needs to be authentic yeah
what else you know your your relationships with your family
and your spouse's and your girlfriends and boyfriends that needs
to be off but for you to be able to
do that to achieve that you first need to discover
who you are and what you really want very clearly
and also you need to uncover the fears and incentives
which are keeping you being inauthentic see like what are
you really afraid of what are you gonna lose are
you gonna get rejected are you gonna be lonely and
miserable or are you gonna be judged the next core
principle is that you need to develop a life purpose
I have a cold course about that 25 hours long
course on how to develop a life purpose is so
important life purpose is the sense of what you're doing
in your life again it's all about clarity it's about
finding the right alignment between your values and what you
really want and you're a career and merging those together
and then working on that and building something of lasting
value there that you can offer to the world so
check out my course if you're interested in that the
next core principle is take 100% responsibility for your life
and don't blame anyone observe yourself blaming people and stop
doing it train yourself to stop doing it take full
responsibility if you don't take full responsibility anything less of
a hundred percent that means you're gonna be a victim
in those areas that you don't take responsibility in which
means you're gonna feel stuck and you're gonna feel miserable
and depressed and bitter and annoyed and frustrated and ask
the definition of not a good life by taking responsibility
you assume the burden of solving every problem that comes
your way and that makes you very resourceful and creative
because now you've committed to solving all these problems to
studying them to doing self experimentation trying different techniques turning
to different sources reading books and videos and courses and
all of this to solve your problems see and it's
only through this kind of attitude that you actually will
end up solving your problems whereas most people they just
come up with excuses and blame others or why the
problems can't be fixed it's actually a lot better to
be able to fix a problem than to suffer through
it for the rest of your life and it gives
you a sense of power and strength and self-esteem when
you do that when you become a victim you lose
self-esteem and you sort of feel bad about yourself and
you feel like you're a weak and you're not able
to handle life and then you you unplug from life
you become alienated and you just kind of like go
through the motions robotically and that's when you lose touch
with that one of those core of for purposes of
life which is feeling alive you no longer feel alive
because you're not actually taking challenges head-on because you've instead
opted to be a victim the next core principle is
be a leader lead yourself lead others around you don't
wait other people to inspire you to motivate you to
tell you what to do you do that yourself be
proactive be decisive take risks this also connects with that
principle of living a life and feeling alive this is
how you feel alive as being a leader being proactive
being decisive taking some risks which leads to the next
core principle which is be a creator tap into the
joy of creativity you have the power to be a
creator and to create all sorts of beautiful things art
music film writing novels magazines websites you know entire philosophical
systems and schools and religions and spiritual groups like there's
cars you could engineer airplanes new technologies like there's so
much stuff you can create pick something that you want
to be a creator in and then do that and
enjoy that you do it because it's enjoyable because as
god you're participating in the creative process of all of
creation and as a corollary here provide massive value to
mankind as the creator that's something you should strive for
how do I provide lots of value to mankind how
do I contribute to society improve the world that's part
of life purpose that's very important because if you are
lacking this component in your life you're gonna feel empty
and also what's gonna happen is that other people will
come and seduce you with various kinds of low consciousness
ideologies to get you to fill that void of a
lack of purpose in your life right so then what
happens is that people become Nazis or they become terrorists
or they they become some like right-wing fringe guy who
posts on some forum some like racist stuff like this
kind of stuff right why do people get sucked into
these kinds of low consciousness ideologies it's precisely because they
lack a legitimate life purpose they are not taught how
to be powerful creators they are not able to provide
massive value to the world so what they do instead
is they focus their energy on demonizing judging doing violence
and other sorts of schemes and manipulation tactics to get
their fill of life purpose it's sort of like if
you don't have a quality person to have sex with
then the way you're gonna it's not like you're never
gonna have sex you will have sex it's just it's
gonna it's gonna be probably in very low quality forms
like jerking off into a plastic cup see so it's
the same sort of thing with life purpose if you
neglect life purpose you're gonna pick up all sorts of
dysfunctional life purposes unconsciously that's like the default position the
next core principle is that reason cannot be trusted this
throws a lot of people for a loop and this
is very counterintuitive but reason and rationality cannot be trusted
all the highest insights and truths are trans rational not
irrational not less than rational but trans meaning beyond rational
think of it this way every single criminal terrorist murder
rapist thief religious fanatic con artists and wrongheaded scientist who
did bad science every single political party every single tyrant
and dictator what do all these people have in common
reason you might think no leo these people are all
unreasonable no every single one of these people has very
good reasons for why they do what they do and
why what they do is exactly right and good and
why they should continue doing it so how can you
trust reason by definition reason always feels reasonable to the
one whose reasoning this is what I mean by the
self-deception and by self bias see yourself biased to your
own chains of reasoning and what you don't understand is
that reason is not a vehicle towards truth it was
never intended for that reason is concoctions by your mind
by your lawyerly mind mostly your left hemisphere for most
people in order to justify your it going addenda that's
the real function of reason so reason just like a
good lawyer will be able to craft a case and
argument for any position any egoic agenda that you have
so reason cannot be trusted any time that you hear
a speaker who is making appeals to reason and is
arguing and saying and kind of framing the situation such
a way that all those people are unreasonable but I'm
the reasonable one and it's through reason that we get
to the truth anytime you hear that anytime you see
a person trying to be extra reasonable that's exactly the
same as looking at a person who's trying to be
extra moral you become immediately suspicious that the person who's
preaching morality and how good he is and how good
everyone can be but how they're all evil and how
they should be as good as him and that morality
is gonna solve everything you should be immediately suspicious and
you should expect that moralizing person has skeletons in their
closet and they're actually not moral well the same thing
with reason with these people who doubt reason as a
sort of ideology or a solution to everything if only
we were all a more reasonable than mankind would get
along be very suspicious of that the next core principle
is to embrace paradox confusion and not knowing again this
is one of the very counterintuitive things most people think
of paradox confusion and not knowing as bad things as
the opposite of personal development and the opposite of a
good life but no it's just the opposite the closer
you get to the good life the more you will
embrace paradox confusion and not knowing and you will get
comfortable with these things it's the person who thinks he's
figured everything out perfectly in this little model and put
it all into a little model and he thinks that
that model is is perfect it's consistent and it's it's
is it's airtight and super logical it's that person who's
deluded you can't do that with reality because reality is
infinite and all your little models and schemes are all
finite see my episode about doodles and completeness theorem if
you want to understand why that's impossible Kurt durdle actually
proved that truth is larger than proof area counterintuitive discovery
the core principle is emotional mastery you should be very
interested in mastering your emotions you should be very interested
in emotions period and how they work and spend a
lot of your time observing emotions now here's a mistake
that people make about emotional mastery it's when I say
emotional mastery they think oh yeah that sounds good I'll
just be hyper rational I'll be this unemotional detached person
who's above it all that's not emotional mastery that's the
suppression or repression of emotions to develop emotional mastery to
feel deeper into your emotions and this is a lot
of the type of concern that women have women can
object to some of my teachings they might say leo
but you're you're teaching us how to be like unemotional
and robotic and I want to be more emotional know
what I'm talking about is how to be more emotional
emotional mastery does not mean that you stop experiencing emotions
it actually means you experience emotions deeper but you're more
conscious of what they actually are and that's what gets
you mastery and control which should also be distinguished from
outbursts of negative emotions so somebody else listening here might
say Oh leo so what you're saying here to become
an emotional master I have to let all my emotions
out and be fully authentic with my emotions that means
that if someone cuts me off at traffic I will
open my window and and scream expletives at that person
because I'm angry and now I'm you know I'm being
authentic I'm expressing my anger and this is developing emotional
mastery no that's not emotional mastery that's actually a smokescreen
from fully feeling and observing your own emotions yelling at
people outbursts anger violence expressions of negative emotions these are
often just smoke screens from really self reflecting and and
feeling your own emotions an angry person doesn't really feel
their emotions they just act them out robotically you want
to read books about emotional mastery about how emotions work
because emotions are so sneaky and so tricky and you
know speaking of reason and emotions these rationalists they think
that reason is superior to emotions but actually it's the
other way around it's emotions which are dominating your reasoning
process those people who are hyper rational they're not hyper-rational
really they're emotional they're just not conscious of the emotions
that are fueling their reason you see their reason the
reason that they're so attached to reasoning is emotional and
it's because it's connected with their ego mind which is
full of emotions emotions are much more powerful in motivating
you and affecting your behavior than any reasons that you
have reasons come after the fact reasons are rationalizations they're
backwards rationalizations your left hemisphere actually confabulate s-- these reasons
later to justify whatever you're doing emotionally whatever's driving you
emotionally and to live the good life you're not gonna
be able to do that through reason you'd have to
do that by becoming a very observant of your emotions
and it's by curing your emotions that then your reasoning
process will also get purified along with that the next
core principle is you must integrate the masculine and the
feminine no matter whether you're a guy or a girl
and whether you lead more masculine or more feminine there's
a whole spectrum there and people lean in different directions
and so forth as of course we're all aware at
this point but what you need to do whichever direction
you lean in so let's say you're a man that
leans masculine like most men and you're a woman that
leans feminine okay so what you need to do as
a man is you need to go deeper into your
masculinity understand what it really is but at the same
time you want to make sure you don't create a
shadow out of the feminine so you're not doing at
the expense of the feminine you also need to dive
into your feminine side and explore that and master that
and integrate that feminine shadow into you and you need
to actually become sort of a synthesis of both and
you know vice-versa for the woman this is very important
for you to be able to then relate properly with
the opposite sex otherwise you're gonna become masculine but you're
gonna have a feminine shadow or vice versa and that's
gonna create all sorts of relationship problems for you and
also you're not gonna feel as good just being macho
masculine or girly feminine without integrating the other side so
like what we're trying to become is full well-rounded human
beings now that doesn't mean that you need to be
down the middle 50/50 so you know if you're a
masculine man I'm not saying that you need to be
half masculine half feminine you can still specialize and kind
of be predominantly masculine but you also need to integrate
the feminine aspects into your psyche and make sure you
don't hold any kind of grudges or judgments about the
opposite polarity the next core principle is non manipulation if
you do a lot of observation of your behaviors you
will notice how much you manipulate you manipulate all the
time the ego-mind that's sort of this whole role is
to be constantly manipulating everything you're manipulating your thoughts your
face your body posture your your relationships and in your
work and in your career and all of this your
costly manipulating and so one of the things you need
to do if you want to live a good life
is let go of that manipulation more and more and
more and more the less manipulative you are as a
person the better your life will be the next core
principle is that everything is relative what this means is
that anything except the absolute the ultimate truth of the
capital T is relative that means that it's only known
in relation to something else and I'll have a whole
episode in the future about relativity and how that contrasts
with the absolute but briefly here all conventional understanding and
even conventional experience that you have it's always relative so
an elephant is big only relative to a mouse it's
small relative to the entire earth and so on and
so this is this goes on and on and on
and affects everything that you know everything you know is
basically relative all perspectives are relative your entire understanding of
reality is relative all truth claims unless they're the absolute
which is not really a claim at all it's it's
something way beyond that all truth claims in words all
beliefs this is all relative all cultural norms all moral
standards it's all relative science is relative relative to what
relative to the human mind if the human mind has
changed if the chemistry the human mind has changed all
science flies out the window and all changes relative see
what you see what you experience what you know politics
and government and business it's all relative its relative to
the particular circumstances in context in which it's situated and
if the context changes then the situation changes your knowledge
changes none of that is absolute there is no absolute
external world physical world material world which leads us to
next principle which is context over facts most people get
very stuck on facts but they don't realize the importance
of context context is the the background within the fit
which the facts are situated and I have a whole
episode about context which is called understanding recontextualization go check
that one out it's a pretty profound episode with lots
of examples that I won't go into here the next
core principle is to pull from hundreds of diverse sources
this is done so that you don't get stuck in
any one perspective or paradigm this is absolutely critical as
you're going through life and you're doing this whole lifelong
learning thing which is one of your principles then you
need to be gathering from a lot of diverse sources
don't just read Western books read Eastern books don't just
read Hinduism read Christianity and read Greek philosophy and you
know spread it around diversify then fortify your portfolio of
knowledge and information just like you would stocks in a
stock market for exactly that same reason because you want
to avoid getting locked into some one thing someone terrible
paradigm which is very limiting and what will happen if
you study hundreds of diverse perspectives and this is one
of the core principles of actualized org is that I
do this very seriously then the truth will get triangulated
and cross-reference from all these different sources and books you
read you know you read hundreds of books eventually it
all gets triangulated in it and then it emerges the
sort of the big picture emerges that would be impossible
if you were only studying one particular school or one
tradition or one guru or you know one discipline within
a university you couldn't do that and it's only because
you're studying all these diverse sources that you learn about
all the traps and you learn about the full diversity
of of this thing called human life and human development
and there's so much more there than you could have
possibly gotten from any one school teacher or teaching which
of course applies to me you can't take me as
your only source you need to include me as part
of hundreds of other sources that you study from the
next principle is to satisfy your base needs so that
you stop craving this is very important I have a
soda that I release quite a bit ago called using
Maslow's hierarchy of needs to self actualize and what I
talked about there is it's all about satisfying your lower
needs your basic needs for shelter and water and food
and sex and this sorts of stuff and some friendships
and some self-esteem stuff like your career you got to
handle that stuff so you're not craving it so that
you can move higher up the pyramid to this higher
metaphysical existential stuff that we talked about this is so
important which leads to the next closely related principal of
master your basic survival and livelihood this is utterly important
if you don't do this it's as though you were
a lion on the savanna and you didn't know how
to hunt a lot of people these days especially young
folks I see this very often teenagers people in their
early 20s you know they grew up in a cushy
suburb somewhere in the United States or maybe in Europe
and their parents coddled them and so these kids they
just spent their whole childhood playing video games and watching
movies and just like [ __ ] around in school
with their friends and stuff smoking weed and this kind
of stuff and then by the time they're 20 and
maybe they finish even university they get out into the
real world and they have no idea about how to
actually survive or make a livelihood and then they start
thinking about some of the high lofty things I talked
about like consciousness and psychedelics and enlightenment and this but
it's like what enlightenment can there be when you don't
even know how to hunt learn how to hunt the
modern-day equivalent for human beings of what a lion does
on a savanna is business learn business learn how business
works learn how money works this is absolutely essential without
this you're gonna be crippled you need to be able
to just handle the basic basic things like paying your
rent being able to afford food if you can't do
these things forget about enlightenment for now focus on handling
that and of course that's all a function of your
inner game so it's not because the economy is bad
that you struggle with survival and livelihood it's because your
parents and your schooling and your childhood they didn't program
you with those survive the inner game survival skills that
you need to earn a living in the Savannah the
modern-day Savannah that humans live in and grow up in
which is cities and suburbs see a lion needs a
certain set of skills to be able to survive in
Savannah and a human in a 21st century need a
certain kind of skills in a certain kind of inner
game in psychology to be able to make a living
and survive in a city or in a suburban environment
that's super important I spent at least probably 10 years
of my life really working on developing a way for
how to be independent and survive on my own without
depending on my parents or money from other places or
anything like that so I can be self-sufficient and then
it's based on that foundation that then I could go
and do the higher stuff that I do I couldn't
do that otherwise like if I was worrying about how
to pay my my bills tomorrow I couldn't do this
other work that I'm doing the higher stuff because I
would always be in this kind of cycle of fear
not knowing what's next how to make ends meet this
sort of stuff you got to figure that out if
it takes you five or ten years that's okay figure
that out that's basically what you need to be spending
your teenage years and your all of your twenties up
through your 30s doing you want to you want to
solve that by the time you're 30 ideally if not
sooner the next core principle is mastery you need to
have something at least one thing in your life that
you are gonna plan to become a master in I
don't care what it is there are millions of options
you could be a master at drawing painting music DJing
weightlifting life coaching writing programming whatever you got to pick
one thing though and do it this jack-of-all-trades thing where
you're just dabbling in a bunch of [ __ ]
that doesn't work you need one thing that you're gonna
master this is connected with your life purpose this is
also connected with your thing that I just said about
survival and livelihood you know the lion is a master
at chasing down and lopes master hunting this gives you
a certain stability it also gives you enjoyment because really
your work what you're gonna be doing most of your
life the enjoyment that you get from that depends on
how much of a master you and it takes five
or ten years to become a master in something so
you got to pick one thing and do it so
that you could produce excellent work and so that you
could be a creator and you could be a massive
value provider to society one of the biggest things I
think young people are are screwing up on these days
Millennials and so forth is that they they just they
don't pursue mastery they're not a master at anything they
don't know how to do anything and therefore they can't
provide value to anyone and therefore you're stuck with the
some kind of waitressing job or working at McDonald's yeah
that's what happens when you're a master of nothing start
by mastering one thing one thing that you really enjoy
and it is important that you enjoy this thing that
you're gonna be mastering because you're gonna be putting so
much time and effort into it so you better enjoy
a lot now this doesn't mean you can't have hobbies
I'm not saying that like right now if you're playing
a guitar just for fun and you're an amateur at
it that doesn't mean you have to become a master
guitarist because hey maybe your field of mastery is programming
so if you're a master of programming sure you can
go dabble in guitar you can go dabble and painting
it doesn't matter cuz you're a master in programming you
got at least that one thing but if you're not
a master at anything and you're just dabbling and trying
a bunch of different stuff without selecting anything and being
decisive and clear about it and not being certain about
what you want to master that's gonna come back to
bite you really hard later in life and the older
you get the harder it is to master things so
start young but if you're old still do it better
late than never the next core principle is be aware
of distractions I have a whole episode by the way
I do have an episode about mastery it's an older
one you can go check it out it's called mastery
I have an episode about distractions it's called the egos
favorite defense mechanism distraction go check that one out where
I list all the different distractions that the ego mind
comes up with to prevent you from doing this work
from creating the good life these distractions of course includes
stuff like TV pour and video games internet social media
various kinds of ideologies and family can be a distraction
kids can distraction chasing material success business money drugs all
these can be distractions so you've got to be very
careful this is all part of the self-deception nation self
deceptive nature of the EO mind the next principle is
systems thinking you need to become a systems thinker learn
to think in terms of systems learn to see systems
at work everywhere and develop awareness for the ecological interconnectedness
of things I have a whole episode called intro to
systems thinking which will do just that introduce you to
systems thinking and explain all of this stuff if you
don't know what systems thinking is there are books you
can read about it on my book list that's a
pretty deep topic hmm people who aren't systems thinkers aren't
very good at solving bigger problems they tend to think
of problems in the world very simplistically in black and
white ways and I think that every problem is just
you know has one root cause or something like that
we're usually in a system you have a lot of
factors that are coming into play you have various kinds
of feedback loops that you need to think about systems
tend to work in counter intuitive ways oftentimes you're trying
to change a system the thing you do to change
the system actually ends up worsening the problem rather than
improving it so it's because of this that this is
important this is gonna help you to actually make the
contribution to the world that you want to make because
almost anything that you're gonna be interacting with in the
world that's of any interest is gonna be a complex
system of one form or another especially if we're talking
about large groups of people businesses societies cultures those are
all systems another core principle is be a good citizen
and be conscious of your ecological footprint you are part
of a larger whole you're like one ant in an
ant colony and you need to become conscious that you
are an ant in an ant colony and that you're
connected to a colony that your existence is not something
you do independently you do it as part of the
entire collective that you're a part of and you need
to seek to educate yourself about how that works part
of that is systems thinking because this colony is a
system but also you need to teach yourself about what
impact are you having on the larger culture and the
larger working of this colony that you're in are you
contributing to the lowering of its consciousness or the raising
of its consciousness are you contributing to the problems or
are you helping solve the problems are you being a
good citizen that requires a lot of education teaching yourself
about politics and governance and and how collective ego works
and how ecology works and your environmental impact even when
you're walking down the sidewalk eating a icecream what are
you gonna do with the rapper are you gonna throw
it on the ground or are you conscious of how
you're contributing to that are you conscious of how when
you're driving your car you're contributing to air pollution are
you conscious of how you know you being a citizen
of the United States for example contributes to the wars
that the United States starts overseas are you are you
conscious of your role in that or are you just
blind to that are you conscious of the kind of
food that you eat and how that impacts the environment
and animals and and other human beings are you conscious
of the products that you buy and how that impacts
third-world countries where these products might be developed under sweatshop
conditions right and you take responsibility for that and you
strive to be a good citizen otherwise what you get
is you get a kind of a crummy society that's
unconscious a kind of society that you don't want to
live in another core principle is be strategic I have
a very popular episode called how to be a strategic
[ __ ] it's one of my most practical episodes
that's why people like it I go into a lot
of nuances there about how to be strategic but you
need to be able to be patient with your plans
you need to lay out plans have a long time
horizon think 5 10 years down the road plan stuff
out in your life and be strategic about it so
that you're moving towards the things that you really want
and you need to have some short-term goals meeting from
goals long-term goals etc you need to be able to
go through multiple stepping stones to reach some kind of
goal a lot of people it's like they they want
something but then that's something is over here and they're
over here they don't see a path to there and
they're not able to create the stepping stones to move
their way up and in fact most of the biggest
things in life that you want to acquire are gonna
require multiple stepping stones to inch your way towards them
you're not gonna be able to just leap and get
it in one step the next core principle is that
happiness is only possible with enlightenment so if you're not
enlightened don't kick yourself too much for not being happy
it's actually not possible happiness comes with enlightenment now that
doesn't mean you can't improve your level of happiness of
course you can and you should you should work to
increase your happiness as much as you can even though
you won't be able to really lock in your happiness
without enlightenment you don't even know what true happiness is
without enlightenment but also what this principle demonstrates to use
why Lightman is so important because what you ultimately want
is happiness and the only way you're gonna get it
is through enlightenment so don't put and light it off
for too long another related principle is that no material
possessions will ever make you happy this is impossible this
is like a loss is exerting and reliable than Newton's
law of gravity or Einstein's equations of e equals mc-squared
this is this is more certain than that no material
possession will ever make you happy no matter what it
is cars houses money yachts but not just that also
the stuff that you normally wouldn't consider material like relationships
family knowledge the acquisition of knowledge travel you think travel
is not material well I'm including all of that under
the label of material here none of that stuff will
make you happy guaranteed impossible the sooner you can accept
that ah the much better your life will go if
you haven't you understood this principle you're gonna be chasing
for many many years you're gonna waste decades of your
life the next related core principle is be happy all
by yourself train yourself to be happy all alone just
sitting doing nothing that doesn't mean you have to be
a loner for your whole life you can socialize and
have fun with friends that's okay but if you can't
be happy just sitting on your couch doing nothing you
really can't be happy all the other stuff is just
temporary little boosts little shots of adrenaline and excitement little
drugs really that are distracting you from doing the inner
work you got to do to just be happy sitting
there by yourself on a couch for an hour or
two or a whole day or all week the next
core principle is keep your life simple and Spartan don't
over clutter your life not just with objects but also
with all kinds of social obligations and commitments family and
a bunch of kids and all this now that doesn't
mean there's a problem with having kids and family of
course you can have those things but just be mindful
of the fact that any time your life sort of
frees up your ego mind tends to want to fill
it with just any kind of distraction or activity what
you want to do is you want to minimize your
life and I have a whole video called lifestyle minimalism
check it that out minimize your life stitch that you
have room several hours every day to do self-improvement and
to meditate and do spirituality maybe do some psychedelics this
sort of stuff so you can work on everything we're
talking about here right everything we're talking about her the
implementation of all these principles requires a lot of free
time and work which most people waste on various kinds
of frivolous activities you know don't buy a house too
big that you don't really need because you're gonna waste
time cleaning that house maintaining that house doing all this
stuff when really buy a smaller house instead so that
you waste less of that time doing that and it
says spend more time working on yourself because remember the
really good stuff is the inner game changing the inner
game is really what's going to make you happy and
satisfied and get you all the other stuff that you
want not having a big mansion-house the next core principle
is that without practice and exercises and techniques there will
be no results theory alone while important to know what
to do will not in itself produce much results like
95% of your results will come from the practices and
exercise and techniques not from the theory that doesn't mean
the theory is pointless the theory is very useful but
you got to go beyond that and as far as
techniques go let me share with you the most powerful
techniques that I have discovered very simple I'm not gonna
hold it back from you psychedelics meditation meditative yoga journaling
contemplation visualization and solo retreats these are the most powerful
techniques that I discovered in the last five or ten
years of doing this work for me now for you
there might be other techniques but these are pretty solid
and consistent techniques these techniques have been proven by thousands
and millions of people to produce some of the biggest
gains that you can get in your life so the
biggest transformation come from these techniques and notice that most
of these techniques are inner techniques even psychedelics isn't it
seems like an outer technique but it's an inner technique
it's an outer technique which triggers an inner process and
the final principle and a very important one is do
not turn actualized unrig into an ideology actualize that work
is not meant to be an ideology it's not meant
to really be a philosophy or a system of any
kind it's not meant to have any rigid principles or
rules you're not supposed to follow these sixty-five principles that
I gave you like the ten commandments nothing like that
because that would violate principle number one which is ideology
and dogma so I have to be careful every time
I speak that it doesn't turn into that and of
course I have to play my part but you have
to play your part because I can do everything in
my power but then you could still turn what I
say into an ideology or into a dogma and in
fact that's what most people do so you have to
be very careful not to turn actualize that organ to
another religion see to be able to implement all the
stuff I talked about about above you need to you
need to be very intelligent about it and you need
to be very thoughtful and mindful and you need to
be very context sensitive you see it's not a formula
that you just kind of like follow it's not a
robotic thing that you do it it requires consciousness it
requires active participation every single day they that you're implementing
this stuff and also of course the reason I say
this is because actualizado work teachings have certain limitations it's
still a perspective even though I cover hundreds of perspectives
that I compile them together it's still a perspective it's
still coming from me it's less certain the limitations and
biases that I have and stuff that I got to
work through and of course of course it has that
which is why you got to be careful and you
got to look at other sources and not turn this
into an ideology so those are the 65 principles now
of course I have left stuff out these are like
the major principles of actualize that work there are hundreds
of more minor principles which I've talked about in other
episodes which would be too long to include here but
you know I've left has some important stuff like physical
health fitness nutrition and and other things like that which
are still important but as far as actual eyes that
org goes be sixty-five principles I think encapsulate a lot
of what I teach all right that's it I'm down
here please click that like button for me and come
check out exercise that all right that's my website you'll
be able to find my blog with various insights my
book list with lots of books the life purpose course
and the forum where you can chat about all this
stuff and finally I'll just conclude by saying this this
last thing and this you might think of like as
the final core principle is that life is complex and
challenging life is extremely deep but also very broad there
are many many many facets to it so just because
you understand someone or two facets don't get too cocky
and think that you've got it all there's so much
here to explore it's gonna take you your entire lifetime
to explore and you still will have much left over
for for future lifetimes and life is challenging which means
that you have to appreciate that you know I went
to into a lot of depth here in this episode
is it's almost like a two-hour episode here and still
I've only kind of just glossed over the surface of
these principles it will take you years to study and
learn all of these principles don't get intimidated by that
just realize that yes that's because life is so complex
and it is challenging it's difficult to learn all this
stuff which is exactly why most people have a mediocre
life because it takes a lot of work and energy
and time to do stuff to study all this stuff
to verify for yourself that it's true you know it's
one thing to just listen to me and believe everything
I say that in itself will take you a couple
hours here at least but that's not enough to actually
go and verify each these principles for yourself to corroborate
and cross-reference with other sources to triangulate the truth to
get other perspectives to see where I might be wrong
in all of this and then to implement all that
in your life that will take years and decades but
hey that's why you're alive and that's why you got
80 years to live you so that you can do
this this is this is the the meat of life
right here everything else that you do is just a
garnish this is the main course so try to structure
your life in such a way that you're focused on
the main course and not the garnishes of life and
also this should alert you to the fact that there
are no easy answers see there's no one technique no
one magic pill no one method that will solve everything
for you because life is just too broad for that
to work so you got to be nuanced no black
and white simplistic answers here that's why my episodes are
so long because you know the kind of stuff you
could fit into a five ten minute episode just like
what it's not gonna make a dent in the real
issues you have in your life it's only gonna be
rearranging the the chairs on the deck of the Titanic
and I want to really help you to get to
the root of things to get to the ultimate peak
experiences those mystical experiences you know to have to it
to handle all the bottom of the pyramid to get
to the very top of Maslow's pyramid and to go
even beyond that that's where yeah that's where life gets
really good that's what I'm really passionate about teaching and
experiencing for myself and then of course you take that
wisdom and you bring it back down to the bottom
pyramid and you infuse the bottom with the top and
then that's when your life really becomes something special so
we're gonna continue talking about that more and more that's
what all my episodes are geared towards hopefully now you
have a good understanding of what actualize that org is
about and you can follow these principles to to create
a really powerful life I hope you can see the
value of what's being shared here do not take it
for granted this day today from this information from now
on if you really make a commitment you can change
the entire trajectory of the future of your life in
an amazing way but it's not enough just to make
that commitment you're also gonna have to remember to work
at it every single day from now on as well
yes it's challenging but that's why I actually eyes already
exists is I keep releasing new videos to release more
insights for you more techniques and also just to keep
you motivated inspired and reminded that you've made this commitment
so stay tuned with me for more if for no
other reason than just to have me remind you that
this is what you really want because it's very easy
to forget and to fall back asleep in with all
your friends and then before you know it ten twenty
years goes by and you've pissed it all away and
you have nothing to show for it and you're more
depressed and miserable and regretful than ever you
