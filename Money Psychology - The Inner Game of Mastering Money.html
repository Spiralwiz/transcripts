hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the psychology of
money the deep root of all your money problems I
haven't spoken to you much about my dad but the
story of my dad was very instructive for me and
understanding and shaping my relationship towards money my dad is
very interesting character and I don't have time to go
into all the details of it but in a nutshell
all my childhood and basically through my teens until I
became an adult the situation in my family with money
was that my dad was the main breadwinner and he
was always off scheming and coming up with different business
ideas he was very entrepreneurial and that sounds great right
except the problem was is that every time he came
up with some new endeavor for how to make money
it would start off sort of promising and good and
then it would collapse and so then he was sort
of new endeavor and then it would collapse and a
new endeavor and that one would collapse at every single
time it collapsed and this happened over the course of
20 or 30 years basically my entire life and I
grew up in the situation and so although we were
never poor we were actually sort of like upper-middle class
but uh we had this sort of sine wave if
you plotted our money situation over time it would be
a sine wave some moments it was a lot of
money coming in and other moments we had so little
money that our electricity was turned off and we would
have to light candles in the house because we had
no lighting or air conditioning so that was interesting and
that um that whole situation ultimately led to the destruction
of my entire family like literally that destroyed my entire
family and all of that came about because my dad
basically was not conscious enough to recognize the inner game
of money and the psychological neurotic obstacles that were there
for him the key insight that I want you to
take away from this discussion is that money problems are
not economic problems they are not business problems they are
first and foremost psychological problems this is very difficult for
many people to wrap their mind around because when you
have financial problems and you're struggling with money in whatever
way there's a lot of different ways in which you
could struggle with money you have too little of it
or you're spending too much of it or you're hoarding
it or some other problem that you have with money
this is not fixed just by getting an infusion of
cash people think like oh well if I just had
more cash however I could get more cash that would
solve everything actually it's very counterintuitive because your problems are
psychological they're in here they're not out there no matter
how much that might seem to be the case so
cash will not fix it in fact if you ever
do get an infusion of cash you might be surprised
to learn like some people who get it that that
doesn't really solve your problems your patterns continue your problems
with money continue over and over and over again it's
the same thing as dysfunctional relationships right if you have
a pattern of dysfunctional relationships the problem is not the
people that you're relating to the way we would think
like all this this right this girlfriend here she wasn't
right for me or this boyfriend wasn't right for me
no it's an inner game problem you're going to keep
having those bad relationship problems over and over and over
again until you realize that hey I got to turn
inwards and really take a look at my beliefs attitudes
and my entire paradigm of relationships and the same thing
goes with money see money is really a hot-button emotional
issue and this is interesting because we would maybe think
that money is not an emotional issue we might think
that all money you know it's actually a very cut
and dried rational sort of issue either you have the
money or you don't either you're rich or you're poor
either the economy is good or it's bad or your
business is doing good or it's doing bad like look
at the numbers but money is very emotional it's sort
of like religion or like politics right these are sorts
of issues that people get very heated about and very
emotional about and of course that's exactly why there are
so many problems in these domains of life because when
we get emotional about stuff we tend to make errors
and we tend to go unconscious and not see how
the actions that we take backfire on us that was
the case with my dad it's probably the case with
you if you repeatedly struggle with money uh also notice
that with money your relationship to money is largely shaped
by your family's relationship with money when you were growing
up when you were a kid and a teenager think
back and take a look at the overarching relationship that
your whole family had towards money did your parents agree
with each other about it or were they fighting with
each other about it maybe they had different philosophies that's
how it was with my dad and my mom they
had totally different philosophies about money or maybe both of
them agreed but they both agreed that money was very
difficult to make or that those evil corporations were responsible
for making it so difficult for us to make money
or something like that or maybe the opposite maybe both
your parents were very lavish and they lavished you with
money and they were you know spending it left and
right so the key here to understanding money is to
understand that mostly you adopted many of your beliefs and
attitudes towards money in your childhood largely unconsciously you just
soaked it up from your environment and now though as
an adult you live based on those patterns or maybe
if you're like me actually in reaction against them so
like if your parents were very wasteful with money then
maybe now you react against it and now you're very
stingy with money or the opposite and some people think
that well if I am just doing the opposite of
my parents that means if they were dysfunctional and I'm
doing the opposite that means now I'm healthy and functional
and actually know often what happens that you're actually swinging
the pendulum from one end of the spectrum of dysfunction
to the opposite end of the spectrum dysfunction and what
you're living as an adult is you're living in reaction
to those emotional problems that your parents endured and that
then you have to endure as well and what this
does is when now you're an adult and you're facing
money challenges it makes it appear as though the money
challenges are really external obstacles in the outer world like
you don't have the right job or you're not in
the right business or you just don't have enough money
in your bank account and these seem like external obstacles
but that's rarely the case what I find is that
external obstacle sensibiy illusions in fact you got to turn
inwards take a look inside at your really core attitudes
and paradigms about money and then you will be able
to solve almost all your money problems if you only
get the inner game right I'll tell you another brief
little story and that was when I was a teenager
I like to read books like biographies and I'm one
of my favorite biographies another teenager was I read about
Bill Gates and I was really fascinated I read the
history of Bill Gates and how he started windows and
I also read about Apple Computer and stuff like that
and so this was happening in like Silicon Valley in
the 1960s and 70s and just from reading this book
I picked up some negative beliefs about money and about
business from reading this book I got this image because
the narrative in the book was that it was such
a heyday in the 60s and 70s with Silicon Valley
that when I was growing up in the 90s in
the early 2000s I actually felt really negative about my
prospects at starting a business because I felt like well
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs could do it in the
1960s and 70s because that was the heyday and now
it's gone all the big companies are already here and
they all took over and now how am I going
to make my money and I actually turn that into
a limited narrative and that held me back for a
long time from starting my business and I had to
work through that and overcome that and it was really
funny because actually while I had this very limiting narrative
about my prospects in business very ironically those were like
the most boom times because I lived through the whole
starting of the internet in the late 90s and early
2000s that was the whole internet boom and then also
the mobile boom which happened starting in like 2007 and
through 2010 that was the mobile boom and both of
those had even more potential to earn money then the
Bill Gates era and the Steve Jobs era in the
1970s with Silicon Valley but actually because my mindset was
so limited from this narrative that I just picked up
from reading one book and misinterpreting what that book said
that um that really limited me and what I was
able to do until I undid some of that stuff
so the bottom line is that you really have to
very carefully look and assess how you think about money
and how you relate to money money is an entire
domain of life it's a huge area of life that
requires a lot of work and knowledge to master see
most people don't treat it that way most people think
of money as like Oh cash that's what money means
it means cash no money for me is an entire
domain of mastery in the same way that intimate relationships
could be a domain of mastery business could be a
domain of mastery um sexuality could be a domain of
mastery you know consciousness or meditation could be a domain
of mastery so I can't go into all the details
of how to master money because that would be a
very long discussion you could have long courses and entire
seminars about that but what I do want to do
is I want to help you to really wrap your
mind around this idea that money is mostly a psychological
issue rather than external world issue and the way we're
going to do that is by just showing you what
are all the psychological aspects that create money problems well
firstly its fears think about all the fears that you
might have or people around you might have about money
for a lot of people the prospect of not having
money not being able to pay your mortgage actually conjures
up a flight or fight response and it can feel
like you're dying when you aren't able to pay your
bills on time it can actually feel like you might
actually get the sense that I'm gonna go broke and
then be out on the street and I literally am
gonna die that's how it could feel to you and
that could actually be coursing through your body that emotion
and of course that affects your entire attitude towards money
but you might also have other more subtle fears and
anxieties with money so that whole of course domaine a
fear and anxiety that's all psychological and then think about
how that affects your performance in business how that affects
your performance at work how that influences your strategic decisions
when you're trying to plan or to save money or
to decide what to buy right these emotions get in
the way and they sabotage your performance also there's this
whole issue of emotional spending a lot of people spend
their money emotionally not very rationally and that creates all
sorts of problems with them we've seen celebrities celebrities who
earn millions of dollars a year who are on TV
or in the tabloids and we see about them having
money problems how could it be that they have money
problems they make so much money well it's because if
you have an emotional spending problem which is psychological it's
purely psychological then no matter how much money you make
you could be the highest-paid celebrity in Hollywood and you
will still have money problems you see Michael Jackson is
a great example of this there's also emotional hoarding which
is the opposite of emotional spending so maybe for example
you were like me and because your parents and during
your childhood you didn't have that much money so now
as an adult you're actually kind of hyper vigilant and
sensitive to that and so you try to kind of
defend yourself by building up a nice little nest egg
for yourself right and that might seem like well I'm
being responsible what's bad about being responsible that seems a
healthy relationship towards money except what happens when you're hyper
stingy and you're hoarding money and you're using that as
sort of an emotional crutch that's emotional hoarding and then
that comes back to bite you in the ass that
mechanism backfires because then if you're like me you know
I actually have to work through this because it was
difficult for me to actually make important purchase decisions to
actually pull the trigger on buying a book or buying
the right course or going to the right seminar because
I just had this emotional need to hoard money and
not to spend it and that bit me in the
ass because I needed to spend it strategically to make
important investments there's also all the limiting beliefs that revolve
around money and there's so many of these that we
pick up from our society from our family what are
they well here's a short list the economy is not
good enough that's why I struggle with money corporations have
all the power that's why I struggle with money I
can't make big money in my field yeah sure if
I was a doctor or a dentist or a lawyer
then I could make nice money but because I chose
to be a marine biologist a yoga instructor or an
artist because of that that's why I struggle with money
or maybe you have the belief that competition is too
steep to earn good money or maybe you believe that
there's just not enough to go around and there's only
so much money and there's seven billion people on earth
so because there's so many people on earth well no
wonder I struggle with money maybe you believe that or
maybe you believe that you can't start a business because
you don't have enough capital and you need capital to
start a business and so therefore there's catch-22 that without
capital you can't start a business and so that prevents
you from starting a business or maybe you're not interested
in business maybe you just have a nine-to-five job a
regular career and the reason you struggle with money you
believe is because my boss is a jerk that's why
Leo it's because my boss doesn't appreciate me and he's
very stingy and so of course that's why I struggle
with money what can I do about that or maybe
you have to believe that it's your company see you
work in a corporation and it's the company who's stingy
who's screwing me over what can I do about that
I can't change the entire corporate culture or maybe you
believe that money is hard to make that's a very
common belief think about where that belief might have come
from well probably from your family right if money was
difficult to make for your mom and your dad then
you will probably believe that it's actually difficult to make
now you might say well Leo we all know money
is difficult to make well no not really you believe
that because you struggled with it for most of your
life but there are people out there who actually believe
that money is easy to make and it's pretty crazy
once you get a little bit of success and you
realize how money really works and you get your psychology
the inner game of money dialed in you can make
money very easily very easily it can be shocking how
easy it is to make money when you dial in
your inner game and most people who I would tell
that to if they struggle with money they can't even
believe that that's so far outside their paradigms that they
can't believe that because their beliefs are so unconscious to
them when you believe something like money is hard to
make your mind doesn't hold it as a belief your
mind actually thinks that this is true and this is
how reality is so it really shapes what's possible for
you that's why these beliefs are so critical or maybe
you believe that money is evil it's a source of
corruption and evil in the world and if you believe
that where did that belief come from well probably from
your family right if your parents thought that maybe your
parents grew up in a Protestant or a Catholic sort
of upbringing and they developed these beliefs about how money
is the root of all evil and then they imprinted
those beliefs into you and now you hold those beliefs
and you look around and you say well but Leo
it is evil look at all the damage that money
does in politics and look how much it destroys the
environment and how these corporations are so unethical in what
they do with money you know money corrupts people and
money is all about power and this sort of stuff
and while that might be true for some people that
doesn't necessarily mean that money is evil and if you
think that money is evil think about how that's going
to limit your ability to make money because you're judging
this thing called money and you might judge that all
that guy right there you know he's so rich he's
a rich billionaire and so he's evil but guess what
you're also partaking in the game of making money maybe
you aren't a billionaire but still you go to a
job and you make money and while you judge him
you also secretly at the same time judge yourself for
making money and that can be a huge limiting belief
or maybe you have limiting beliefs like oh that thing
right there is too expensive I can't afford that I
could never afford that I could never afford a million-dollar
house and I could never afford afford myself that car
or I can never afford to go on this kind
of vacation and then that becomes true for you some
people have this belief that everyone is trying to scam
them it's like Oh leo you're trying to sell me
some sort of course or something or some of these
self-help authors you know I go to a seminar and
then they try to upsell me on stuff they're just
trying to scam me I know how it works I
know how it works these self-help authors all they do
is to just write books they don't help anyone but
themselves the whole thing is just scam if you have
that kind of belief then think about how much that
limits you when you need to go out if you're
going to be successful in life and you're going to
be wealthy guess what you're gonna have to hire people
to help you you'll probably have to hire coaches consultants
you're gonna have to go to seminars buy books and
programs and some of those could be very expensive and
if you think that all these people are trying to
scam you think about how many avenues you're cutting off
for yourself with that one belief or maybe you believe
that business is anti spiritual think about how that limits
your ability to do business and you might say well
Leo I do believe that business is anti spiritual and
that's why I don't have a business that's why I
just go to my nine-to-five job that's very funny because
when people say that what are you doing when you're
going you're not my job what is that that's business
too so if you believe that business is evil and
anti spiritual you've really painted yourself into a corner because
again secretly deep down inside your mind knows that when
you're going to your job you are engaging in business
you have to engage in business in one way or
another to survive you need money to survive you see
so you can't damned money because if you do that
means you're damning yourself not just through people but you're
also damning yourself at the same time so you can
start to see how a lot of these beliefs can
be dysfunctional and how they can backfire and a lot
of these beliefs they're just not true their constructions they've
been concocted by your mind or just picked up from
your childhood environment and they can be changed you can
take every one of these beliefs and flip them upside
down into their polar opposites and Wow when you do
that that takes some work but when you do that
that will really change your struggles with money other facets
of money that are psychological are playing the victim a
lot of these limiting beliefs that I said already play
into this narrative of being the victim but just to
say a few more points about this you know a
lot of people have excuses about why they struggle with
money as though it's inherently the norm like its natural
to struggle with money and so they have all sort
of excuses like well it's my boss it's my company
it's the economy it's the corporation structure you know the
damn corporations who have taken all the the best job
so now you know how can I compete with them
as a one-man shop all these excuses but these are
all excuses because you know what companies if you're in
a bad company you could change companies if you're in
a bad industry you can change industries the economy I
made some of the most money I've ever made my
entire life during the worst economic time in my entire
life which is the 2008 crash when that 2008 crash
happened the global collapse of the economy and the US
economy especially the stock market tanked and all that I
was making more money at that time than ever in
my entire life pretty funny you know so a lot
of people have these sorts of excuses as though they're
stuck in their job as though they're stuck in their
line of work and they're stuck in their business and
they're tied to the economy but the fact is that
those are all excuses and a lot of those excuses
are emotional because you know what it's scary to go
out there and start a business it's scary to change
your career it's scary to go into work and to
ask for a promotion that you think you deserve but
maybe you're afraid that if you ask for too much
they'll fire you I've been there that's scary to do
so of course it's much easier to play the victim
and to come up with all sorts of excuses and
that's emotionally based can you see how that's emotionally based
it's your fears that are creating your excuses which are
then making you play the victim which are then leading
to your money problems also procrastination think about how procrastination
reinforces your money problems procrastination with paying the bills procrastination
on starting your dream project or your dream business or
procrastination on going back to school to learn the skills
you need to get a better degree to then be
better at your job and then to earn more money
but you keep procrastinating on that again and again and
again what's procrastination it's a purely emotional psychological issue think
about also materialism the trap of materialism thinking basically that
money will lead to fulfillment and the solution to all
your problems in life a lot of people fall prey
to this and this entire attitude of materialism what is
this this is based on beliefs which are for psychological
it's based on emotional needs that you have that you
are trying to fill with materialism it's this sort of
emptiness or this void that you're trying to fill with
materialism which will never work but you don't know that
until you really know that you see a lot of
people don't know that even when I tell them they
still can't believe it because this is such a counterintuitive
thing and that whole dynamic of materialism is purely a
psychological problem it's not an outer world problem it's a
psychological thing another problem with money comes from improperly earning
money there's a lot of different ways that you can
earn money and a lot of them are improper what
does that mean well you can get involved with all
sorts of businesses or schemes or multi-level marketing or whatever
which can earn you some money in the short run
but in the long run it's going to lead to
all sorts of disasters which I can attest to because
I've seen my dad do this over and over and
over again he was the master of finding ways to
earn money that were really not proper and not wise
and what was that driven by it was driven by
psychology it's that need to have an immediate result it's
that sort of impatience that you have which is what
everybody has when they go to try to start a
business using some get-rich-quick scheme what is the get-rich-quick scheme
preying on its preying on you wanting money now which
is of course an emotional trigger and they know how
to press that button in you so that you buy
their get-rich-quick scheme which rarely tends to work and then
that just fuels your struggles with money also improperly prioritizing
money a lot of people put money way too high
on their list of values because they think that well
money should go above family and it should go above
relationships and it should go above my ethics and it
should go above consciousness and personal growth and if you
do that you start to run into a lot of
problems but why do you prioritize money so highly again
probably because of fears and emotional needs that you have
improperly investing money is also rooted in psychological problems a
lot of people make bad terrible investments and they fall
prey to various financial traps that exist such as credit
cards variable rate mortgages various pyramid schemes and multi marketing
schemes bad stock investments bad real estate investments and why
do they do that well because they're not very aware
it's an awareness problem they're not aware of these traps
and also because they get seduced emotionally seduced into these
traps because these traps offer something easy something quick something
lucrative and that's rooted in psychology another facet that's psychological
about money is a lack of long-term strategy a lot
of people don't sit down and actually create a long-term
strategy for their finances and then that leads them to
just going with whatever is going to work in the
show term and that leads to disaster when it comes
to your finances also psychologically rooted is lack of discipline
and lack of proper money habits if you don't have
the right habits financially installed in your life you're going
to struggle with finances and if you lack the discipline
with investing with working on your career with working on
your business that sort of stuff you know all that
requires discipline checking your bank account statements checking your expenditures
versus your income if you lack discipline in all those
areas and of course discipline is largely a psychological problem
if you lack discipline then you're going to have financial
problems for the rest of your life also lack of
knowledge and education most people who struggle with money just
don't really understand how money really works they haven't taken
the time to sit down and learn it and that
leads to disastrous results in your life and why didn't
they sit down to learn it well it's probably a
psychological issue because they were too lazy or because it
was too boring for them they couldn't motivate themselves to
learn about money to master money to educate themselves or
they thought that it wasn't necessary and then that created
problems and lastly avoiding and ignoring money some people they
might say well the arm a spiritual person maybe I'm
a very artistic creative person I don't want to worry
about money facts and figures that was never my forte
so I'll just leave that to somebody else and they
ignore the whole situation and that ends up being disastrous
because if you avoid the issue of money if you
avoid learning about it and changing your early childhood beliefs
which are tend to be very naive if you avoid
getting the inner game of money dialed in because you
just ignore it uh that's probably rooted in some psychological
emotional stuff that you had going on in childhood and
then what happens is disaster because you can't really go
through life and avoid this domain called money it's a
very big domain you're gonna run into it no matter
what whether you start a business or don't money is
gonna affect a lot of things in your life so
you can't just say oh I'm just going to avoid
it I'm just going to ignore it cuz it's not
my forte can't do that in the same way that
you can't really go through life and say something like
well you know health health just not my forte I'm
gonna ignore health I'm an ignore Fitness I'm gonna ignore
nutrition if you do that you will get terrible results
in your life you're you'll die a lot sooner than
you should have so um I'm hoping that you're starting
to see here how many psychological facets that are too
many they tend to be a lot more nuanced than
we originally think and because we don't look very deeply
into them it makes it appear as though money is
an external obstacle when in fact it's not what I
want to give you is I want to give you
sort of a big-picture ideal of what you should be
shooting for when it comes to money psychology what does
healthy money psychology look like because I've been describing a
lot of dysfunctional stuff well here's a quick list for
you first is that you're fully aware of the trap
of materialism and you really understand that materialism does not
work at all it just cannot work you will never
be fulfilled by having money and none of your other
problems in life will really be solved by having money
also you've identified many emotional reactive triggers and hot buttons
that you have with respect to money so stuff that
you need to buy or fears you have from your
childhood or whatever emotional reactive pad you've identified those and
you become very aware of them that's part of this
big picture ideal also you're not ideological about money you
don't hold money as good or as evil you really
drop many of your beliefs about money so that you
hold it as rather neutral also you've made yourself aware
of many of the money traps that have been constructed
by society what do I mean by money traps well
it's all the stuff like shopping credit cards mortgages pyramid
schemes bad investments the dangers of the stock market you've
educated yourself about these and you're very wary of them
and you're not tempted emotionally tempted to get lured into
these traps because make no mistake about it a lot
of these are traps that were very carefully designed by
people to get your money also as this ideal you
have an abundance mindset which means that you don't think
that money is limited and that you need to fight
others and that it's a win-lose situation you hold it
as a win-win situation that you can create abundance for
yourself that's an entire attitude that you have to develop
and it can be difficult to develop that if you
grew up in a lower-class or a middle class family
where this sort of abundance wasn't there it goes contrary
to many of your direct experiences it feels like a
fantasy and so there you have to work on your
beliefs and believe it or not it's possible to develop
that also as part of this ideal is you take
100% responsibility for your money situation and you don't make
any excuses or you don't blame anybody else it's not
your mom it's not your dad it's not the economy
it's not the president it's not your company it's only
you and it's your inner game that makes a difference
and you recognize that and that gives you all the
power because now you can change that also you're using
money strategically investing it strategically mostly in yourself so that
the money is paying dividends for you and you're taking
a long-term view of things so you're actually sitting down
and you're planning out and you're strategizing with respect to
money rather than just treating money as something that comes
in or something that goes out and you sort of
just kind of like look at it on a weekly
or a monthly basis no you're looking at this more
in terms of years and decades you have a long
term view with respect to your finances and lastly as
part of this ideal is that you really taken the
time to position yourself in life so that money has
become a byproduct of your deepest passion this is very
important I've spent probably a decade of my life putting
this puzzle piece in place because it's such an important
puzzle piece money should come to you as a byproduct
of doing your greatest passion not from just going to
a nine-to-five job and trying to pay the bills you
can get money that way but that's so inefficient that's
so much less than you're capable of and you will
definitely have money problems if you don't set it up
this way and how do you set it up this
way well I have a cold course you have to
find your life purpose which I have a whole course
on over 30 hours of content explaining how I set
this up in my life so that my greatest passion
is creating money for me and you can definitely do
that for yourself but that takes work in a lot
of explanations so you might want to check out my
course if you're interested in figuring that out so uh
that's sort of like the ideal that you're shooting for
now you might wonder ok Leo but how do I
actually do this because a lot of this stuff is
abstract and what I really need is money tell me
how to make money well that's the trap right there
already is being too eager and too focused on just
getting cash well you need to do is need to
slow down you need actually turn inwards really turn inwards
start to observe your money patterns start to observe your
spending habits start to observe how your earning income where
is your income coming from and why is it coming
from those places what's motivating you to get that income
is it just to pay the bills is that your
motivation and is that really a high quality motivation so
you want to start to become more conscious of that
apply awareness to the problem that will fix a lot
of stuff for you that will not be fixed just
by getting cash in your pockets getting cash in your
pockets does not fix almost any of these psychological aspects
in fact it can actually make them worse then what
you do is after you've been observing your patterns is
you decide that you're going to master this domain this
is a whole domain of mastery in the same way
that relationships are fitness and health is meditation and enlightenment
is you know these are all different facets of life
and money is a facet of life and at some
point in your life you're probably have to say okay
enough is enough I can't just wing this anymore I
have to go read the books I have to go
find the expert advice I have to maybe go take
some training some courses some seminars this sort of stuff
get some coaching on this so that I've really mastered
this domain once and for all and then I could
be making intelligent strategic choices and so you decide they're
going to master this domain and then what you do
is you get to work doing the research doing the
research not get to work to earn money get to
work doing research about money people don't do this nearly
enough which means you got to go find the books
read the books take notes on the books go find
the courses go find the seminars spend a few years
doing this go get therapy or coaching on your money
issues from your childhood we're those needs release those fears
look at your emotional triggers and buttons with respect to
how you're spending money and why you need to be
earning money take a look at this trap of materialism
that you have this idea that if I just had
more money than I could have all my problems in
my life solved and fix all that and then you'll
be in a good position that will be a solid
foundation that you're building and after you do that I
think that the most important thing is life purpose find
your life purpose and align your career or your business
with that so that your greatest passion is the source
of your income in life be very careful about this
trap of asking people to tell you how to make
money maybe you watch this episode and you're thinking now
well Leo you've talked a lot about a philosophical abstract
psycho babble but you didn't actually tell me how to
make money give me a one two three step formula
for how I can start a business and make money
I deliberately didn't give that to you because you cannot
become wealthy through some one two three step formula it
doesn't work like that what you need to do is
you need to build the foundation think about it this
way if we wanted to grow a gigantic tree that
sprouted a lot of fruit that could feed a whole
village of people what would we do would we spend
all our time focusing on the leaves and the fruit
of the tree no what we would do is we
would spend all our time cultivating and strengthening the roots
of the tree making sure that it has the strongest
root system possible the foundation and then the leaves and
the fruits would take care of themselves that's what you
got to do here avoid the trap of just going
for cash that's never going to work that's always going
to backfire and it's going to lead to this recurring
problem of you struggling with money over and over and
over and over again I've been there I've seen my
dad do it it's a very painful way to go
through life so what I decided to do early in
my life is I said you know what I'm gonna
I'm gonna I'm gonna develop a deep foundation for my
security for my financial security my life that's going to
be based on proper psychological mindsets and life purpose and
then from that making money becomes easy it's really effortless
and it becomes a joy because you get to go
to work do the things you love to do and
then money just pours in and isn't that really what
you want but how do you get there it's not
by buying some sort of blueprint for some business in
a box business in a box doesn't work you're gonna
have to be creative in the end about how you
go out and design your career and design your business
that's a very customized thing no one can hand that
to you you have to figure that out for yourself
all that I can help you with and others if
you decide to go read some books or take some
seminars I recommend that a lot what they can do
is they can get you to figure out the inner
game and then you're going to figure out the outer
game as you go along right so don't get too
hung up on the outer game stuff so that's it
I'm done here but before I let you go I
have a worksheet for you so go down take a
look at the link below click on the free worksheet
download it and do the exercises those exercises will help
you to take this abstract stuff and drill down and
make it concrete because what I want to help you
do is to actually really analyze why you behave the
way you do with money and that's difficult to do
without doing the worksheet so do this worksheet it's very
important and that's it I'm signing off so please click
the like button for me share this episode with friend
put your comments down below and lastly come to actualize
it right here come check it out sign up to
my newsletter sign up and stay tuned because I have
a lot of other topics that I need to talk
to you about for mastering your life you know to
master your life you really need to master multiple domains
of life if you just master one domain of life
you're going to be lopsided and your life's not going
to go so well and there's a lot of counterintuitive
stuff that you need to learn about every single domain
of life and you know what your success in life
is going to be directly proportional to how you can
master the inner game the psychology the psychology of relationships
the psychology of emotions the psychology of business psychology of
money psychology of health if you can master the psychology
of all those and more then you're going to have
the strongest foundation the strongest root system and then the
fruits that you will get will be so amazing that
you will not even believe it but it will take
some time for that tree to start to sprout the
fruit take some time so what I encourage you to
do is to buy into the vision decide that you're
really going to take mastering your psychology seriously that you
really want to self actualize and that you're making this
as part of your whole life journey is to be
growing it's really the most fascinating thing you can do
in your life is to be growing and to be
learning how to grow better so that's what I'm here
to do is I'm here to support you with the
theory the techniques the resources and ideas that you need
to make that a reality so stay tuned with me
