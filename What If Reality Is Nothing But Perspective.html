I want to talk about perspective and points of view
this episode is going to be what I consider epistemology
so one of the most important things that I try
to teach is that reality is deeply perspectival reality is
made out of different perspectives and that to understand reality
you need to be flexible enough with your mind to
be able to look at it from different perspectives why
is this so difficult to do have you ever wondered
this have you ever noticed that virtually everybody that you
know virtually every human on the planet is stuck in
their limited perspective of reality and they can't see reality
through any other perspective it's like they're stuck and what
they're doing from a meta-level if you just kind of
like look at what are humans doing with their minds
epistemic ly on this planet it's very simple they're born
they're conditioned or indoctrinated into some worldview and then they
live their entire life looking at the world through that
worldview through that perspective unable to see reality in any
other way and then they defend that worldview or that
perspective to the death as though it's absolute truth when
actually it isn't have you noticed this when I say
it like that it seems so obvious like how could
humans be so stupid as to genuinely believe that the
perspective that they have of reality is actually some sort
of absolute truth or how things actually are and here
I'm talking about all manner of perspective I'm not just
talking about really fundamentalism although of course I am I'm
talking about political perspectives I'm talking even about materialism and
science as a perspective of reality I'm talking about rationality
logic I'm talking about whether it's feminism or whether it's
men's rights or red pill or sort of the pick
up way of looking at the world or whether you're
a capitalist or a socialist or a liberal or a
conservative or this or that mmm whatever culture you're from
whether you're Japanese or Chinese or Brazilian or American or
European or Scandinavian or African or a middle-eastern whatever religion
you have and then even just beyond that even if
you start to get into spirituality like genuine spirituality not
the sort of spirituality as a Dogma via religion but
like real spiritual work non-duality awakening work and so forth
even there people have different perspectives that they get stuck
on have you noticed this have you wondered why this
is going on what are the deeper structures of the
mind or of the psyche that are fueling this because
it's so common everyone is stuck in their own perspective
isn't it obvious to you that no one perspective can
be correct isn't that obvious isn't it obvious what the
game is that the mind is playing every mind basically
thinks that every other mind is diluted with the exception
of itself which it thinks is the absolute truth or
the absolute perspective so people will readily agree that all
there's all these people in the world but of course
my perspective can't be diluted and of course everybody is
doing that same thing so we get the kind of
mess that we're in see so one of the most
important things that I try to teach with my work
my entire life's work is grounded in this is to
try to avoid that pitfall yourself to try to do
the exact opposite of what everybody else is doing in
society which is to stop defending your perspective and to
take a sort of a meta perspective by stepping up
one level taking a higher elevation looking down upon the
entire situation and seeing it for what it is which
is a game of the mind of defending its own
perspective I mean look everywhere you look on YouTube you
see people debating other people about differences in perspective everywhere
you see on cable news it's people arguing with other
people defending their perspectives and unable and unwilling it's like
they're deliberately unwilling to be able to look at the
world from somebody else's perspective have you noticed that why
does that happen why is it such a common phenomenon
see part of the materialist paradigm which all of us
assume and take for granted as the default way that
reality is we tend to think of reality as this
objective external material thing out there and then that we
humans are just we're looking at it but there's something
deep that's absolute that we aren't creating but that's just
their part as part of reality and that that is
sort of like what we're seeing in that our perspective
isn't really a perspective we hold it as truth we
hold it as something deeper than just a perspective and
it never occurs to us what if reality itself is
nothing but perspective what if there's nothing but our own
perspectives on reality that's an interesting meta perspective but see
most people are so stuck in their perspective that just
to get them to consider the possibility that there is
no reality underneath your perspective there is only differences in
perspective and that in the end all perspectives are in
a sense equally valid or just one way of accessing
reality and there that there is no reality underneath or
behind the particular way in which you're accessing it most
people don't want to consider that as a possibility because
that robs them of the attachment they have to their
own perspective then it's very clear at that point if
you accept that premise or that possibility that I just
laid out it's it's very clear that then defending any
one particular perspective is very silly but our minds on
the other hand get very attached to our perspectives and
our perspectives really really seem true they really seem objective
it seems like my perspective it's not something I'm creating
it seems like my perspective is just how the world
is and it couldn't be otherwise so one of the
things I try to push you to do which makes
this work different than many other things that you encounter
in society then many other intellectual works is that few
other intellectual works explicitly acknowledge this Mehta view of perspectives
and explicitly push you to go beyond your own perspective
of reality to not get stuck in that trap most
of what you encounter in society in the intellectual marketplace
is you encounter various people pushing their own perspectives because
they think that they're true and this has been happening
throughout all of human history and yet what we see
if we look far enough back into into history we
see how absurd many of these different perspectives were at
the time how wrong they were how deluded they were
how partial they were and so on and yet at
that time people treated these perspectives as absolute truth there
was a time where the majority of people on this
planet had the perspective that the planet is flat and
it's at the center of the universe and it's not
in motion the planet is not spinning it's not moving
it's completely stationary see and now we look at that
and we laugh how silly they are we think but
this should so a very deep doubt in your mind
because if millions and billions of people could have been
deceived in such a way about such a fundamental thing
just as little as five or a thousand years or
five hundred years or a thousand years ago then what
makes us so confident that we're not committing the same
kind of epistemic mistakes today see my entire life's work
is is informed by this possibility very early on in
my teenage years I just noticed that people were disagreeing
with each other about different perspectives and I noticed that
I too disagreed with these people now of course I
had my own perspective but then it made me wonder
but how can I be so sure that my perspective
is it right why am i why am i defending
my own perspective as vehemently as I am and then
that got me to start to question like well how
do I really know anything at all that gets you
into some deep waters of epistemology and I spent some
number of years being very skeptical mostly skeptical of my
own ideas and as I questioned my own ideas I
realized that really there was no foundation to my own
ideas into my own perspectives and beliefs and then that
is what led me to ultimately reaching this this this
point of a profound relativity a profound appreciation of relativity
which then opened up my mind to be able to
explore reality in radical new ways that most human beings
are unable to do because they're stuck in their own
perspective and this has been if there has been any
magic formula in my in my life and in my
work this is it this is one of my biggest
magic tricks is the ability to recognize that my own
mind is bullshitting me and then I can't take it
too seriously and once you see this it completely changes
your whole orientation to society to mankind to belief systems
to ideologies to science to religion to spirituality and it
opens up radical new possibilities that that most people could
never pursue because they're stuck in their own perspective defending
their own perspective but see in order to go in
this direction there's a problem in that you have to
be willing to endure the sting and the emotional discomfort
of doubt and surrendering your own perspectives on reality all
the stuff you've been taught all the stuff it seems
intuitive and obvious to you all the stuff that seems
self-evident all the stuff that your religion taught you that
your teachers and professors taught you that you read in
books that your parents taught you that's part of the
background assumptions of your entire culture all that needs to
be questioned that's very uncomfortable and it's not immediately obvious
what you would gain from doing such a thing because
at first it seems like just abstract philosophy doesn't seem
like it's gonna really get you huge success or earning
a bunch of money or get you a bunch of
hot girls or something like that so why would you
do it well for me the motivation was just pure
understanding a desire to understand what's really going on for
its own sake not to get something out of it
but just to understand for the sake of understanding if
I had to teach you one thing with my work
I think it would be this the ability to step
back from all perspectives and to realize that no perspective
is true all perspectives are partial and that your own
mind is always biased towards whatever perspective it has on
the world it's like you have these blinders on where
your mind deliberately is unwilling to question your own perspective
precisely because the mind is situated in that perspective and
it stands to lose its own self by giving up
that perspective and because it has this deep fear this
fundamental fear of losing its perspective the way that it
copes with that is that it creates all sorts of
dysfunctional coping mechanisms that project its own ignorance and defensiveness
and insecurities outward such that it doesn't have to focus
in on questioning itself for example mechanisms like debating arguing
with others getting angry at others judging others for how
stupid they are creating an entire career around one's ideology
or philosophy or perspective writing books about it starting YouTube
channels about it defending it using logic and reason to
project one's perspective out onto the world condemning and demonizing
others for not agreeing or understanding your perspective because see
the trick with a perspective is that you don't hold
the perspective and yet think of it as a perspective
when you are really bought into your perspective your perspective
is for you reality most people don't make a distinction
between reality and their perspective of reality they think that
their perspective is reality just to kind of ground this
a little bit let's give you some examples because it
might be getting a little too abstract for example you
believe that you were born you believe that that's not
a belief or a perspective that you were born to
you that you were born is reality it's not like
oh well yeah I was born well that's one perspective
and then so there are some other perspective that's alternative
to that no there's no such possibility space in your
mind that is part of your perspective is your perspective
is such that your perspective is that you were born
and your perspective is that there is no perspective about
this it's just reality and there's no possible alternative another
perspective that you might have is that you you believe
that the universe existed before you were born and that
you were born into it and that when you die
you will sort of reverse that process you will be
born out of it you will disappear but the universe
will continue to run along as it did before you
were born your ancestors will will continue to live on
your children and their children and so forth that mankind
it'll all continue just like it did before you were
born now again this is not held as a perspective
this is held as a reality so these are just
a few examples I mean we could come up with
hundreds of different examples of of what perspectives are you
could have the Christian worldview you could have the Buddhist
worldview you could have the Islamic world view you could
have the atheistic worldview some nihilistic worldview you know whatever
so is a very very tricky thing your mind doesn't
want you to venture outside of your perspective it feels
uncomfortable it feels confusing it can even feel painful to
venture too far outside of ones perspective but therein lies
the the true work and freedom that you can gain
the growth that you can gain as a human is
not falling into that same old trap that 99% of
people fall into which is defending their perspective and holding
it as absolute truth what if you did the exact
opposite of that what if you made a counterintuitive move
here and you said that for the rest of your
life you commit to being non-ideological and you commit to
surrendering your own perspective enduring the emotional discomfort and labor
that comes with that and exploring other others perspectives not
looking for a replacement or a better perspective but rather
as a sort of meta exercise in just the exploration
of perspectives what if you took that approach to life
from now on what if you are no longer interested
in defending any intellectual position or pet theory of yours
ever what if that whole exercise just ceased to have
meaning for you you didn't care anymore about defending liberalism
or conservativism or libertarianism or socialism or capitalism or Christianity
or Islam or science or atheism or even logic or
rationality or even material existence or human history what if
you saw through that entire game as just a game
of the mind and you rose above that can you
see how that would be a a radically different attitude
towards life than almost any of your peers friends family
members or colleagues or even great intellectuals in society have
ever done it's so simple but it's such a counterintuitive
move it's so deeply counterintuitive that it doesn't even occur
to most people to do this yet when you hear
me talking about it in retrospect it seems so obvious
it seems like yeah why would I limit myself artificially
to one particular culture religion school of philosophy or political
ideology or anything any of that because they all seem
so limited why would i artificially limit my own mind
why how can i really judge another perspective unless i've
lived in it looked through that lens and seen what
it really feels like you see one of the problems
with perspectives is that people will use their perspective to
evaluate some other perspective without actually switching perspectives such that
what happens is that your original perspective colors how you
see some other perspective and of course because of the
biased nature the partial nature of every perspective it's going
to impart a sort of a tint or a distortion
onto other perspectives and therefore you're not going to really
truly be able to understand the other perspective so what
I mean by this is if you're a Christian that's
your perspective on the world and then when you look
and consider other perspectives like Islam or atheism or let's
say Sol abscissa as three alternative possibilities just chosen sort
of at random when the Christian looks at those the
Christian isn't objectively honestly neutrally giant with genuine desire to
understand or a genuine desire to explore those other perspectives
going and actually looking at the world through those perspectives
the Christian mostly what they do is they see Islam
or atheism or salep system through their own lens which
is not the same thing as actually looking at the
world through an atheist lens or Islamic lens or solipsistic
lens and of course the eighth I mean the the
Christians world view or perspective contains defense mechanisms and justifications
and rationales for why doing so would be a bad
idea why it would be dangerous why it would be
evil why would be a waste of time why it
would be immoral and so on but the trick that
needs to be noticed here is that this is a
trick of the mind because of course one's perspective is
going to have rationales for that for why that one
perspective that you happen to hold is the best one
I mean when you really think about it with even
a little bit of self reflection it becomes so obvious
how self biased and partial one's perspectives are perspectives tend
to be selfish and then tend to just elevate themselves
above everything else I mean it it's so convincing the
convenience of its strike you doesn't it strike you as
a little bit too vini n't that when a person
holds any perspective that perspective tells tends to tell them
that that is the best perspective they could possibly hold
I mean it's just the game that the mind is
playing is a certain sense it's so obvious that it
stuns you how come you didn't notice it sooner and
yet most people don't so for example if I'm a
fundamentalist Christian I believe I have the right worldview the
best one how convenient and if I'm an atheist I
believe I have the right worldview the best one again
how convenient and if I'm an academic I believe that
my academic research and my academic worldview is the best
one how convenient this Moline because even with great intellectuals
people with high IQs people who are well-educated academics and
scholars and Nobel Prize winners it's quite stunning how easily
they fall into this trap of getting locked into their
one perspective for example one of the things that immediately
puzzled and shocked me when I started to do academic
philosophy you know when I was about 16 years old
18 years old I got into philosophy just on my
own started reading philosophy books started reading about different schools
of philosophy but immediately it occurred to me that what
is the history of philosophy but different philosophers arguing for
their own perspective and I thought how narrow-minded is that
every single philosopher over the last two thousand years since
like Plato and Aristotle has been writing these massive tomes
these books and treatises and dialogues and so forth arguing
for their perspective of the world but isn't it obvious
that all of them have a partial and limited perspective
on the world and that none of them are ultimately
true in any absolute sense that all of them are
just picking up aspects of reality and talking about them
but none of them truly encompass all of reality isn't
that obvious and yet as obvious as that is I
mean this isn't rocket science it's so obvious it's common
sense that that's the case but but at the same
time these people devote their entire careers and lives to
defending their positions how can that be how can these
these are supposedly these philosophers you know the philosophers from
Western civilization from the Western intellectual tradition look if we
just focus on those these were probably some of the
most intelligent wisest smartest humans of Western civilization and yet
they've fell into this very simple basic fundamental trap of
the mind so as soon as I saw that it
made me immediately question like well how am I gonna
do philosophy am I gonna just like devote my life
to doing philosophy and fall into the exact same trap
as all these people what's the point I thought the
point was to understand reality not just just play favorites
with different perspectives and then try to convince and persuade
others of my perspective I don't want to play that
game I'm interested in something deeper something truer if something
true or a deeper exists I didn't know at the
time whether it did or didn't see once you start
to see this game is sort of it ruins the
illusion for you it's a very powerful meta perspective so
your mind is engaged in an active process of creating
a perspective a reality the reason that a perspective is
so difficult for people to distinguish from reality is that
it is reality it's your reality and a very useful
way to think of it is that all of us
are not living in the same reality we're living in
different realities depending on how different our perspectives are from
each other and some people have radically different perspectives than
ourselves imagine the perspective of a of a dictator like
Saddam Hussein or Hitler or Stalin imagine the perspective of
a woman if you're a man or a man if
you're a woman imagine the perspective of an animal how
do you think your dog experiences reality can you see
how radically different it would be than your experience of
reality what would even be that intersection it's not so
obvious imagine the perspective of fundamentalist Christian today versus the
perspective of a Christian 2,000 years ago these were totally
different perspectives even though they're both called Christian imagine the
perspective of some natives living in a tribe of a
hundred somewhere in the Amazon rainforest these people have barely
even seen modern society or technology they don't have computers
or microwave ovens or refrigerators and then you're walking through
the forest through the jungle in the Amazon and then
for the first time in your life you see a
helicopter or a jet airplane flying over the canopy imagine
the perspective of a slave someone who grew up in
slavery and doesn't even know what it's like to live
what we would call a normal free life as a
child he was just a slave his parents were slaves
and their parents were slaves there's not even a possibility
in this child's mind of anything other than slavery imagine
the perspective of a prostitute so this is just a
little sampling you see notice I want you to notice
whether you're resistant to exploring as different perspectives notice that
in a certain sense is kind of uneasy maybe uncomfortable
maybe some of these perspectives seem ugly to you you
don't want to explore them maybe some of them seem
wrong or evil imagine the perspective of a serial killer
or a cannibal now again when I asked you to
imagine these different perspectives I'm not saying to judge these
perspectives from your existing perspective I'm saying to actually embody
that perspective to look through that lens which means you
have to relinquish your existing perspective you have to step
outside of yourself that's difficult for the mind to do
of course because you are your mind hmm you don't
just have a mind you are your mind so when
I ask you to change perspectives the more radical the
shift in perspective the harder it'll be for your mind
to do the more open-mindedness will be required and the
more threatening it will be because you will feel a
greater sense of loss of your own identity so one
of the reasons that people who share similar perspectives get
along better together as a community as a society as
a as a nation or as a tribe is because
their perspectives although different every individual has a different perspective
but some of us have less difference than others and
so for example it's a lot easier to build a
nation based on a single common perspective such as Christianity
or Islam because that serves as a sort of a
unifying binding thing that we can all agree on it
is a sort of a consensus that we've come to
we all sort of see the world in a in
a certain coherent way collectively because we share some fundamental
parts of our perspective and then it's easier to get
along it's easier to understand how the other person thinks
there's less disagreement our values are more similar so we
can we can make decisions and we come to agreements
that that most of us would be comfortable with and
now try to imagine what it would be like to
build a tribe or a city or a nation where
you had fundamentalist Christians and fundamentalist Muslims in equal proportions
I mean it would be a constant tug-of-war now I'm
not using this to justify creating some sort of ethno
state I'm just pointing out some of the real challenges
of how perspectives work likewise it would be difficult to
get for example a spiral atomic stage green hippy in
the same room with a serial killer and to have
them to sit and just have a conversation with each
other it would be difficult to do that it's a
lot easier to just get a roomful of hippies together
and then they can all sit around and they can
play guitar and smoke some weed and do some you
know chanting and some other stuff like that that they
all agree on and they're all happy with but you
know once you introduce a few serial killers into that
into that group and some dictators and some of the
what's gonna happen you don't know what's gonna happen it
creates a volatile mix people start pulling in different directions
and notice that people kill each other over difference of
perspective so this is not merely some abstract philosophical consideration
works like oh yeah Leo's talking about perspectives and he
just wants us to be more open-minded and just to
like explore other perspectives know people kill each other over
difference of perspective people get divorced over difference of perspective
people enslave each other over difference of perspective people conquer
each other people exterminate each other have you wondered why
something as abstract as a perspective after all what is
a perspective anyway such a seems like such a nebulous
abstract philosophical sort of thing why would we kill human
beings over difference of perspective why what is the function
of perspective in one's reality in one's life what is
the perspective doing why is it even there to begin
with these are all questions for you to ponder I'm
not necessarily going to answer them all for you I
want to sort of guide you towards thinking about this
a little bit more deeply because I think people really
take perspective for granted perspective is such a fundamental thing
and yet none of us are really taught how to
think about perspective none of us are Todd had a
question perspectives how to explore new perspectives how to open
our minds to perspectives this is one of the most
important functions of Education and yet most of our education
system is just brute force memorization of various facts and
perspectives most education is about teaching you a perspective rather
than teaching you about how perspective works which means that
most education is just indoctrination into a particular perspective you
see as it turns out a perspective is not just
some arbitrary random thing your perspective is how you survive
within reality it's how you keep yourself alive your perspective
is a bit like the operating system that runs the
entire heart it's the it's the software it's the fundamental
most fundamental layer of the software that is running the
hardware so to speak of your body it's like the
bios of an operating system it's it's so deep and
it's so fundamental that usually we don't notice it we
don't think about it we don't change it very much
because it's dangerous to change it has wide repercussions in
terms of your behavior your actions your feelings usually what
we're changing when we're changing ourselves at all is we're
changing the apps on the computer we're not going in
and mucking around in the BIOS but the problem with
that is that if you want serious change significant change
it's not going to be enough just to change the
apps on your computer or on your phone if you
really want to change the behavior of a machine or
your phone or your computer or whatever it is you're
gonna have to go to the to the BIOS level
and change that that will that will really allow you
new capabilities open up new capabilities of that hardware but
there's a trade-off is that it's more difficult to do
that kind of work it's more threatening there's more potential
for mistakes you know you make a error or bug
in the BIOS it because it's it's closer to the
core in a mistake there affects everything it will screw
up all the apps but also you see part of
the problem is that the BIOS we got or the
BIOS we have today whatever yours is you got where
where did you get it from you got it from
your culture and your society and your parents and your
education system basically that's where you got it from but
what is all that well that's all content that's just
an arbitrary contingent function of where you were born what
time you were born in what country you were born
in what parents you were born to and so on
and the conditions that were occurring in that environment and
so your BIOS had to fit and to match whatever
environment you were born into otherwise you would have died
see so for example if you were born into a
fundamentalist Christian family and yet you didn't subscribe to that
fundamentalist Christian BIOS it's not just it's not just a
collection of beliefs you see Christianity not just a collection
of beliefs it's much deeper than that it's an entire
operating system a set of assumptions fundamental assumptions metaphysical ones
epistemic ones moral ones about reality in the universe and
your role in it about people about animals about all
sorts of stuff which informs how you're going to interact
with all that stuff so that that BIOS was sort
of downloaded into you from your parents and so on
because it's functional the reason that they could give it
to you is because they have lived in that environment
and then they they recreated that environment that you were
born into right like they were also part of some
Christian community so when you're part of a Christian community
a Christian BIOS works harmoniously with that community and therefore
if you adopt it then you can live a rather
pleasant peaceful life people will accept you they will approve
of you they will love you they we'll give you
accolades they will give you a job good luck getting
a job in an all Christian fundamentalist community when you're
an avowed atheist or Muslim probably not gonna work so
well good luck getting all of your basic needs met
when you have the the Islamic BIOS in a fundamentalist
Christian community good luck getting the approval that every human
craves the love that you crave the sex that you
crave the kind of romantic relationships that you crave the
marriage that you want the children that you want to
raise with your partner the the sense of community that
you want to have and feel like you're a part
of the kind of job and career that you want
to have and so on see so in a sense
you were forced into adopting the bios of whatever community
you were born into because as a child all you
really want is just approval in love that's that's all
you really want from your parents and your your friends
during your first let's say 10 to 20 years of
development that's mostly what you want you want to fit
in you want to be loved you want to be
taken care of and if those things are denied to
you things go terribly wrong in one's BIOS and you
see the child would it's getting programmed with this BIOS
is an early age the child has no prior experience
a child is like a blank slate the child doesn't
understand that there even is a BIOS that he's being
programmed with anything the child doesn't understand that this is
happening this is only something you could recognize maybe 30
years afterwards and even then you know if you're listening
to me maybe you can recognize it but but like
you're not gonna most people are not gonna recognize this
unless you're doing serious philosophy serious self-reflection so anyways you're
getting programmed with this BIOS and you have no ability
to evaluate the quality of this BIOS it's pros and
cons its limitations its strengths and weaknesses you don't consider
any of that to you it's just reality it's your
environment you don't know any other environment but the one
you grew up in you don't know any other culture
you don't know any other religion you don't know any
other metaphysical or epistemic system or framework or paradigm and
so understandably after 1020 years of growing up like that
it's cemented in your mind and then that that sets
how you will see the world and how you were
interact with humans and others in your community for the
rest of your life now of course it's possible to
undo that and to change that but that's gonna require
special labor on your part to do that and what
happens when you get programmed with a bios which is
out of date or out of tune with the rapidly
changing culture and community or if you move and change
communities or if the BIOS is just inherently toxic and
dysfunctional to begin with what if you're raised in some
sort of toxic abusive family what if you're raised in
some kind of Mormon cult polygamous cult what if you're
raised in some sort of secular atheistic business-minded family sort
of like the the stories here now that we that
are coming out about Donald Trump how Donald Trump was
raised his father Fred Trump how he raised his kids
you know Fred Trump was this was the sort of
business tycoon type I imagine he wasn't too religious I
imagine he was atheistic I would imagine he was very
he sort of materialistic in terms of seeking just the
material pleasures of life sex money and power and so
on and so this was this was program to the
bios of all the Trump family children see try to
see that when your mind knows nothing else but the
BIOS that is running it it is using that by
that BIOS to evaluate and judge everything it sees it's
the lens through which everything is seen and it's precisely
because of that that the mind is incapable of objectively
impartial e evaluating its own flaws of the BIOS you
see it's sort of like if there was an error
in a computer system at the most fundamental level of
the code then that computer system would not be able
to recognize its own errors because the very mechanism of
err recognition would itself be erroneous and that turns out
to be the sort of hinge point upon which most
of mankind's problems hinge is that when we're really really
bad at neutrally and impartially evaluating the inadequacies of our
own worldviews and in fact instead what we try to
do is we try to deny it we create all
sorts of defense mechanisms and coping mechanisms to deny that
this is even a problem we create excuses and rationales
justifications we project outward any deficiencies in our own perspective
and worldview we project that out onto others in the
world because when you're looking at the world through rose-colored
glasses the whole world looks rose and would you look
at your own glasses if you try to reflect on
the glasses while you're wearing the glasses the glasses themselves
will look rosy so when a Christian a fundamentalist Christian
evaluates his own worldview to him it seems fine what
problem there's no problems or when a muhabba Strada chol
islamist looks at his own worldview to him it's there's
no problem but from our perspective we've had a look
at that we say but isn't it obvious to him
that there's something deeply wrong within his worldview where his
worldview is advocating and harming civilians and death to infidels
and this sort of stuff isn't it obvious to him
that that's not that that is dysfunctional but there's something
that there's something very bod deeply biased about that but
see that's because you're looking at it from your worldview
you have to be able to drop your worldview and
look at it from his perspective from his perspective he
can't see it but what that means is that from
your perspective you can't see your own deficiencies and errors
of your BIOS so in practice most people have a
very deficient outdated bios and is precisely because it's so
deficient and outdated that they get defensive about it and
they refuse to change it under any circumstances and then
they wonder why they're unhappy in life why they suffer
why life is [ __ ] why humans don't get
along with each other around them they wonder while this
is going on and why their life is so dysfunctional
and then when they try to change it by reading
a book and they change a few apps on their
on their computer they wonder like well okay I changed
a few things but fundamentally there's still problems that's right
because those problems are rooted in the BIOS but the
BIOS is the one thing you don't want to change
because actually the BIOS is what constitutes your entire identity
so most people would rather survive as dysfunctional Devils than
to admit that they are dysfunctional Devils and then to
do the work of actually correcting their BIOS to change
that they would rather be right than to actually improve
their life to significantly improve your life you need to
go to the BIOS level and change that which is
not what most self-help teaches you how to do which
is why most self-help it's effective to a degree but
not to a deep degree because it doesn't really address
these epistemic and metaphysical deficiencies in in your bios which
percolate and manifest throughout all of your actions behaviors thoughts
beliefs and attitude towards the whole world see people don't
appreciate how deep this perspective stuff goes you might be
sitting there listening to this you might say yeah Leo
I generally agree with you I think it's important to
look at the world through different perspectives and so on
but still you see that's still a trick of the
mind because what's happening there is that what happens is
that you have your main perspective but because your mind
is so attached to that perspective when you start to
evaluate this perspective your mind constructs a new perspective within
the existing perspective such that now we have nested perspectives
like this imagine them like a perspective I kind of
think of as a cone so you have a cone
within a cone and then what happens is that you
start to evaluate on the cone within the cone that
your mind is constructed so your mind has constructed a
sort of a virtual perspective of your actual perspective and
then what you're engaged in is you're engaged in questioning
the virtual perspective but not the actual meta perspective the
actual original perspective which is still running the whole show
such that what happens is that you you end up
questioning the virtual perspective then you think okay yeah I
did I question my perspective and I don't see any
problems in it or I've solved some of the problems
of it and now I now we're good right but
no you haven't really the trick of the mind is
that you only questioned the the fake perspective your perspective
of your own perspective not the actual perspective itself because
the actual perspective itself if you if you go all
the way you know towards the very back of the
cone if we're looking at as a cone like this
all the way to the very back of the cone
what are you gonna find at that point where the
cone lines converge all at that point what are you
gonna find there you're gonna find nothing nothing at all
you're gonna find the true self you're gonna find what
you really are without a perspective and that's what you're
most afraid of is finding that because to find that
is going to obliterate the whole perspective it's going to
reveal the perspective to be completely ah construction an arbitrary
relative construction that was designed for the survival of its
own self in other words what you're going to discover
is that your entire life has been selfish partial and
biased everything you believed everything you thought that was true
everything you did all the ways in which you behaved
even such things that you would normally think of as
just brute objective facts like the fact of your birth
or the fact that you were given birth to by
parents a mother and a father the fact of a
universe that you were birthed into the fact that you're
going to die the fact that there are other humans
in the world that you interact with your belief in
a God or not a God whichever one you believe
in whether there is one or isn't one all of
these you'll find that even those largest constructions and even
the idea that you are your body you will find
that to be a construction and then even the idea
that there is a reality at all you'll find that
to be a construction and eventually you'll discover that you
needed all these constructions to be any particular way at
all because if you didn't construct these things if you
didn't have a perspective you would be nothing and there
would be nothing to talk about nothing to experience and
nothing to survive and no reason to pursue anything there
would be no meaning to life because meaning is only
relative to the things that you want to pursue which
are only relative to the things that you are interested
in survive it your body in your life and so
on so in a sense this this self-reflection process of
going all the way back to the to the origin
point of this cone of perspective is really sort of
the reverse process of your birth and the reverse process
of your of your education and your upbringing your birth
education upbringing was this accretion process more like a snowball
rolling down a hill you you rolled and rolled and
rolled and you accreted more and more material to grow
bigger and bigger and bigger and to gain more substance
and so as you were growing in your teenage years
and then into your early 20s and 30s and so
on you have created more and more material more and
more perspective and then once you accrete that material you
need to defend that accretion so that it doesn't break
apart because otherwise you feel like you're dying you're losing
yourself so you spent the first half of your life
accreting yourself and then if you want you can spend
the other half of your life now reversing that process
and surrendering yourself and going backwards and discovering why you
accreted yourself in the first place pretty cool see the
thing we call life and reality's much more amazing than
materialist with have you believed you're not just a thing
that was born you're a thing that created itself why
did you create yourself in the exact ways that you
did and not in some other ways you see but
for this whole process to work you have to be
willing to actually want to understand in a truthful way
what's really going on with you it can't be some
personal thing you can't just be defending some ideology or
some worldview because it suits you that's what most people
are doing here you have to to do this self-reflection
process to really understand what's going on you have to
be willing to surrender your own self and your perspective
and then you wonder well what's in it for me
leo what's in it for me if I do this
but you see that's already the wrong question because if
you're asking what's in it for you that's already you're
basically asking how can I just double down on my
own existing perspective but if you're just doubling down on
your existing perspective you're just gonna get more the same
you're not gonna get something different and you're never going
to understand reality that way so the reason that I
personally got really serious about exploring different perspectives is because
I wanted to understand reality not through my own personal
lens but how it ultimately is and for that I
need to be able to step outside my perspective and
explore other perspectives and ultimately it turns out that reality
is nothing but a collection of infinite perspectives every possible
perspective that could be taken by consciousness is what reality
is it's every possible way that reality could be seen
that is what reality is that's what you discover and
you discover that to really understand a reality you need
to look at it from every possible angle every possible
perspective sort of like if we had an elephant standing
here and we wanted to understand this elephant what most
people do is they just take one snapshot of the
elephant from one particular angle relative to where they're standing
so one person will take the snapshot from the front
one from the back one from the side one from
underneath from one from up top one from two feet
away one from 100 feet away one from a mile
away and they all get different views of the elephant
but if you're the type of person who wants to
understand what an elephant really is can you ever be
satisfied with a single angle no you need to see
every possible angle now you might wonder but-but-but what is
the elephant really this is sort of the question that
the LA Spurs asked there's our perception of the elephant
okay we've got that it's got colors and this and
that but but leo different people see the elephant in
different ways you know maybe a colorblind person looks at
the elephant one way or like if we're using different
cameras you know every cameras gonna capture that elephant differently
so it's not just a matter of angle it's also
a matter of what camera you use what lens you
use what settings in the camera you use to see
see we start to get a multiplication of possibilities here
so it's not even just as simple as every possible
angle and notice to get this elephant just even using
a single camera a single lens all the exact same
settings and even using a single distance from the elephant
can you see that there's an infinite number of angles
to an elephant infinite angles but now it gets more
complex the infinity increases because it's not just different angles
it's different distances from the elephant it's different cameras different
lenses different settings we can look at the elephant in
different electromagnetic spectrum we can see what the elephant looks
like to the human eyes or to a camera design
for human eyes or we can look at it through
night vision or through x-ray or through infrared or through
ultraviolet and whatever else there exists we can look at
it even through sonar we can use a sonar to
hit that elephant ping the elephant like a submarine sort
of thing with a radar and get some sort of
signature back and that will be one aspect of the
elephant you see so what's happening is that we're paying
this elephant using different settings so to speak we're gonna
just say settings includes all the possible variations cameras angles
whatever and we're getting some data back in a certain
sense from that elephant we can even ask like artists
you know that'll be an interesting example taking uh take
an elephant take a hundred different artists put them at
a hundred different angles and have them draw that elephant
and you're gonna get like very very different depictions you
know some of the art will be very realistic some
of the art will be very impressionistic like that sort
of Monet fuzzy painting some will be very abstract or
you know maybe some artists will just draw a square
like a blue square on a on a white background
that will be his his notion of you know that's
the essence the spirit of the elephant is that that
blue square somebody else will will do like a Picasso
sort of fragmented cubist you know painting of the elephant
so people will exaggerate and distort in all different ways
and you might say well which one is true well
it's the one that's most realistic right it's the one
that actually looks closest to an elephant no it's completely
relative all of the perspectives are valid given that you
understand where the perspective is coming from you see so
in a certain sense that highly abstract painting of an
elephant that just captures its pure essence like a a
square painted blue or a square painted gray you might
say well this this is a child could draw that
that's not real art it doesn't really capture the elephant
but it could capture the essence of an elephant better
than a realistic depiction of the elephant but in order
to appreciate that you have to really fully go into
the mind of the person who drew that thing you
see it's very easy to just dismiss it and say
well that that's not really an elephant that's some [
__ ] it has nothing to do with an elephant
so you got it you got to think beyond that
this is where helps to be able to step outside
your perspective because if your whole perspective of art is
that it has to be as real as possible that
you have to recognize that that's one perspective of art
it doesn't have to be that way nowhere in the
universe does it does God say that elephants must be
depicted as they are in the most photorealistic way in
a certain sense there's there's more artistry and there's something
more interesting and more profound and deep when you capture
an elephant in an abstract way if you can actually
capture it that way it's not easy it's not just
as simple as drawing a square and painting a certain
color to really capture its essence you'd have to go
beyond that you have to you'd have to kind of
like see into its soul or see into its essence
into its spirit whatever that means so so you might
wonder if we accumulate all of this all of these
different perspectives you know we have photorealistic ones we have
x-rays we have microwave pictures we have sonars and radars
and we have different painters painting the elephant in different
ways how is the elephant really well of course the
elephant is infinity the elephant is nothing the elephant is
everything the elephant is the infinity of infinity of ways
in which it can be seen understood and depicted so
normally we think of an elephant as like this creature
with big ears and tusks and it's gray colored and
it's got a tail and it's big and it's got
feet and this is how we don't really think of
an elephant no that's an elephant relative to your BIOS
to your human nervous system to your eyes ears all
of that so if we see you actually believe that's
how an element that's like what an elephant is you
believe that's what an elephant is is the way that
you see it and I mean it is that that's
a valid way to see an elephant there's nothing wrong
with that but if you really wonder stand where an
elephant is you're gonna have to explore every possible perspective
of that elephant and then when you unify them all
together then you understand what an elephant really is and
it's infinity it's just infinity as is every other object
as is the entire universe as are you see even
just to see that elephant to begin with what you
had to do is you had to separate yourself from
the elephant such that there's an elephant here there's you
as a human over here using your nervous system to
look at this elephant over here and then you know
light is bouncing forth and all this sort of stuff
you had to sort of you have to create all
these dualities all these distinctions you have to separate yourself
from the elephant so you could look at the elephant
in that particular way that you're looking at it from
and see from that limited perspective and then you get
a material elephant because if you didn't do that there
wouldn't be any material elephant there to begin with there
wouldn't even be a you to begin with so see
if you want the full richness of reality it's imperative
that you start to appreciate all the different perspectives that
can be taken on every object and every subject and
to be neutral about it so that you don't get
biased or locked into any one favorite one because they
see if you say that well the best depiction of
an elephant is a photorealistic one or the most truest
version of an elephant is the one taken with this
nikon camera with this particular lens and this particular distance
at this particular angle if you get if you get
stuck on that then see your your look at how
much of a reality you're missing out on you're missing
out on the the true beauty and awesomeness of what
reality is which it wishes it's diversity of perspective necessitated
you're literally missing out on infinity by choosing to look
at reality from one particular partial angle and how sad
is that you're crippling yourself and then you're wondering why
you're not satisfied in the world and why you suffer
and why things seem bleak and bad and why you're
upset at people well it's because you're stuck you've artificially
limited yourself without realizing what you've done and then also
you're incapable of getting along with others because you're so
stuck on your one limited angle of a perspective that
you're not willing to budge and to consider the perspectives
of others in fact you actively hate all other perspectives
other than your own you fight them you debate them
you reason against them you waste a lot of mental
energy doing that all of that just to defend your
little narrow view of the world and then of course
you can't get along with others because when you think
your perspective is the only true right one and others
have different perspective which of course they must have because
they're different than you they have a different body different
mind different upbringing different environment different parents different genetics different
personality type different neurology different chemicals and neurotransmitters going through
their brain and all of that you start to fight
with them which leads to violence which leads to racism
which leads to genocide which leads to war which leads
slavery and oppression and all these things and all of
that because you're just committed to your one little narrow
perspective and so is everybody else and then you're surprised
why we don't get along why there's riots in the
streets why people hate each other life you'll hurt each
other this is it what if you made a commitment
to be neutral to all the different perspectives to stop
judging them to start appreciating them and start loving them
as though they were your own what if you approached
life in this way where you knew that in this
life right now you're gonna live through it as a
man or a woman as white or black as Asian
as Christian or Muslim or Buddhist or whatever you are
conservative liberal capitalist socialist you're gonna live through it with
that perspective and then when you die you're gonna live
through it you're gonna be born again and then live
through it through some other perspective of course no maybe
a different time this was that you were you know
first you were alive during the 21st century then you'll
die then you'll experience it from the 22nd century then
you'll experience the earth from the 23rd century then you'll
experience some other planet from some other century and then
it'll just keep iterating and iterating and iterating the universe
will keep iterating through every possible perspective until it understands
itself from every possible angle from every possible location and
all the locations and all the angles are infinite so
this process continues endlessly forever and that that is what
the universe is it's a never-ending process of self reflection
of self understanding and as this self-reflection deepens and understanding
increases the universe recognizes itself as being infinitely perspectival and
as it does so it surrenders its attachment to individual
perspectives and forms until eventually it reaches a sort of
a critical mass of understanding where finally it falls in
love with itself by falling in love with all of
its diversity of perspectives by surrendering its own selfish attachment
to one specific perspective and the way that it does
that is by living through that perspective and understanding it
fully not just understanding it in theory but actually living
through it like I said earlier to really understand in
perspective it's not enough to look at it from some
other perspective you actually have to incarnate and live through
it so to really understand what it's like to be
a fundamentalist Christian it's not enough while being an atheist
to maybe attend a church meeting even that is more
than most atheists will ever do in their life see
most atheists are so disgusted by fundamentalist Christians they think
they're such idiots that they wouldn't even attend a fundamentalist
church for a Bible meeting because they think it would
be stupid and a waste of their time but even
if they did attend that meeting they still really wouldn't
understand what it's like to be a funnel most fundamentalist
Christian to really understand they would have to die and
reincarnate as a fundamentalist Christian and live through that they'd
have to completely surrender their atheism to really understand that
and then of course the same goes for a Christian
a fundamentalist Christian would never dare to go to a
Middle Eastern mosque and pray actually seriously pray five times
a day or whatever they do in some middle-eastern mosque
uh-huh cuz he would think that that's that's pointless it's
stupid it's wrong it doesn't it doesn't tell me anything
about the world it's just delusion its falsehood it's gonna
it's gonna detract from my Christianity it's gonna somehow endanger
my Christian identity or whatever or maybe it'll even be
a a betrayal of God to do such a thing
that's fundamentally what a Christian would would believe a fundamental
squish I mean there's different kinds of Christians and there's
different kinds of Muslims or some are more open-minded others
but I'm sort of talking about the father blue ones
so but yeah so for that Christian to really understand
what it means to be a Muslim he would have
to die and reincarnate as a Muslim fundamentalist Muslim and
experience that for a good 80 years not just for
one year for a full 80 years to get the
full sense of it and so now you see where
this is going so every consciousness will use different consciousness
here if what you are fundamentally as a consciousness every
consciousness in order to fully understand what consciousness is would
have to incarnate and live through every possible way that
consciousness could live every experience that conscience possibly have this
of course includes not just human experiences and not just
experiences in the 21st century but all centuries all timelines
all planets all living creatures and being including ants and
insects and birds and trees and plants and and even
inanimate objects like rocks chairs cars and if there are
other universes through all the possible universes through all the
possible multiverses all of it so if consciousness experiences and
lives through every single permutation of of that of every
perspective eventually it'll come to a point of complete self
understanding which would be absolute infinity it would complete a
full full cycle a full cycle of self realization in
so doing the cycle begins sort of Atlit if we
say the cycle begins at complete ignorance or completely limited
perspective as more perspectives are experienced by consciousness it opens
it up more and more and more to appreciating and
wanting to explore more and more perspectives this is actually
a movement from fear into love so we're gonna start
at a point of utter selfishness and fear and limitation
of perspective and then as we open up we realize
that oh actually exploring different perspectives this is actually a
good thing it's not a bad thing so we surrender
more of our of our fears and more of our
selfishness and more of our attachment to a particular limited
way of being and we become a little bit more
unlimited a little bit less limited a little bit less
limited a little less limit and as we do that
we we cycle through more and more perspectives as we
do that we start to fall in love with the
diversity of what we are is consciousness which is the
diversity of all these perspectives we start to fall in
love with more and more and more and more of
them until eventually we reach a point of absolute love
a point of complete impartiality and neutrality because we recognize
that all these perspectives are totally relative they're completely equal
we integrate every single one of them until they all
perfectly cancel out leaving us with a pure infinite consciousness
and that's what God is that's what you are in
your highest form God is all perspectives at once without
any bias towards any particular one because there is no
reason to be biased towards any particular one when you
realize that your true essence is nothing so you have
no attachment to anything you need nothing to be defended
you have no limit that you're trying to defend and
therefore you're you're fully satisfied with the with being every
possible perspective simultaneously because in so doing your abundance increases
to infinity your diversity increases to infinity and you realize
your entire full scope as the whole universe as consciousness
and you integrate all that into yourself and you realize
that that integration is what love is it's what you
are it's what the universe is pretty cool huh so
what's stopping you from doing this fear selfishness attachment close-mindedness
disbelief that such a thing as possible or that it
exists see that's the cosmic mechanism that's the cosmic game
so you can either engage in this process consciously and
willingly deliberately or unconsciously unwillingly with resistance you can either
love the process or you can hate the process you
can fear the process you can be grateful about the
processor you can be resentful about the process either way
the process will happen because the truth is that consciousness
is infinite and it's everything if it wasn't you couldn't
be here with your particular perspective the only way there
can be one perspective if there are is if there
are all perspectives see most people aren't engaging in this
process consciously deliberately willingly with joy and gratitude most of
them are resisting coming up with excuses and various kinds
of coping and defense mechanisms to avoid the process which
slows the whole process down and makes it needlessly complicated
and painful so it's up to you how much resistance
you put up to this process the more resistance you
put up to it the more suffering there will be
the less resistance the better your life will go so
this is what I mean when I say that reality
is a love simulator you've heard me say this before
in my episodes about love the nature of love and
what is love the universe is trying to teach you
to love but you're resisting it because the love is
so great that will it will annihilate you in the
process but since the universe is love that's what it
is it can't be anything else because infinity is love
it has no other alternative you might wonder why would
the universe be this way it seems like an awfully
specific and complex almost human-like affair you might said like
well Liam I understand how maybe a human would want
to teach me love but why would the universe want
to teach me love well what else would consciousness be
in the business of doing why would consciousness do anything
else but teach itself love is there something better it
can do see the universe is in the business of
doing everything and by universe I don't mean the scientific
material universe I mean universe with a capital u a
universe which includes every possible multiverse and all that stuff
the totality of everything you see the universe is in
the business of being everything it's perfectly symmetrical it's a
absolute supersymmetry that's the only way it can exist in
the first place in order to have a symmetries you
need an overarching unifying absolute supersymmetry where all the a
symmetries cancel out that's where the a symmetries come from
that's the source one perspective you need to have an
infinity of perspectives then that can generate one particular one
so if you want to hasten this process make it
easier on yourself what I recommend for you is that
you use love to help you to explore other perspectives
what if from this point on you made a commitment
to actually appreciate every perspective that you encounter in life
instead of what you currently do which is you judge
it and criticize it and try to debunk it and
try to manipulate it and try to attack it or
try to defend it or you try to do something
with it in order to serve yourself or to enhance
your survival what if you dropped that and you mustered
the courage to actually appreciate every possible angle on reality
and then you became an explorer of these different perspectives
such that even your entire life this current life that
you're living in would be recontextualized as not just this
one little personal life that you get to live and
then you die and in the meantime you're just trying
to accumulate as much wealth and success and sex and
happiness as you possibly can and pleasure rather than looking
out like that and then being all depressed when you're
on your deathbed because all your life is coming to
an end bla bla bla bla bla how sad it
is what if you like really opened yourself up to
the the ultimate adventure an infinite adventure in consciousness where
you know you're going to you're going to go through
every iteration every incarnation and experience all of reality from
every possible angle as part of the universe's journey to
understand and love itself what if you put your personal
little life here in the 21st century on this planet
into that larger context what if excited about exploring other
perspectives traveling to different countries talking to different people eating
different foods interacting with different races listening to different political
commentary and appreciating understanding the validity of every political commentary
that has ever been made including fascist ones Nazi ones
and racist ones and misogynistic ones and feminist ones and
LGBTQ ones and conservative ones liberal ones capitalist ones socialist
ones and you saw the pros and cons and the
limitations of each recognizing that each one is like that
painting of an elephant which presents some aspect of the
elephant but never the complete thing always an infinitely small
aspect of the final thing and that you kept your
eye on the real prize which is the infinity of
the elephant not one particular rendition of it but in
order to appreciate that the infinity of the elephant you're
excited about looking at the elephant from every possible angle
in every possible depiction and rendition through every possible lens
and that you can appreciate it now that doesn't mean
you draw false equivalence in the sense that now you
hold that liberals and conservatives are equally bad or that
you hold that Nazis are the same as socialists and
so forth now you can you can still make practical
distinctions you can still see that certain perspectives are more
dysfunctional relatively speaking than other perspectives when we consider for
example the well-being of humans in 21st century on this
planet certain perspectives are are better in a relative sense
in the sense that someone who's a climate change denier
you can you can enter that person's mind and see
the world through his eyes understand the appeal of that
perspective and why it's there but ultimately you recognize that
it's a it's a fear-based closed-minded perspective which is based
on denial and various others sorts of things usually biased
by various survival interests whether they're financial ones or cultural
ones and so forth and so you can see that
and you can see that you know because we want
to maintain decent living on this planet that we should
we should probably do something about global warming and climate
change but still like you can really dive into that
climate change denial perspective and really experience it see that
that will actually enrich your life that will help you
to understand other people it will make you a more
loving human being how can you be a loving and
conscious human being when you think that climate change deniers
are idiots or that they're evil see you can't every
time that you're judging some other humans perspective in the
world you're fundamentally misunderstanding them and you're you're you're actually
doing yourself a disservice because you're getting stuck in your
own perspective and you're losing the infinite abundance that could
be there for you and then that becomes like a
thorn in your side too cuz then you got to
be worried about the Nazis and you got to be
worried about the racists and you got to be worried
about the white supremacist and you got to be worried
about the flat earthers and the climate change deniers and
this to see all these become thorns in your side
too which irritate you whereas you could become so expansive
and so conscious and so deep in your understanding of
reality that you can you can incorporate all of that
into your larger sense of self that doesn't mean that
you're gonna act those things out doesn't mean you're gonna
become a racist it doesn't mean you're gonna you know
go vote for a Nazi I'm not saying you do
that but you can incorporate all those things you have
a deep understanding and a deep wisdom and a deep
love for that for all the dysfunction of mankind for
all the selfishness and evil of mankind you you have
a deep love in that and how do you think
you would feel if you were able to achieve that
do you think that would make you a weaker person
or a more powerful person if you were able to
just like sit on the couch and fall in love
with all of mankind rather than what you do now
which is bicker and debate and judge and criticize and
demonize and even do violence to you probably have fantasies
of doing violence to people you disagree with even if
you never actually do the violence but you're you're committing
the violence in your own mind you want to spit
in their face or punch them or kick them or
even shoot them or you wish some sort of harm
upon them but as you're doing that see what you're
not conscious of is that you're you're judging ultimately and
demonizing your own self because all these other perspectives are
really you don't know this yet but they're all aspects
of of you they're all aspects of infinite consciousness so
really when you're judging and demonizing and criticizing you're you're
judging and criticizing and demonizing your own self you're wishing
violence upon your own sound and you better believe it
that's gonna that's gonna come back to bite you as
the buddha supposedly said there's a lot of fake Buddha
quotes out there but one of them that I remember
that I like it's probably fake but it's good anyways
goes something like you're not punished for your anger the
anger is your punishment see you're either gonna be a
bitter person or gonna be a loving person there's really
two options in life your bitterness is gonna be directly
proportional to how how little you understand and appreciate the
perspectives of others how much you're stuck in your own
perspective and your love is gonna be directly proportional to
your level of understanding and appreciation of the abundance that
the universe inherently is as long as you're willing to
open yourself up to that the difficulty is that as
you open yourself up to that the love becomes so
strong that you're able you're literally unable to hold it
it's too much love see most humans only no partial
love but what if ever you walked out side your
front door and you looked at the trees and the
plants and the cars and the earth and all the
humans walking around you saw that and you took all
that in as as your own self and you you
were in love with it constantly and this love just
was like an echo chamber that kept perpetuating itself and
strengthening itself like a rule like a snowball rolling down
an infinite slope growing ever larger and larger and larger
and larger see that's the ultimate possibility for your life
so when we're talking about creating the good life what
do we really mean ultimately it's not about accumulating material
stuff per se it's not even about changing your personality
to be better and so forth really what we're talking
about as we're talking about getting your mind on this
infinite slope of love where this snowball we we start
off the snowball at first it's difficult to push it
down hill and it gets stuck but eventually you build
up enough momentum that it just it it just goes
into an infinite rolling down the slope growing larger and
larger and larger and your love just accumulates more and
more and more and more you're sort of going into
a freefall of love that would be isn't that would
not be the most amazing life if you were actually
able to somehow figure out how to achieve that so
what keep it keeps people from doing that well fear
selfishness basically attachment and at this point which I want
to probably hit on in a future episode again cuz
it's such an important point your psyches inability to just
hold that love that's something you should practice more is
when you feel so much love for your life and
for reality that like your body your body starts to
get antsy and squirmy you're not able to hold it
it's almost like it's almost like it you're on the
edge of an orgasm but it it like it feels
uncomfortable because you want to come but you can't and
you're kind of like at that edge you know that
feeling because that intensity of love what if you if
you just sit there and you consciously experience it and
fully feel it that Daddy that intensity of love will
itself be what heals you and transforms you it'll burn
out your impurities and your selfishness but that shadow or
darkness inside of you that devil that's inside of you
that ego that's inside of you your your sense of
self and all of its attachments and diction's it's gonna
it's gonna resist that that purification and the fire of
love see and so one of the things you should
practice is whenever you have those rare moments of this
intense intense love is to try to stay in it
as consciously as you can for as long as you
can to feel it as deeply as you can to
allow it to touch you your heart as deep as
it can and to let it to transform you and
then to go through that entire it's a grieving it's
actually a grieving process that you go through and you
will cry you will have various kinds of emotions come
up positive ones negative ones and so this is the
process of spiritual purification of letting go of your attachments
so that you're then cable of loving more and this
is one of the things that psychedelics help you do
is they helped you to go through this process by
just blasting you with intense superhuman levels of love divine
love absolute love unconditional love infinite love and then gradually
over time not in one fell swoop but gradually over
time does this this raises your capacity to love and
this this is this is a long process that takes
years and years and years the reason it takes so
long so long and there's so much work there to
be done is because you have so much attachment to
selfishness and fear and also because the love is infinite
it's so great that you're always going to discover higher
and higher levels of it and in a sense that's
what all human growth ultimately entails if you want to
understand human growth at like the the highest purest level
the deepest level it's this and it all begins simply
with having an open mind and a willingness to explore
different perspectives and to question one's own perspective and to
be able to step outside and beyond one's own perspective
so I hope this / helps this I hope this
perspective helps you to see life in a different way
and to show you a new meta possibility the possibility
of approaching reality as as a perspectival thing not an
objective material thing and then getting excited about exploring all
this and not getting stuck in the human pettiness that
is happening all around us especially on YouTube nowadays where
people are constantly debating and debunking and judging each other's
perspectives so that's that's ultimately my life's work is to
help you to explore different perspectives and to understand how
they work and why they work the way they work
and then to appreciate that more and more and more
and to be careful as we're doing that not to
turn what I'm teaching actualize that orange into a perspective
of its own see that's always that's always the danger
is that you know you get cocky you know you
explore a few perspectives and you get cocky and say
okay I've explored enough of them I figured it all
out and then you kind of create a new perspective
out of that but that's still that's not really it
that's not enough because you've just locked yourself down again
see so you have to keep constantly pushing your mind
to explore more and more to look at the world
from different points of view I think one of the
most powerful mental tools or techniques that you can use
for the rest of your life if you really want
a higher quality life it's this it's very simple challenge
your mind even though it won't want to do this
challenge and push your mind to look at the world
through other perspectives that are significantly different than yours in
a non-judgmental way where you actually step outside of your
own perspective and take that perspective you can actually like
do that for example just as a thought exercise sit
there after this video is over sit there just for
five minutes and I want you to actually try to
live through as close as you can approximate what you
think it would be like to be a neo-nazi or
a fundamentalist Christian or a Muslim or a woman or
a man you know whatever the opposite of whatever you
think you are you know one of my favorite things
about sex this is something I'm gonna teach more of
in the future is it's not the orgasm that I
receive I mean that's great but one of my favorite
things is actually like what really turns me on in
sex is imagining the orgasm that the woman receives lot
of guys miss out on this they're too eager to
get their orgasm and they have no interest in what
it feels like for the woman to have her orgasm
I don't just mean giving her an orgasm and taking
pride in that that I mean that's nice but no
I mean actually vicariously experiencing her orgasm as though it
were your own I challenge you to sit there if
you're a guy for five minutes close your eyes and
try to experience for five minutes in your mind just
using visualization basic visualization and imagination try to actually feel
what it's like for a woman to experience sex what
that feels like what the appeal is to her in
it it's a it's it's beautifully different than what it
is for you as a guy right to understand this
you need to actually get into her mind into the
psychology of a feminine sexuality that that's that can be
challenging for some guys but also it's extremely rewarding if
you're able to do it and you can do it
in fact here's a bold claim it's possible for you
as a guy to sit there on on your couch
with your eyes closed without physically touching yourself to actually
visualize her perspective and her orgasm and her sexual excitement
so deeply so profoundly that you will actually literally experience
her orgasm and you will have a female orgasm it's
possible for you to to do that I'm not saying
it's easy I'm not saying I'm gonna do it in
five minutes you'll probably take a lot of practice you'll
have to open your mind significantly you may require the
help of psychedelics or something like that to actually accomplish
it there are various techniques that can help you like
hypnosis and so forth self-hypnosis and you have to get
really good at visualization to do this but you can
do this and if you do it it'll be one
of most amazing experiences in your life and it'll get
you a tangible sense of what I'm talking about and
exploring like really exploring others perspectives and the beauty of
that but you know for now if that's too tall
of an order for you for now just commit from
now on in your life to just genuinely being curious
and exploring other people's perspective so like if you're at
work and your boss is just you're disagreeing with your
boss and your boss is a different perspective than you
about something rather than just being defensive about it and
criticizing him and so forth actually pause for a minute
and try to see it from his perspective that doesn't
mean his perspective is right or that you should do
what he says but just try to see it from
his perspective and you'll see that this is enormous ly
beneficial in dealing with humans whether it's at work bosses
co-workers employees or in politics it's extremely effective in politics
it's extremely effective in understanding religion you basically cannot understand
religion without this also with spirituality it's extremely effective in
your personal relationships with your family your children your lovers
and spouses and girlfriends and boyfriends it's very effective in
understanding history being able to go back and actually look
at looking at the world through different historical perspectives it's
it's powerful for understanding different cultures and appreciating different cultures
it's powerful as a technique for healing wounds and trauma
from your childhood because to really forgive your parents or
somebody who harmed you or did wrong to you in
some way you will have to use this method in
some way to see their perspective to see why they
did the things they did why it felt right and
proper from their perspective to do the things they did
to you to harm you and then that will create
an understanding which you will be able to use to
then forgive and to develop compassion and to get over
that trauma and wound that was caused to you by
somebody else this is sort of the universal solvent for
resolving human conflict is this ability and of course the
reason we have so much human conflict at social at
the social societal levels and at the cultural you know
culture wars and the battle between males and females and
and at the individual level the family level at the
worker employee level at all these different levels we have
these conflicts precisely because people are unwilling to practice this
technique and nobody has taught them how to practice this
technique and it's difficult to practice a sec nique it
takes effort it's not something we naturally want to do
naturally our mind wants to just lock itself into one
perspective so try that on for size as a technique
