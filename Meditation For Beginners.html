Hey this is Leo for actualized.org and in this episode
I'm going to explain meditation for beginners Meditation is the
single most important self-improvement habit you can have. Let me
repeat that again, because i need to stress the significance
of this. Meditation is the single most important habit for
self-improvement that you can have. So the question is why
aren't you meditating yet. Why aren't you meditating consistently. Now
you might say Leo why are you beating on this
point? Because I'm already here i'm willing to learn, here
i am, so tell me how to do it and
i will in a second.... but there's a larger issue
here and the larger issues is that you still don't
grasp and fathom the full significance of what you stumbled
upon here you're kind of like a man was walking
down the street, or a woman walking down the street,
who stumbles upon a little golden nugget lying on the
road and you think to yourself, "oh a golden nugget
that's great!" and you try to pick it up and
then you run off with it never having realized that
what you really discovered but failed to realize is a
gold mine! not one little nugget. This thing here... i'm
going to share a nugget with you today but it's
really just a little tip of the iceberg you've discovered
a gold mine. So take what i say here very
seriously and i'll come back to this point after I
show you the technique. So let's talk about how to
meditate. So there's a lot of different techniques out there
and i actually have episodes that cover various techniques in
a lot of depth. I want to give something simple
for beginners who haven't done this before or who have
tried and failed and now are really serious about making
this habit stick. So I'm going to boil all the
meditation down for you to just like one little simple
nugget, and what that is is the following and I
want you to now do what I say with me
and don't just follow along intellectually. There's a key distinction
we have to make to meditate effectively, and that is
the distinction between thinking and awareness. So we have thinking
on the one hand which is what you normally do
which is what you're very familiar with, and then we
have awareness which is kind of puzzling and mysterious and
you know ..."Leo what is awareness?" Well we're gonna make
this distinction and this distinction is something that you actually
make by meditating. You don't make distinction this distinction by
thinking. See there's two ways to try to make this
distinction. One is to say" oh okay let me think
about this, oh yeah I've thought about it, oh yeah
there's a distinction between thinking and awareness" So that's one
way and that's fine you start there but I want
you to go deeper right now with me I want
you to become aware that there is a distinction between
thinking and awareness, not just to think about it but
to actually become aware of it. See there is this
kind of weird self-referential thing going on here so let's
try it right now as you're sitting there don't change
anything. you don't change your posture, don't do anything, just
sit there and listen to me right this very second
and become aware of whatever is happening for you, become
aware of your direct experience. Don't think about it become
aware of it, and feel the difference between those two
things. it's one thing for example to be aware that
there is a a pressure sensation under your ass because
you're sitting on a chair and another thing to think
about it. ok those are two different things and I
don't want you to think about the difference. I want
you to experience and become aware of the difference. are
you following along with me right? now it's hard at
first to see the importance of this distinction. it might
seem like that distinction is not even there for you
right now. but what's going to happen after practicing a
lot of meditation and after practicing a lot of watching
and being aware of the difference between thinking and awareness,
then the distinction in your mind gets drawn sharper and
sharper and sharper and sharper, then over the years it
becomes so sharp that then you have profound epiphanies and
realizations and emotional releases and all sorts of amazing stuff
starts to happen from this little simple meditation habit so
what meditation is, one way to look at it, is
it is simply the using of awareness to draw a
distinction in your mind between thinking and awareness that's one
way to frame it. So the actual technique let's practice
it right now.,i'll show you the most simple, i think,
technique that exists for meditating and what this is this
is like.. this is called the no manipulation technique. so
try right now sit there. as you're sitting don't try
to put yourself into some sort of meditative position or
posture any posture position you take is fine and just
sit and notice and be aware, just observe and watch,
all these words like aware, be observant ,watch, notice these
are all synonymous so just sit there and notice what's
happening right this very second in direct experience. right this
moment, not a minute before, not ten minutes later, not
what I'm going to say next right now. so you're
hearing the sound of my voice maybe you're, you're looking
at me if you're watching this on video and you're
feeling some emotions in your body... thoughts might be coming
up for you so do this right now and just
train your mind on that and try to stick with
it no manipulation means that you don't manipulate your body
or your posture, you just let it go natural and
whatever it wants to do let it do it this
includes your mind. so let your mind go natural -
so if your mind wants to think perverted thoughts, let
it think pretty thoughts and if it wants to judge
let it judge and if it wants to go crazy
and get angry and upset and all this let it
do that and if it wants to experience some emotion
like sadness or happiness or excitement or frustration let it
experience that emotion Whatever is occurring for you. Don't try
to experience anything because you already are experiencing. there's never
a moment when you're not experiencing unless maybe when you're
deep asleep, but if you're awake then there's never a
moment you don't have an experience, so that's it your
meditation is focused on that this right now this right
now experience right here okay. so do it do it
right now while I'm talking you don't need to be
in a quiet environment to meditate you don't need to
sit alone by yourself, I mean it helps, that's a
good place to start. especially if you're a beginner but
you can do it right now is I'm talking. notice
that you don't need a fancy position you don't need
to manipulate your breathing. that's it. that's the whole method
sounds very simple and it is very simple and the
problem with it sounding so simple is that you overlooked
the significance of it and also you underestimate the challenges
of it this whole non manipulation thing is very challenging
it's actually very very challenging to stop manipulating yourself because
that's what you've been doing for decades now as you've
been manipulating yourself and you haven't been allowing whatever is
actually occurring to actually occur you've been fighting it and
when you start to practice this one thing you're going
to notice is that man i am manipulating myself not
to manipulate myself and that too is a manipulation so
that's just something yo're gonna work through. you can experience
all that that's the process of learning how to meditate.
so that's the just of the technique, now let's talk
about how to set the habit because the habit is
the most important part here the habit is going to
evolve the following for you, so you going to start
with 20 minutes of this per day. you're going to
sit there with a timer get yourself a timer, set
for 20 minutes and then you're just going to sit
in one sitting don't break it, up don't interrupt yourself.
preferably find a quiet place to start because you're just
beginning. and that's your habit and you can use every
day. Every single day this is so critical, if you
get this wrong oh man... you've... you've really got wrong.
every single day no excuses. So you have got tp
make this commitment what I'm telling you is not just
every single day for the next month, I'm telling you
every single day for the rest of your life. every
single day and I mean it really, I mean it
it's like: no vacations no holidays no sick days no
excuses, no emergencies, nothing every single day you commit to
finding 20 minutes to meditate, and is it possible? yeah
it's possible. it's definitely possible. in fact it's, it's so
easy it's so easy to find 20 minutes in your
day to meditate that it's actually quite ridiculous all the
excuses people come up with why they don't have 20
minutes I'm pretty busy guy, I run a business and
I've been meditating consistently every single day for the last
three years, haven't missed a single day why is that?
it's not because I'm some extraordinary individual, I just set
it as a priority I just said this is important
and so here it is and it's happened, haven't missed
a single day, so you can do that too. that's
the habit, now let me hum let me give you
some words of warning and some guidelines, for this habit
that you will be developing over the months and years
to come because if you don't follow what I'm going
to say next you're gonna fail, like guaranteed fail, so
listen to these guidelines that i'm gonna tell you. so
first of all have the expectation that your first year
you will suck at meditating you will. No one is
born a good meditator you suck at it when you
first start and you suck for quite a while notice
the whole year that's quite a long time to suck,
so you gonna suck during all that time so be
prepared for that. you come into thinking like oh yeah
not manipulation that's easy i cannot manipulate myself i can
just sit there for 20 minutes and not manipulate myself
and the reality is that no you can't and it
will take you a year or more to get decent
at that and it's not within your control you can't
control yourself you can't manipulate yourself into not manipulating yourself
see so that's not going to work here your standard
operating procedure is not going to work here it's not
gonna help you in fact it's only going to slow
you down and if the more you try that then
maybe we'll be two years instead of one year that
you're gonna suck but that's just something again you can't
control it's out of your hands the only thing you
can control is the setting of the habit which is
why it's so freaking critical that you do this every
single day because that's really the only thing you can
control here it's just that that's it. what else will
happen to you is that it will be very very
frustrating so here's your second guideline: is going to be
very frustrating for the first year if you don't expect
that you're going to fail the number one reason people
failed meditation is they come into a thing like all
meditation that's going to release some stress i'm gonna feel
nice and feel happy so let me do it and
then of course what happens the first year you hardly
get any of that and so you look at it
and say well clearly it's not working clearly i suck
clearly i'm a failure I'm not cut out for this
and so you quit you quit in the middle of
the learning curve you see a meditation is a pretty
steep learning curve the benefit of that is that once
you get past the learning curve it becomes amazing it
becomes so amazing it's hard to even describe with words
one thing you have to learn by hitting your head
against the wall repeatedly through meditation every single day is
that you cannot control your thoughts and I don't just
mean that in the sense that you suck at controlling
your flaws and that one day you will get good
at it I mean no, you can't control your thoughts
that's not an ability you possess nor will it ever
come into your possession now to fully grasp the significance
of that you will have to meditate for a while
so i'll let you meditate and discover that on your
own I don't want to spoil the surprise for you.
Also another guideline i want to give you here is
that you will have bad days like really bad days
while you meditate some days will be great some days
will be average some days will suck and some days
will be really really bad so I'm talking about those
really really bad days when you have those really really
bad days on occasion you might have a couple of
them per month remind yourself that it's actually during this
very day that you're growing the most with your meditation
you don't grow the most when you're just sitting there
and blissing out and being peaceful and calm I mean
those are nice, take when you can get them but
you're not going to have very many of those days
when you start and what you got to realize is
that it's kind of like going to the gym when
you're at the gym and you're pushing some really heavy
weight you can barely push and maybe you even fail
to lift it that's some of the best workout days
that's what you're shooting for as a weight lifter is
like taking your muscles to the breaking point so that's
what meditation is like and meditation is going to be
up and down and up and down don't expect it
to be just a a smooth upward progression like this
every day you're getting better and better and better, no
it's going to be up and down up and down
sometimes you are going to feel great and then the
next day you're going to crash you're going to be
caught in your mind thinking and being frustrated and pissed
off at the world and depressed and suicidal and during
that time I want you to remind yourself what I
told you here, that your best days are your worst
days ok and hm for the last guideline is that
as long as you do it it counts. what this
means is that some people they sit down they meditate
and they say after 20 minutes they say"well I meditated
for 20 minutes but this session was a bad session
i was i was thinking about sex or something so
this session I didn't meditate it doesn't count you know
if I'm sitting there thinking about sex for 20 minutes
is that meditation?" and the answer is yes it is
because what counts in meditation is the fact that you
sat down and you have the intention to sit there
and to be aware now it's not in your control
whether you will be aware or not and some days
like I said will be very bad days but still
count that as proper meditation so the stipulation here is
that you should have this kind of rule in your
mind that you can use again to reassure yourself when
you're failing or you think you're failing that the only
way to fail here is to not do the habit.
if you sit through 20 minutes you succeeded it's that
simple don't make it any more complicated. Speaking of complicated
it's very easy to make meditation very complicated: I have
hour-long episodes where I going to in-depth techniques and nuances
of meditation and you can do that later but remember
that what you're doing with meditation is your your sort
of learning to deal with your monkey mind and you're
learning to deal with all the distractions and self-doubt and
sabotage that your mind creates for you and one of
the ways in which it does it in the context
of meditation is that it creates all sorts of questions
and it wants to complicate everything, it's like "well Leo
what's the best time to meditate? Should i meditate in
the morning or in the evening or at lunch time?
or Leo should i meditate like by myself? or in
a group? or should I take a class? or should
I sit on a pillow? or should I sit in
the lotus position? or should I listen to music? or
not listen to music? or should i use technique Y
or technique Z.. so what this does is this distracts
you see this is your mind distracting you, this is
how the mind sabotages you and that's why you have
a lot of emotional issues in your life is because
you're not aware of the mind doing this so um
here just want to keep it very very simple I'm
deliberately not answering all your possible questions and covering all
the possible angles if you want that you can find
that in other episodes that i have, keep it very
simple right your focus here has to be... like almost
a hundred percent on just sitting down and doing your
20 minutes every day that's your whole focus and what
I want to set for you as a goal with
this habit is that your first few months it's going
to be 20 minutes a day then once you get
a little bit comfortable with that raise it to 30
minutes then a few months later raise it to 40
minutes 50 minutes and then what I want you to
do is by the end of the year in 12
months to be a 60 minutes and then you can
stay at that level for a while that's a pretty
good number ok so that's your your habit goal, make
the commitment make the commitment because like i said this
is the single most important self-improvement habit that you can
have I talk about a lot of advance and complicated
and nuanced topics and I give a lot of weird
techniques for meditation for other types of inner development but
really this here is all you really need and if
you've listened to me talking about it, my question for
you is why aren't you doing it? I can almost
guarantee that you're not doing it, why aren't you doing
it? this is the single most important self-improvement habit that
you can have in your life, because the results of
it exponentially grow on you about three years ago when
I started meditating I could barely sit still for 10
minutes it felt like torture it felt like I was
in hell for 10 minutes and now the other day
I i meditated for six hours not all in one
sitting I broke it up into blocks but they're pretty
long blogs and it was six hours and it was
amazing i mean six hours is pretty difficult for me
it doesn't come easily but uh overall the effect is
amazing the effects meditation had in my life has been
beyond description of words and it's only been three years
so far that I've been doing it last year I
bought myself a big flat screen TV and a playstation
4 wanted to play some video games and you know
how that goes and i just sold my ps4 and
i'm selling my TV this week because I don't need
these things anymore because when i sit and do nothing
I get more satisfaction and meaning than I do from
watching TV or playing video games it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
it is just like it's it's extraordinary the changes this
will have on your mind there are a lot of
specific benefits about meditation I could cite health benefits psychological
benefits emotional well-being benefits and all this kind of stuff
but i don't really want to go into that I
want to let you kind of discover that on your
own the important here is that you just grasp the
significant potential here for you right can you see that
potential if you're a forward-thinking person and you can see
the value of investing into yourself right investing into a
habit this habit is going to be difficult to build
initially I mean but not that difficult it's only 20
freaking minutes a day but what that will yield for
you a year or two or three or ten down
the road is going to be incredible it's going to
be incredible one of things you are going to discover
is that the level of happiness you have now when
you're doing your favorite most flashy activity like going to
a fancy restaurant or snorting some drugs or playing the
newest hottest video game hm whatever right whatever floats your
boat whatever really excites you... that you'll be able to
get that level of excitement and more by doing absolutely
nothing now that's powerful that is powerful because you've now
stop being a slave to all that shit and then
you've opened the doors now you've opened the doors it
doesn't just end there it's not just a blissing out
you've opened the doors to real self improvement at that
point and any problems you have in your life emotional
problems relationship problems business problems these problems just melt away
almost by magic they melt away because this is the
power of the distinction between thinking and awareness and it's
very hard to believe that the this little distinction can
have such a huge practical impact on your life but
it certainly can so I hope I've inspired a little
bit to really commit to making this a lifelong habit
