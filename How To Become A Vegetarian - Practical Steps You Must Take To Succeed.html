hey this is Leo for actualised gorg and in this
video I'm gonna talk about how to become a vegetarian
[Music] alright so let's break into this how do you
actually go about becoming a vegetarian what are the practical
considerations what are the philosophical considerations in this quick self-help
segment in about 15 minutes I'm going to cover all
the ins and outs about how to really make this
transition in your life because it can be a challenging
transition to make now let me start off by saying
that I am NOT a vegetarian in fact I don't
think that vegetarian vegetarianism is necessarily the most healthy diet
out there if you're just concerned about diet but there
of course are other considerations there perhaps a considerations about
morality ethics that you have when considering this switch so
let's go into all this stuff and in the end
this is not just going to be a theoretical discussion
what I'm going to give you is I'm gonna actually
give you the practical steps that you can take to
become a vegetarian so that you're actually a vegetarian in
your real life with your diet not just in theory
now the reason that I can talk about this with
some authority even though I'm not a vegetarian is because
I've done a lot of work on my diet over
the years in fact over the last eight years I've
really cleaned up my diet lost a lot of weight
may have been able to make a lot of transitions
with my diet cleaning it up progressively over the years
and so I have some understanding of the psychology takes
to make a diet shift and actually right now I'm
kind of starting to lean more towards vegetarianism I'm trying
to put more vegetables in trying to take out some
animal products from my diet and that's something that I'm
currently working on so this this topic actually resonates a
lot with me right now and I see myself maybe
in the future becoming a vegetarian depending on where things
go alright so what is the practical size of this
and let's talk about how to become vegetarian well I
think there are two reasons that people become vegetarians a
is that you think that vegetarianism is going to improve
your health because it's a healthier lifestyle so that's one
consideration and then be the second one is the moral
and ethical consideration of the cruelty that goes into butchering
animals eating animal products the impact that perhaps that has
on the environment how that's contributing to global warming how
that's contributing to unsustainable farming practices on sustainable manufacturing practices
so all of those considerations I'm actually not going to
touch the ethical and moral considerations that's way too much
to talk about in one video so I'll I'll cover
that somewhere else here I'm just going to talk about
the practical side so nutrition first question is is vegetarianism
even more nutritious for you is it a better more
healthier way to live than by consuming animal products this
is also a pretty deep question and I think that
what I'm going to tell you here rather than going
into all the studies and debate around this what I'm
just gonna say is that you need to do your
research so one of the reasons and one of the
the key techniques that I can give you here for
the psychology of changing yourself into a vegetarian is to
have a solid grounding and why you're doing it make
sure you're doing it for a valid reason and that
it's something that is gonna stick with you something that's
gonna resonate with you maybe you saw for example some
some documentary or you saw some sort of shock footage
on YouTube or somewhere else about animals being hurt slaughtered
butchered and now it's making you think about whether it's
right for you to be consuming animal products I would
say that that's a good place to start but that
should not be your motivation for why to become a
vegetarian because that is that's like a little temporary stimulus
little temporary hit that you're getting of either fear or
excitement or shock and that is not going to be
enough to sustain a vegetarian lifestyle because what the dairyman
in vegetarianism is going to entail for you is changing
the practicalities of what you do throughout your day how
you eat how you interact with your friends how you
interact with your family those are the real challenges those
are the logistics challenges I'm going to give you some
tips on how to fight those but in order to
really get at the root cause of that and to
have a solid foundation you want to know why you're
doing it right make sure you understand why and I
think that if you're coming at it from this nutrition
standpoint where you think that vegetarianism is healthier for you
and actually do you think that there are some good
valid points to this then then go and do the
research buy some books some hard science that will show
you that we'll make a case that will convince you
of why it's good also if you have some moral
considerations ethical considerations go ahead and research those look at
some books that talk about the sustainability of of farming
animals versus farming vegetables take a look at what kind
of performance differences you might get for example if you're
an athlete or you're doing sports here at the gym
you're working out you're putting on muscle that's probably concerned
for you to is to take a look at well
am I going to be able to do all that
on a vegetarian diet as well as I will on
an animal-based diet and there are ways to do it
so you got to go out there and do a
little bit of research get yourself educated that's number one
next is make sure that you're committing to a lifelong
sustainable change there's no point in becoming a vegetarian for
a week there's no point becoming a vegetarian for a
month if you're really interested in this then you want
to make a transition and that means that not only
are you gonna have to you're gonna have to make
some changes in your diet you're gonna have to make
some changes in your psychology so now that you're on
board with this and where you start there is I
want you to accept the costs of becoming a vegetarian
that means you're not going to be able to have
that steak anymore that means you're not going to be
able to have those eggs if if eggs are not
gonna be part of your vegetarian diet you're not gonna
be able to have chicken you're not gonna be able
to have turkey on Thanksgiving you're not going to be
able to have some of these things that maybe right
now you hold near and dear to your heart and
that is the cost so I want you to weigh
those costs against the benefits that you'll be receiving and
those benefits you have to make a list of benefits
what those will be for you I don't know a
potential list of candidates might be well first of all
you might be healthier you might feel you might feel
cleaner you you will get rid of that mental fog
that you have from eating all these refined animal products
you might feel a sense of pride that you're not
contributing to problems in society with mainstream farming and manufacturing
and all the nasty practices that go on there so
you just might feel a sense of pride that you're
not doing that and so these are some of the
benefits that you're getting right the benefits versus the costs
realize that there are going to be real costs and
there's there's also going to be not only the long-term
costs there's also going to be short-term costs the short-term
costs are really the stuff that you have to do
to change your diet that's gonna be painful a little
bit difficult for you at first because it's unnatural in
the sense that you've built up a habit of eating
animal products now switching and cutting all those off is
going to be difficult simply because well our society is
not a vegetarian society our society advertised animal products everywhere
almost anywhere you go most of the dishes contain animal
protein so that's something that you're gonna have to kind
of wean yourself off of alright so except those costs
be serious about them and that's also why I want
you to do some research so you can understand what
those costs are and also understand what the benefits are
to you alright the next and this is now we're
getting into the real logistics of how to make this
transition happen is that if you have been eating animal
products and now you don't want to be eating animal
products at all what I would say and this is
where my experience comes in with diet is you want
to make these transitions in shifts in phases so here's
how I would do it and this is actually something
that I'm toying with right now I'm not technically a
vegetarian but I'm going through a vegetarian phase right now
and what that means is that I'm going through my
diet and I'm taking a look ok what can I
actually make what changes can I actually make in my
diet that I would be reasonably happy with that I
could sustain for the rest of my life without being
too too depressed about not having in my life anymore
so for example can I get rid of chicken in
my diet practical practical question am i okay with not
eating chicken anymore am i okay with not eating the
steak anymore am i okay with cutting out butter am
i okay with cutting out fish salmon I love smoked
salmon am i okay with that and so what I'm
doing right now is I said okay I think there's
something to this idea that if I become a vegetarian
it's gonna be healthier for me and so I wanted
to test this out and so what I said to
myself is okay I'm gonna test this out and the
way I'm going to do it is I'm gonna cut
out some items I'm not just going to become a
vegetarian overnight that's too drastic of a shift I know
that my my brain and my body will rebel against
that so what I have to do is I have
to go in there and have to say okay what
I'm gonna do is this week when I go shopping
I'm just gonna take and and make some subtle changes
I'm not gonna buy the steak that I usually buy
I'm not gonna buy the chicken that I usually buy
I'll buy something else I'll buy more more fruits more
vegetables maybe I'll buy some whole grains too to replace
that right and one of the questions that I had
when I was starting this was I was asking myself
well what am I going to replace my steak in
my chicken with because I eat those on a weekly
basis I love them I have good recipes already in
place for those I don't even have any vegetarian recipes
I don't even know how to cook vegetarian stuff and
so what I need to do there's I need to
say okay well there's a logistical challenge here I need
to plan this out I can't just jump into it
I have to say okay so first things first is
I cook at home I cook all my own meals
that's another topic but I cook my all my own
meals so that means I need some recipes for vegetarian
dishes because if I don't have the recipes then that
means I'm gonna be tempted to go at some of
the supermarket and just grab that chicken or that steak
because I have recipes for those and I don't have
other recipes so maybe that means I need to go
online do a little bit of research find the recipes
maybe I need to buy vegetarian cookbook right these are
like practical just logistical considerations I want you to start
thinking about these things because if you don't do this
I guarantee you you're not going to be able to
make the transition it's not going to be successful it's
not gonna last long term so let's go into some
of the other points here well for me for example
it's a little bit easier because I do cook all
my own meals and already went through that shift I
already went through that phase where I transitioned off of
all the fast food all the restaurant food out there
which is in my opinion garbage they use the lowest
grade ingredients that you could possibly get because they're trying
to raise their margins I don't blame them but that
doesn't mean that I'm gonna ingest that and put that
into my body so what I decided to do is
make a transition I did this about six months ago
where I transitioned entirely from restaurant food to cooking my
own meals that way I have full control I can
shop for organic products and got Whole Foods get all
the high quality ingredients that I want I know exactly
what's going into my food no trans fats no artificial
stuff and so for me that transition took place six
months ago so now it's easier because I make all
my own meals I can control this so for me
for example now it's pretty easy if I want I
can cut out protein I just need to find replacements
for you and might be too more challenging because I
bet that you are not cooking all your meals you're
probably snacking on stuff you're buying stuff at the you
know at the gas station or you're stacking of stuff
at work or you right now have a habit of
going to two different restaurants eating out with your family
eating out with friends eating out with co-workers and that's
gonna be a logistical hurdle that you have to overcome
right so I would say start planning in phases so
maybe the first phase for you is to wean yourself
off all the restaurant and takeout food maybe that's gonna
be your first phase then the next day is may
be taking out red meat then maybe the next phase
months down the road will be taking out seafood and
taking out chicken and maybe then a few months later
you'll take out eggs and butter and really even go
more towards vegan then even vegetarian maybe that's how you
want to do it right in phases not just all
in one go it's not going to work it's just
gonna be too hard it's not gonna work unless you
are incredibly driven for some sort of moral reason to
do this and so I would say think about it
like this right this is this is how you change
your diet and of course this applies not just to
vegetarianism but to any kind of diet changes that you
want to make is you want to think it out
consider the logistics consider the logistics and logistics for you
are gonna include I want you to think about your
work I want you to think about your family I
want you to think about your friends I want you
to think about how often you're eating out versus how
often you're cooking at home and I want you to
think about your athletic performance or the Jim performance that
you want to have in your life so think about
all those things and ask yourself the critical questions what
am I going to need to do to clean up
my diet at work around the family with my friends
in order to get the Geo performance that I want
what am I gonna have to do to make the
shift into vegetarianism there so you're gonna probably going to
need to somehow come up with a system so that
you're not going for for you know that pizza with
pepperoni and sausage that is always showing up every Friday
night at work or when your friends go out someplace
to some steak house you're gonna have to find some
vegetarian options there so looking at maybe the restaurants that
you go to and making sure that there's a vegetarian
option in each one of those otherwise you have to
tell yourself well I'm not going to go there anymore
so you have to set some of these kind of
hard and fast rules and you have to think it
through because the real challenge with diet is the logistics
of it because people don't think it through and so
what ends up happening is their friends just drag them
out one night and they end up deciding to go
to a pizza place and there everyone decides to order
a meatlovers pizza and all the sudden you're just sitting
there and you're looking at it and there it is
and you really don't have any other option you're kind
of now committed to eating that pizza or being hungry
basically and so you know you have to think about
that what are you going to do where are you
going to draw the line is it before you even
enter the pizza place is it gonna be after you
enter the pizza place and maybe there you decide you're
gonna have a salad and that you have some sort
of strategy for how to get those salads instead of
being tempted by that pizza you know what is it
gonna be maybe gonna get a vegetarian pizza I don't
know think about that stuff this is important this is
how you actually make the transition alright and the last
couple of points are this I want you to approach
this not in a dogmatic kind of moralistic way where
like I am a vegetarian this is important this is
what I got I want you to approach it as
an experiment try it out go in with an open
mind and say you know what I'm gonna try this
out for maybe a month maybe two months and just
see see what happens see how it affects my nutrition
see how it affects my health because even though you
can read all these books on nutrition you can read
all these books about Pro vegetarianism con vegetarianism vegan something
else you have all these different opinions out there in
the end what matters is what works for you and
what agrees with you not in theory but in practice
that means go out there start making the changes and
start seeing what are you satisfied with what are you
not satisfied with be be more aware listen to the
signals that your body is sending you so that means
how are you feeling start noticing if you're starting to
go all vegetarian start to notice how does that affect
your mental performance how does that affect your performance at
work how does that affect your moods how does that
affect your gym performance how does that affect your family
and relationships because it's gonna it's gonna have ramifications in
all those areas start to notice that and don't be
so dogmatic about this is right or this is wrong
because what's actually right and wrong is simply how you
feel do you actually feel happier as a vegetarian do
you feel better do you have better performance in your
life do you feel less guilt do you feel more
ethical if you do then it's right for you and
if you don't then stop doing it give it a
good go but if it's not working for you stop
doing it and then the last point I'm gonna make
is get get some blood work done I think that's
important too one of the things I learned from the
biohacking movement which I was kind of a part of
you know experimenting the different supplements and experimenting with just
different diets with biohacking what I learned is that really
the key is to track yourself track your statistics right
of course track how you feel but also have some
objective metrics too so before you start making a big
diet change I would recommend go get some blood work
get some blood work on your lipid numbers cholesterol numbers
just to get a baseline for where you're at right
now then go ahead and start implementing changes in your
diet and then you can get blood work done maybe
six months or 12 months later and just see what
happens see the difference because those are gonna be some
hard numbers that you're actually gonna be able to prove
to yourself that something happened don't make the mistake of
saying that well blood work this is so technical it
costs money in the end blood work costs one hundred
two hundred bucks if you're paying cash and if you
have insurance then it's probably cheaper for you so go
out there and do that blood work because what that's
gonna do critical thing is it's gonna give you evidence
to support your actions so that means if you take
your cholesterol numbers today and then you go vegetarian for
six months and you take them again six months later
and you find out that your cholesterol has all sudden
dropped all your numbers have improved you're seeing better gene
performance what that's gonna do is in your mind it's
gonna build a case for why what you're doing is
good because it's very easy to forget that once you've
made those positive changes that you're gonna start to feel
like well nothing nothing's really change in my life you're
just gonna kind of get acclimated to the new position
and sometimes that will actually tempt you to get thrown
off course and then to drop off and all of
a sudden you might notice yourself all of a sudden
not being able to sharing anymore and sneaking in some
some non vegetarian meals here there and the way to
prevent that is to build up the case that what
you're doing is good that it's working it's not just
theory it's actually working you're feeling it you're seeing it
on the on the print out page with your numbers
