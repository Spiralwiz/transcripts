            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/tS3mMZblq0U' target='_blank'>Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 1</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Leo Gura's Concept of Absolute Infinity</b>: Leo Gura delves into the complex concept of "absolute infinity". He emphasizes that this topic digs into the deepest level of human understanding and insists upon a serious reflection on existence itself, not simply the content within existence. This isn't about molecules, atoms, or tangible forms, but the substance of all existence. He urges viewers to consider his exploration with open-minded curiosity.
</li><li><b>Absolute Infinity as the Answer to Existence</b>: According to Leo Gura, the answer to vast questions such as "what is reality?", "what is consciousness?", "what is God?" and more, is Absolute Infinity. This may appear as an oversimplified answer considering the depth of these questions but Leo asserts that our lack of understanding of Absolute Infinity is the obstacle to grasming this correlation.
</li><li><b>Challenging the Perception of Unanswerable Questions</b>: Leo Gura confronts the presumptive notion that enigmatic universal questions like the ones he's addressing cannot be answered and stamps it as arrogance and clear lack of curiosity. He advocates for continuous intellectual exploration and asks viewers to remain open to the voicing of answers that might initially seem impossible.
</li><li><b>Highlighting the Root Problem of Reality's Origin</b>: Gura identifies the core issue that arises when people consider the origin of reality, which he coins as the "bootstrap problem" and "self-reflection problem." He presents the conundrum of God's location and being during the process of creation, considering that if all reality was created by God, God is outside reality; however, to be real, God would need to be included in that reality. 
</li><li><b>Synthesis of Various Domains to Understand Reality</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges that resolving this paradox requires a synthesis of diverse domains of knowledge including aspects like: limits and physical laws, foundations, grounding, perspectives, relativity, duality, boundaries, contrasts, hierarchies, and power. These concepts necessarily interlink to form a comprehensive understanding of reality and its nature.
</li><li><b>Exploring the Concept of an Infinite Object</b>: Leo suggests a thought exercise to imagine an infinite object. He acknowledges that it's a significant mental task due to the inherent human struggle to grasp the concept of infinity. Gura reinforces that this is a critical step to understanding the depth and complexity of absolute infinity and the substantial nature of existence.
</li><li><b>On imagining an infinite object</b>: Leo Gura encourages the audience to try and visualize an infinite object, employing a thought experiment involving a sphere with infinite dimensions. He guides viewers in imagining a sphere with infinite spatial dimensions, color nuances, smells and beyond. He acknowledges the inherent difficulty in this task, noting how our minds, conditioned by our own finite experiences, struggle to really conceive the infinite.
</li><li><b>Limits and Physical Laws</b>: Gura discusses the concept of limits and physical laws that define reality, as conceived by scientists. Using the example of a soap bubble, Gura points out its definite shape, size, and color. He advances the idea that the bubble's shape and properties are due to physical laws and elements outside the bubble. Pushing further, Gura questions what limits or governs reality as a whole and challenges the notion that reality's limits are determined by physical constants and laws, introducing the infinite regress problem.
</li><li><b>Infinite Regress Problem</b>: Gura introduces the infinite regress problem, which arises when asking what enforces the constants, like gravitational constant, or what provides the basis for limits. He argues that if we place something outside of reality to act as its enforcer, that element automatically becomes part of reality, thus expanding our concept of reality. Hence, any attempt to identify the limiter of reality leads to an infinite regress, a string of questions needing further justification.
</li><li><b>Inadequacy of existing explanations</b>: Gura spotlights the shortcomings of both science and religion in addressing the question of what limits reality. He points out that both domains generally avoid or fail to address this issue, instead often settling for simpler, vague explanations or assumptions about the nature of reality. He compares attributing the state of the universe to a gravitational constant and attributing it to God, noting that both explanations are insufficient as they do not provide any fundamental understanding of the nature of reality itself.
</li><li><b>Infinite Regress and the Concept of No Ultimate Limit</b>: Leo Gura argues that "infinite regress" might not be a problem, but rather a feature of existence. This idea suggests that reality could possibly have no ultimate limit, opening up the possibility of infinite chains or levels of existence. 
</li><li><b>Standards, Foundations, and Grounding</b>: Leo Gura discusses the difficulties in determining a standard or foundation to assess or measure reality. Any standard or foundation we choose is itself part of reality and could easily be disputed. As everything in reality is a subset of the universe, we can't fully explain the universe using subsets, which is a limitation of any method or standard. The discussion emphasizes the conundrum of explaining the whole using parts. 
</li><li><b>The Issue of Grounding</b>: He also talks about the concept of "grounding," or the base upon which things exist. Leo questions the ultimate grounding for existence, examining a series of entailing foundations, from the ground he stands on to the atoms and particles that constitute matter according to physics concepts. The problem of infinite regress returns, as each step of grounding leads to another, leaving us again with the likelihood of no ultimate grounding or foundation.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity and Perspective</b>: Leo Gura highlights that all individuals have perspectives, and every point of view is limited and relative. This limited perspective forms the basis for our understanding of reality, creating the question of who or what perspective should be the arbitrator of what is real. The democratization of different views or averaging of scientific perspectives falls short as this again would be an added perspective. Leo insists that the challenge of always being limited to a specific point of view can never be escaped. 
</li><li><b>Objective Reality and Bias</b>: Gura comments on the fascinating epistemic problem that arises around objective reality where the individual bias or perspective is the dominant factor. He suggests that individual truth assertions may be seen as "right" due to personal bias but those perspectives are not objective since they only provide a limited viewpoint. He rejects the notion that group consensus, whether via democratic processes or the consolidation of scientific perspectives, can represent an ultimate perspective. Each asserted 'correct' viewpoint merely adds to the plethora of distinct, potential realities, emphasizing the never-ending cycle of perspective-based 'realities'. 
</li><li><b>Science and Human Perspective</b>: Gura affirms that what is understood as universal, or the scientific perspective, is merely human perspectives labeled differently. He reminds that assumed objectivity, even in the realm of science, is simply a refined subjective perspective. Ultimately, he reiterates the inescapable problem of relying on perspectives to understand reality and asserts that our understanding of reality is largely determined by our finite viewpoints.
</li><li><b>Gods perspective and the complexity of incorporating all perspectives</b>: Leo suggests that God's perspective would encompass all perspectives, not just human ones, but also the perspectives of inanimate objects and all entities in the universe, including potential extra-terrestrial life. He argues that even with advancements in technology, humanity is infinitely far from achieving God's perspective.
</li><li><b>Concept of time relativity</b>: Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which demonstrates that time is relative, opens up the idea that reality may not be an objective physical world, but instead an absolute relativity made up of different perspectives creating reality.
</li><li><b>The importance of dualities, contrasts, and distinctions</b>: Leo emphasizes that knowledge, reality, and experiences are shaped by contrasting opposites or dualities such as up and down, rich and poor, existing and non-existing. Without these contrasts, our perspectives would fail to differentiate things.
</li><li><b>Problems with definitive distinction</b>: Leo argues that the distinctions humans make are relative and therefore subjective. He points out that different individuals, or even cultures, can make different distinctions, affecting how they view and understand the world. This suggests that it's difficult to definitively and objectively distinguish between different aspects of reality. 
</li><li><b>Inter-relatedness of entities, perspectives and reality</b>: He proposes that reality is constituted by an intricate and total interconnection of different entities and their perspectives. He muses that all realities, physical or otherwise, are absolutely relative and the process of creating more perspectives is tantamount to creating more reality. 
</li><li><b>Inability to attain ultimate reality</b>: He suggests that it might be impossible to claim an ultimate or objective reality given our reliance on personal perspective and our impossibility of having direct access to all other perspectives. Defending one's perspective as the "correct" one is inherently flawed due to its circular reasoning, as it relies entirely on personal bias.
</li><li><b>Struggle in choosing the supreme perspective</b>: Leo discusses the dilemma of determining whose perspective is the ultimate one. He criticizes the idea of claiming one's perspective is correct based solely on one's own viewpoint, arguing it is a case of self-affirming bias. 
</li><li><b>Human Separateness and Boundaries</b>: Leo Gura delves into the concept that implies how all existences are in some way unified despite our distinctions. Examples like cats, dogs, and humans don't exist separately but rather as a part of a unified existence made visible via distinctions. Even distinctions like the heads and tails of a coin are actually interconnected, emphasizing that boundaries might not be objective realities but constructs humans project onto reality. Different individuals or cultures may have different boundaries based on their perspectives.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of Significance and Existence</b>: Gura expands on the idea that the significance of boundaries and distinctions is largely subjective, manifested based on personal values and experiences. Furthermore, he questions the objectivity of existence and non-existence, cautioning against confirmation bias from our fear of non-existence. 
</li><li><b>Function of Science in Determining Boundaries</b>: He critically analyses the role of science, arguing that it assumes boundaries are objective entities, despite these boundaries being drawn from relative perspectives. Leo emphasizes that all descriptions of reality are inherently based on relationships, whether intimate or universal. 
</li><li><b>Selection of Significant Relationships</b>: He puts forth the notion that humans ignore the majority of relationships in the world, giving importance to only a small fraction that matters personally to us. He concludes that, feasibly, all objects are infinitely related with all other objects and establishing the significance of these relationships is selectively subjective. 
</li><li><b>Exploring of Objective Perspective</b>: Finally, he considers what existence may be like from "God's perspective", contemplating the balance between existing and non-existing elements and the significance between the two from an objective viewpoint.
</li><li><b>Understanding Relationships within Reality</b>: Leo, Leo Gura, discusses the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected and in a relationship with everything else. However, as humans, we only focus on certain relationships based on our own biased needs and perspectives. Science, too, studies relationships between certain variables or phenomena, but omits infinite possible relationships in the study. Thus, our understanding of what relationships are important is based on our subjective biases.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Hierarchy of Relationships</b>: Gura challenges the assumption that certain relationships are more foundational or important than others, arguing that this might be our bias impacting our perception. He reminds the audience of the lack of an ultimate foundation, making it problematic to claim some relationships as more foundational. Considering the interconnectedness of everything, he proposes that there is no hierarchy, and everything in reality may be equally essential, even those things we dislike or seem unimportant to us.
</li><li><b>Form and Formlessness</b>: Gura introduces the concepts of "form" and "formlessness." Form refers to objects that have shape or characteristics, while formlessness refers to potential ideas without any specific shape or characteristics. All forms are finite and distinct, while everything formless is potentially infinite and indistinct.
</li><li><b>Reality's Infinite Power and Possibility</b>: In this last discussion, Gura prompts the audience to consider the nature of reality's power and possibility. He suggests that everything might be possible in reality, contradicting our conventional understanding of possibility based on energy conservation laws in the physical world. This idea challenges us to rethink what we perceive as impossible within the universe.
</li><li><b>Infinite and Absolute Reality</b>: Leo Gura explains how reality is infinite, limitless, and groundless. He counters notions that certain things for reality are "impossible" or "difficult," arguing that such judgments stem from human experiences and limitations. Gura simulates the idea of reality through a hypothetical "infinite block of sand" which, by its infiniteness, contains all possible forms without needing to be carved out. Gura presents this as an analogy for reality, embodying all possibilities in its infinite, formless object. 
</li><li><b>Limits and Weirdness of Reality</b>: Leo states that notions of "normality," "weirdness," and impossibility are subjective judgments based on personal and cultural experiences, and are thus not absolute truths. He emphasizes that what is deemed normal or weird can vary over time and across different cultures.
</li><li><b>Reality Is Relative</b>: Gura argues for "metaphysical relativism," stating that reality is absolutely relative and that absolutism of reality stems from its totality of relativism. He reminds us that no "who's" exist to arbitrate or enforce any absolute norms or perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Reality as a Collection of All Possibilities</b>: Gura describes reality as a cemetery of all possible asymmetries, as an infinite expanse of all conceivable possibilities. This vision of reality unifies all its parts into one entity. 
</li><li><b>Absolute Infinity</b>: To explain "absolute infinity," Gura cites the metaphor of an infinite sandbox. In an infinite block of sand, all the potential shapes are already present, embodying the absolute infinity wherein all potential and actual possibilities exist simultaneously. This concept reflects Leo's interpretation of reality, where every possible form and scenario exists in potential, defining reality's absolute infinity. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Sand Metaphor for Absolute Infinity</b>: Gura furthers his metaphor of the infinite sandbox by invoking the concept of "infinite sand" where each particle is replaced by a formless, infinite object. Representing a closer approximation to reality than normal sand, this infinite sand captures the essence of absolute infinity. Instead of definitive physical properties, infinite sand contains every possible object and form, mirroring the infinite nature of reality. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion</b>: Gura concludes by stating that words cannot truly encapsulate the dimensions of reality's infinite nature. Instead, he encourages his audience to surpass language and directly experience the limits of the infinite, formless reality.
</li><li><b>Totality of Absolute Infinity</b>: In this section, Leo Gura elaborates on the concept of absolute infinity. He clarifies that this includes both everything that exists and everything that doesn't, encompassing all potentials and actualities simultaneously. Absolute infinity is inherently contradictory, embodying attributes that are both opposing and complementary, such as existence and non-existence, large and small, defined and undefined.
</li><li><b>Personal and Divine Perspectives</b>: Gura expounds on how humans perceive reality, noting that our point of view is a particular way because we identify with certain perspectives. We choose to identify with a specific point of view, such as being a statue in infinite sand. But, our perspective doesn't conflict with God's (infinite) point of view, since we are an inherent part of the whole, and we are never separate from it. Our chosen perspectives contribute to the totality of absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Zip File Analogy</b>: To further illustrate this, Gura introduces the analogy of a zip file that contains all possibilities. This zip file is both one and infinite, depending on the perspective from which it's viewed. It embodies infinite potential, encompassing every possible property that could ever exist, including existence itself. Yet, it also exists outside of any position in space, as space is included within itself.
</li><li><b>Reality of Infinity</b>: Gura underscores that what we observe in our immediate surroundings exemplifies the abstract concept of infinity he describes. Everything that appears finite is simultaneously infinite. This infinite state is not distant or theoretical; it's present in our direct experiences. Moreover, existence and non-existence coexist and are superimposed upon each other, creating a delicate balance.
</li><li><b>Infinities and Finiteness</b>: To encompass everything, infinity must contain all finiteness, thus forming a complete circle. Contrasting elements like sounds, colors, shape, etc., are all 'precipitates' or outcomes of infinite potential. Absolute Infinity is groundless and contains all possible contrasts and distinctions. However, from different perspectives, it can be perceived as both existing and not existing at the same time. 
</li><li><b>Timeless Existence of Reality</b>: Leo discusses the timeless existence of reality. It's not unfolding linearly in time and space, but emerges simultaneously like an explosion. Reality is an all-encompassing, immediate moment in which everything imaginable is present. It can be visualized as God firing a shotgun loaded with everything at once.
</li><li><b>Reality as a Precipitate of God</b>: In essence, known reality is a small fragment or 'precipitate' of God. However, to draw a distinction between what's infinite and what's finite is futile because all dichotomies exist within infinite potential. The distinctions we observe in reality are contrasts within the cloud of potential. Moreover, the conventional notions of existence and non-existence are simultaneously unified and transcended within this absolute infinitude.
</li><li><b>Question of Existence</b>: Towards the end of this section, Leo ponders on the question of existence and non-existence. He suggests that what humans perceive as existence might be non-existence, questioning how anyone would be able to differentiate between the two. He points out that everything, including what we usually consider as non-existence, is a part of absolute infinity and hence, inherently exists. Despite our inability to grasp these concepts, Gura argues that they are core aspects of the fundamental nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Existence and Non-existence Superimposed</b>: Yet again challenging human perception and understanding, Leo speaks to the concept of existence and non-existence being superimposed, in that there is nothing else and nowhere else to go. He equates reality to a "groundless infinite singularity" that is not a physical system but, rather, a collection of contrasts consisting of nothing. Thus, reality becomes like a Star Trek holodeck, an "infinite hallucination", without a physical or mechanical basis, defying human understanding of what is possible.
</li><li><b>Reality Without Mechanism</b>: Gura boldly confronts the challenges posed to science by reality, as continuous exploration of reality's content doesn't get to its coreits substance. The substance of reality, Gura posits, exists and doesn't exist simultaneously. It is everything and nothing at the same time, a startling assertion that explains everything yet leaves nothing explained at the same time. This deeply contrasts with science's approach, which continually explores the content within reality but doesn't reach its substance.
</li><li><b>Impossibility of Understanding Reality</b>: Gura claims that truly understanding reality would be a profound and life-altering experience. It would transcend the intellectual and be deeply emotional. However, he acknowledges that most listeners will not fully grasp his explanation, as it pushes the boundaries of human intellect and conception.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Direct Experience</b>: Gura emphasizes that words and concepts, such as his own, cannot fully capture the truth. Instead, he encourages direct experience of this truth, to step beyond finite minds and become endless, escaping the constraints of human existence. He points out that this idea can be discomforting and seemingly contradicting, but its paradoxical nature illustrates the complexity and mystery of reality.
</li><li><b>Inability of Science and Philosophy to Grasp Infinity</b>: Leo concludes by recognizing the limitations of science, philosophy, and religion to adequately grasp the concept of absolute infinity. He insists that achieving understanding is not a collective effort and cannot be facilitated through shared methods or experiences. Instead, he suggests that this achievement can only be reached individually, but in reaching it, one will realize that they were part of a collective reality. 
</li><li><b>Call to Continued Exploration</b>: Despite the heavy metaphysical concepts, Leo urges listeners to rewatch the video multiple times and really dissect his arguments. He acknowledges that this won't answer all philosophical questions, but it will provide the framework for individuals to seek a direct experience of realityan ultimate truth far beyond mere words or concepts.
