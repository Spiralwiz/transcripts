hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to be
funny the psychology of humor what I want to give
you here is a very practical guide for how to
up your humor especially for guys who are very logical
and very analytical and very serious minded they have a
serious minded attitude towards life because I was personally that
way not too long ago and I underwent a journey
of my own to transform that and the reason I
did that was because it was necessary for me to
get better results with attracting girls in this episode what
you're going to get is you're going to get a
bit of a bit of my backstory you're gonna get
some theory about what funniness is how humour actually works
we're going to take a look at your own psychology
and what within your own psychology is holding you back
from being more humorous naturally and then I'm going to
give you various categories of humor lots of specific examples
from my own life of how I used humor and
I'm going to give you three powerful exercises that you
can use to actually drill this into your mind so
we have a lot to talk about so let's get
right into it why is humor important well might seem
self-evident but there are actually more factors than you might
initially think I think the most important factor is that
it helps you with your a man to attract girls
now here I'm going to kind of be assuming that
I'm dealing with a male audience and that you're trying
to use this humor to be more likeable especially with
girls although the principle that I talked about here could
be used by anyone in any context this is not
just for in the nightclub or on a date or
with your girlfriend you can use this if you're a
girl you can use this in business context you can
use it everywhere this is a very flexible skill but
especially with girls it's just a killer skill killer skill
another important area where it's going to be great for
you is just with socializing being friendly and being friendly
in different contexts so it could be with friends when
you're just drinking beers at the bar or it could
be in a work environment it could be in a
social networking environment it could be in a professional environment
doesn't matter where this is a very powerful skill you
can use humor to build really deep connections to really
open doors that would otherwise never be open for you
you can use humor as a way to manipulate people
you can use humor to really get your way in
life where otherwise you wouldn't get your way so very
powerful humor is also very powerful if you're in sales
or if you're in marketing if there's stuff you got
to sell if there's a presentation got to give if
you got to convince someone of something it's a lot
easier to get your way when you're humorous about it
and when people like you and perhaps the most important
reason which nobody really thinks about is simply your own
happiness and well-being if you're a person who's going through
life and you're dead serious all the time the way
that I was and you have a stick up your
ass the way that I did and you're afraid to
socialize with people and you've got four or five layers
of mental filters for every sentence that you speak from
your mouth that means before sentence can come out you
filter it four times to make sure that it doesn't
upset someone or that it it's not embarrassing or weird
or you're not going to get judged for it if
you've got all this going on you're actually not happy
on the inside because you feel like your authentic self
isn't allowed to flourish in fact this might be such
a bad state for you like it was for me
that you don't even know this is going on for
you and you might have developed this kind of a
stigma where you tell yourself like oh well I'm just
not a very humorous person my whole life people have
told me that I'm kind of dry and I'm kind
of boring and maybe I'm a nerd and all this
kind of stuff and you feel like well can you
help me can you help that type of person and
my answer is yes I can because that's exactly who
I was and still am I'm a really nerdy person
so you can get some really powerful ideas here here's
the number one trick the big picture of what you
got to do to become funny is you have to
start to change the entire lens through which you see
the world right now if you've got a bad sense
of humor it's because you're looking at the world through
this lens where everything is dead serious and everything is
very analytical logical and pragmatic so that means whenever you
move your lips it's to get something utilitarian across to
somebody else like hey can you go get me my
car or can you loan me some money or can
you do this thing at work it's just very dry
matter-of-fact type of conversation which leaves no room for funniness
you can't get funniness that way and the chances are
that you've been doing this for so long you've been
looking at life through this filter of seriousness for many
years maybe several decades now that it's going to be
very difficult for you to shift out of this and
to reach this tipping point where your lens moves away
the serious lens moves away and in a new limb
lens comes into focus which is the lens of looking
at life and seeing humor and absurdity and silliness in
almost every situation no matter how mundane it is that's
the big picture key now the question is how do
you actually do this and what you're going to discover
if you're an analytical person the way that I was
you're kind of shy you're very logical very serious that
is going to be quite challenging to do this shift
in lenses that's going to be difficult but it's necessary
because until you get this shift what I found in
my own life personally is that it's very difficult for
you to be humorous and you try too hard at
it and basically you're too anxious about it and it
kind of backfires on you so it's very important I
would say that you make the flip happen make this
shift happen in your lenses and I'm going to tell
you how to do that but it's going to take
some effort from you you're not going to do it
just by finishing this one episode you're going to have
to do some practice to follow this up and not
just a week of practice not just a month of
practice but at least 12 months or more of practice
but think of it this way you got to really
ask yourself how badly do you want this skill of
being funny how valuable is it to you now you
might think about it like well being funny you know
uh there's a lot of other stuff in my life
that I could put my attention and energy into twelve
months of practice you know wouldn't it be better to
just put that into my job or into my career
into my relationship something like that and I would say
hold on a minute maybe you're looking at this from
the wrong perspective maybe actually being funny is a really
critical and key skill in life for you I would
suggest that it is if you really think about all
the ramifications that it could have if you just develop
this skill you're going to really be much better at
attracting women you're going to be much better social you
can be much more comfortable socially you're going to be
able to make business connections that you otherwise would never
have been able to make you're going to be better
at sales you're going to be happier on the inside
so there's a lot of benefits you're going to be
able to get your way in life more easily so
is that worth the investment I kind of need to
convince you that it is because otherwise you're not going
to do the work to get the shift to make
it effortless right humor is supposed to be effortless and
that's kind of what I experienced in my own life
is about three or four years ago I decided that
hey you know I've been very antisocial my whole life
in high school and in college I didn't really interact
with people much at all I was very focused on
work I was very focused on my academics on my
grades and I really good at that and I was
very much in my head and I played a lot
of video games and that's where I was and unfortunately
after eight years of that high school and college I
was kind of left socially inept unable to date unable
to be friendly with guys at the bar and this
was a problem for me right big problem by the
way before I forget there's an important point I wanted
to make about why this skill is so important for
you if you're a man having humor is very important
for you much more so than it is for women
not only because you can attract women with it but
actually because you can use it as a form of
power it's a way to manipulate and if you want
to be a powerful leader you need to have a
sense of humor it's very difficult to be a powerful
leader if you have no charisma and if you're just
very dry all the time and you can't make a
joke to save your life it's very hard to follow
that kind of person into battle great leaders are usually
pretty good at making jokes and in fact they're so
strategic about making jokes and little quips and zingers that
they can put other people into their place they can
establish status their higher statuses and scent is essentially established
through humor which is I think one of the deep
evolutionary reasons why women are attracted to men who are
humorous not simply because they can make the woman feel
good I mean that's certainly a plus but because it
shows that a man who is so confident socially he
has social power and he has social status and that's
something that women find very attractive so anyways back to
my story right so I was this very socially inept
guy after college and after a while basically I had
to say okay I got to fix this problem and
I started getting into the dating scene and I started
learning about how dating works and I got involved with
pickup for a few years then I went pretty hardcore
with pickup and just learned a lot of theory and
tried a lot of different stuff and got a lot
of insights but basically what happened for me is eventually
I was able to reach this point at first it
was very challenging but eventually I reached the point where
my analytical lenses and my serious lens it all kind
of melted and I could start to see humor effortlessly
in every situation and I've been very well served by
that and there's still more growth that I can do
there but that's really something that I want for you
here so I want to share how you can do
that for yourself so how do we do that for
you well basically what we need to do is we
to unwire your logical serious attitude we need to make
you more emotional and more spontaneous less controlling of yourself
less self-conscious we also need to give you a more
relaxed internal state you cannot be humorous from an anxious
place you're not going to be very humorous if you're
depressed if you're angry all the time if you hate
your life so one of the deeper fixes for this
is to actually go improve your life so that you're
happier in your life happy people will naturally say funny
happier things right if you're seriously depressed you're probably these
these little tricks that I give you here might not
be enough to fix you you might need to fix
the depression first before you do that so you're relaxed
also if you're for example talking to a girl and
you're trying to say humorous things to a girl you're
going to find that you're going to lose all your
humor abilities if you're talking to a girl and you're
nervous to her because like you feel like oh my
god she's this hot girl I need to impress her
and all that kind of stuff if you have this
approach anxiety that they call it it's gonna be very
very hard for you to be humorous because in that
anxious state you're not relaxed enough to let the spontaneous
humor come through and humor the best kind is spontaneous
it's not canned material all the stuff I'm going to
be sharing with you here these are going to be
like a skill set that you develop so you're not
going to be using canned lines or funny jokes that
you read on the internet somewhere I'm talking about the
real skill of being humorous which is completely flexible and
adaptable and works in every situation for that to happen
we need to also remove your verbal filters this is
hard to believe but you have many layers of verbal
filtering going on all the time which prevent you from
saying the things that you really think and this makes
you non humorous this is very natural because we live
it we live in a society and probably you grew
up in a family where there are certain things that
you weren't allowed to say certain things that would offend
other people certain things that were politically incorrect or sacrilegious
or whatever maybe you even got slapped for saying something
you shouldn't when you were a kid and now basically
you've got all this filtering going on which prevents you
from being authentic prevents you from just being blunt and
it prevents you from being goofy and that's another thing
we need to work on is your willingness to be
goofy right so some guys one of the problems that
they have in something that I had is that like
you walk into the club and you're gonna have fun
with girls here and you're maybe going to try to
pick a girl up or something you know say something
funny but you walk in there with this kind of
attitude like you're James Bond like you're this cool suave
sophisticated untouchable uh like very masculine kind of dude and
you have no smile on your face you're kind of
robotic and you think that that's what girls are into
and you think that you can be humorous from that
kind of place but actually you can't the best place
to be humorous from is a goofy place imagine your
body being all loose like a monkey imagine a big
grin on your face imagine weird facial expressions imagine looking
silly imagine people looking at you and thinking that you're
a total goofball clown you have to be good get
comfortable with that image right because that involves you being
judged that means that there could be situations where you
might do something embarrassing or shameful or stupid looks silly
and you have to be okay with that and that's
something you have to kind of work through in your
mind right to be okay with that everyone has a
unique and natural sense of humor this is what I've
discovered I thought that like well maybe some people are
more humorous than others and while it's probably true that
some people are naturally a little more humorous and others
I think we all have a sense of humor the
problem is that most people have been kind of beaten
down by society and told no so many times and
we've been so serious and analytical for our whole lives
that we've lost touch with it so if you feel
like you don't have a natural sense of humor I
would I would just caution you not to jump to
a conclusion there and to limit yourself with that belief
leave the possibility open that maybe in fact even though
right now you're kind of a nerd and you're analytical
and you don't think that you're funny and there's no
history of you being funny in the past leave the
possibility open that you could actually develop into a really
humorous individual that's what I found I was able to
do in my own life it's really hard for you
to believe like it was for me that fear could
be stifle in you so much that you have lost
touch with your sense of humor your natural sense of
humor it seems like yes leo I mean I could
be afraid of certain things in social situations but am
I really so afraid that like I'm not this like
super witty super uproariously funny guy and the answer is
yes that's what I found is that actually yes that's
the case if we totally loosen you up like if
we took you out for a night on the town
and it was just like fun and rambunctious --mess for
eight hours straight and we got you drunk and we
just got you to do silly things and we were
doing in this very social context where everyone was approving
of you and everyone was cheering you on what would
happen is that you would be extremely humorous by the
end of that night simply because you have put yourself
into such a emotionally a playful place by the other
night that just like brilliantly likey you will be more
hilarious than a stand-up comedian it's quite shocking and you
can actually test this out and see that this will
be true but you know you can't always go through
that kind of process so we're going to talk about
some details now about the structure of humor what is
humor really why do people laugh this is actually a
pretty deep question and thinkers throughout history philosophers in fact
have actually asked this question since the Greeks and Romans
the the ancient and they've wondered like you know what
makes people laugh it's a pretty interesting phenomenon because as
far as I'm aware no other animal in the animal
kingdom laughs pretty interesting so why do humans laugh and
one prevailing theory that I like is that the reason
humans laugh is because it releases tension which is built
up right throughout the execution of the joke or whatever
the funny situation is so laughing is like a release
of tension and it's really interesting because laughing is not
a conscious behavior it's an unconscious behavior we can't really
control what's funny to us and what's not it just
happens automatically that's one of the beautiful things about laughter
is that you can just let yourself go and laugh
and have a great time but more practically how do
we create humor the way we create humor is by
setting up a situation where something unexpected or jarring happens
this is how all humor works so there's a certain
situation or context or someone is delivering some lines to
you of words and you're kind of expecting one thing
you're kind of being taken in one direction and then
in a split second there's the punchline and there's this
kind of reversal and expectations and it's like oh it's
not what I was thinking and it becomes funny to
you and you start to laugh to release tension that
was built up in that situation so that's basically how
all humor works now there's lots of different specific categories
of humor and I want to cover some of the
basics here and I want to give you examples so
I'm gonna give you examples across all these categories from
my own personal life so these were some of the
most funny moments that I can remember and I mean
I've said a lot of funny [ __ ] going
out a lot I've gone to a lot of nightclubs
spend a lot of nights going out and some nights
you know we're just terrible I was just awful but
then some of the stuff I said was just like
pure gold so I'm going to give you some examples
of that here all right so the first category is
what I call ridiculous this scenarios what this means is
that basically you come up with a ridiculous scenario and
you verbalize it to the person or group of people
that you're talking to and you can really take it
to ridiculous proportions in fact the more ridiculous the more
unexpected it is the more jarring it is and the
more funny it is so what are some examples of
this and by the way this is one of my
favorite categories because I think is one of the easiest
ones to work with so one time I remember I
was in a club and I saw this girl and
I was just in such a good mood I walked
up to her and I just immediately started talking about
something like this I said hey you know we would
have the most amazing children together in fact if we
had a baby girl I would tell her that she
should become a porn star or a stripper because she
would just be beautiful she'd be the most beautiful girl
in the world we would want to make her a
porn star and we had a baby boy he would
be an ass model on the cover of magazines known
all over the world for his beautiful ass so that's
an example for you right there and then I just
kept kind of going with it and making it more
and more ridiculous so as you can see in this
example I start off kind of plausible it's like we
would have amazing kids and that's that's already a little
bit presumptuous of me to say that to someone I
just met random stranger but then I just take it
to ridiculous levels and it becomes ridiculous especially when I
start talking about how a girl is going to become
a porn star right why is this funny because usually
when parents have a child and the child is beautiful
and it's a girl it's like they think that is
this little angel that they have and they want her
to be everything except a porn star so how funny
would it be if the parents actually wanted her to
become a porn star that would be hilarious so basically
that's kind of the the expectation I was playing against
in that example here's another example and this is a
slight twist on ridiculous scenarios and this is giving a
ridiculous compliment so let's say you're a guy and you're
talking to a girl you want to compliment her usually
guys would give up a corny compliment like hey you've
got beautiful eyes no that's that's that's that's very chumpy
instead give her a compliment like this and this is
one that I used and I got a really good
reaction one time I said oh my god you are
the cutest thing ever you are cuter than a baby
polar bear sliding down a rainbow into a pot of
gold over an emerald green pasture with a unicorn in
the background covered in rainbow sprinkles so that's quite a
mouthful but the point behind that example is that it's
a compliment but at the same time it's just so
ridiculous and over-the-top and every additional thing I say is
just even more ridiculous in the previous thing and it's
just you know you can't keep a straight face even
just saying that that line it's hilarious so actually when
I said that to this girl she she was laughing
so hard she had instead of talking to me she
actually ran off to grab her friend and she brought
her girlfriend over and asked me to repeat the compliment
to her girlfriend because she thought it was so funny
so I'm you know there you go just an example
right there another example and this is also a slight
twist is in more ordinary situations let's say you're not
at the club or calm chill situation maybe for example
you're with your girlfriend or even with your wife and
you want to be a little funny with her what
do you do well one time I was walking down
an aisle at Whole Foods and I saw these really
ugly yoga pants you know those yoga pants that they
sell at those organic food markets so I saw some
of those yoga pants there and this particular one just
had this awful pattern on it just totally hideous no
one would ever want to be seen with this so
I texted the girl that I was seeing at the
time and I said something like ha ha ha I
said something like oh I found you the perfect pair
of pants and then I texted her a picture of
those pants so again it was ridiculousness being played out
right so I actually take my time to look for
the ridiculous around me as I'm sitting somewhere if I'm
bored if I'm on a cell phone if I'm walking
through this Supermarket if I'm in a club if I'm
looking at a girl this is where I'm talking about
again training your filter to look for the ridiculous in
the mundane and this this takes a bit of practice
what's cool about is you can literally train yourself by
looking around you wherever you are and find something ridiculous
about the situation also what you can do is you
can just concoct ridiculous situations out of thin air right
so it doesn't have to be handed to you on
a silver platter you can just literally come up with
ridiculous situations just like like literally it's just like fantasy
you just come up and just keep adding more and
more and more and more to it kind of like
I was doing with the the baby polar bear sliding
down the rainbow and just kind of adding more and
more crap to it and it just became funny after
a while okay so the next category is role-playing this
is a powerful category what you do is you assume
a role as though you're an actor and then you
pick a funny role for yourself that you're going to
play so two favorite roles that I have that I
like to play is the Garrett the arrogant [ __
] or the arrogant King and the Deva so the
arrogant King is is a favorite of mine so basically
you walk into the place and you act as though
everything that comes out of your mouth is as though
you're the king or tyrants of this establishment so here's
an example of how this was go let's say I'm
in a club that means I walk in and I'm
a very cocky I hold this very cocky regal pose
and I walk up to people and I kind of
expect them to initiate conversations with me and kiss my
hand as though I'm this King right like they really
respect me and then let's say a girl starts talking
to me and I'm talking to her and I'm listening
to her and then when she's done talking I would
say very well you have done well my subject you
have earned the privilege to feed me grapes at dinner
time as naked women fan me with palm fronds from
this scorching heat that we're in so something like this
right you kind of act like you're this King and
like it's very cocky and arrogant but you do it
in this way where it's pretty obvious to people that
you're acting and that can be funny you can also
play the diva so a lot of times girls will
play divas especially hot girls they want everything done for
them and they they expect everything the best you know
they expect the best luxuries and they expect you to
treat them nicely and all this kind of stuff and
it's like nothing is ever good enough for them so
you can take on that role yourself and actually preamp
the girl so if you're with a hot girl and
you're a guy one thing you can do is you
can act the diva and everything she does like it's
not good enough for you and it's like no I
wanted better I want it faster I wanted bigger you
know like this like you're not satisfied with anything but
you do it in a playful way not in a
critical way and so that can be a fun role
those are just two roles you can come up with
many other types of funny roles and what's cool about
roles is that not only are you kind of like
making other people laugh but most importantly in primary is
that you're making yourself laugh in this role it's almost
as though you're being a rascal and you're playing pranks
on people you're just kind of walking around and you're
playing this role and other people don't even know that
you think that you're this King but in your mind
you know just for this next 30 minutes you're going
to be pretending and it's just kind of funny to
you how people react so that can be a cool
one another category of humor is self-deprecating humor this is
a classic one and it can be really powerful I've
got a really good example for this from my own
life so one time my buddy and I we went
to the Spearmint Rhino which is like a world-class strip
club here in Las Vegas where I live and we
went there we were just kind of hitting on the
girls and it was a slow Tuesday night and we
were cheap we didn't really want to pay for lap
dances so we would sit there girls would come and
sit on our laps and just kind of talk to
us try to get us to buy lap dances but
we were just kind of screwing around so I kind
of just decided to see how far I could take
it with a girl and just kind of attract her
you know let's try to attract a stripper without paying
or anything and so I'm you know sitting there thinking
like what can I say to make her laugh and
then and I was thinking like well guys always come
here try to impress these strippers because strippers are just
like gorgeous Spearmint Rhino has some of the most gorgeous
strippers you'll you'll find in the world and uh and
then it hit me and I'm like oh I know
exactly the right the right thing to say so she
comes over this asian girl comes over on my lap
she's beautiful girl and and I asked her so uh
you like guys with tiny penises right like guys with
really small dicks and she's like looking at me and
she's kind of like what I'm like yeah you know
I'm this guy um it was a really tiny dick
and I think you would really love me but tell
me something do you have a boyfriend and she's like
yeah and I'm like I'm you know I bet your
boyfriend is like one of those macho guys who like
goes to the gym has these huge biceps and stuff
you know I don't have huge biceps and uh and
I bet you're your boyfriend he has this huge massive
dick because I know how much you strippers love massive
dicks but have you ever considered dating a guy with
a tiny dick like don't you ever get tired of
getting banged by guys with giant dicks like I mean
it's fun at first but then after a while I
imagine that it gets kind of boring kind of annoying
in fact right wouldn't you like to meet a guy
with like a tiny micro penis like a little a
little nub of pee like a half-inch er well that's
what you got right here with me girl you don't
know what you're missing out on and so I just
keep going with this and so I'm basically combining self-deprecation
and ridiculousness and I'm just kind of like ramping this
up uh-huh by the time I was done with that
she was just laughing her ass off and she sat
there with me on my lab for like 40 minutes
just talking to me after that because it was so
hilarious and it demonstrated so much confidence for me here's
the trick with self-deprecating humor if you're going to use
it go really over-the-top with it because if you do
a little a little weak self-deprecating humor then people might
think like you're insecure about yourself but when you do
really obnoxious over-the-top self-deprecating humor it's so hilarious that actually
it makes you hyper confident because think about it from
the girl's perspective she's kind of expecting that this guy
he comes here he's not married attractive he probably wants
to impress her with how cool his car is or
how much money he makes or or how much business
he does or something like that how muscular he is
and you know how masculine he is so that's where
she expects now when I come in there and I
start telling her all you know the things about my
tiny dick like to her that's completely out of her
realice completely against everything she expected and that makes her
laugh a lot and it shows that I'm very confident
because I could sit there with a straight face and
talk about my tiny dick which is what nobody would
ever think of doing in a place like a strip
club so that's what made it work so try that
another category is blunt social commentary I'll give you an
example of this last last spring I was at a
meditation retreat and it was like this very intense four-day
workshop where we did a lot of very like deep
soul-searching work for meditation and enlightenment and you know we
shared a lot of our deep histories and stuff about
ourselves and our emotions and then at the end of
that whole thing we were sitting in a circle on
the last day and we were trying to just wrap
everything up and what was interesting about that situation is
that we weren't allowed to talk other than doing those
exercises so really we knew nothing about each other we
didn't even know our names and we didn't know like
where we're from or where we worked or anything about
ourselves so in a sense we kind of shared our
hearts and we spilled out a lot of private intimate
details but on the other hand we kind of didn't
even know the most basic things about each other so
we were sitting in that circle and we were about
to all leave we flew in from different parts of
the country and one of the women there she just
says oh you know I would really like to know
a little bit more about everybody here so why don't
we just go in a circle and everyone say their
name and say where they're from and maybe a sentence
or two about what they do and she said all
that kind of like offering it as a suggestion to
us and I sat there and immediately in my mind
the funny thing popped it because I was looking for
fun and my mind found the funny and what it
found funny was that I said this I said you
know I think we should just treat this whole thing
is a nice one-night stand so we don't want to
spoil it by knowing too much about each other and
when I said that the whole room just lit up
in uproar is laughter and they laughed for good 20
seconds like it was it was really contagious laughter and
the reason that worked because there was this this jarring
juxtaposition of this kind of like very green very hippy
environment that we were in we were sitting there very
quietly meditating and stuff like that and everyone was very
respectful and loving of everybody and here I bring sex
into the situation I bring a one aisle you know
a cheap dirty one-night stand into the situation I kind
of I just opposed those two together and also it
was like a authentic social commentary very subtly because in
a sense what was special about this workshop we went
through is that we didn't really know each other that's
what made it good we were kind of like strangers
and that's what makes the one-night-stand good is like we're
kind of like strangers right so it was kind of
true that people didn't really want to give out their
names and all their personal details to fill in all
the blanks we kind of liked leaving it open and
leaving the mystery there so that got a lot of
people laughing and actually my filter was on even more
and what I what I caught on to is that
some people are actually laughing so hard that it it's
like in my mind it's like oh those people really
know what I talk about what I want to talk
about here with the one-night-stand and it was so funny
because I could have immediately said and I didn't say
this but I could have said this it's like wait
a minute some of you were laughing way too hard
at that joke implying that they had a lot of
one-night stands when they were younger because this was this
was also a group of like 50 and 60 year
olds right so they usually don't talk about sex and
one-night stands that much so it was a really funny
situation that I could have made even more funny if
I wanted to because my filter was open and I
was looking for the funny and that's what I want
you to kind of learn from this example is like
if your mind is open it's looking for the funny
it will find the funny you just need to release
your filters and you also need to train your mind
to look for funny and at first that's difficult but
once you get it it's really worth it and it
becomes effortless that's by the way how that funny friend
that you have in class or that funny friend you
have at work that's so charming and it seems like
humor is so effortless to him how does he do
it exactly this way he didn't train himself he probably
did it just spontaneously but basically he learned how to
change his filter to always look for the funny and
not to then hold himself back from saying and just
blurting it out let's give you some more examples so
uh next category is random nonsense I love this category
you can literally just say random complete nonsense to people
and they will start laughing for example I've walked up
to girls and just opened with I have the most
amazing semen in the world you would love my semen
and I just say that with a straight face and
it's hilarious they start laughing and giggling because it's just
such random it's just complete random nonsense and I just
again I make it ridiculous by going over the top
with it um I remember one time two girls were
sitting at a bar and I was feeling a really
great playful mood so I just walk up to them
I just started the conversation with hey what do you
girls think about glory holes I need your opinion on
glory holes and I just started asking them about glory
holes out of the blue and it's like it's the
most ridiculous the most nonsensical conversation starter ever and it
works beautifully so this especially works well when you completely
completely remove all your filters this is also by the
way why when you're when you're drunk you can be
very humorous because your filters are removed by the alcohol
and by the way everything I'm talking about here was
said when I was completely sober I never drink and
in fact in all the hundreds of nights that I
went out to clubs talking to girls I virtually never
drank so this [ __ ] was said totally sober
in fact some of the things I said were so
ridiculous that girls would just assume that I'm drunk when
in fact I'm not which makes it even more funny
to me the girls don't know it but to me
it's even more funny okay let's move on to the
next category the next category is play on words so
if you're somewhat of a wordsmith and you have good
grasp of the English language or whatever language you're doing
your humor in you can make play on words and
the English language is really great for this so if
you have a strong verbal skill then this is one
route you might want to go what's an example of
this well let's say that a girl is telling me
something funny and I want to tell her something like
hey you're just absolutely ridiculous instead of saying you're absolutely
ridiculous I would say something quirky like you're absolutely ridonculous
you're a ridiculous donkey you're so ridiculous that you're redonkulous
something like that and there could be a a million
other examples that aren't coming to mind for me right
now but you get the idea with that one the
next category is breaking expectations and while I already said
that breaking expectations is kind of the common thread between
all humor here I mean a very specific thing I'll
give you two examples to illustrate this both of them
with with girls that I was kind of dating so
I was aiding this one girl I was seeing her
and we were having sex multiple times and then he
got to this point where it was almost like she
was getting this feeling that I'm kind of like using
her for sex and so she came to me one
one time at my hotel room and she's sitting there
on my bed and she's kind of a little bit
annoyed with me and she's she's kind of telling me
something so Solio you're like you're using me like I'm
just like your little [ __ ] you're using me
like a little [ __ ] and then she was
kind of waiting for a response from me and immediately
my mind saw the funny in this and the funny
was that she was so expecting me to go against
that and to start defending myself like no baby I
don't think you're a [ __ ] you're you're my
little princess I'm gonna treat you right like she was
expecting that for me so what I do you know
I decided to go completely against the grain on that
one so she tells me you're just treating me like
a little [ __ ] and I said yeah pretty
much with a little cheeky smile on my face and
her jaw just like Oh her jaw just drops like
it's shocking right pretty pretty blunt it's shocking but it's
also hilarious so then she starts laughing about and we
both start laughing about it's just funny it also kind
of diffuses the situation so that's one example of breaking
expectations another one also with the girl that I was
sleeping with we were actually kind of lying in bed
in the morning and we were just kind of like
talking [ __ ] you know the way that you
do and somehow we got on this topic of what
would happen if a bear attacked her and I would
have to come in there and rescue her and so
she tells me something like well so if a bear
attacked me then you would come in there and rescue
me and then she expects me to kind of chime
in there and confirm and say yeah you know I
would I would be your valiant uh knight in shining
armor I would come in there and I would beat
down this bear and save the damsel in distress that's
what she was expecting me to say but I saw
that in my mind's like oh don't do that make
it funny go against the grain on this one and
so she tells me so a bear attacks me and
you're gonna come save me and I say [ __
] no I'm not gonna come save you bear are
you kidding me bears are dangerous wild beasts all let
the bear work on you and I'll just run away
it's a [ __ ] bear you're talking about I'm
not going to mess around with the bear so I
went completely against the grain and again for a second
her jaw just drops it oh you did not just
say that like that's what she's saying it in her
mind but then she starts laughing we both start laughing
cuz it's so hilarious um and it's really good so
breaking expectations is huge in fact you could just walk
into every situation especially if you're talking to a girl
and you want to make her laugh everything she says
in your mind install the filter to say kind of
the exact opposite of what she wants you to say
break every expectation she has for how you should act
and that will make her laugh hysterically and the final
category I'm gonna give you is called physical humor so
sometimes you're lost for words you don't know what to
say you can just be goofy and funny physically funny
facial gestures sticking your tongue out Oh or making some
weird face just randomly out of the blue that's somebody
is hilarious sometimes one thing that I'll do is if
I'm in a nightclub you know in the nightclubs they
have these styrofoam sticks that have lights in them they
kind of light up and you can wave them around
a lot of times girls will walk around and nightclubs
with these sometimes what I do is I'll just grab
one of those sticks and I'll put it down below
my belt like it's my dick hanging out and I'll
just walk around with this big thing hanging you know
sticking out from from my belt and I just walk
up to groups of girls and I just do kind
of like a thrusting pelvis motion with this foam stick
and I just say stroke it stroke it you know
you want to stroke it and so I just kind
of like do this jerking off motion and it it
gets a variety of results half the girls are shocked
and offended and the other half of the girls are
laughing hilariously and and and a lot of girls will
come over start to actually start stroking it and sucking
it is hilarious so just like physical humor like that
which is uh usually context-dependent you can know you can
do that too so one key here that I want
you to understand is that humor is highly situational and
context dependent it's not like I'm walking in there with
a pre crafted joke that I'm going to say it's
not like a knock knock who's there joke and you
say something funny that's lame humor the best humor is
situational humor it's fluid and spontaneous and the only way
you can get that is not by memorizing canned lines
but replacing your filters when you have the funny filter
on when you're looking for the absurd the ridiculous when
you're looking for breaking expectations your mind will get good
at finding that stuff and then when you remove your
your filters for offending people or blurting stuff out or
looking silly then you'll just blurt stuff out and it's
going to come out funny so that's the whole key
to humor is those two things let me give you
one more powerful tip here I have a question that
you can use in your mind to help you unlock
the funniness in yourself unlocking the funniness here's the question
write this one down what could I say in this
situation to make it funny again what could I say
in this situation to make it funny write that down
and ask yourself that one question whenever you want to
be humorous you have to train your mind to be
asking that question all the time when you're interacting with
other human beings even in the most mundane situations like
maybe you're at a gas station and you're paying for
a bottle of water it's not funny at all there's
nothing absurd about the situation it's the most mundane situation
now in your mind if you want to practice being
humorous you ask yourself okay what could I say in
this situation to make it funny and you force your
mind to come up with something funny now here's the
trick when you first start doing this it's going to
seem very hard and it's going to feel impossible in
certain situations you're going to say something like well leo
is just a bottle of water at a gas station
clerk there's nothing funny about it that's because you're funny
filter isn't installed yet into your mind the funny filter
will get installed by asking the question and forcing your
mind to come up with answers it's a training process
what I found is that I literally had to rewire
how my whole mind works because usually my mind is
not looking for the funny usually I'm very analytical you
know I'm I'm doing some marketing or I'm writing some
some blog post or I'm shooting a video or I'm
thinking about some deep philosophical topic there's nothing funny in
my mind that's looking for you know for anything humorous
and when I do that for a long time I
forget that humor is even possible but when I force
myself to look for the funny over and over and
over again and it's hard at first eventually what happens
is that my mind starts finding the funny so now
we're getting to the portion of this program where I'm
telling you how to actually practice this this is how
you practice it this is why I said at the
beginning how bad do you want this skill if you
want this skill you're going to have to go through
the emotional labor of rewiring your whole mind the nice
thing about it though is that if you do it
once in your life then forever you're going to have
that ability to be humorous spontaneous it's a very powerful
ability so it's worth doing even though it'll take you
some months or years to do so let me give
you a few more tips on how to practice this
I always say this if you're really serious about it
you really want to fix this problem once and for
all in your life make it your mission for the
next 12 months to look for the funny in every
situation you possibly can everywhere everywhere with friends with family
with girlfriends with boyfriends with guy friends with co-workers everyplace
look for the funny your mind will get better at
it as you make that your mission and then you
do the following 3 exercises so exercise number 1 I
call it random sentence strings so here's what you do
for 10 minutes straight you set a timer sit down
in a quiet place alone by yourself and then for
10 minutes straight you're going to string together random sentences
using the last word in one sentence to then start
the next sentence so I'm going to give you an
example right now so let's start with a random word
first word that pops into my mind is water water
is delicious for fish I just made a random sense
in my mind now it sounds like a stupid sentence
water is delicious for fish I don't even know if
that makes any sense but I just blurted it out
with no filters so water makes no sense for fish
now fish is the last word in that sense I'm
going to use fish to start my next sentence random
sense fish smell like smelly vagina okay random just blurting
it out a random sentence I'm not trying to be
funny random sentence so now a vagina is the last
word in that sense so vaginas are designed to create
babies nothing funny about that but I just blurted it
out babies uh babies are stinky and loud nothing funny
about it I just blurted it out the last word
is loud loud nightclubs are annoying as [ __ ]
blurting it out [ __ ] and you just keep
going right so that's the process the key with this
exercise is that it's not so much teaching you how
to be funny but it's removing your filters those filters
that are preventing you from saying funny stuff you need
to get very good at just blurting stuff out and
not hesitating so this exercise will work great for that
so you're going to do this exercise every single day
for 10 minutes for at least 3 months straight and
if you're very serious do it for the next 12
months you're going to have huge gains if you do
this second exercise it's visualizations and affirmations I'm not going
to go depth into depth on visualization and affirmations because
I have whole videos that show you how to do
that you can go search for those but basically I'm
going to give you two visualizations and two affirmation statements
that you can use very powerful so how you're going
to do is like the following you're going to set
a timer for five minutes and you're going to sit
down and you going to do visualizations for five minutes
and you're going to visualize the following thing number one
is the following statement I see funniness everywhere I see
funniness everywhere you're going to close your eyes you're going
to visualize yourself going through every context in life at
work at home in the family at the nightclub seeing
funniness everywhere you can visualize that you're also going to
do five minutes more of affirmations of that statement so
I see funniness everywhere you're just going to say to
yourself in your mind I see funniness everywhere I see
funniness everywhere I see funniness everywhere for five whole minutes
okay and then the second statement is I am a
rascal it's a good one you're going to close your
eyes for five minutes are going to visualize I am
a rascal in every context of life picture yourself being
a rascal and enjoying it and then you're gonna do
five minutes more of affirmations I am a rascal and
you're going to say to yourself in your mind I
am a rascal I am a rascal I am a
rascal for five minutes straight you're going to do these
visualizations and affirmations for three months straight every single day
don't dismiss how powerful this is this is what reprograms
your mind very powerful and the final exercise is every
situation that you're interacting with other human beings you're going
to look for the funny scenarios in life everywhere every
single sentence that you hear from someone's mouth you're going
to ask yourself the question how could I make that
situation funny how could I turn what they said and
riff on it and make it funny and you can
actually really take this to the next level by practicing
on store clerks so if you really want to practice
this with a live human being what you do is
you go to a mall public mall go to a
department store at the mall like Macy's go to the
de cologne department where they have women or men selling
you stuff and you just start up casual conversation as
though you're interested in some cologne but then you ask
her some questions about where she's from and how she
got this job and you just sort a conversation and
then you look for the funny and everything the single
thing she says look for the funny and you try
to riff on it and make her laugh what's really
cool about that is that there's no pressure on you
and she has no expectation that you're going to make
her laugh and you're going to make her day better
by doing that cuz she's bored out of her mind
standing there for eight hours anyways and there's really no
risk to you in this situation so you can go
and practice that very easy for free you can also
practice with your friends and your family if you have
a girlfriend you can practice on her if you have
a wife you could practice on her I love practicing
this with girls that I date I'm talking to a
girl if I'm skyping with a girl because I have
a long-distance relationship or something literally I'm sitting there and
everything she's telling me over Skype I'm just asking myself
in my mind what's funny about that what's absurd about
that what could I say that would make her laugh
and my mind just gets better and better and better
at coming up with the [ __ ] until for
a few years it gets really good and the scales
tip the ship happens my filter changes now I've got
the funny filter on and I'm pretty humorous when I
need to be it's quite remarkable how flexible your brain
is and how much it will adapt and switch filters
here so believe in yourself as you do these exercises
I'm telling you that if you do this for the
next even just three months you're going to have significant
improvements and if you do it for 12 months you
might become extremely humorous the most humorous person in your
entire social circle is this is extremely powerful extremely powerful
stuff don't get tricked into thinking that these techniques are
very simple and kind of like lowbrow techniques you want
something more sophisticated you want more sophisticated forms of humor
know start with the most crass the most basic humor
and the most basic techniques here these techniques these visualizations
and the other stuff that I told you this will
take you very very far all right before I go
let me give you two important warnings warning number one
is do not use canned lines this will kill your
progress what you're trying to develop here is a skill
and a rewiring of your entire mind you're trying to
change these filters canned lines will not do this for
you if you take the examples I gave you here
and you just memorize them and you go up to
girls and you tell them you might even get a
few laughs here and there but you're not going to
develop real humor you're not going to become a humorous
individual you're going to become a line spouting robot and
in fact they're going to be nervous when you're spouting
those lines because you know what if I say that
line wrong or what if I run out of lines
and you will run out of lines and your lines
will also not be context sensitive you're not going to
have a line for every context so go for the
bigger picture goal you want to develop this skill is
a very powerful skill that you want to have in
life especially if you're a man so it's worth doing
the hard work to get it don't waste your time
so much on canned lines I wasted a lot of
my time memorizing canned lines and it didn't really help
me become humorous the way that I wanted and the
second warning I'm going to give you is you have
to come at this whole thing from a sense of
self amusement and not seeking validation so I'm not telling
you to go out there and become a clown for
the world because the world needs more clowns and because
the world needs more humor no you're not trying to
become a stand-up comedian nor are you trying to really
make other people laugh that's not your job what you're
doing here is you're developing this ability you're developing a
new attitude towards life you're going to see life in
a new way you're going to have more playfulness in
your life that's fundamentally what you're doing here is you're
building this kind of playfulness muscle because you're way too
uptight you're too serious that's why you're not humorous you're
not playful you're not letting yourself go it's almost like
you want to be drunk your whole life it's like
you're so loose when you're drunk imagine being that way
your whole life but being sober at the same time
it's not a paradox this can happen but you want
to come at this from a place of self amusement
so when you say something funny in a situation it's
not to get a laugh it's not to get people
to like you it's you expressing your joy for life
that's what it is seems subtle but it's an important
distinction so when you say things or do funny things
it's mostly to amuse yourself and if other people laugh
great if they don't who cares a lot of times
they'll be offended they will that's okay you have to
take that cost that's fine a lot of times they'll
think you're stupid that's okay a lot of times I'm
the happiest and I'm laughing the hardest on the inside
when I do something stupid and then people are laughing
at me and I'm kind of like laughing at myself
and I'm laughing at the fact that they're laughing and
it's just like it turns into is kind of like
cycle of self-amusement so it's not necessary even that other
people laugh at your jokes as long as kind of
you're amused on the inside and of course don't use
this as a way to to be mean to people
that's also not what I'm advocating here try to make
yourself amusement work in such a way where your self
amusing but you're not hurting others in the process it
is possible to do both you don't need to always
be amusing yourself at the expense of others right so
just keep all that in mind follow the exercises and
you're gonna have some powerful shifts in how you see
