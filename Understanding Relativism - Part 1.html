[Music] you understanding relativism part 1 welcome to this multi-part
series on relativism or relativity there's probably gonna be two
parts maybe a third part we'll see because there's so
much material to cover here and it's quite complex but
also I should tell you right off the bat that
if you're looking for an in-depth look at the physics
of Einstein's general relativity theory that's not what we're gonna
be talking about here today we're talking about relativism as
a sort of a as a philosophical topic and even
though of course Einstein's general relativity theory is one instance
of relativism and it's an important one and we will
be touching upon it it's not going to be a
deep dive into the physics of Einstein that's that's something
maybe we'll do in the future at some point but
what you have to understand about relativism and relativity is
that goes far beyond just physics there's many different kinds
of relativity and we'll be discussing many of those here
today so actually this topic is more foundational than any
kind of individual physical theory we're gonna be talking about
many different theories within science and philosophy and morality and
ethics so I'm really excited about this topic I've actually
been wanting to talk about it for for probably over
a year now I've been preparing my notes I've been
preparing my thoughts because this this is tricky to explain
it's very easy to misunderstand relativism really easy and this
makes this this this series complicated and really very advanced
so I just want to warn you to keep an
open mind as usual with these very foundational topics this
is tricky stuff easy to misunderstand and that's because it's
threatening two worldviews no matter what kind of world you
you have it's gonna be threatened by some of the
things that relativity reveals so just keep an open mind
think about this stuff critically for yourself don't just believe
me don't just accept it and hold on to your
objections I know you're gonna have a lot of objections
to the various things that I'll be saying that's natural
and normal and don't worry I got you covered at
the very end of this video there's gonna be a
lot of objections which we cover and we're probably gonna
cover some more in part two so let's begin a
one one more word of warning the argument somebody making
here are not going to be merely a rehashing of
post-modernism or cultural relativism as you find in many universities
and modern academia this goes way deeper than that and
there are important differences between the way that I'll be
presenting relativity versus post-modernism in fact there are some very
important points that post-modernism misses and doesn't understand and we'll
be touching upon those and especially in part one we'll
be talking about various limitations of post-modernism so let's begin
with sort of a foundation here we need a foundation
to work off of what is relativism how is it
understood within philosophy I'm gonna be reading you some quotes
here from various sources to get us just grounded in
what relativism is so here's the first one by Wilhelm
Krug he says relativism is quote the assumption that everything
which we experience and think including the self the idea
of reason truth morality religion etc is only something relative
and therefore has no essential endurance and no universal validity
and quote so that's a very good encapsulation of what
it is but let's go deeper a little bit deeper
if we turn to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy which
is a great resource for philosophy topics it's sort of
like the wikipedia of philosophy it says relativism and they
have a very good by the way they have a
very good page on relativism which has tons and tons
of stuff that i can't possibly cover all of it
they say the following quote relativism is the doctrine that
knowledge truth and morality exist in relation to culture society
or historical contact and are not absolute it goes on
to say quote relativism roughly put is the view that
truth and falsity right and wrong standards of reasoning and
procedures of justification are products of differing conventions and frameworks
of assessment and that their authority is confined to the
context giving rise to them relativists characteristically insist that if
something is only relatively so then there can be no
framework independent vantage point from which the matter of the
thing in question can be established end quote and it
goes on to say that relativism means quote that some
phenomena X whether its values epistemic aesthetic and ethical norms
experiences judgments and even the world itself is somehow dependent
upon some underlying variable Y for example paradigms cultures conceptual
schemes belief systems and language such that for example justice
is relative to local norms truth is relative to a
language game temperature is relative to the scale that we
use there are no universal criteria for adjudicating between differing
worldviews there could be more than one right way of
describing what there is and quote and lastly it says
quote one main traction of relativism is that it offers
a way of settling or explaining away what appear to
be profound disagreements on questions of value knowledge and ontology
and the relativizing parameter often involves people their beliefs cultures
and languages end quote and I should also add to
that list the biggest relativizing parameter which is states of
consciousness which this article on the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy
on relativism doesn't even address at all the biggest thing
so even though there's a lot of good points within
this article ultimately the things that we're going to be
considering he go away deeper than anything that modern Western
philosophy or post-modernism really understands about relativity it's tricky because
on the one hand we want to say we need
to say that everything that human beings know and believe
and understand about the world is absolutely relative all of
it is relative but on the other hand we also
need to leave room for the absolute absolute truth that
is not relative and this interplay between relativity and the
absolute truth whatever that is and I'm not explaining yet
here what that is because that's that's a whole big
can of worms that we're gonna be focusing on in
other episodes in fact I've discussed it in other episodes
it's not really important for the for the purposes of
this discussion but you need to leave room open for
the absolute so just keep that in mind now there
are different kinds of relativism there's social and cultural moral
and ethical epistemic and then the deepest version which is
the ontological and the physical so for example social and
cultural relativism would be things like you know different societies
and countries have different cuisines and different laws of course
and ethical and moral relativism would mean that depending on
which which era you live in there are different moral
standards different ethical standards and so you can't just say
there's one right one it depends on which era era
becomes a relativizing parameter see epistatic relativism is all about
knowledge differences in how we see the world how we
understand the world how we know the world so for
example there are different epistemologies science is one epistemology and
other epistemology might be religion or mysticism or voodoo or
witchcraft and and so on so there are different ways
of knowing the world which one is the best one
well who knows is there even a best one a
lot of people assume that there is a best one
a lot of people assume that there is a best
culture or a best ethical system or one absolute one
one that's absolutely true and all the other ones of
course are wrong this view I call absolutism absolutism is
sort of the opposite of relativism if relativism says that
everything is just up for grabs and is socially constructed
so to speak and is just subjective absolutism says that
no is just the opposite there's a hard external objective
physical reality there's a set of facts that's true for
everybody and then sure people can have different opinions about
it but they're just wrong if they don't got the
facts that's absolutism there's a lot of problems with absolutism
and also you need to distinguish between absolutism versus the
absolute or absolute truth this is true the capital T
these are two very distinct almost opposite things so when
I say absolutism I do not mean absolute truth I
mean a world view in which you think that good
and bad are objectively determined within reality and that you
believe that there's a hard set of common facts objective
facts that we all share and and then there's ontological
relativism or metaphysical relativism which actually goes to the physical
substrate of reality and what it says is that there
actually is not a physical world that's the same for
everybody and a lot of people have difficulty buying that
so so usually if you accept relativity you accept some
degree of it but you don't want to go too
far so the question for many philosophers is where do
you draw the line you draw it at social and
cultural relativism like do you accept that most people these
days would accept that different cultures have different cuisines and
customs and that there is no one best culture now
of course many people even struggle with that admitting that
there absolutists and they tend to be dogmas very closed-minded
so that's not a it's not a very sophisticated position
to to deny social and cultural relativism but still many
people manage to do that many conservatives and right-wingers take
that position then of course there's those who admit of
moral and ethical relativism that good and bad is just
a matter of perspective and of course the Conservatives and
right-wingers tend to reject that so you know people draw
that line I different places then then some people go
even further and they admit of epistemic relativism they say
well science is not the only way to understand the
world there's other epistemologies and science is not necessarily the
best one nor is logic and rationality necessarily the best
one maybe there's certain advantages to science but then certain
disadvantages as well maybe we'll discover some new epistemology in
the future so some people are as open-minded as admitting
that but then oftentimes and this that by this point
it's but almost everybody they draw a firm boundary between
all of those relative isms that I just mentioned and
then ontological and physical relativism so when it comes to
the actual physical world for example the earth do you
believe that the earth is a real object that is
objectively true for all beings or is it only true
for you or like only true for human beings or
only true if you believe in it so to speak
see most people would say no Leo the earth I
mean now you're getting crazy the earth you know that's
just hard facts man that's just reality I mean you
can't you can't say it the earth is just a
belief I mean maybe you might say that the earth
is flat around that might be a belief but but
that there is an earth you can't dispute that right
or can you see ontological relativism actually challenges that notion
that there is an objective world an objective earth that
you're sitting on right now is there some merit to
that you well we'll explore that in a minute so
which of these are true and which are false the
problem is that when they teach all of this to
you on in a philosophy classroom in some university or
when you read it online at the on a Wikipedia
philosophy page or on this Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy they
don't actually give you a clear answer they just kind
of like leave it open and then you're you're on
your own to figure it out well I'm gonna give
you a clear answer and the answer is that all
of them are true but not in the way that
you think so there's wrinkles here that are tricky to
explain and so we're going to be explaining here in
some detail so not only are all of those true
it actually goes way deeper than you can possibly imagine
the relativity way deeper the relativity in fact goes so
deep that it goes full circle and turns into the
pure absolute truth but you have to distinguish that from
your ideas being absolutely true so when I say absolute
truth I'm not talking about relativism as a worldview so
I'm not saying that relativism as a worldview is absolutely
true nor am I even saying that what I'm saying
here to you is absolutely true none of that is
the absolute the absolute is something beyond all of that
that grounds this entire conversation we're having and that grounds
all of human experience so what that is is is
mysterious and for now we're just gonna leave it as
a sort of a unknown variable just keep in mind
that it's there how do you know that it's there
well of course unless you directly become conscious of it
you don't know so you're just taking my word for
it for now but my claim is that you can
become directly conscious of the absolute and and you can
know it absolutely but of course until you do become
conscious of it you don't really know so as far
as you know from your position maybe I'm full of
[ __ ] maybe I'm deluded maybe I'm maybe there
is no such thing as absolute but then again maybe
there is so just keep your mind open relativity means
that you only know things compared to other things that's
the essence of relativity you can't know something as if
you were just an impartial objective observer looking down upon
the cosmos from God's point of view so to speak
that is not our position as humans here on earth
we are intimately involved with the process of understanding the
world we are not unbiased objective observers even when we're
being scientific even when we're being mathematical and hyper logical
we're still participating in this whole process of understanding things
of making sense of our life and we do this
process of making sense of life by comparing different parts
of life to other parts of life and this is
how we get a handle on what life is and
this is relativity so here are some basic examples of
relativity an elephant is large relative to a mouse how
do you know what large and small are other than
through comparing different parts of reality to each other see
that's how you did it when you were born you
didn't know what's small and large were you learn that
through experience by comparing different parts of reality now of
course this seems so obvious but you don't overlook the
obvious it's in the obvious where we really get tricked
this stuff is not obvious at all it's easy to
accept for most people that yeah they are I understand
that an elephant is large only relative to a mouse
and that actually is tiny relative to the entire planet
that's so obvious but just notice that as much as
you might hate relativism you will admit to this basic
example so you're already a relativist it's just a question
of where do you draw the line and what I'm
going to show you here as we keep going is
that the line itself that you draw is relative so
where you draw the line depends upon you depends upon
your worldview depends upon your experiences and your beliefs and
that actually there is no such line within reality some
more examples for you a triangle as we know from
geometry class adds up to 180 degrees if you add
up all three angles but this is only relatively true
if we are talking about geometry done on a flat
plane which is Euclidean standard geometry the kind you learned
in high school but then there are other kinds of
geometries if you do geometry on a curved surface depending
on how it curves the triangle will not add up
to 180 degrees C so we have to admit of
relativism within geometry or even let's take an even more
basic example you'd take a look at a glass that's
exactly 50% full but at the same time it's also
50% empty so which is it well it's both of
course in fact to say that a glass is half
full or half empty is actually identical but also at
the same time it's not quite identical because it gives
you a different flavor a different interpretation it means something
different in your mind whether you think of your bank
account for example as being half full or half empty
it'll give you different emotions it'll give you different motivations
about what you should do about that see and notice
what's interesting about relativism is that it opens us up
to the possibility that the what we might call the
quote unquote facts of the situation don't have to change
for our perspective on it to change significantly so how
the facts of the facts affect us how the world
affects us may not so much depend upon what the
world factually is but rather upon how you look at
it what perspective you take the Eiffel Tower is 1060
3 feet tall but this is not absolutely true this
is a relative truth depending upon the velocity at which
you're you're moving at when you're looking at the Eiffel
Tower so one thing that Einstein showed is that actually
the length of physical objects will change depending on how
fast you're moving and if you're moving close to the
speed of light as you're approaching an object let's say
you're flying towards the Eiffel Tower straight from the top
like from outer space down and the tower is standing
like this and you're flying down towards it but of
course you're very far away and maybe you're looking at
it through a telescope or some binoculars then actually what
you'll what you'll see is that the the length of
the tower will change and be different and so literally
according to Einstein the tower does not have a fixed
length there is no way that the eiffel tower is
it only is how it looks to you given your
frame of reference that you're moving at given your velocity
and given your relative position to the tower of course
given the towers velocity relative to you that's a very
twisted relativistic counterintuitive notion which we'll be talking more about
as we go here that's general relativity in a nutshell
another example is with science is science true many people
today would say yes Leo science is true it's proven
ah but not so simple you see science is true
relative to what it's relative to the past 21st century
science appears true it's more true than 15th century science
that's correct but today's science is gonna look so faulty
and wrong a thousand years from now in the 30th
century see so this is very important to keep in
mind because otherwise you fall into the trap of thinking
that science is just true all the time no sciences
is not true all the time science has many inaccuracies
and errors in it as we know from the past
if you've studied the history of science science has gotten
reality very wrong in the past and more so science
is still getting reality very wrong today it's just that
it's very hard for us to see cuz we're we're
sort of on the bleeding edge of the future it's
hard for us to see where science is misunderstanding reality
because if we knew where it was misunderstanding reality than
we would have advanced science by a whole generation but
of course that is what science is doing is it's
advancing itself every single day but it does so slowly
it creeps along so you can't tell where science will
go a thousand years from now or at least most
people can't some of us can so in this sense
science is very relativistic and also it's relativistic in a
sense that science is not the only way to study
and understand the world there are other methods which are
different from science and sometimes even superior to science a
lot of people are not even aware of this possibility
they think size is the only way they think science
has a monopoly on truth which of course it doesn't
so these are just some basic examples to start to
get you to understand what we mean by relativity of
course you can look around you in the world and
you can see thousands of examples of relativity for example
even when you just like go to a restaurant and
you sit down with your family some members of your
family will enjoy the food other members of the family
will hate the food it's the exact same food so
what change well of course individual tastes how people perceive
it changes and so that's what makes reality actually so
interesting is that there's so many different points of view
and perspectives that we can take on it it's so
relativistic that it really stretches credulity a lot of people
they deny this relativism by saying at all well at
those people are just wrong they're just stupid they're just
crazy or they they're just ignorant but that itself actually
is the ignorant and the deluded position so what you
really need to do to start to understand relativism is
you need to open your mind and really be willing
to to give credence to other people's points of view
such that you don't dismiss them too quickly otherwise what
happens is you become an absolutist and you think that
your position is the only right one and that all
other people are just deluded and of course this is
how you create a sense of reality that becomes very
important later but before we get into all that let's
let's go through some of the history of relatively a
relative it relativism especially within Western intellectual tradition Western culture
so let's rewind the clock two and a half thousand
years and go back all the way to the ancient
Greeks to the ancient Greek philosopher known as Anaximander whose
dates were 610 to 546 BC he was one of
the very very very earliest philosophers in the West really
thus a philosophy sort of began with him and his
contemporaries and he resolved a very interesting philosophical and at
that time scientific problem because remember back then philosophy and
science were the same field there was no distinction between
them so what did what was the problem he resolved
well it was a problem of the floating earth contrary
to what some people think the ancient Greeks actually knew
that the earth was globe that it was round and
for them though the tricky question wasn't whether the earth
was round or flat they understood that it was round
what puzzled them was how could around earth suspended in
empty space almost all ancient cultures assumed that the earth
rested on some support that it couldn't just float in
empty space because the assumption was that if it was
sitting in empty space it would fall down and of
course the earth isn't falling down because we don't feel
it falling down so that means it must be supported
by something this was the the way people thought back
then now look what you have to understand is that
this might seem silly to you that people thought this
way but you have to really put yourself in their
shoes and really look at it from their epistemic perspective
from their sort of veil of ignorance they didn't have
the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants and
visionaries and and great scientists and philosophers that we have
today you know we have two and a half thousand
years of hindsight and standing on the shoulders of giants
so so this was a real puzzle back then in
acts of manners time and he came up with the
solution for it and here was his argument here was
his great brilliant insight this was an insight equivalent to
Newton's insight about the Apple falling and being pulled down
by gravity this was an insight equivalent to Einsteins insight
about the nature of light and space and time and
his insight was very simple he said the following the
earth can sit unsupported in an empty void because it
is falling and it is pulled equally in all directions
and the only way he could have come up with
that line of reasoning is by realizing that up and
down are actually relative so something as simple as up
and down being relative which we all understand today at
least I hope so this was not obvious at all
to early humans because our direct experience is that there
is an up and there is a Down and all
our lives we live within this field this polarized field
of up and down and it just seems that objects
just intrinsically fall down and staying up is inherently difficult
and up is always that way and down as always
this way and no matter where you are where you
are on the earth that's true for you but then
of course if you think about a little bit deeper
you realize that well wait a minute if I'm on
the North Pole and up is this way and down
is that way and then if I'm on the South
Pole it has to be reversed see relativity that's the
only way the earth could be round is if that
relativity was true you could see how a lot of
people could refuse to accept that the earth is round
simply on the grounds that that means that up and
down are relative and their direct experience clearly shows them
and they have decades of this experience because you know
most people have not flown flown to different poles of
the earth especially back then there was no such possibility
so your direct experience was simply that up is that
way and down is this way and it can't be
otherwise you see the mind was locked into that paradigm
and Anaximander is great insight was that in a sense
earth is falling but it's falling in all directions at
once therefore it's sitting still see how it kind of
goes full circle very clever very clever bit of thinking
and of course that's exactly how it is and now
for us it's easy to accept this because we we
have watched a bunch of science-fiction movies and we know
we've had astronauts in space we've seen footage of those
floating around and true enough if you have a droplet
of water in outer space it just hovers like in
this very eerie way it has nowhere to go where
can it go see and that's very counterintuitive to us
and it's kind of spooky and eerie like if if
if I just snap my fingers and you found yourself
right now floating in the vacuum of outer space on
the International Space Station you would be really creeped out
by that because it would be so different than what
you've been used to your entire life and yet actually
that is the more true more general way of looking
at reality not this way that we live on the
planet because this is a very local portion of the
universe which hasn't up and down but most of the
universe does not have an up and a down you
see so up and down are only relative to this
context of being on this planet so that's an exome
and er one of the earliest examples of relativity and
really what I want to show you here is that
mankind's greatest developments scientifically philosophically and culturally over the last
two thousand years have often been discoveries huge landmark discoveries
of relativity and each time one of these discoveries was
made it was made by some genius brilliant visionary thinker
and then it was opposed by the majority of people
who were not visionary genius thinkers and then what happened
is that after many centuries of debate and controversy and
rejection finally people came around and accepted the truth of
relativity so here's other example is with Copernicus this is
exactly what happened with Copernicus when he proposed that the
earth is not at the center of the universe this
was a brilliant bit of relativistic thinking because at that
point the religious dogma and orthodoxy simply said that the
planet must be at the center of the universe and
everything else revolves around the planet of course this is
a very self-centered literally self entered way of looking at
the universe and of course that's part of the problem
is that every time that we're looking and making sense
of the universe is that we're looking at it very
self-centred Li and so we have to kind of step
outside of our own selfish agenda and selfish perspective to
see how it really is and so of course Copernicus
proposed this idea that the Sun was really more central
than the earth and and then later we found out
that even the Sun is not really the center of
the universe but just one one out of out of
millions of other Suns that exist and so that really
dislocated us from from taking any kind of central position
within the universe and this was opposed by the church
by the orthodoxy even by many scientists at the time
because it certainly doesn't feel to us in our direct
experience that the earth is moving it seems like everything
else is moving it seems like the stars are moving
planets around us are moving the Sun is moving but
the earth is not moving it's stationary from our point
of view but of course if you went and stood
on the moon for example you would feel the opposite
you would see the earth rotating around you would not
see the moon rotating to you the moon would feel
like it's at the center of the universe you see
and that's the essence of relativity is that it's actually
it's very difficult to notice the relativity because you're enmeshed
in the very thing that you're investigating it's precisely because
you're standing on the earth that it's difficult for you
to realize that the earth is moving see it's precisely
because you take a stance within your moral framework whatever
it is that is difficult for you to see that
your moral framework is relative and then moving on through
history there was the discovery of the Americas with Columbus
and other explorers and just try to imagine how big
of a relativistic shock this was to Europeans because of
course Europeans had other cultures like African culture and Islamic
culture and even Far East Asian culture from the Orient
and all that but generally European culture was sort of
monolithic and then imagine that somebody goes and discovers a
whole new continent a whole new set of continents a
whole new half of the planet that was basically missing
from our maps and from our understanding from our awareness
and think of what that must have been like during
that time to live through that it must have been
as radical as if we discovered that Mars was filled
with aliens and life and plants and we went over
there and started exploring it all it would be crazy
unbelievable stuff that would be making the headline news every
day and it would really disturb our sense of reality
because the kind of things that you would find there
you'd find new types of human beings practicing new types
of religions praying to new types of gods consuming new
types of food riding different types of animals having a
totally different cuisine different clothing different weaponry like so much
different languages think of how unsettling that must have been
because your whole life you grew up as like a
Catholic and you believe in a certain set of moral
codes and you you believed that you should eat certain
types of food and all this and then you let's
say you take a ship and then you you go
over to the Americas and they're just like you're in
an alien world see and are you going to be
open-minded enough to accept that their customs and and their
religion and their God that they pray to is no
better than your own that is just another one an
alternative one or are you gonna insist that actually well
yeah Leo I admit of course that there that there
are people and plants and animals living on the new
continent in the Americas but but my religion is a
superior one of course that's exactly what happened and so
there were religious wars and conquista doors and all of
this and Mission I work trying to to civilize the
heathens and savages of the Americas and then of course
you know in retrospect we look at that and we
see how myopic and closed-minded that was how ignorant that
was but this was just par for the course this
is how the human mind works if you were alive
at that time you would have fallen prey to those
same delusions and that that closed mindedness because hey you
know when you grow up your whole life in Europe
you don't know anything else you don't want to know
anything else you're scared of anything else because you know
if you have to go to the Americas and maybe
seriously consider that there God might be more true than
your God you see that relativize is your own religion
on which your entire identity is based that's very threatening
so of course you're not even going to want to
study their God because you're just automatically a student there
God is [ __ ] that's the problem with absolutism
that's also why relativism is so important because if you
take a relativistic perspective towards the whole world then you
don't get so wrapped up in your own personal dogmas
and beliefs your mind opens which allows you to explore
reality more accurately than you could otherwise during the same
time roughly speaking Magellan circumnavigate of the entire Earth actually
Magellan died before he succeeded in doing so but his
crew many of whom also were killed some of them
succeeded in actually making it all the way around the
earth it was a terrible journey very gruesome very actually
interesting to read about it I have a whole book
about Magellan's journey on my book list check it out
describes the whole ordeal eventually Magellan was butchered in the
Philippines he was actually a really cruel and evil person
and he was butchered for it by the by the
Filipino people by the natives probably rightly deserved because he
tried to convert them all with his absolutist ik catholic
stance but anyway is I digress my point about bringing
up Magellan is that when his crew went around the
whole earth they kept meticulous logs of every day of
their whole journey it took them years to sort of
navigate the whole thing finally when they got back to
Europe they realized that they were missing a day and
at first they thought well we must have like kept
our records wrong but later they realized no actually that's
because what day it is is relative to where you
are on the planet and actually if you take an
airplane and you fly all around the the earth you're
gonna either gain a day or lose a day depending
on which direction you fly around in it's kind of
a weird counterintuitive result that you think couldn't happen cuz
you would think like just common sense or it just
tells you that everyone on the planet he's experiencing the
same day like today is Friday I'm shooting this on
a Friday so today is Friday but not for everybody
on the planet it's Friday relative to me and people
who live near me in my country but on the
other side of the earth it ain't Friday it's already
Saturday or it's not even Friday yet see so it's
relative then of course after all this exploration around the
world started to happen we had to invent a new
system of time zones Greenwich Mean Time which means that
you know it's noon the notion of what noon is
is relative because it's noon at different times of the
day for different people around the planet depends on your
on your position around the earth so if it's if
it's noon here right now for me it's not for
many of you it's the opposite of that see relativism
noon is a relative notion but for many people like
you go back 2,000 years and try to convince somebody
back then that noon is a relative notion that would
be a tough sell to most people now some philosophers
might understand because they understand the earth is round but
your average person wouldn't understand this because their direct experience
contradicts that for them noon is the same for all
people you know Leo how come I'm able to meet
my friend for lunch at noon if noon is relative
well of course of course you're able to meet your
friend because you guys live so close to each other
that you can't tell the little differences but of course
if you're trying to coordinate lunch between you and someone
who lives in Africa or in Asia well good luck
doing that and you're not gonna be able to do
that with your with your simple absolutist ik notions of
what noon is so this actually becomes very practical this
is not just philosophy this affects how we live our
lives think about also cultural and religious relativity which sprawled
during this time because as the planet globalized and communication
and travel became easier and people were able to not
just live in one little town their whole life or
little village but are able to travel around and do
tourism and all of this you experience so many cultures
and different religions that you start to really question which
culture which religion is the right one it can be
freaky there's actually a phenomenon called culture shock where you
travel to a different culture and it's so radically foreign
and alien and weird to you that like it makes
you question whether like you almost feel like you're in
some surreal dream when you travel to some far-off country
because it's so different the customs are so different the
norms are so different the way people even say hello
or the way they bow to each other or the
way they eat their food like very simple little things
like you know in Asia they don't they don't have
Forks or they don't have table salt you know these
are just very things that you just take for granted
as a European or as an American it's so different
there you know go go to Japan and see what
that's like you're gonna be in for some serious culture
shock see so all of this makes you question your
reality you come back home and you start to wonder
hey you know is it really right that we don't
bow to each other maybe why don't we bow maybe
that's the better way to live life is where people
bow to each other or maybe you think it's the
opposite you know certain cultures eat certain animals that other
cultures would be horrified at eating whether it's insects or
cows or giraffes or whatever see all of that I
want you to understand it's not merely that it's like
oh yeah it's kind of weird and alien it's kind
of doesn't feel comfortable it goes way beyond that really
what's happening when you're experiencing these different cultures cuisines and
religions and so forth you're experiencing different perspectives and you're
actually coming face to face with the relativity of reality
and this is a threatening notion to you because your
entire way of life and survival is based upon a
certain environment you've been living in and it can be
difficult to admit that survival is very different in different
parts of the world people survive in very different ways
you see and then you come back home and you
realize that wait a minute what am I even doing
why am I even going to this diner five job
while I am ieaving sitting in this cubicle working for
this person doing the things that I'm doing why am
I even going to school right it really makes you
start to question not just your life but if you
take this deep enough you'll actually start to question your
reality what's real and that's when this stuff gets really
serious and of course that's precisely why people are so
against and so reactive to relativism because they don't want
to go down that slippery slope because it's it's a
slippery slope and watch out because you might slide off
you might slide off the entire world if you go
deep enough think about the development of the US Constitution
that was a radical achievement for mankind because it guaranteed
religious pluralism freedom of religion nowadays we think oh well
what's the big deal that's so obvious it wasn't obvious
back then it wasn't obvious when 99% of people were
out salutis and they were either Catholics or Protestants and
that's all they were and they knew that they were
right and everybody else was wrong it was extremely counterintuitive
to create a new society and enshrined to its very
fabric freedom of religion because this opened the floodgates to
relativity and back then people were theocrats the governments of
that time they were ruled by some Pope or some
divinely anointed monarch who justified his rule because he was
some son of God or even literally God himself or
came from some divine lineage like the Egyptian pharaohs and
so forth and so there was no possibility of another
religion this was this was crazy this was insanity to
say that there could be two religions and that they
could both be equally right this was insane see but
nowadays this is rather normal now of course many people
still reject this a lot of people actually and especially
it was ironic about it is that many conservatives and
right-wingers if they are religiously oriented then they tend to
be absolutist ik about their religion and so even though
they defend the constitution and they say that they love
the Second Amendment and they love the free speech and
all of this and they want to preserve that as
traditionalists but actually they don't understand religious pluralism that the
Constitution enshrined they actually want a theocracy they want America
to be a Christian nation of judeo-christian nation and then
they come up with arguments for why why it was
that way at the founding right because they don't understand
the value of religious pluralism and even if they do
even if they admit and they say well Lee okay
fine let's allow the Muslims to to go to their
mosques and let's allow the Hindus to do their Hindu
stuff but Leo that I mean they're still deluded everybody
knows Christianity is their one true one so we're only
allowing those other people to believe what they want to
believe simply because we just want to like humor them
and we don't want to piss them off but really
we know we all know that judeo-christian values are the
right ones right you see it still hasn't sunk in
what religious pluralism and relativity really means when you really
understand that your own religion is not absolute this is
a this is a huge paradigm shift for human beings
in their cognitive development this is where you shift from
Spile dynamic stage blue to orange and the constitution was
a stage orange revolutionary invention it wasn't a stage blue
invention the way that theocrats and fundamentalists and evangelicals sometimes
want it to be it was a very radical evolutionary
development at that time and many people opposed it because
they were absolutist a little bit later in our history
we have the development of Euclidean geometry or actually maybe
it was a rough roughly around the same time as
the Constitution was written roughly speaking non Euclidean geometry was
discovered by Carl Gauss and others at that time and
what they discovered is of course that the classical geometry
of Euclid from ancient Greece as brilliant as it was
you know Euclid outlined all the postulates and axioms of
geometry and he was very rigorous in outlining all these
and it was just assumed that geometry was done set
in stone geometry just is absolute until of course we
started questioning a little bit further than we realized that
all of Euclid's proofs and axioms and and conclusions they're
all true relative to a flat plane but on a
sphere it ain't true anymore on some saddle-shaped surface that
ain't true if we're talking about a four or five
or 10 dimensional gmh object it doesn't behave according to
Euclid postulates and ideas so entirely new geometries had to
be invented and that led to huge scientific and philosophical
revolutions and then of course a little bit later in
the early 20th century we had the development of quantum
mechanics and this was a huge relativistic breakthrough many people
still don't understand the significance of quantum mechanics and what
it really means as far as relativity goes so the
reason that quantum mechanics was relativistic was because what it
showed is that measurement is not an absolute but that
measurement is entangled with the actual measuring instrument so before
quantum mechanics what we assumed is that if I just
take some physical object and I start measuring it I'm
measuring the actual physical object and there it is and
my measurements are just objectively true but what happened was
when you started to bore deeper and deeper and deeper
into reality itself the very guts and fabric of it
you started to reach the point where it became impossible
to distinguish the measuring instrument that you're using and the
thing that you're measuring and that they are actually at
at all times entangled because you cannot divide the subject
from the object you're not some impartial observer so when
you're taking a microscope and you're looking at some molecule
in that microscope the actual photons of the microscope are
affecting the molecule you're looking at and it's changing your
measurement so you can never say how an object actually
is what you must say is you might say this
is how object X appears when viewed through method or
object Y and there is no such thing as a
particle a particle is something you see when you look
at an object a certain way so it's not that
there's a particle over here and then some measuring instrument
over here no no no what a particle is is
entangled with any measuring instrument that you're using which is
what generates the particle otherwise what you have is you
just have sort of a quantum soup an indefinite indistinct
quantum soup a sort of infinity from which the particle
must be drawn out using some method of observation so
this was very counterintuitive spooky and paradoxical and a lot
of people didn't want to accept it a lot of
people still don't want to accept it a lot of
scientists still don't accept this even quantum physicists who are
working in advanced universities today still do not accept the
epistemic and metaphysical implications sure they accept the results but
they don't like the lab results they accept that but
they don't accept the metaphysical and epistemic implications of what
I'm saying here and of what the early founding fathers
of quantum mechanics realized what Niels Bohr and others like
him realized and if you want some more details on
that I have a multi-part series two part series called
quantum mechanics debunks materialism where we go into this in
a lot of depth and I actually dissect and give
you quotations it's very in-depth so go check that out
if you're really interested a lot of people still argue
with me tell me that I don't understand quantum mechanics
because that I'm presenting it in a relativistic fashion and
then in fact Leo quantum mechanics never really demonstrated relativism
that's simply because you you don't really understand the metaphysics
and the epistemology of quantum me you haven't thought about
it deeply enough yet it's extremely radical stuff and even
though some scientists do understand it by and large the
implications the metaphysical and epistemic implications of quantum mechanics have
not percolated through into mainstream culture people still generally believe
that the world is man of particles that particles exist
independently of humans and measuring instruments and then we can
just talk about particles you can't just talk about particles
this has been debunked for over a hundred years yet
most people go around and keep talking this way why
is that because it makes no practical difference within the
very limited context that they're living in but actually it
does make a practical difference you're just not aware of
how the way it makes a practical difference is that
it solidifies your worldview into some materialistic worldview some sort
of absolutist ik worldview and this actually affects your ability
to investigate reality and to discover who you are and
to self-actualize which is why we're talking about this all
this connects directly back to your own personal development you're
not able to go deep enough in personal development unless
you understand relativity because you get stuck in some absolutist
worldview perspective like you start to believe that you are
a physical body and you never question that it never
occurs to you that that could be a relativistic notion
but we're getting there let's not get ahead of ourselves
continuing on with the history of course we had soon
after quantum mechanics or even roughly at the same time
Einstein's general relativity where Einstein showed and proved and this
was borne out by many different experiments that time space
motion and length are all relative so literally like I
said with that Eiffel Tower example the length of an
object depends on your speed and your frame of reference
to that object there is no such thing as absolute
space in the way that Isaac Newton fought there is
no absolute motion think about house if acanthus is people
still don't understand how significant and how radical Einstein's discoveries
were sometimes people argue and they say well Leo Cole
relatives what are you talking about relatives relativism good and
bad morality can't be relative man but even time and
space and distance and length and motion have already been
proven to be relative for over a hundred years this
has been demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt and
yet you still cling to some absolutist version of your
culture as being superior or your religion as being superior
or your morality your your notion of good and bad
is being absolute like you're not thinking about this at
all are you time does not exist space motion distance
does not exist but see it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter because in your everyday experience which is the thing
that drives your whole worldview it doesn't matter you don't
care about the truth you don't care about what's real
you don't care about facts what you care about is
your perspective and how it allows you to survive that's
what you care about you care about your ego and
your entire sense of physics and reality is completely serving
your survival you get this almost nobody gets this even
scientists who should know better they still don't get it
they get it theoretically but they don't actually get it
in their own life they don't get how significant it
is they haven't allowed it they haven't allowed this knowledge
to really transform their everyday consciousness so in this sense
science is very stuck even still today people are in
denial about it and notice that all throughout history the
name of the game is denial every time some new
relativistic development happens whether it's a discovery of the Americas
or non Euclidean geometry there's always a large contingent of
people which deny it demonize it attack it reject it
ridicule it and even harm an attack violently attack those
people who are putting forth these discoveries right because your
worldview is at stake and not just your worldview but
your very life is at stake because your life in
your world you are inseparable you and your world you
are inseparable you are your worldview you don't just have
a worldview you are your worldview I want to read
you a quote from Leonard Susskind who is a modern
world-renowned scientist who understands relativity and of course quantum mechanics
he said quote Einstein in the special theory of relativity
proved that different observers in different states of motion see
different realities and quote yeah do you understand the significance
of that quote that's a huge thing to admit a
huge thing to admit and by the way even though
Leonard Susskind it's a great scientist otherwise and of course
understands many of these things and he said this quote
he still doesn't understand the full extent of relativity that's
how deep this stuff goes so be very very careful
alright I'd be very very careful I want to warn
you about thinking of relativity in overly simplistic terms it's
very easy to strawman relativity it's very easy to come
up with some childish notion of relativity which then just
you know breaks apart upon just considering a few examples
relativity is very twisted and complicated and it's not easy
to understand it's not easy to explain and you're not
going to understand it simply by listening to me talk
for a couple of hours this is a good start
but you're very far from really understanding what relativity truly
means so let's keep going let's complete our history here
around the same time as quantum mechanics and general relativity
there was also the discovery of multiple different types of
logic for millennia and for centuries it was assumed that
Aristotelian logic is the only kind of logic it's a
very binary linear form of logic and then it was
discovered that actually there are an infinite number of different
types of logic so of course that relativized logic there
was no longer one true logic there was also the
development of Quinn's ontological relativism roughly around the same time
as Einstein a philosopher analytic Western philosopher by the name
of Willard Klein who I talked about in the past
some of my epistemic oriented episodes he came up with
several papers which outlined and explained ontological relativism literally what
he said is that if you have two human beings
from radically different cultures trying to communicate with each other
or let's say a human and an alien and we're
trying to communicate with each other our language in our
world view is so entangled with our ontology and what
we think of as our physics that it becomes inseparable
and it becomes impossible to actually discover what the ontology
of the other person is without fully becoming that person
because our language is infested with ontological assumptions and so
when an animal is running by let's say you can
point to that animal and you could say well that's
a cat and you might say well but that alien
could also point to the animal and also say well
that that's a cat and so we can agree on
that you know I might say cat the alien might
say Boop that's the word he uses let's say for
cat and bye-bye that we both mean cats so what's
Leo what's the problem I mean we can agree on
this stuff this is not complicated but actually it doesn't
work this way what Klein showed is that it's much
more twisted because how are you gonna determine what Boop
refers to within the aliens paradigm just because he points
at that thing that you call a cat and says
Boop does not mean that you can say that he
has the same notion of a cat as you do
because for you when you point at and you say
cat you mean well it's a it's this creature with
four legs and it's runnings got a tail it's got
fur it's got all this sorts of stuff and it's
an object and it exists that's what you mean by
cat but to him what he points that and he
says Boop what he might mean is the the motion
of fur through space for example so you might be
thinking of that cat as an object that exists permanently
within space the alien might be thinking of that cat
as a verb for example as fur through space as
a process not as an object and that's a that's
a significant metaphysical ontological difference and what what Quine basically
showed is that there's never gonna be a way for
you two to reconcile that and to fully understand each
other the only way you can really understand what this
alien means is if you grew up in his culture
and learned all of the norms and ways in which
these aliens think about cats and animals in the world
and so in this sense literally we've got a version
of ontological relativism where the actual physicality of things changes
then in the middle of the twentieth century there was
an enormous development within science based on the work of
Thomas Kuhn who came up with the notion of a
paradigm I've talked about this in my episode called I
believe it's called how paradigms work Google actualized our own
paradigms and and you'll find it is a very important
video where I talk about Thomas Kuhns word and basically
what he discovered from studying the history of Sciences he
discovered that science the way it works is it works
through paradigms there is no such thing as one objective
science there are different paradigms within science different competing worldviews
so to speak these paradigms are actually on two on
two logically different and epistemic ly different they're just like
different world worldviews different ways of looking at the world
and doing science in different ways and so there's always
competing paradigms within science happening at all times and there's
always like a prevailing paradigm and those paradigms need to
be subverted and then challenged and the new paradigms are
introduced and so this is a whole process by which
science evolves it's much more messy and complicated than people
think and it's much more relativistic and in fact Thomas
Kuhn introduced the notion of what's called incommensurability which means
that if I have my worldview and you have your
worldview we're never gonna be able to fully reconcile our
two worldviews which is just sort of basically what I
was explaining with the cat example it's like that now
of course Thomas Kuhn later was was shocked that his
work was used in order to defend various radical versions
of relativism and he he distanced himself from that but
actually Thomas Kuhn did not understand his own discovery of
paradigms he didn't understand how radical paradigms really are he
didn't fully understand what relativism is and so in this
sense he rejected it prematurely that's because how that's how
tricky this stuff is right so world class philosophers and
scientists and thinkers and intellectuals they still misunderstand this stuff
so I can be very very very careful here so
literally what Thomas Kuhn was saying was that depending on
which scientific paradigm you're using to look at a problem
and out the world he wasn't just saying that we
have different world views he was actually saying that the
things out of which the world is made actually change
when a scientific paradigm changes that's pretty radical and a
lot of scientists they don't want to admit this because
they believe in a material objective external world that's independent
of them but as quantum mechanics show there is no
such a world you're always interfacing with the world so
really there isn't a world and a scientist or a
world in a world view the scientist is the world
the world view is the world then relativism went full
bore in the second half of the 20th century with
developments within linguistics structuralism post-structuralism and post-modernism this is a
deep topic that I don't have time to get into
I have an older episode about Jacques Derrida and deconstruction
and about post-modernism and about language go check it out
it's a it's a pretty good episode very in depth
about what post-modernism is about and I'll be talking more
about post-modernism in the future and various limitations of post-modernism
but basically what happened was in in that late 20th
century relativity became so obvious to academics because the world
became so globalised and so interconnected that we could no
longer seriously as an academic you could no longer seriously
maintain that one culture was superior to some other culture
or that one worldview was superior to all other worldviews
it just became untenable for social scientists to think this
way they had to adopt a position of of relativism
and then of course that that was easier to do
in the social sciences and the softer Sciences and the
humanities and it was in the hard physical sciences so
a lot of hard physical scientists still rigidly cling to
a materialist reductionistic worldview where they insist that everything can
be just boiled down to hard physics into particles but
as we've seen there are no such thing as particles
so what are you boiling it down to you can't
even do that you can't even do that and then
there was of course relativism acknowledged within sexuality and within
gender which is what we're seeing now and of course
a lot of people react against this negatively traditionally oriented
people they react very negatively when you tell them that
sexuality or gender is relativistic they don't want to admit
that male and female is relative they don't want to
admit that homosexuality is just as normal and is just
as naturalness heterosexuality that there's different different things even just
beyond male and female and and all this right so
this is all this is all sort of the history
of relativism and of course there's many examples I'm leaving
out because it's long enough as it is but what
we can see here is that really the 20th century
the last century was the century of relativism there were
so many relativistic discoveries within quantum mechanics logic linguistics philosophy
history of science the humanities the social sciences like man
you had the psychedelic revolution which just poured gasoline on
top of all that sexual relativism gender relativism religious relativism
Wow that's a lot of stuff it's a lot of
stuff so sometimes conservatives rail against academics and colleges and
universities for teaching relativism and that this is destroying the
fabric of society the you know good old Christian values
yeah of course it is of course it is relativism
is like an is like acid hydrochloric acid poured upon
one's worldview it's it's deconstructive destructive and people of course
react very negatively against this but what you discover the
deeper you study reality is that more and more of
the thought the stuff you thought was absolute you discover
is actually relative and this is very unnerving and of
course this is why universities have led these relativistic revolutions
and movements and they are a force they are a
cultural force which is relativizing culture which a lot of
people find frightening and threatening but it has to happen
in universities because universities are sort of at the forefront
of human knowledge and they are dealing with like the
cutting edge of discovering new stuff the cutting edge of
science the cutting edge of understanding and so for them
it's untenable to take an absolutist position really on anything
because you will simply be proven wrong and eventually you're
gonna lose your professorship if you take an absolutist position
because eventually your ideas and theories will simply be debunked
or disproven you won't be able to write good research
papers you need to be very careful and relativistic as
an academic a to qualify everything you say you got
it confine it within a context you can't just say
that such and such is true absolutely you got to
say it's it's true in such in such a situation
under such and such conditions when measured in such and
such a way to such and such people from such
and such a perspective this would be very nuanced academic
way of conveying a truth and even then that often
doesn't go far enough so relativism is necessary to explain
the diversity of perspectives cultures social norms epistemic schemes and
ontology and paradigms that are found throughout human history and
all around the world so relativism is inevitable you can't
keep this thing bottled up because it's actually coming deep
from within science science in a way is actually undermining
itself because science began as a sort of absolutist ik
project but then the more and more you did science
the more you discover that no this isn't right it
doesn't hold our experiments don't support this whether it's experiments
within quantum mechanics or within cosmology or within astrophysics or
within biology or sociology or psychology anthropology history it doesn't
hold and Western culture has been very absolute istic for
for 2,000 years and and then you know the that
dam was slowly eroded eroded roted until now is starting
to burst and of course would that come a lot
of challenges but now let's contrast that was all Western
tradition now let's contrast that with Eastern culture in the
East actually they were not absolute istic for as long
as the west relativism was a important feature of Eastern
philosophy for a very long time for thousands of years
in fact I want to introduce you to one very
important piece of that which is the concept of on
account Avada it's a bit of a long word on
a cantata it's the Jain notion of many sidedness and
I love this notion this is such a powerful concept
I almost wish I could shoot a video just on
this notion alone literally it means no one perspective ISM
no one perspectivism that's on account of and I want
to now quote to you what this means from Wikipedia
it says quote the origins of anekantavada are traceable to
the teachings of Mahavira who used it effectively to show
the relativity of truth and reality let me pause there
a Mahavira was an early enlightened sage I think he
actually predated the Buddha but just think of him as
a-- basically has another buddha so going on quote according
to Jainism and of course Jainism was founded upon mahavira's
teachings no single specific statement can describe the nature of
existence and the absolute truth all knowledge claims must be
qualified in many ways including being affirmed and denied reality
can be experienced but it is not possible to totally
express it with language human attempts to communicate is called
nya the word nya which translates as partial expression of
truth language is not the truth of the capital T
but it's a means and an attempt to express truth
spiritual truths are complex they have multiple aspects language cannot
express their plurality and yet through effort and appropriate karma
they can be experienced no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can
be true if it is asserted without a condition or
limitation all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways
because reality is many sided and it goes on to
say quote all of the following 7 predicates must be
accepted as true for a cooking pot so imagine an
ordinary household cooking pot usually we would say well that's
just a physical object it's obvious what it is so
what can be relativistic about it well here's how Jainism
and Mahavira would look at it they would say firstly
quote from a certain point of view it can be
said that the pod exists from a certain point of
view the pot does not exist from a certain point
of view the pot both exists and does not exist
from a certain point of view the pot is inexpressible
from a certain point of view the pot both exists
and is inexpressible from a certain point of view the
pot both does not exist and is inexpressible and finally
from a certain point of view the pot exists the
pot does not exist and also it's inexpressible & quot
I absolutely love this to me this is this this
notion of anekantavada is one of the most important notions
in your entire attempts to understand reality and there's a
reason for that of course and the reason that Mahavira
understood this is because he was enlightened and that's really
the only time that you'll fully appreciate what relativity means
is when you become enlightened but nevertheless you know you
got to start somewhere so let's start here can you
see how on account Avada works can you see how
important it is and can you see how different it
is from the way that most people treat life most
people in life what are they doing they're debating they're
arguing they're trying to advance their position they take absolutist
stances and they say no reality is this way and
then somebody else says no it's that way and then
they argue and they debate whether it's science or morality
or ethics or even spirituality this happens what people don't
see is the meta point the meta point is when
you zoom up from all that and you look upon
what's really going on why do people have such radically
different perspectives of the world like totally different not just
a little bit different totally different how is this possible
and the ultimate answer is on account of odda many
sidedness because the nature of reality itself is that perspectival
and relativistic it's not one way as we tend to
assume of course the other great contribution from Hinduism and
perhaps from Jainism is the the parable of the five
blind men and the elephant which is a really beautiful
metaphor for explaining a lot of conflict and contradiction between
different human paradigms this is an ancient story from from
India which basically goes like this there were five blind
men and one giant elephant and they all were feeling
it one blind man was feeling the the tail another
one was feeling the leg another was feeling the side
and other was feeling the ear and those feeling that
the snout and and each one started to explain what
an elephant is to the other ones and they all
started to explain it from their own direct experience you
know so the one holding and feeling the tail he
said it's like a rope the one feeling the leg
he said it's like a tree trunk the one feeling
the side says it's like a wall the one feeling
but ear said it's like a curtain the one feeling
the snout said that it's like a snake and then
they all started arguing and fighting with each other and
they could never agree about what an elephant is and
of course the elephant in this case represents reality itself
and each blind man represents just a person and so
every time we start to have a conversation about what
reality is every one of us because we're only experiencing
a tiny tiny portion of the whole because reality is
so huge and fast and actually it's literally infinite because
reality is literally infinite you never have the whole even
if you did have the whole you couldn't communicate the
whole because the whole is the whole how do you
communicate the whole to the part you see and so
this becomes a very deep epistemic problem how do we
teach and discuss what reality is when each one of
us is like one of these blind men feeling this
giant elephant and this in a nutshell explains so much
it's such a simple metaphor but explain so many deep
problems that you see within life it helps you make
sense of reality so much that's why I love these
concepts of anekantavada and this parable of the elephant and
the blind men so what you got to understand is
that each side of a debate is always part right
part wrong and also always incomplete to every metaphysical question
there are many right answers reflecting many facets and degrees
of the one absolute truth which is the whole of
reality the absolute truth is the whole of reality it's
the elephant so the elephant is there but what the
elephant is is the sum total of all the views
and so really the blind man they're not really separate
from the elephant they are part of the elephant so
all really maybe even a better metaphor would be that
like the elephant's tail was trying to communicate with the
elephant's leg was trying to communicate with the elephant's ear
and its snout and each part would try to argue
with each other and fight with each other and tear
itself apart the elephant will just literally kill itself tearing
itself apart not understanding itself one part trying to outdo
the other parts without realizing that it just is the
entire thing see made out of different parts so that's
why this stuff is so tricky and of course specifically
this metaphor explains why there's so much controversy within spirituality
within religion and even within non duality even within Buddhism
even if you take one sect of Buddhism you'll discover
so many different perspectives and world views on that sect
of Buddhism people still don't agree have you ever wondered
why this is the case have you noticed this is
a deep universal problem across all human endeavors is that
people disagree with each other so much and they they
hold different world views even if people have the same
worldview they still disagree with each other because in the
end their world views might be similar but they're not
identical so who's right and who's wrong well the mistake
is thinking that one of them is right and the
rest of them are wrong that's the mistake the correct
way to look at it is that each one of
them is pointing out some part of reality misunderstanding it
deeply and then reporting it in an incomplete fashion and
that's why we have this crazy mess and it's so
difficult to understand reality going on I have another quote
for you this one is now from Paul Bogosian and
he says quote the relativist about a given domain D
purports to have discovered the truths of D involved an
unexpected relation to a parameter and quote so for example
it is wrong to enslave people we might say that
and many people would look at that and say okay
that's that's true that's true but actually it's not true
it is wrong to enslave people relative to 21st century
norms that's more true because it's also true is that
it's okay to enslave people relative to ancient Roman norms
so who is correct are we correct in the 21st
century or where the ancient Romans correct the mistake people
make is they say well the clearly ancient Romans were
uh neva l've dand they were barbarians and we've had
time to think it through and Leo we finally come
to the true conclusion which is that everyone knows that
slavery is actually wrong that's incorrect not everyone knows that
and even if everyone agrees with you even if you
took a poll of the entire planet and seven billion
people agreed with you that slavery is wrong the reality
is is that all that you really have is you
have a consensus of seven billion people in the 21st
century saying that slavery is wrong that doesn't actually make
it wrong that just means that that's what it is
that's what people think that happens to be the current
situation who knows what it'll be like in three thousand
years you don't know you don't know this of course
offends and threatens many people slavery is a nasty business
and people want slavery to be objectively wrong now of
course don't misunderstand me and please don't get offended I'm
not saying that we should bring back slavery a normai
in favor of racism nor nor am i nor am
i making arguments for for some sort of white nationalism
anything like this we're just trying to accurately understand what
it really means to say that something is wrong or
to say that something is true to not understand this
simply because you're offended by it or because it threatens
you I mean I understand where you're coming from as
part of your survival agenda is to look out and
not to get enslaved and that's that's that's fine and
I support a government that doesn't enslave people but it's
relativistic see it's wrong precisely because you are the one
who might be enslaved that's precisely why you want to
say that it's wrong it's wrong relative to you why
is slavery bad because it makes you feel bad if
slavery made you feel good it would be right according
to you you see so it's relative to to your
emotional system it's not wrong in any absolute sense it's
wrong in the sense that it creates a lot of
suffering for people so relative to that it's not good
then again still furthermore it's only wrong if you don't
want to suffer you see you're assuming that everyone doesn't
want to suffer but again you have to go deeper
you have to ask well is suffering really wrong what's
wrong with suffering most people never get to question this
deeply of course of course there is nothing wrong with
suffering and you could even imagine a scenario in which
someone who wants to suffer for him being a slave
is right now of course you're not gonna find many
of these people but again there's a there's a deeper
point here that's being made there's a deeper metaphysical epistemic
point that's being made there is no truth of the
matter of whether it is wrong to sell people of
slaves independently of one's frame of reference as harsh as
that sounds as heartless as that might sound to you
it's true and it's actually very important that you understand
why it's true otherwise you're gonna be deluded in how
you think about reality and you better understand that it's
gonna affect how you live your life for the worse
you're actually gonna suffer by not understanding this so here's
one lesson I want you to take away from this
episode is that I want you to get very good
at asking the question what is the frame of reference
here what is the frame of reference here so usually
what happens that when human beings are discussing something or
they're trying to understand something they forget the frame of
reference it's almost always ignored it's almost always taken for
granted in debates and discussions and even within scientific inquiry
this creates a false sense of absolutism and solidity so
for example from now on if you understand relativity I
want you to think this way if someone comes to
you and says so-and-so is bad I want you to
ask the question from what frame of reference if someone
says to you so-and-so is crazy I want you to
ask them from what frame of reference what's your frame
of reference if someone says so-and-so is true or such
and such as false I want you to ask from
what frame of reference and find the reference frame make
it explicit do it about your own views as well
so like if you believe that Hitler is evil ask
yourself what's my frame of reference if you believe slavery
is bad ask yourself what's my frame of reference and
what you'll discover is that oh yeah my frame of
reference is that I am assuming that suffering is bad
ok is that true could suffering be good again what's
my frame of reference for assuming that suffering is bad
well because I don't like to feel bad I don't
like the feeling of suffering but then question that further
you know what's the frame of reference is it true
that's the feeling of suffering is actually bad and you
might reach a point where you actually discover that the
suffering isn't objectively bad it's only bad relative to you
because of course suffering is a subjective mechanism that your
mind uses to help you to survive now you might
say Oh leo but I got to survive survival is
good question that as well what's your frame of reference
to say that survival is good or that it's even
necessary and so on you get the idea and also
when you hear people talking sloppily I want you to
to translate what they're really saying or yeah translate what
they're saying into what they really mean so for example
if someone says the following is true what they actually
mean translate that what they actually mean is the following
is true relative to blank and if someone says the
following is rational it's not actually rational what they mean
is it's rational relative to blank or someone says so-and-so
is good actually what that means is so-and-so is good
relative to blank or someone says the following thing is
meaningful what they actually mean is it's meaningful relative to
who or relative to what and when someone says so-and-so
is real such-and-such is real what they really mean is
such-and-such is real relative to blank for example we're sitting
here right now I'm sitting here you're sitting over there
we're having this discussion this seems like it's real it's
real relative to dreaming but for example you take some
psychedelics or you have a Samadhi experience or an awakening
experience and you realize that actually this what we call
reality this here it was only real relative to dreams
but you go one step higher you realize that this
itself as a dream you awaken from it and you
realize like oh that wasn't real this thing we call
real isn't real Awakening is real that's what's really real
this thing here this was just a dream see in
that case what you did is you discovered the hidden
conscious frame of reference that was there it was laying
there the whole time but you weren't aware of it
and that's what that's what you discover what you sort
of do some serious consciousness work so science is not
better than witchcraft monogamy is not better than polygamy Buddhism
is not better than Islam logic is not better than
emotions meditation is not better than psychedelics each has its
unique pros and cons this is difficult for many people
to accept also make sure you don't make the mistake
the common mistake of thinking that what I'm doing here
is I'm setting a false equivalencies between for example science
and witchcraft so listen to what I carefully to what
I'm saying here science is not better than witchcraft that
is true but this does not mean that science and
witchcraft are equally suitable for any given situation or goal
so for example if you want to send a man
to the moon science is better than witchcraft relative to
that objective if on the other hand for example you
want to do some deep soul-searching and you want to
visit the astral spirit realms science is terrible for that
you better use witchcraft or something along those lines to
do that so you know witchcraft usually involves serious psychedelic
herbs that are used potions and point mints and so
forth those can actually be effective for sending you to
the astral realm and doing shadow work and facing your
own inner demons and spiritually growing yourself science it's not
very effective for that so they have pros and cons
and so this requires care here I'm not saying that
size is equivalent to witchcraft and I'm not saying that
Buddhism is equivalent to Islam it's just not better is
what I'm saying and I'm saying it has unique pros
and cons you might say Allah leo but but Buddhism
is less violent than Islam Buddhism is a more true
religion it's easier to achieve enlightenment through Buddhism but again
that assumes that enlightenment is your highest goal that's a
relative matter there's no reason why you should want enlightenment
or something else maybe what you want is you want
to pray and worship Allah in which case Islam is
of course obviously the preferred way also you have to
understand that it's relative to context and environment so for
example if you're living in the middle in the Middle
East then even though Buddhism might technically be let's say
better for achieving enlightenment maybe it has better techniques or
so so you might think if you're living in the
Middle East and you have to consider other factors like
political factors family ties friendships that you have these are
all important to you so in this sense you might
actually convert to Islam simply because you're gonna fit better
into your culture whereas if you were gonna be a
Buddhist in the Middle East in certain areas you know
that might that might actually be threatening to your life
go try being a Buddhist in Saudi Arabia it's not
gonna work out so well for you you ain't gonna
get enlightened you're gonna get your head chopped off see
so you say oh yeah but that but isn't that
proof that that Buddhism is better because look in Saudi
Arabia the Muslims ilda chop your head off the Buddhists
oh do that again it's all relative depends on what
you want do you care about getting your head chopped
off that's your frame of reference you don't have to
care you know just because it's your survival just cuz
it's your ass doesn't mean that now it's the truth
it just means it's your ass so be careful about
that sort of self-centered way of looking at the world
another way to think about relativity which I really like
is is as this as follows reality can't tell which
way is up or down reality can't tell which object
is big or small reality can't tell the speed at
which an object is moving at reality can't tell the
difference between an inch and a mile reality can't tell
what time it is right now reality can't tell you
what the XYZ coordinates of an object are and reality
can't tell if Hitler is a bad person reality doesn't
know these things you as a human can know these
things and by knowing them you don't find them in
the outer world you actually create them a lot of
scientifically minded people mathematically minded people they somehow assume that
every object in the universe has an X Y Z
coordinate of course this is painte ly absurd this is
a human projection objects in the universe do not have
an X Y Z coordinate God so to speak does
not know the XYZ coordinates of my body right now
there is no such thing because this is a relative
notion that had to be constructed by humans likewise God
does not know what time it is right now and
I'm not saying that you should believe in God I'm
just I'm just using that as a sort of a
metaphor for taking the universal perspective this is what you
have to do stepping outside of your perspective to take
the universal perspective likewise God can't tell the difference whether
Hitler is a good or bad person you can now
here's the trick here's a wrinkle is that you are
part of reality so reality actually can tell that Hitler
is a bad person but only through you you see
so when you judge Hiller to be a bad person
that is reality determining at that very moment that Hitler
is a bad of course you have to understand that
some other person might determine that Hitler is a good
person so there's gonna be your determination as reality determining
Hitler's bad and then reality will determine that Hitler is
good you know it's like a neo-nazi would probably think
Hitler is good so who is right you might say
well of course I'm right but of course that's only
from your perspective if you realize that you weren't just
this part of reality but also this part of reality
and all parts of reality because reality is one if
you realize you were the whole elephant then you would
realize that neither one is right all of it just
is a perspective and all of that is what reality
is that is the whole elephant and this is what
gets you a sort of a meta perspective and a
distance from your personal little judgments of Hitler or anybody
else get that again I'm not saying that well actually
I sort of am prove it this is too controversial
so I'm not saying that Hitler is good what I'm
saying is that it's undefined Hitler is neither good or
bad but also using that principle of anekantavada we also
have to say that to be totally rigorous we have
to say Hitler is neither good nor bad Hitler is
undefined Hitler is good because some people think he's good
Hitler is also bad because many people think he's bad
and so Hitler is both good and bad and all
of that at the same time and also none of
it at the same time and beyond all of that
Hitler transcends all of that at the same time as
well that's anekantavada and that's as close to the truth
is you're gonna get within language within thought without within
concepts you can go beyond all of that but now
we're getting into a realm that's we're going into Samadhi
now and and then that that's beyond anything that can
be spoken or communicated so I can't teach it to
you that would be the actual absolute so what kinds
of things are relative I got a list for you
all aesthetics tastes and opinions of course should be obvious
enough right all beliefs in all worldviews science and mathematics
and that's a difficult one for people to swallow but
all scientific models and descriptions are relative all scales and
measurements are relative counting and units are relative so this
is why mathematics is relative you see because what counts
as 1 or s 2 or as 3 years 4
as what 5 whatever is relative is this one object
or is this 5 objects it depends on how you
counted see you could look at the hand as being
1 or you could look at it as 5 5
things but it's actually both are sort of true at
the same time the hand is 1 but also it's
got 5 it's got 5 parts to it but of
course how many parses that really have well I mean
it's got billions of cells so is this hand really
1 is it 5 or is it a billion cells
it's all of that and it's none of that and
it's beyond all of that as well because of course
it's got molecules in there and atoms and quarks and
how many quarks are in here trillions upon trillions and
trillions so how many is this hand this hand is
actually infinite it goes on forever there's an infinite number
of structure to this hand it has no end it
has no bottom it has no beginning and it has
no end of course continuing on with the list patterns
within nature and significant relationships that you pull out of
nature so if you say that X is related to
Y which is a lot of what science does science
is basically just finding patterns and relationships within nature every
relationship you find is relative every pattern you find is
relative it's just a question of which patterns will you
focus on and of course the patterns you focus on
are the ones that help you to build the worldview
that will help you to survive so see all science
is very selfish in the sense rationality and logic are
relative all analysis and critique is relative knowledge all knowledge
and understanding is relative all language symbols thoughts and concepts
are relative all paradigms models theories and epistemologies and relative
all physical objects and what counts as a physical object
to even say that this is a hand that's relative
perception all perception is relative mm-hmm all of history is
relative all culture is relative survival of course is relative
go check out my a two-part series called understanding survival
where we talk about the relativity of survival in a
lot of detail meaning significance value purpose and goals and
motivations these are all relative morality ethics norms right and
wrong and good and bad these are all relative all
judgments are relative all religions are relative all spiritual teachings
and explanations including all of my own are relative justice
law criminality and good government what counts as good government
this is relative so there's no such thing as an
absolutely good government there's good government relative to what your
survival needs are what's good government to one person will
be terrible government to another person because they have different
survival needs of course this is why creating a good
government is so notoriously difficult and so contentious what counts
as that the best is of course relative all problems
are relative health is relative success and failure are relative
happiness suffering difficulty pain and pleasure our relative sanity and
insanity are relative birth now here's where it gets really
tricky your own birth life and death and sense of
self are relative and your notion of other human beings
is relative drawing of all categories is relative and all
dualities are relative as I discussed in my three-part series
called understanding duality so what's left what is it relative
that's exactly the point see that's exactly the point so
let's take a quick intermission and then we'll come back
and talk about objections to relativism okay let's talk about
some common objections to relativism you have to be very
very careful because it's so easy to come up with
simplistic and stupid notions of relativism which of course are
obviously false so let me help you to avoid some
of those very obvious foolish versions of relativism so first
of all Leo if relativism is true how is it
that snow is white is relative it's relative in more
than one way so first of all snow is white
you would have to actually analyze the words in that
proposition snow is white all of those words first of
all are heavily laden with ontology and various metaphysical assumptions
just to get two people to agree on what snow
means is not as easy as you think or what
white means is not as easy as you think but
even if we put all those linguistic issues and ontological
sort of semantic issues to the side and we just
take that word simplistically the way that most people mean
it even in that case snow is white like in
which universe under your normal waking consciousness what if you're
in a dream is snow white in a dream what
if you're on a psychedelic what if you're hallucinating what
if you have some visual problem in your nervous system
you know with your visual system you have some tic
in your nervous system is it still gonna appear white
or some other color you see so snow is white
is relative to many factors including your nervous system your
perceptual system how you use language even just to say
snow is white that's it that's a very gross abstraction
which snow are you talking about snow is white as
an abstraction I mean there's no such thing you can
point to a particular piece of snow and you can
say that thing is white maybe but then you know
there's different things you could point to and then how
do you know the thing you're pointing to is really
what you mean or what you meant when you said
snow is white so there's there's also a further problem
between sort of like the correspondence between specific phenomena in
the world and and then your abstraction of it so
just say that snow is white that's not actually an
empirical a purely empirical statement that's an abstraction and then
of course it's it's white to you as a human
being but is it white to a snake to a
cow to a dog to a cat to an alien
you see so it's utterly relative next objection Leo if
I get cancer how is that relative of course you
got to be very careful here with relative relative does
not just mean that well anything goes like you can
just think up of any random thing and then it
like it poof it materializes into existence or like if
you have some problem then you can just say oh
well it's a relative problem so it's like poof I
can just think it out of existence like I broke
my leg for example and then Leo you're saying that's
relative so I can just now imagine that my leg
is is not and suddenly it's healed no it doesn't
work like that see that's not what relativism means relativism
doesn't mean you just get to think [ __ ]
up and then it materializes instantly that ain't relativism that's
your foolish straw man of relativism but even in this
case of cancer right so cancer is still relativistic in
the sense that you say Leo I got cancer well
what do you mean by I exactly you mean your
body so you're attached to your body yeah you've identified
yourself with the body that's not a scientific fact that
you are your body in fact you know a famous
sage Raman of Maharshi he actually died of cancer he
was deeply enlightened very awake died of cancer but before
he died I think it was cancer on his arm
or something he got cancer on his arm in his
old age and his followers you know they get got
very concerned because they were they worshiped him they looked
up to him as though he was God well he
was God but anyways they looked up to him and
of course they wanted to cure him of this cancer
because you know his teeth didn't want to let his
their teacher die so they got all sorts of doctors
to come in there and try to help put herbs
on it and whatever to cure it nothing worked but
as they were like putting medicine on the cancer on
the arm and trying to fix it Raman supposedly he
just sat there and he just looked at it he
said ah don't worry about it just leave it all
died doesn't matter the body will die this body is
just mud is just earth and mud it doesn't matter
the real I won't die because of course he transcended
the whole notion of of being a body so so
so so literally you know literally you want to become
immune to cancer well change who you think you are
if you change your identification to something which can't get
cancer then you can't get cancer even though of course
the body can get cancer and the body can die
but that doesn't mean you're the body so in this
sense there you go it's relative next objection Leo how
can science be relative doesn't science deliver us the truth
it sure seems that way no science is very deceptive
in that we use it to create all this fancy
technology and then we think like well it must be
true and therefore nothing more needs to be said about
it no not that's not at all the case science
is relative in in many ways I've already talked about
how science is relative to the era that it's being
done in very much so the science that will happen
in a thousand years will be so radically different from
today's science that we will look back and look at
today's science 21st century science as the equivalent of doctors
bleeding their patients with leeches or some other form of
quackery that's how modern physics will look in a thousand
years science is also relative in that it's a very
specific epistemic system with various standards premises methods and techniques
that it uses and the very notion of what counts
as science is fluid science itself changes by doing more
science you change how you understand what science is because
science most generally speaking is simply the investigation of reality
and as you investigate reality of course science itself is
what a part of reality so as you're investigating reality
you're also investigating science and you're learning how to do
science better and actually the boundaries of what qualifies the
science will change such that for example in a thousand
years many spiritual techniques meditative and yogic techniques that today
are not counted as science will be admitted and accepted
as legitimate science so what counts as legitimate science this
very much depends on how we think of science culturally
and bureaucratically in our institutions and you better believe that's
gonna change and in fact science in the next thousand
years will change more than science did in the first
thousand years the last thousand years there's many changes and
reforms that are needed to science and then of course
science is actually literally done differently people assume that well
science is just universal science it's not universal science is
how humans understand the world if there are aliens out
there one day we meet them they will have a
different version of science than what we have radically different
perhaps in some ways might be similar but also radically
different even there's even differences between the way men and
women do science next objection leo but how come scientists
agree on the same factual data if you're saying that
physics and the actual physical substrate of reality is relative
this is a very good question first of all I
want you to notice that a lot of scientists do
not agree on the data there's a lot of debate
about this and what science is about is is gathering
consensus and a lot of what that is about is
about convincing others of your way of looking at the
world and how you look at the world of course
affects the kind of data that you see and a
lot of times one scientist looks at the world this
way gets one kind of data another sign just looks
at the world using a different set of paradigms and
premises gets a different set of data and this data
in a sense is in commensurable it can't be directly
correlated and compared now of course in very simple cases
scientists do often agree on the data you know you
can get a ruler give it to one scientist give
a ruler to another scientist they can measure an elephant
from nose to tail and discover you know some common
number although even that is not always as easy as
it seems so you know cuz rulers are different measuring
instruments are different it's hard to calibrate them but let's
say they do come up with the same data you
have to understand that there's different levels and layers to
relativity so for example the data scientists agree upon is
highly contingent upon which states of consciousness both of these
scientists are in and also the fact that they're both
humans and they share a similar educational background similar culture
they work for similar types of institutions they both grew
up in the same era of course they have the
same similar brains similar neurology similar perceptual systems virtually identical
DNA so all of that is necessary for scientists to
be able to agree on data try getting to scientists
who have even a 1% difference in their DNA to
both agree on the same data that would be very
difficult to do so see part of the problem is
because really humans are like the only intelligent species that
we know of on this planet and in this physical
universe and so the problem becomes is that we're so
isolated that we tend to think that were so good
and so smart and this lets us get away with
not acknowledging the relativity of our own deepest held assumptions
and world views because even though we do have lots
of different cultures around the planet still most of the
humans who have all these different cultures still have 99%
the same DNA very similar brains very similar perceptual organs
and neurology and so therefore of course we all tend
to think alike and we told him to agree but
you know try getting a scientist to agree with some
alien scientists from another planet that would be very very
difficult different and you could imagine that they would disagree
about what the data really is also the notion of
data or facts is itself a relative notion you see
because it's completely contingent upon which state of consciousness you're
in different states of consciousness produce different data so when
you're dreaming and sleeping that's one set of data when
you're awake here in the world that's another set of
data and so on so yeah just because like we
can both look at a physical object and agree that
that that's a tree or a cat or stuff like
that we can have this with the same raw physical
data understand that that's deeply entangled with our entire nervous
system but also I want to address an even deeper
point here which is a point about the absolute so
here and we're gonna also address on an additional objection
to relativism a lot of people have a sort of
just intuitive almost knee-jerk reaction against relativism especially a lot
of scientifically minded people because they tend to just Intuit
that there must be something about reality which is not
subjective which is an absolute and it's that which they
want to call the data or the facts and in
a certain sense this intuition is actually correct because there
is the absolute there is being and in fact the
only thing there is is the absolute the only thing
there is is being and so being is literally the
very substrate of everything but this being that I'm talking
about here this is not the same thing as what
you when you as a scientist or as a normal
person have your facts and your data that is not
being that is a conceptual projection that you're adding on
to being so in a sense what I'm saying here
is that if you are able to completely overcome your
self agenda your sense of self in various kinds of
conceptual categories and schemes and paradigms and worldviews and self
deceptions and even your entire perceptual system if you're able
to overcome all of that ultimately you will arrive at
the absolute truth or at being that is the thing
which grounds everything but this is so radical and so
alien to what any ordinary human person has ever experienced
that it's almost pointless to talk about it here because
it is not nearly the same thing as data or
facts the way that scientists think about it data and
facts are relative absolute being is absolute but what that
is you're not conscious of it yet you might think
that I'm talking about some sort of other universe that's
not it absolute being the irony of it and the
difficulty of it is that it's right here right now
everything is absolute being but it is not what you
conventionally think of as data or facts or even perceptions
even though it's not different from perception it is still
not the same thing as human perception so you can
only arrive at being through a state of Samadhi or
a union between subject and object which I've talked about
in past episodes so in a sense the reason that
scientists can agree to some data or facts is also
because there is that absolute and that absolute is not
somewhere else that absolute is right here right now it's
just that they're not and you're not fully conscious of
what that is and you're missing her per ting it
with your projections and your your world view you're kind
of lumping it all together and then you're calling that
data in facts another objection Leo if relativism is true
how come people can still be factually wrong cuz doesn't
relativism mean that whatever I believe is just true again
that's a very silly notion of relativism that's not what
I'm arguing for here it's much more nuanced than that
so yes you can still be factually again factually wrong
factually here is a relative matter and even wrong is
a relative matter so again remember that all of our
facts as human beings stem from our neurology and our
psychology our common DNA our common ancestry our common culture
so of course because of this this unifies a lot
of us together and guess what's thinking along the same
page but you can still be factually wrong because again
your own perspective is relative to past perspectives that you've
had so what it means for you to be factually
wrong is that at at some point in the future
you recognize that something you said in the past you
know no longer holds true and that's because you know
you're exploring more of reality you're you're exploring your own
psyche and your own mind and you're realizing how you
might have been deluding yourself tricking yourself fooling yourself misconstruing
something misinterpreting something or even just simply not observing something
carefully enough so of course because of this you can
correct your own worldview and you can admit to yourself
that you're wrong of course and somebody could even convince
you that you're wrong by / presenting a persuasive argument
that's because you're able to to compare what you believed
before to what you are being proposed by this other
person and then you're gonna put them side-by-side again relativistically
you can compare them and you can decide that oh
well maybe the thing I held before really didn't make
much and again why why do you change your belief
you change your belief precisely because you're comparing various perspectives
in your own mind you're kind of juxtaposing them and
you're trying to fit them together like a jigsaw puzzle
so the reason you accept some new theory or idea
is because it fits better with your total picture of
reality than some other part that you used to have
and it helps you in some way so in this
sense it's it's a very relativistic manner another objection so
Leo does relativism mean that for flat-earthers the earth actually
is flat is that what you're saying or is the
earth actually round and then the flat earthers are deluded
which one is it again it's a little bit tricky
here we need to think about this in multiple ways
from a certain perspective it actually is sort of the
case that for a flat earth earth the earth actually
is flat from their point of view that sort of
is true which is exactly why these flat earthers can
be so radical and they can be like so fully
bought in to their worldview that literally what a flat
earther gets on an airplane and he's flying he could
look at the horizon of the earth and he could
say left low look it's flat it's gonna look flat
to him because you see you don't just experience the
earth largely how you experience the earth is not just
by simply observing it it's all the stuff that you
also project onto it see so your expectations and your
metaphysics actually colors your perceptions such that for example if
you if you look at somebody that you hate you'll
actually look at them and you'll see them you'll perceive
them as being more ugly than they really are because
your your eyes are actually being colored by that hatred
and judgment that you had you're not able to see
them properly and clearly now of course if the flat
earther eventually you know flew into outer space and look
down on the earth maybe he would see a globe
and then this would this would be a problem for
him but again this is still relative still relative because
this is happening within his own consciousness this round earth
that he's seeing or not seeing it's happening within his
own consciousness and in this sense it's relative so what
I'm saying is that for example when the flat earther
dies the earth will disappear for him there will not
be an earth it won't be flat and it won't
be round and in a sense even as we're sitting
here talking about the earth it sounds as though we're
talking about some real object actually you have only an
image in your mind of the earth it's purely a
concept for you you have very little direct experience of
the actual earth so keep that in mind I am
NOT saying of course that just by thinking the earth
is flat that when you fly into outer space and
you look down it'll actually be flat for that person
and for another person who believes the earth is round
and he flies into outer space he'll see it as
round I'm not saying that right it's a much more
subtle thing that's being said here but I am also
saying that the actual physical earth is relative for example
when you're dreaming the earth doesn't exist before you were
burned before you were born the earth didn't exist at
all and after you die it won't exist for you
and from your point of view that's all that matters
you might say all Leo but but the earth will
still exist I'll just be dead but the earth will
still continue to exist no it won't the only reason
you can think that is because right now you're alive
so when you're dead the earth will not continue to
exist because what it means to say that the earth
exists is that it exists for you from your perspective
not independently of you you're imagining that the earth can
exist independent of you but that's you imagining it as
long as you're alive see it's twisted here it's tricky
another objection Leo how can history be relative well this
objection is very easy to answer should really be obvious
all history is highly partial you never see a complete
history of mankind or a civilization or even though an
individual person you're always cherry-picking elements and piecing stuff together
and interpolating and interpreting it you don't really know the
true history of Rome or of Egypt or of even
individual people you don't know the true history or biography
of Hitler or any or any other person throughout history
really this is highly relative and then your the way
you see history is is highly shaped by by how
you want to see it and it can't colors your
whole worldview and then your worldview colors how you interpret
history as well see do you see history as as
a constant progression towards freedom or maybe you see history
as as various power dynamic and power struggles or maybe
you see history is just like an evolution a fractal
evolution or advances in technology or maybe you see it
as advances in biology or whatever and there's different ways
of looking at it each one of those is highly
highly relative true history you might say is this infinite
thing out of which you're plucking out individual strands and
then you're you're highlighting and emphasizing those of course a
very common objection is well Leo how can good and
evil be relative this is such an obvious one that
I don't even want to go into it in depth
I've covered the relativity of good and evil many times
in Prior episodes go check out my episode called what
is the devil that explains the mechanics of good and
evil and how relative it is basically what good and
evil really are in the way that most people mean
them is it's simply that which aids your survival what
aids our survival you call good what hinders our survival
you call evil and of course your survival is completely
relative to who you are such that every person generally
has vastly different survival strategies and therefore they have very
vastly different notions of good and evil and that's why
people disagree about good and evil so much all throughout
history and up to this day another objection is well
Leo does this mean that Hitler was actually good and
that he was as good as Jesus because you're saying
that good and evil are just relative so our Hitler
and Jesus equivalent again remember I'm not saying that things
are totally equal so I'm not saying Hitler was equal
to Jesus they were very different they love different different
lives they communicated differently and they interacted with people differently
and Hitler ended up killing a lot more people than
Jesus did so so those are important differences now is
it good is it bad this all depends on your
perspective is killing good or bad in your mind killing
is not objectively good or bad it just depends on
again what you're what you want what your goals are
who you are so Hitler is not as good as
Jesus it just is what it is and then you
are attaching these labels to it another objection Leo how
can we build a society if all values are relative
as you're saying again relativism does not mean that we
can't cooperate together that we can't build a consensus we
can't come to some agreements we can of course we
can largely because we share the same DNA we shame
share the same brains the same neurology the same perceptions
we are in the same environment for the most part
we are all humans we basically have very similar needs
for our survival of course there's minor differences but we
have we have certain basic requirements and based on that
which all of that is not absolute that's all relative
because you know you could have been born an orangutan
rather than human in which case you would you would
not be able to build a society with you is
you know orangutangs and humans can't build a society together
it don't work orangutan don't even understand what a society
is and they probably don't even need one so so
so because we have so much commonality we're the same
species basically that's why we have common needs and common
values now of course in practice it's so difficult for
cisely because even though we're all humans there's so much
disagreement that it's very difficult to get a consensus about
how to build a good society and what it means
to build a good society our values are very different
depending on our culture and what part of the world
we live in and and even within that still so
many disagreements even within the same family you've got so
many disagreements between what is right and what is wrong
and what is good and when it's bad and what
is needed and what's not needed next objection but Leo
Einstein said that the speed of light isn't relative it's
a constant so doesn't that contradict you know her relativity
here well two points about that first of all speed
of light is not truly a constant because it varies
depending on the medium that it's in so it's relative
to the medium now you could say well but Leo
I'm specifically talking about the speed of light in a
vacuum well first of all there's no such thing as
a vacuum a perfect vacuum doesn't exist so you're talking
about some idealization but even if we grant you that
and we say okay the speed of light in vacuum
is totally constant first of all understand that right now
scientists are actually debating this point it's not clear that
the speed of light is actually a constant some scientists
have actually proposed that there are tiny minut you know
down to the thousands and millions of a decimal point
fluctuations within the speed of light and that that that
is not just because our instruments are not good enough
to measure it accurately but they're actually saying that this
is inherent to sort of the background noise of of
space-time itself so that's a interesting theory it hasn't been
proven or disproven yet it's just you know they're they're
still working this stuff out so that's a possibility and
of course that would mean that it's relative also the
speed of light could change with the history of the
universe we don't actually know if the speed of light
has been constant throughout the entire birth of the whole
universe that we're in there could be other universes in
which the speed of light is a different speed it
could also be the case that for example the speed
of light is actually relative to the universe that we're
in and the rate at which the universe is expanding
and of course if you've studied the expansion of the
university especially universe is not actually a constant it's accelerating
and actually it's been said that the universe accelerates either
is accelerating now or has accelerated in in the past
at speeds faster than the speed of light see so
maybe inside of the universe the speed of light is
whatever it is and it's a constant but then that
doesn't really determine what can happen outside of it outside
the universe alright so there's there's a lot of potentially
nested contexts here in various frames of reference that you
have to take into account so it may not be
as constant as we tell ourselves another objection so Leo
does this mean that enlightenment is also relative because you
talk about enlightenment don't you have to be consistent here
and admit that enlightenment can be false and the answer
is no enlightenment is we might say the one thing
which is not relative it is the absolute enlightenment is
awakening to that absolute that I've been alluding to throughout
this episode that's the whole beauty and radical nature of
enlightenment is that it's it's precisely the thing which gets
you out of relativity and what that is you can't
possibly imagine until you experience it for yourself and you
actually awaken another objection but Leo aren't you contradicting yourself
here because it sounds like you want me to accept
everything that you say and what you're saying is that
everything is relative but you want me to accept it
as an absolute isn't it the case leo that everything
you're saying here is relative so isn't your own theory
eating itself alive because you're saying everything is relative but
you want to say that that's true which is precisely
what we can't say if we want to say that
everything is relative this is a very good point and
this is a common mistake that many post modernists make
is they try to say for example that everything is
relative all for example all morals are relative and they
go one step further and this is their mistake is
they say yes all value systems and morals are relative
and therefore we shouldn't prefer one over the other we
shouldn't marginalize anyone we should treat them all equally but
of course there is no such should just because all
value systems are relative doesn't mean that some value systems
aren't more useful in certain situations than others again depends
on your goals but let's return back to this point
more directly about me contradicting myself the nature of the
absolute is that when you speak about it it contradicts
itself because language is dualistic and relative you can't speak
about the absolute without contradicting yourself this is not a
mistake or an error or an oversight on my own
my part I'm actually deeply aware of this and you
need to become deeply aware of it too so even
though there is the absolute nothing I'm saying here is
the absolute so if I said that this video and
everything I'm saying here I want you to take as
the absolute and that this is the absolute truth if
I said that mm-hmm then you'd be right I'd be
a hypocrite but I'm not saying that what I'm saying
is that everything I'm saying here is also relative so
I'm actually in accordance with what I'm saying I'm saying
everything is relative including language and this is part of
language and these are thoughts these are concepts it's all
relative but there is an absolute me saying there is
an absolute is not the absolute that's still relative don't
make that mistake but if we go beyond all the
words to that which cannot be pointed to or spoken
or communicated or thought or imagined that is the absolute
and me saying that is still relative so the point
you have to get here is that there's just absolutely
no way to communicate the absolute but it's there so
this is the finger pointing at the moon and you
need to go beyond focusing on the finger and actually
go to the moon and so if you keep insisting
that I contradict myself that's you looking at the finger
because you're looking at my words and my thoughts and
concepts and my teachings which of course are relative I'm
not saying my teachings are absolute I'm saying that my
teachings can perhaps if you do the work one day
get you to realize that there's something beyond the teachings
beyond the relative that which cannot be spoken that which
is read between the lines which cannot be explicated in
any way and that will be the absolute truth and
you will know it for yourself but you yourself will
also not be able to think it or communicate it
to anybody else that's the very radical and paradoxical nature
of the absolute so are all my teachings relative of
course they are none of my teachings can capture all
of reality my teachings cannot capture the whole elephant all
they are are just maps and models little tiny photographs
of the elephant's ass not the whole elephant you got
to go and experience the whole elephant for yourself all
I'm doing is I'm telling you that there is an
elephant that you can go explore and you can discover
all of its nooks and crannies and various aspects in
in detail and I will never be able to speak
them all to you so my teachings are not a
substitute for you realizing the entire elephant in fact really
for you realizing that you are the entire elephant so
when I'm talking about the elephant I'm really just talking
about you so those are all the objections now we're
wrapping up here I just want to conclude by saying
that understanding relativity I hope you can start to see
is absolutely crucial for understanding reality and for going deep
into your own personal development work that's why we're covering
this topic this is not just philosophy if you want
to know more about the absolute and you're curious go
check out my many videos about the absolute check out
my video about ask techno do ality check out my
two-part series on understanding absolute infinity part 1 and part
2 check out my video about what is god Part
one and Part two that all explains the absolute and
I have many more episodes that explain the absolute so
search for those I've talked about it many many many
times so I don't want to rehash all of that
here that's it for part 1 make sure you stay
tuned for part 2 believe it or not we still
have a lot to say about relativity and that's it
we're done here for today please click that like button
for me and come check out actualize that org that's
my website you'll find my blog with various insights that
I post exclusive videos I recently posted a deep awakening
experience that I had exclusively on my blog in video
form go check that out might be interesting to you
check out my book list check out the life purpose
course check out the forum where you can discuss the
stuff and ask your questions and finally I never want
you to ever just take the things that I say
on faith the point of these videos is to get
you to start thinking for yourself to contemplate all of
these points carefully this is very advanced stuff and you're
not going to be able to understand it if all
you do is you just sit there and passively listen
and just nod your head and accept it all and
then move on to the next video that's not gonna
work I expect you to think about this stuff question
it challenge it play devil's advocate but again not so
much towards me because that just becomes a projection but
rather with yourself sit down and think through these various
points I made various objections to come up with your
own objections and then try to defeat them try to
answer them try to really understand what is relativity rather
than just being a skeptic or a cynic and just
telling me all Leo relativity's all horseshit here's why you're
wrong rather than doing that instead make the counterintuitive move
and actually just start from the point of saying okay
relativity if relativity is true how can it be true
and then actually think through it as though it were
true that's a much better way to explore and try
to understand what something is by assuming it to be
true rather than to by assuming it to be false
you know like if you want to understand for example
what Christianity is you need to enter Christianity assuming that
it's true not that it's false because if you assume
that it's false you're not gonna understand Christianity likewise with
any other worldview for example if you really want to
understand Nazism start reading Nazi books assuming that they're all
true not that they're false now that doesn't mean that
I want you to accept Nazism as true this is
just a sort of a mental exercise you're doing you
know an intelligent person can assume something is true look
at the world from that perspective for a while sometimes
for days for months for years even and then switch
it off and say okay well that was just a
thought experiment now let me look at it this other
way let me assume that it was false or let
me assume something else was true that contradicted that other
thing that I was holding it's true you got to
be cognitively flexible enough to be able to jump back
and forth between different perspectives like this this is one
of the keys to this work and lastly I want
you to notice if you get emotionally triggered or reactive
against relative anyway and I want you to pinpoint those
exact places are you triggered by moral relativism epistemic relativism
ontological relativism are you triggered that time and space are
relative or that Hitler being bad and evil is relative
or about slavery or whatever notice those and watch those
very carefully in and then question those and ask yourself
why am I getting triggered by this there is something
very valuable for you to discover there because really the
only reason you ever get triggered about anything is because
it threatens your survival and sense of self and your
world view which is very integral to your sense of
self and to your entire life and to your survival
strategy so that is where the real work is done
here is by observing your emotional reactions anytime you get
emotionally reacted by anything that I say turn inwards and
find that thing within yourself which is the cause of
you being triggered that's how you'll really grow not by
ranting at me with your objections and your opinions and
telling me how wrong I am this doesn't help grow
you this is a complete distraction and of course this
doesn't mean that I can't be wrong of course I
can be wrong I'm fallible which is precisely why I
want you to contemplate this stuff just in case I
make an error somewhere or I delude myself you can
catch me on that error the way you catch me
on an error is not by being cynical and skeptical
about the things I say but rather by taking the
things I say seriously and contemplating them for yourself and
then actually discovering what's really true that's how you debunked
me not by creating stupid reaction debunking videos that that's
that's all just ego it's all just a waste of
time which is why I don't really even like to
respond to that sort of stuff so there you go
stay tuned for part two you
