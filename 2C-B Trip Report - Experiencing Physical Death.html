hey leo here for actualised dot-org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about my incredible amazing to see
B trip report experiencing physical death [Music] warning misusing psychedelics
can be dangerous and even lethal the legality of these
substances vary by country the information provided here is for
educational purposes only you agree to take 100% responsibility for
any physical mental or legal consequences which may result from
applying this information you I want to narrate to you
how I experienced physical death on to see B to
C B is a recreational psychedelic it's often used by
people at raves and parties but not in my case
I had a very interesting experience that's quite atypical if
you're a psycho knot and you're researching to see B
because you want to know what a typical trip report
is like well mine is not your typical trip report
because I'm not your typical tripper I don't trip recreationally
I trip existentially so you're not gonna maybe get what
you were looking for here but on the other hand
if you're a living being whatsoever then you will find
something quite useful and amazing from this trip report because
this really was something rather extraordinary what is to see
B to C be is a class of psychedelics it's
different from the tryptamines so it's not like DMT or
mushrooms which are tryptamines this is a feta thiamine so
it's similar to mescaline and I wanted to try this
out because people talk about it as a party drug
people liken it to ecstasy sort of has similarities to
that if you read many of the trip reports and
they say that basically what you get with 2cb is
some nice colorful visuals you don't get a lot of
mindfuck component which is the component where your mind goes
very existential and it really screws with your whole concept
of reality so 2cb is not supposed to have too
much of that and it's supposed to be kind of
like light and fun people take it at parties and
they listen to music it makes music beautiful it makes
visuals beautiful and that's your typical 2cb trip so what
I decided to do is to try this thing out
for myself as I do and I took ten milligrams
of to see be plugged which is a rectal administration
and you heard that right so I took it rectally
so what that means you take a small needleless oral
syringe little syringe that like you use for your dogs
or for your cats and then you mix the powder
to CB usually comes in a fine powder you mix
it with some water very little amount of water is
required so very small amount of substance and then you
stick it up your butt and you administer it and
there you go and now you're ready to trip now
2cb is more commonly administered orally it works orally you
can just eat it wash it down with some water
comes with pills sometimes I don't recommend taking those because
God knows what's in them and also you can snort
it now what I wanted to do is I wanted
to try out to see B to see what it
is like but also I wanted to test out this
method of administration of plugging because it has a lot
of promise the thing that I like about plugging is
that you get the full dose if you administer if
you administer it properly whereas with snorting you don't often
get the full dose like with five Meo the dose
will get snorted too deeply it'll go down your throat
it won't get all the way ingested and so then
that leads to questions about how big of a dose
did you take so I like plugging because it's more
accurate also it has a very fast come on and
it removes problems of nausea with certain psychedelics so specifically
with 2cb the problem is that if you eat it
orally you can become nauseous and I wanted to avoid
that it also avoids problems of sometimes if you have
eaten a meal you can't take a psychedelic because you
need to take it on an empty stomach so here
you bypass all that by plugging it also interesting with
the ffedith ila means both to CBN with mescaline if
you plug this substance you only need to use about
half the dose that means the dose is twice as
powerful plugged as it is orally so that prolongs your
doses by twice so that's pretty cost-effective so anyways I
plug this thing it's not as disgusting or painful as
it sounds it's actually very effortless and quite a pleasant
method of administration and then I go and I lie
on my couch and so I'm lying on the couch
and waiting for this thing to come on and I
know that it's gonna hit me pretty asked because I've
read what happens when you plug things and so I'm
expecting it to come on in five minutes or so
and sure enough it does as I'm laying there I'm
looking up at the ceiling I'm looking at my hands
like this is what an introspective manner and I'm already
starting to feel at the five minute mark that like
something weird is going on very subtle but something weird
is going on I'm almost starting to feel like my
hands are not my own anymore a little bit of
like dissociation but it's very mild and I'm lying there
and I'm starting to feel some weirdness in my body
and this is what they call the body load it
starts to come on and what the body load is
is just this sort of like I would describe it
as an um almost anesthesia like feeling in the body
where your sense of physical body starts to change in
a weird way not necessarily unpleasant but it's just kind
of weird and I would say that your body feels
a little bit more heavy and numb than it normally
would and also I noticed that as this body load
is coming on which is becoming stronger and stronger as
the trip continues I notice a little bit of nausea
coming up as well which took me somewhat by surprise
because I don't usually ever get nauseous on trips and
because of the plugging method of administration so what I
do is I go and I take a couple of
ginger pills these are just over-the-counter ginger supplements it's just
pure ginger root in a ground-up form as a pill
you can take a gram of this when you're about
to trip and I often do to reduce any potential
nausea so I take that and that works pretty well
for this trip here I don't really get any nauseous
problems going forward then I lie back down on the
couch and I'm looking up at the ceiling and I
start to notice the visuals kicking in a little bit
and as far as the visuals what I'm seeing is
a couple of things first thing I'm noticing is my
visual field starts to shift in these waves almost as
though the whole thing is a mirage but it's subtle
it's not like my whole visual field is getting torn
apart it's just like these waves but the waves are
enough that you start to question like what is this
thing that we call a visual field at all where
is it actually occurring in consciousness but then what is
consciousness and then so that takes you down that whole
rabbit hole so I get these waves and then at
this point I roll on to the floor off of
the couch and on the floor I have some blankets
and some pillows spread out because I know that tripping
on the floor works pretty well for me so I'm
laying there on the floor and I'm looking up and
I'm right above me is this giant round paper lantern
so it's sort of like an oriental paper lantern except
it doesn't really have any colorful designs on it it's
just made out of like wire mesh and then paper
wrapped all around it it's pretty big and circular it's
about 1 meter in diameter like this and I'm laying
there looking up at it and it's a lamp it
has a light bulb inside and it's just shining soft
yellow light through this paper so the lamp is there
and I'm looking at that and the visuals now are
coming on even stronger and so now what I'm noticing
is I'm noticing colors some of the psychedelic colors that
are quite common on various psychedelics like mushrooms and LSD
I'm starting to notice some of those they're not very
sharp though I would say that they're rather muted there
are some purples and greens and yellows and oranges and
they sort of like to come in and out and
that's starting to come on and the other thing that
I notice with visuals is little patterns so when I'm
looking at the paper on my lantern I'm seeing little
curly swirly organic shapes exactly like the kind that you
might see on mushrooms and they're very intricate and kind
of ornate and then these patterns can morph around and
move and they're also hypnotic in that they suck in
your attention because they're so beautiful in that the way
that they're moving that you just go into the sort
of trance looking at all these colors and waves and
patterns so there I am on the floor experiencing this
and everything is going well and just to back up
for a second as far as 2cb when I started
this trip I basically expected that this was going to
be a test run so whenever I do a new
psychedelic I always do a little test run with a
small dose this is a relatively small dose nothing dramatic
was really supposed to happen and on top of that
this was supposed to be kind of like a fun
light party psychedelic so I'm just kind of like enjoying
the day and my mind is not worried about anything
I'm not really expecting anything to happen and I'm just
going on this trip but what starts to happen is
that to my surprise I become quite introspective now looking
and staring at this lamp which is starting to mesmerize
me and my mind feels like it has become this
hot gooey lava lamp with my thoughts just sort of
bubbling away very slowly like hot molasses and I start
to introspect about various existential questions that have been interesting
me for many years like what is consciousness and what
is the self what is life what is reality what
is Brahman what is God and so as this lava
lamp of my mind is bubbling away I'm going deeper
and deeper into this introspection and at this point I
surrender control of my mental focus and so I'm not
any more in control of my mind my mind is
guiding itself or maybe the psychedelic is taking my mind
wherever it needs to go and I just trust it
with that and so off we go there we go
deeper and deeper and deeper and it's getting more and
more and more profound and then I look at the
clock and we're 50 minutes in now and my body
now feels anesthetized it feels pretty numb not any kind
of shocking or painful or uncomfortable manner I'm relatively comfortable
but I am taking a bit by surprise at how
much body load 2cb has compared to say mushrooms or
five Meo even or al-lat but I don't really care
I'm really entranced in this interest action so one of
the things that my mind ultimately settles on is this
facet of truth which I called groundlessness which is basically
when you realize that everything you know in reality is
a thing or an object you could also think of
it as a surface right everything you know in reality
especially in the visual field is a surface but then
you ask yourself okay so if we have this surface
here what's the grounding for this surface it's like well
there's some other object inside of it or some other
surface there behind it okay so then but then what's
grounding that surface well it's other surface and what's grounding
that surface well yet other surface so we have surfaces
grounding surfaces but then you carry this chain of thinking
through to its conclusion and you realize that it's a
never-ending infinite spiral that never ends at anything out to
infinity see this is what I call groundlessness this is
like the structure of existence or the structure of God
itself when I say God I use that word interchangeably
with existence and reality not a man in the sky
so I'm apprehending this groundlessness and it's almost as though
an extra dimensions dimension opens up in my awareness and
in this dimension is all this deep existential stuff all
this wisdom all these answers and insights they just come
effortlessly when I'm on this 2cb and the ground in
this groundlessness i've experienced it before it's uh it's always
profound though and it always blows my mind no matter
how many times I experience it and I'm just going
deeper and deeper I'm getting sucked and mesmerized by it
because it's so beautiful and profound and the beauty of
it now my mind focuses on the beauty of the
growl assist and I'm just getting overwhelmed and lost and
entranced in this beauty and I'm just getting mesmerized by
it more and more and more and it just consumes
me and at this point the beauty is becoming so
beautiful that it's beyond emotions and beyond tears the beauty
so deep that it's actually sobering you can't even cry
it's so beautiful and I'm just going deeper and deeper
this is just consuming me and at this point I'm
thinking to myself with my last remaining kind of meta
awareness or my sober mind I'm just thinking damn what
is going this is supposed to be a light party
psychedelic what the hell is this this is way too
deep I didn't think it was going to go this
deep but I love it right I love it cuz
this is kind of like what I'm about so I
love this and I just go deeper into it I
surrender into it I don't put up any fight at
all and then pretty soon I I'm at the point
where my eyes are starting to close and I'm starting
to kind of like get drawn into my body and
my whole body is basically numb and now something very
kind of horrifying occurs with me and I remember that
exact moment where I realize that I just went past
the point of no return and the boundary between real
and unreal has broken down and the boundary between the
physical and the non-physical has broken down and that if
I keep going down this path this means I will
physically die and yet at the same time it's so
beautiful this groundlessness that I can't or I don't even
want I think I could but I just don't want
to I don't want to break out of it it's
too beautiful I want to go into the beauty I
want to explore this beauty and so I surrender even
more fully to it I surrender all my commentary I
surrender all symbolism because usually I'm commenting on stuff in
the back of my mind sort of taking mental notes
for insights that I want to keep for myself that
I want to take out of the trip maybe that
I want to share with you and so forth this
had to be surrendered because the beauty was so overwhelming
that you couldn't symbolize it it was beyond symbolization so
I I let that Co I let the commentary go
I shut the meta mind and at this point I
really feel like I'm about to physically die now let
me explain this a little bit because you might be
wondering well what do you mean by this Leo are
you actually physically dying as your body dying well here's
the thing when the boundary between the physical and the
non-physical is realized to be groundless there is no more
difference between real and unreal and now what does your
physical body mean see when we conventionally talk about the
physical body we make this distinction that oh yeah there's
a physical body then there's the mental aspects there's a
psyche yada yada yada if you physically die that means
like you get shot in the head and then of
course your body dies and you die with it but
see this entire paradigm doesn't work when you're really conscious
because when you really conscious you see through this paradigm
it's not true there is no such thing as a
physical body what you identify with as a physical body
isn't really physical at all it's just surfaces within consciousness
these surfaces are ultimately groundless and when these distinctions break
down your entire sense of reality breaks down and at
this point when you experience physically dying you're physically dying
that's how it felt to me and the reason that
was it was just it was almost self-evident I think
that if like you got shot let's say you got
shot in the gut where you didn't die instantly but
you had like maybe five minutes left until you bleed
out completely and lose consciousness so if that happened to
you you'd be lying there on the street let's say
bleeding out and I think that both your body and
your mind would know that you have suffered a fatal
wound and that that this is the end there's no
recovery from this and so at this point your physical
body and your mind will start to make preparations your
body will have a certain reaction certain chemicals and hormones
will start to get released but then also your mind
will start to make preparations you're going to start to
look at your life you're going to start to get
a really a clear picture of everything your life was
about what you did why you did it any regrets
you have you're facing your maker here in a sense
so that's what started happening to me as I was
lying there I didn't have like heart palpitations or anything
physically negative happening with my body it was all rather
Pleasant but I think that that's largely because I'm at
the point where I've done enough contemplating I've taken enough
trips and had some very powerful trips in the past
where I'm sort of I'm sort of open to this
stuff now whereas I think that a year ago I
certainly would not have been and I would have certainly
done something to break myself out of this trance I
would have moved my body I would have gone outside
I would have go eating some food but here I
really just wanted to go as deep as I could
and I wasn't struggling with it at all so I'm
lying there in a second I'm expecting my physical death
and then I just say okay let's do it I
don't care anymore it's too beautiful I don't care if
I live or die I don't care if something wrong
happens to my body I'm just going for it and
so I just went for it and as I was
closing my eyes and about to die it occurred to
me that if someone walked up to me right there
in that room with a loaded gun and pointed at
my head normally of course I would be afraid and
I wouldn't want to die but here in this situation
it would not matter it would make no difference at
all there would be no distinction because I'm already going
through the death process what more could what more could
I go through that was already the ultimate that I
could go through and so that's what happened it also
occurred to me right there before I died that I
have finally become so open-minded that it's going to kill
me why am i dying because the beauty is overwhelming
the beauty is going to kill me why else am
i dying because my mind has become so metaphysically open
we might say that it's going to kill me physically
and I had a very clear sense that everything in
my life from when I was a child and I
was curious about the world - when I was in
school and I was learning philosophy - when I went
to college and I was studying epistemology and I was
doing a lot of contemplation on my own and then
all through now and then the last four years of
my life with actualised org all this time spent contemplating
and talking about all these topics that all of this
I talk about open mindedness a lot right so that
all of this was basically me trying to open my
own mind more and more and more and more and
more until ultimately it would kill me physically kill me
and so here I was and I was gonna let
it happen and I felt pretty good about it because
I just had an intuitive sense from my very birth
that open mindedness is the right way to go and
that there is no bounds to open mindedness there's no
such thing as too much and so here I prove
that and I fully surrendered this was utter surrender like
utter utter utter surrender and what I experienced as I
closed my eyes is what I would call a complete
ego death but you have to understand that when we
say ego death and I've used that term before in
the past that there are degrees of it and that's
the deepest degree of it is your physical death so
when we say ego death sometimes it's easy to think
of it as like oh yeah so that's like a
psychological sort of thing it's not really physical death but
you have to understand from your point of view which
is the only thing that matters is your point of
view from your point of view when you're going through
this process it feels like physical death that's how serious
it feels it doesn't feel like oh yeah you know
I'm alright physically but like it's just my mind is
doing some weird stuff on some hallucinogens no no no
we're way way way past that see all these distinctions
between my mind and hallucinogens and physical reality in mental
all these distinctions have gone out the window they don't
exist the very fabric of reality the entire paradigm of
reality as you conceive it is gone okay and that's
when I close my eyes and I experience this thing
and what I remember I'm thinking back to it right
now very vividly is how I died how I disintegrated
I literally disintegrated and it was as though all the
little molecules and particles of my body which supernovae and
just exploded out into infinity it was like I was
an ice cube thrown into the ocean and it just
melted and spread throughout the entire ocean I remember my
sense of self going from my head into my heart
and then when it was in my heart I felt
like that was the truest sense of self and then
that just exploded and my literally I felt like my
entire physical existence and my life had come to an
end and just completely exploded and flipped everything flipped inside
out and my heart just melted and then I died
out into reality and became one with the very fabric
of reality and that moment of death like I remember
that exact moment when it happened there was a very
specific point at which I went supernova and it was
like I have this metaphor in my mind of imagine
a rubber basketball and then if you take a hook
and you hook into that rubber basketball into its side
and then you just yank it so fast and so
hard that the entire thing flips inside-out almost by magic
you just flip yank and yank and flip that whole
thing inside out so that the inside now becomes the
outside and the outside now becomes the inside and that's
what happened in that moment I would supernova is that
Leo was gone completely gone as though there was no
such thing not mentally Leo not physically Leo and what
was left was just the universe reality itself this was
by far the most incredible and most positive and most
joyful experience that you could possibly imagine that was the
moment of death and that I had that epiphany is
that death is the greatest thing that could happen to
a living creature because it feels like after you die
right after you die and in fact in that process
of dying for a split second it's terrifying because you're
dying and you have no idea what's coming next but
then as you fully let go and the death occurs
the next split-second you're so relieved it's like your entire
life was this giant thousand pound weight wrapped around your
shoulders just tons and tons of weight and then all
of it was just lifted in a split second and
you realize that you're untouchable and that you're immortal and
then nothing could ever disturb you again it's complete peace
just utter utter peace and joy and profundity the beauty
of it is indescribable and so that was my experience
and I basked in that for I don't know how
long I lost track of time maybe five ten minutes
probably not very long and then I started coming back
I started to reiterate it my sort of sober meta
mind did come back and it did sort of start
to analyze a situation and it started to wonder what
the [ __ ] is going on how is it
possible there's no way that this is possible did I
really just die how could that be and I started
to just doubt my cell phone it's added me is
this an illusion how is this possible there's no way
and at the same time I'm laughing and I'm smiling
because I realized that there's nothing external that's gonna come
and validate this experience I mean I did experience my
death that's what it felt like and at that point
there are no other people there is no physical reality
there's nothing to validate you it's not like oh yeah
I need a scientist to come tell me that I
died know when you're in that situation yourself you don't
need a scientist you are the evidence of it you
the death is so goddamn powerful that you cannot mistake
it for anything you know when you're dead alright this
is not something that's like oh yeah I'm not sure
if I'm really dead no it's so [ __ ]
overwhelming that it's like you know you're dead and then
it's so goddamn incredible it's hard to believe you're dead
and then it's hard to believe it from that perspective
because it's just it's almost too obvious so anyways I'm
laying there and trying to analyze all this stuff and
to understand it a little bit more and just kind
of basking in the freedom of it this is radical
liberation here and then I remember feeling proud of the
fact that I conquered death that's how it felt is
that I literally conquered my physical death and that nothing
mattered anymore and that nothing could touch me anymore and
in fact I remember imagining myself getting a round of
applause from the whole universe as though all the sentient
beings and creatures and animals and humans that are out
there we're all standing there and clapping for me applauding
for me for having faced my death because this is
the ultimate this is the ultimate thing you can do
and then I felt kind of bad about this my
meta mind my sober mind was saying well isn't it
egotistical to be applauding myself for this but I remembered
that story about the Buddha where they say that when
the Buddha awoke the entire earth shook in recognition of
his awakening and that's what it felt like here and
it was a really a profound moment because the deeper
thing that I realized there is that there's nobody but
me now as the universe to applaud myself who else
would applaud myself but me it's not Leo applauding himself
it's the whole universe because that's what I am now
because there is no more leo there at this point
and so I just kind of accept the applause and
I realize that this infinite beauty of God can only
be known to God and to nobody else and this
experience of death this beautiful death can only be known
to you the one who was alive no scientist is
gonna explain it to you you're gonna experience it when
you experience it and that's the only way the universe
can experience that is when that happens when you go
from being finite to being infinite that's when you experience
it so if you don't allow yourself to bask in
that beauty and to congratulate yourself for that then it'll
never happen ever in the universe because how else could
it other than through you it has to happen through
you you're the only thing that's there you are it
you're the whole thing and it's you so even if
there was somebody standing outside you like your friends or
maybe your spouse or something and they wanted to congratulate
you for what you just accomplished conquering death and they
clapped for you that would also be you they would
be you they're not separate from you because now you're
them you're the whole thing so I accepted my applause
and just bask to that and I was really just
dumbfounded by what just occurred especially on this little measly
psychedelic this little dose that I was just trying out
this supposed to be just the tester dose blew my
mind but overall it was all very positive I didn't
have any fear resistance to it pretty much at all
I look at the clock and it's two hours now
and very quickly I've peaked and I've passed the peak
so at this point the color for visuals they all
subside my body still feels rather anesthetized and numb and
I lie there for a while just basking in all
this but then finally I summon the strength to get
up on my knees and hands and I'm on the
carpet there in the room on my knees and hands
and the most extraordinary thing happens I look around I
look at my hands as though I'm entering one of
those blue avatars from James Cameron's Avatar you know when
they first enter those creatures and they're kind of just
like experiencing themselves being in this weird alien body that's
what it feels like now to be in my body
because what happened when I was talking about the basketball
getting flipped inside out what I meant by that is
that my entire inner world got annihilated as I'm standing
here looking at my hands there's no more inner world
of Leo there's no more Leo's life it's just like
the hands are the universe looking at itself feeling itself
and also their immaterial so I look at my hands
and I realize that there's nothing physical or material about
these hands these hands are just surfaces within a field
of consciousness which is ultimately groundless and so I'm marveling
at my hands and I look at the coffee table
and then I take my my knuckles and I wrap
it on the coffee table and I'm laughing and I'm
just blown away because the substance of my hand is
identical to the substance of the coffee table is identical
to the substance in between the hand and the coffee
table which is just air it's all consciousness it's all
just one substance consciousness so I sit there looking around
the room like this and just amazed at how my
perspective of life got flipped completely inside out and upside
down and I'm getting that sense of being headless like
I tried to be conscious of my head just looking
like this but I can't see my head and therefore
my head literally does not exist and it's like I'm
the universe with no head but with just hands looking
around the room I actually am the room not just
looking around the room it's like I'm the inside of
that basketball being itself and then from this point on
the rest of my trip was rather unremarkable this was
only two hours in but the trip still kept going
for a good six hours after this it's just that
there was no fancy visuals and no really deep stuff
because I already went through the deepest thing I could
possibly go through and so the rest of the trip
I spend walking outside a little bit on the grass
looking at people and dogs as they're being walked I'm
walking around kind of like a numbed out zombie like
a man who just came back from the dead and
I just had this kind of stare as I'm walking
and just kind of like looking at everything as though
for the first time in my life and just contemplating
the significance of what I experienced and then I come
back inside and I met and I just ponder some
more and let the effects of the 2cb fizzle out
it took a long time actually I could still feel
lingering effects especially in my head this kind of buzz
for almost a full 12 hours from the beginning of
my trip and then I went to bed and that's
it so what are the lessons here for you the
lessons if you're trippin but also the lessons if you're
doing consciousness work or you're interested in non-duality well firstly
about party drugs this notion of party drugs is a
it's a really silly notion they can be just as
deep as anything else they can be just as deep
as five Meo DMT because well one of things I
realized is that it's not the substance or even the
size of the dose that really determines the depth of
your trip it's your preparation it's your intent its how
serious you are it's how existential are you willing to
get it's how much of a foundation you've laid it's
how much you've contemplated in self inquired and I've been
doing this especially over the last month a lot starting
with my solo retreat which I did about a month
ago so that built up a lot of mindfulness in
me made some shifts but then also I've been cleaning
up my diet lately I've been eating very healthy just
a plant-based diet so I think that contributed I was
also doing neurofeedback brain training I was meditating a lot
contemplating a lot so all these things now synergize plus
all the prior trips that I took and I took
some very deep and powerful trips in the past with
five at me oh all of that is now synergizing
and is what made this party drug this little party
drug so powerful another important insight that I got for
tripping is that I realized that trips are not just
independent episodes I used to think of trips more like
sitcom episodes where each episode ends basically where it started
and it's a self-contained thing and now what I'm seeing
is I'm seeing an arc a trajectory of my trips
which is really the hero's journey it's a progression it's
a spiritual progression towards the ultimate truth and what that
involves if I think back to my earliest trips a
year ago what that involves is that it first starts
with you just getting familiar with how psychedelics affect your
body in your visual field but then it goes deeper
you start to get into your inner demons you start
to get into your deepest fears you start to get
into very deep insights for the first time you see
some of these insights they shock you you can't even
make sense of them so you need to experience them
again and again to see them more up-close for what
they really are to fully understand them so I noticed
that there's this arc I specifically see that arc because
there were a couple of key trips that were quite
significant which have led me to this particular trip that
I had now where I was able to experience this
physical death this ultimate surrender this surrender was much much
deeper than any surrenders that I've done in the past
even on five Meo hmm and I think that's because
I had to build up to it I had to
practice and surrender ever deeper on all these different trips
and I had to face fears so one of the
most important fears I had to face was the fear
of insanity which I faced on mushrooms that was my
toughest trip because if I didn't face that fear of
insanity there was no way that I could do this
physical death surrender here in this trip and also of
course I had to come in contact with absolute infinity
which I did on my break through five mio trip
that was very important because if I hadn't had that
as a foundation for this trip then I wouldn't be
able to go as deeply into the beauty of it
and let it overwhelm me because I would be seeing
it only for the first time the first time you
see it is so shocking that you're not really able
to go deeply into it so let that be a
lesson to you if you're using psychedelics for spiritual work
expect that there's going to be an arc expect that
you're going to need to work through stuff and that
as you keep doing it you're gonna go deeper and
deeper and deeper and deeper and that smaller and smaller
doses of substances will be tired to take you very
deep another lesson I learned is that enlightenment equals physical
death when you see some enlightened yogi or master sitting
up there on his little cushion lecturing to you and
a satsang or something and you look in his eyes
and he has that that's sparkling look in his eyes
that enlightened look you know what that is what I
realized that's the look of someone who's dead inside enlightenment
is a lot more radical than you think when you
first get on this path you think that it's like
oh yeah my sense of self is gonna change like
maybe I'm gonna experience some psychological death no you're gonna
experience physical death you're gonna be [ __ ] dead
did you really expect that you would become immortal without
dying immortality is what dawns when you physically die now
of course to the outside observer you're gonna have a
body just like that enlightened master has a body to
you it looks like he's just pretty normal right but
inside he's [ __ ] dead there's no him inside
he has become the whole universe that's what's so magical
and mind-blowing about enlightenment it is your physical death because
the boundary between the physical and non-physical will disappear for
you it'll have no meaning for you whatsoever another insight
that I had which was very important for me personally
is that physical death is the best thing that could
ever possibly happen to you I used to not look
forward to my death even though I would contemplate it
in fact I would think of my death is like
man my death is coming soon I better get a
bunch of [ __ ] done before I die cuz
that's gonna be the end and while that's still true
I still want to get a bunch of [ __
] done before I die because it will be the
end of doing [ __ ] but but my attitude
towards death has changed completely it's just such a positive
thing in my mind now that I'm almost looking forward
to it it's gonna be it's gonna be a firework
show it's incredible another lesson that I learned is that
there are degrees of surrender many degrees of surrender and
what I thought was me fully surrendering in the past
was not the case there are a lot of hidden
latent fears that you have that keep you from fully
surrendering and you gotta face those so you got to
purify those in order to surrender more and more deeply
and as you do you'll experience deeper and deeper degrees
of ego death and that's the final lesson that I
learned is that there are many degrees of ego death
I've used the term ego death in the past to
describe various experiences that I've had and I think that
those were accurate and generally true but still those mostly
felt like psychological ego deaths whereas this one felt more
physical more total and that was that was a level
of depth that conceptually I knew that that was probably
what enlightenment was but also you know it's just so
different when you actually go through it yourself and you
experience actual death like I mean it feels like the
rock bottom maybe there's even deeper levels I don't know
what I'll experience in the future but this sure felt
really goddamn deep and that's it those are my lessons
am i enlightened no a few hours after my peak
my ego-mind basically came back as was expected as you
should expect with psychedelics when you're at your peak it
feels like you're enlightened forever and that it there's no
way you can ever forget this or it'll never go
away there's no way your old ego mind will come
back but usually I find that it does not to
say that that's always gonna be the case I mean
if you trip a lot like this I'm sure that
at some point it might stick and become permanent I
don't know that remains to be proven now some people
criticize psychedelics for this and say well Leo so all
this is just delusion hallucinations because what good are your
psychedelics if all they do is they give you a
little window to enlightenment a couple our window what good
is that well um try it for yourself and see
psychedelics give you a window yeah that's all they do
is they open the portal the Gateway for a few
hours and that's enough to create some huge shifts in
you that doesn't mean you stop doing your work you
continue doing your work even more after that now you
really know why you're going for it and you really
know what you're going for and you realize the full
ramifications of what you're going for it's very sobering and
it grows you a lot huge growth comes from that
if you're meditating you will also have experiences in your
meditation career where you have these openings these openings could
last for a few hours for a few days but
then they closed back down that's your consciousness kind of
expanding contracting spanning contracting that's completely normal it would be
silly to go to a meditation retreat to have a
window of opening for a few hours then it closes
and then you say to have all well yeah so
meditation is all pointless this retreat was all stupid just
because the thing opened for a little bit and then
it closed no that's how it goes that's how it's
supposed to be it would be way too good to
be true if you just took this pill and then
it opened you forever that would be way too easy
you got a lot of inner [ __ ] to
work through before that can happen see it's not enough
to just see the truth the truth is so massive
and so [ __ ] deep and profound and has
so many facets and components to it that you need
to keep looking at it over and over and over
again before it really penetrates through into your mind and
into your actions and behaviors sometimes for some people very
rarely one in a billion times you could have a
sort of instant enlightenment but that's very rare very rare
even with meditation as well self inquiry usually it's this
process of opening up closing back down struggling to open
up again closing back down it's the kind of back-and-forth
struggle until finally you do that enough times you purify
yourself enough that something finally breaks and your mind cracks
open forever that's the ultimate goal but you know you
can't count on that to happen in one split second
without any effort so I experienced huge growth here my
whole relationship to death has completely changed and I'm I'm
really stoked about it that's my whole trip I actually
wrote this trip up in a lot of detail of
many paragraphs on my computer as a trip report because
there's a lot of details that I thought would be
difficult to communicate here in a video format I still
don't know if I'm satisfied with that trip report I
might publish it if I do there will be a
link down below you can click if you want to
read all the gory details and if not don't worry
about it because I actually did manage to capture a
lot of pretty much everything important in this in this
