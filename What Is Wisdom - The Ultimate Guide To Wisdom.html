[Music] welcome to the ultimate guide to wisdom but what
is wisdom and what is the opposite of wisdom we're
going to look at these questions in a lot of
depth today give you many answers and we're going to
explain how to develop wisdom in yourself should you desire
to go down that path down the path of philosophy
after all philosophy is the love of wisdom so what
makes for a philosopher and why do philosophers pursue the
things that they're pursuing now wisdom wisdom is interesting because
wisdom is different than information it's different than knowledge it's
different than book smarts a lot of people go to
university but they're not necessarily wise academics with phds they
can be good scholars but they aren't necessarily wise people
with high iq also aren't necessarily wise so what is
wisdom what distinguishes it from everything else and why is
it so important so here's how we're going to tackle
this topic i actually sat down and i spent several
days contemplating what is wisdom of course i've been contemplating
it on and off sort of casually for years but
like specifically for this episode i just sat down and
contemplated for a few days straight and came up with
a lot of stuff um but the the issue here
is that even though i'm going to give you all
the answers of the results of my contemplations really you
need to contemplate for yourself what wisdom is only when
you generate your own answers will it have the kind
of value it needs to have for you but here's
probably something that will get your mind jogging and think
it in the right direction now i have a long
list of characteristics of wisdom and wise people that we're
going to cover here and we're going to sort of
do it in the order of most importance because there's
sort of an essence to what wisdom is so when
you're contemplating what is wisdom you can ask yourself what
is the essence of wisdom and when you first start
doing it it's it's rather vague and nebulous and it's
hard to articulate exactly what it is and i tried
many different attempts and there's a lot of stuff i
have to say about it but really when you boil
it all down what is wisdom so here's what it
is it's a keen discernment it's good judgment it's having
proper priorities that's really what it boils down to there's
certain sets of values that are lower values and certain
sets of priorities and values that are higher and the
wise person puts the higher above the lower which is
how it should be and then when they live their
life according to that according to the higher over the
lower then they live a wise life and this is
a person that you would call wise and if they
do the opposite then they are not wise so i
know that's kind of vague but then again wisdom is
sort of a nebulous concept and just what what generates
this keen discernment what does that really mean this keen
discernment is this something that you can develop how does
it come about how come some people have a keen
discernment and good judgment and good sense of priorities and
others don't you've probably noticed some people have this and
other people don't in fact most people don't so those
people who have it how do they get it well
we're going to be talking about that as we keep
going here and i'm going to be listing other characteristics
of what wisdom is so wise people are deliberative and
thoughtful in the way they approach life they rely upon
contemplation and they ask powerful questions they self-reflect and they
introspect they're curious about themselves they don't take themselves for
granted wise people are existentially oriented what does that mean
that means that they're asking questions and thinking about and
interacting with reality in such a way where it's more
than just their personal survival or how to meet their
personal pleasures or how to make life most comfortable and
easiest for themselves they realize that there is an existential
dimension to life and they are interested in this existential
dimension and in fact it's this existential dimension that is
the higher set of priorities and values which they place
correctly at the top and then all the other values
go underneath that and are a lower set of priorities
this is actually pretty rare most people don't live their
life this way most people are not existentially oriented and
from this ultimately stem all of their problems wise people
exhibit an existential humility rather an epistemic humility an epistemic
humility which means that they take the problem of knowledge
seriously what does it mean to know something how do
you know that something is true at all they don't
take this problem for granted they take epistemology seriously they
understand that to come to know something is not a
trivial matter a lot of times we think we know
something when in fact we don't really know it we're
tricking ourselves we're deceiving ourselves wise people take the possibility
of self-deception seriously whereas most people don't as part of
this epistemic humility wise people are exceptionally open-minded because you
need to keep an open mind when you realize that
there's a lot of stuff you don't know those two
naturally fit together wise people take seriously the possibility that
they are fooling themselves whereas most people don't wise people
are experienced and that's an important way in which wisdom
is developed is through massive exposure to life to experience
experience is the ultimate teacher and the more experience you
accumulate and the more consciously you accumulate it and the
more you reflect upon it the more you contemplate it
the more you question it the more you think about
it the deeper your wisdom tends to get for example
relative to children adults most adults are wise we could
say they're wise of course there's many foolish adults out
there but uh but like i said relative to children
why is that primarily it's because children lack all experience
they don't know how cruel the world can be they
don't know how tricky the world can be and they
simply lack experience in all these different areas of life
like in relationships with sexuality with business with how to
make a living with health and diet and other things
like this and so they make many mistakes children do
and adults are necessary to impart wisdom upon the children
so the children don't do something stupid end up killing
themselves or poisoning themselves or harming themselves well just take
that and then extend it out beyond just merely adults
and children but most most of what we call adults
are actually just grown-up children they're not really adults and
so they also need wisdom they need wisdom from people
who have been contemplating and thinking about reality and who
have a deep base of experience with life from who
whom these adult uh you know grown-up grown-up these grown-up
children can also learn and who's uh whose counsel they
can follow so that they don't get themselves into trouble
politically sexually in business and elsewhere with health wisdom is
also holistic and big picture a holistic understanding of reality
and life now this issue of holism i actually have
a whole deep episode that will come out in the
next week or two about holism so we're going to
talk about the issue of holism very deeply so hold
on for that but just remember that wisdom is holistic
which is one of the things that makes it different
from just information or knowledge which tends to be very
specialized and narrow you can be a technical expert an
engineer or a doctor or a lawyer or a academic
that's some sort of technical knowledge you have it's not
a holistic understanding of life and therefore you're not able
to use that knowledge to really orient yourself and develop
that keen sense of discernment to make good decisions in
life wise decisions wise people value the truth this is
actually a pretty rare quality in humans most humans don't
value the truth because they're too myopic to appreciate the
significance of truth in fact to appreciate the awesome significance
of truth and why it should be valued requires a
lot of contemplation and wisdom to begin with to be
interested in truth is already a sign of wisdom wisdom
is non-judgmental the wisest people are the least judgmental wisdom
is also a keen awareness of the counterintuitiveness of life
we've talked about this in the past this theme that
life is counter-intuitive and that to be successful in many
domains of life requires being able to see the counter-intuitive
moves that are necessary oftentimes life works the opposite of
how you think the thing you think will get you
what you want ends up backfiring and gets you the
opposite you think that chasing pleasure for example will create
the best life and you discover it's the opposite you
think that getting a lot of sex will get you
the best life and then it turns out to be
the opposite you think that doing a bunch of drugs
will get you the best life turns out to be
the opposite you think that chasing some get-rich-quick scheme will
make you wealthy turns out it makes you broke and
to be able to see this that is wisdom you
see the twisted ways the inversions that life takes to
be able to foresee that without having to hit your
face against it that's wisdom wisdom is also long-term thinking
the opposite of myopia that also comes with patience wisdom
is patient it's willing to wait to get what it
wants wisdom is independence of thought to be an independent
thinker to contemplate every situation through for yourself and to
derive your own answers rather than just blindly accepting the
answers that somebody else tells you because after all if
you're wise you understand that how can you trust anyone
to tell you anything because they could be wrong so
you have to think it through for yourself wisdom is
nuanced it's a way of thinking about life that recognizes
the complexities and subtleties of different situations in life and
that rarely are things black and white or as simple
as they first seem remember as a child how simple
certain aspects of life seemed to you only for you
later to discover the complexities and nuances and then you
realize how childish your thinking was how naive you were
you wisened up through experience probably through making mistakes and
hitting your head against the wall speaking of which wisdom
wisdom doesn't mean you never make mistakes but wise people
learn very deeply from their own mistakes and they never
make the same mistake twice because they make the mistake
they suffer for it they learn the consequences and how
the suffering comes about because they're aware they self-reflect they
contemplate why did this mistake occur what did i do
to cause this mistake and then they learn their lesson
and they generally don't make the same mistake twice wise
people are mentally flexible and highly intuitive they're able to
change their mind about things this allows them to correct
mental errors or errors in their worldview whereas most people
don't do that wise people can tolerate paradox paradox and
contradiction whereas usually this shuts a normal mind down for
a wise mind a wise mind understands that reality is
paradoxical and works in these counter-intuitive and contradictory ways and
they're capable of holding that paradox without being confused or
paralyzed by it wisdom is objective neutral and unbiased most
minds and intellects are highly biased whereas the wise mind
since itself reflects since it values truth it sees through
its own bs and its own biases and it becomes
keenly aware of these biases and how these biases distort
its perception of reality which gives it clear vision so
it's the opposite of self-biased the more wise you become
the more aware you become of yourself biases and the
more you let them go see my episode about self
bias for more on that topic wisdom is skeptical it
doubts things a wise person doubts himself first and foremost
but skeptical in a moderated healthy way because there are
unhealthy versions toxic versions of skepticism where skepticism is weaponized
i've discussed that in the past see my episode called
true versus false skepticism that helps you to see that
distinction between good and bad types of skepticism so the
wise person by studying his or her own has a
very keen nose for smelling out and therefore the wise
person is difficult to manipulate and difficult to fool and
to trick because he studied all the tricks and he's
aware of how tricky the mind is how tricky life
is how tricky humans are and yet at the same
time this does not turn into a paranoia so the
wise person is cautious when entering new situations and dealing
with certain people who could be dangerous and deceptive but
it doesn't turn into paranoia it's cautioned without the fear
behind it and that's an important distinction especially these days
a lot of people get trapped and lost in conspiracy
theories and all sorts of paranoid thinking and this is
the opposite of wisdom so caution but not fear the
wise person is principled they have integrity they have a
certain set of principles that they live by and they
stick to those principles even when it's difficult which is
pretty rare it's rare to find highly principled integris people
without devolving into dogma and mental rigidity so there's a
difference between being principled in integris versus religiously dogmatic for
example just following certain rules that people programmed you with
principles are things you develop yourself you derive these principles
yourself these are not the ten commandments that you've read
in a book somewhere and you've memorized and now you
parrot them like a robot and act them out like
a robot rather you through your own contemplative efforts through
studying life and studying your own self you derive principles
these principles are deep profound lessons that you learn from
experiencing life and then uh and then you follow those
principles these are the principles of wisdom and so wise
people have these principles then unwise people don't or they're
unable to follow their principles they might have a set
of beliefs like maybe a lot of religious people will
believe the ten commandments but then do they actually follow
them no which means they're out of integrity and to
even value having integrity that already requires a fairly high
degree of wisdom why is integrity important that might not
be obvious to you well you have to contemplate that
and you have to experience what it's like to live
life without integrity or to interact with people without integrity
and then you'll learn the the lesson of why integrity
is important wise people are willing to do the right
thing when called when the situation calls for it wisdom
is self-disciplining because one of the principles you'll learn as
you go through life is that without self-discipline you can't
live a good and peaceful life you're always going to
be tormented and so wise people they have a intrinsic
sense of motivation they don't need to be whipped externally
by some task master to live a good life or
to eat the right food or to abstain from certain
traps and dangers in life they just do it through
self-discipline and this they learn through experience and by making
mistakes you learn the dangers of being undisciplined and then
you learn to discipline yourself and then you are motivated
intrinsically from the inside rather than from the outside you
don't need to be paid a bunch of money or
given a bunch of compliments to do the things you
need to do to be principled because you value being
principled in and of itself more than you value the
money or the praise or the love or whatever you're
getting from somebody else see the wise person has an
internal locus of control as it's known in psychology the
wise person takes responsibility doesn't blame others for their own
inadequacies or problems or suffering in life the wise person
understands that he or she is the central agent of
life and therefore any problems in life they come through
you through me and in that sense i'm responsible for
them i'm responsible for how i'm gonna respond to situations
the wise person does not avoid emotional labor but faces
it head on does the difficult things that need to
be done to live a good life that's closely related
with the self-disciplining the wise person is able to abstain
from and to control his or her cravings isn't a
slave to cravings because if you're a slave to your
cravings then you can't be principled you're just going to
be doing whatever your cravings want you to do at
that particular point in time and of course that leads
to a life that's full of suffering and deep mistakes
and regrets and errors and catastrophes and disasters the wise
person highly values education and learns from the mistakes of
others yes you can learn from your own mistakes of
course and you should and that's going to be inevitable
if you're going to become lies but wouldn't it be
wise to learn from the deep history of mistakes that
mankind has made before you you can read history books
you can talk to your elders to your parents to
colleagues and ask them what the mistakes they've made and
learn from their mistakes so that you don't have to
go through the same fall into the same traps that
they fell into humans have been alive for hundreds of
thousands of years we mostly face similar survival challenges and
we fall into the same kind of traps so really
there's not much reason for you to make mistakes in
your life as long as you're able to be forward
thinking enough to to read and to study lessons of
history and then you can avoid many of those mistakes
wisdom an aspect of wisdom is exquisite balance and moderation
wisdom understands that life is exquisitely balanced on a razor's
edge and that in almost any situation it's easy to
go too far into one direction or the next whether
it's in politics or in relationships or when it comes
to money or to nutrition in all of these and
many other areas in life it's all about exquisite balance
finding that delicate balancing point and that this balance is
dynamic i've talked about this in a previous episode called
i forget exactly what it's called but something about the
importance of balance in personal development i forget the exact
title and you can search for balance actualize that or
you'll find it and anyways so uh so wisdom recognizes
that it's not about taking some extreme position it's about
finding those balance points everywhere in life and so wisdom
is the ability to do that whereas when you lack
wisdom you tend to swing your pendulum too far to
the left too far to the right and yet at
the same time wisdom recognizes that balance does not mean
that you're always going to split everything down the middle
that is a foolish notion of balance so balance does
not mean that you take uh nazis on the right
and progressives on the left and then compromise between them
and say well the truth is somewhere down the middle
it's not not everything is symmetrical not every debate not
every issue has two sides the truth between the denial
of climate change and the reality of climate change is
not somewhere in the middle and so wisdom understands that
and in fact wisdom sees how this splitting everything down
the middle evenly how that is in fact used by
devils and manipulators and knaves in order to try to
trick you sometimes you do have to swing your pendulum
sometimes extremely to one side because the situation already is
deeply out of balance and so you're putting it back
into balance by swinging your pendulum to one side but
then you recognize okay now i've got to swing it
back because it's not going to stay there forever once
you've corrected the situation then you've got a new situation
that now requires a new application of that keen discernment
that we started off with wise people are mature why
people have high emotional intelligence wisdom can admit i don't
know that's one of the hallmarks of wisdom and it
usually takes many decades for a human to develop this
capacity to say i don't know and to not judge
oneself for it and to not judge others like oh
he said he doesn't know that means he's stupid no
when someone is able to say i don't know that
actually means he's smart see that's one of those counter-intuitive
aspects to life too many people are unwilling to say
i don't know and that's what makes them unwise as
socrates famously said uh the one true thing that i
know is that i know nothing and that's what makes
him so wise actually in fact i think the story
with socrates is uh is that somebody went to the
oracle of delphi in greece or whatever in i don't
know yeah in delphi it was in delphi city in
greece uh so they went to the oracle of delphi
and they asked who is the wisest you know who
is the wisest of the greeks and the oracle said
socrates and then they asked the oracle well why socrates
what's so special about him and the oracle said because
he knows that he knows nothing similar to that along
the same lines is that wisdom is able to admit
when it's wrong wisdom doesn't mean perfection like i said
wise people can make mistakes but the wise person is
able to recognize quickly when he's wrong make a correction
not get hung up on it not get rigid or
dogmatic about it not try to cover it up and
then of course a corollary to this is that the
wise person is able to apologize genuinely apologize not as
some sort of fake or cover to save face or
to you know save one's career but to genuinely apologize
for a mistake this takes wisdom to do that similar
to this wisdom is able to forgive and to let
things go wisdom is also very careful when giving out
advice because giving advice is a great responsibility and different
people face different situations so just because something worked for
me that doesn't mean it's going to work for you
and as i develop wisdom i see that and so
therefore i'm careful not to just project my situation onto
your situation and so the kind of advice that wisdom
gives is not a kind of a specific abc one
two three do these steps do you know follow the
ten commandments and you will have a good life or
you will get punished in hell that's not a good
form giving advice rather wisdom guides the one who is
asking for advice wisdom guides him or her to discover
the answers for themselves so the socratic method is used
or a form of guiding one or facilitating or coaching
rather than just telling someone what to do and wisdom
is careful not to push advice onto others not to
give unsolicited advice wisdom is benevolent compassionate and selfless wisdom
values solitude and silence and if you're familiar with spiral
dynamics then wisdom we could say is something like spiral
dynamics tier two cognition that's where really you develop wisdom
because only at tier two do you really transcend the
uh survival values and needs and start operating from the
being values and needs and that now takes you into
the sort of existential priorities territory now that's wisdom that
paints a pretty good uh pretty good portrait for you
there now let's talk about the opposite of wisdom what
do you think that is what's the opposite of wisdom
foolishness of course the fool so what is foolishness well
foolishness is basically the opposite list of everything i just
gave you but even though i tell you that i
want to go and elaborate upon that some more because
it's one thing to just tell you it's the opposite
it's another thing to actually paint you a detailed picture
of what the opposite looks like so let's let's do
that and i want you to see here i want
you to notice something this is sort of a meta
point a little meta tangent of this uh of this
episode so ostensibly here we're teaching you about wisdom but
also we're going to teach you a meta point here
about implicit and explicit i've talked about this in one
of my episodes called implicit versus explicit understanding so so
look if i tell you that foolishness is the opposite
of wisdom that leaves it rather implicit you have to
sit there and unpack that in your mind to really
understand what foolishness is now let's make it explicit by
going down this list and i want you to notice
the difference between having it implicit versus explicit because when
you make something implicit explicit that can be very powerful
at the same time as i talked about in that
implicit versus explicit episode some things can't be made fully
explicit and that's okay too and it can be powerful
to keep something implicit so uh how do you know
when to do which well that's wisdom that's wisdom too
all right so let's make foolishness explicit so the essence
of foolishness is of course poor judgment and lack of
discernment you know these kinds of people you probably have
some of these friends in your life the kind of
friends just have constantly bad judgment they constantly keep getting
themselves into bad situations in their own life that they
themselves created through how they make choices in their life
they're making the wrong kinds of choices over and over
and over again and they're not learning their lessons from
this they keep doubling down on their mistakes that's a
fool that's the essence of a fool a fool has
a poor sense of priorities in life so the fool
has life backwards has his priorities backwards the fool places
the low above the high what do i mean by
this well i mean something like rather than pursuing the
truth which would be the high above the low low
in this case might be something like sex or drugs
or pleasure or money right see the wise will place
the truth above all those things whereas the fool will
place sex above truth money above truth fame and reputation
above truth drugs above truth and truth is not the
only high priority there are many other high priorities we
could talk about that's just one example but this tends
to be the fool's problem he places the low above
the high and he's living his life backwards and of
course because of this all sorts of uh craziness and
calamity ensues and lots of suffering and the fool doesn't
know you know why am i so unlucky why do
i keep stumbling in all these problems well because you've
placed the low above the high because the fool can't
see the value of the high the fool can't see
the value of truth of love of beauty of existential
questioning of contemplation and of philosophy to the fool none
of these none of these things mean anything because the
fool is only interested in base survival cravings satisfying things
like sex you know cravings for food and and for
money and for for fame and for status and for
material possessions and things like this the fool is also
easily lost in minutia and pettiness because the fool is
wrapped up in survival the fool has confused life for
the game of survival and he's just like a hamster
in a wheel running running running but always in place
never getting anywhere it takes wisdom to see that hamster
in a wheel mechanism so the fool often loses sight
of the big picture of life and just gets so
engrossed and mesmerized by the minutia of life that he
could spend 40 years you know doing some petty stupid
little thing thinking it's important when really in the grand
scheme of things it's not important because again his sense
of importance and significance and priority this is all backwards
because he's not thinking existentially or deeply about life the
fool is ignorant and proud of it the biggest fools
are aggressively ignorant they will try to fight you over
their ignorance to prove to you how smart they are
and the more ignorant they are the harder they fight
because the fool is unwilling to admit a mistake or
to admit that they're wrong about a thing the fool
thinks he understands everything one of the key characteristics of
fools is arrogance the fool thinks he's smarter than everybody
else the fool thinks he's got reality all figured out
and that everybody else is an idiot the fool underestimates
the depth of problems in life life has existential dilemmas
that the fool is completely oblivious to because the fool
is wrapped up in his little reality his little selfish
petty little existence and the fool doesn't see anything beyond
himself outside of himself he doesn't have a universal sort
of perspective a meta perspective the fool is completely wrapped
up in the in the in the content the little
petty content of his you know survival problems in life
and um he can't see anything beyond that and then
of course that leads to a sort of a a
vicious downward cycle of you know just engaging in the
pettiness and minutia of survival and the more you do
that the more you suffer and the more problems you
have and then it just doubles down upon itself the
fool tends to be anti-intellectual it doesn't value education because
hey he thinks he already knows everything there is to
know so why why read books why listen to experts
why bother to go out there and find wise elders
and sages to study with why do all that when
i already know everything of course the fool doesn't contemplate
or self-reflect this is key for the fool it's impossible
to be a fool if you self-reflect a lot because
the more you self-reflect the more you see how you
act like a fool the more you see the consequences
and the suffering that this foolishness creates in your life
and then it turns into a sort of self-correcting mechanism
self-reflection does but the fool is too busy he's too
distracted by the externalities of life you know chasing pleasure
and other external things doesn't leave any time to sit
to reflect to contemplate to deeply think things through to
ask questions the fool just wants answers the fool isn't
willing to do the actual intellectual work to derive his
own answers by asking deep questions the fool thinks that
hey if you can just tell me the answers that'll
just be a shortcut and that is in general the
fool's folly is that he's looking for shortcuts in life
everything you know how how can i make it easy
how can i make it comfortable how can i make
it most convenient and in doing that you know the
fool thinks that by trying to have the easy life
his life will be easy but counterintuitively the opposite happens
when you try to go for the easy life your
life becomes hard whereas if you just embrace the difficulty
and challenge of life faced emotional labor head-on didn't avoid
responsibility then your life would actually start to become easier
the fool doesn't see value in truth the fool confuses
truth with whatever serves him because the way the fool
thinks if it doesn't serve me like if the truth
what what is the truth going to do for me
if the truth doesn't give me pleasure and it doesn't
get me money and sex and it doesn't make me
comfortable and oftentimes truth is uncomfortable if the truth doesn't
make me comfortable does make me feel good immediately then
what's the use of truth or the fool confuses his
personal biases and beliefs and dogmas and ideology for the
truth like the ten commandments that's the truth whatever whatever
reinforces my existing worldview that's the truth that's a very
foolish epistemic mistake of course the fool is generally unconcerned
with existential questions feels that they're uh just philosophy just
mental masturbation doesn't see the utility and existential questioning generally
speaking the fool lacks awareness lacks consciousness that should be
obvious given how much we've talked about consciousness on this
channel the fool is oblivious to the problem of self-deception
the fool externalizes deception as something that is coming from
the outside so oftentimes the fool that's why the fool
falls for things like conspiracy theories because it's very tempting
to think that somebody else is fooling you when in
fact the foolishness is coming from within you but because
the fool doesn't self-reflect and doesn't study one's own self-deceptions
the fool is ignorant of such things and therefore the
fool has many enemies and people that he judges and
hates and blames and scapegoats outside externally so the fool
will apply skepticism remember we talked about the distinction between
true versus false skepticism the fool will apply false skepticism
weaponized skepticism at external enemies and not apply the skepticism
correctly to his own worldview and to his own mind
and this just reinforces his foolishness because of this the
fool is gullible and easily tricked and manipulated because actually
the fool has first of all first and foremost fooled
himself once he's fooled himself thinking that he's all smart
and all-knowing and that he has life figured out and
then his priorities are straight thinking he's got all that
figured out of course his whole view of life now
is backwards and so now he's very easy to fool
and manipulate because all he's doing he's just chasing pleasure
and comfort and avoiding painful things and fear and so
you can manipulate him very easily with these emotions of
course the fool is inexperienced so the fool will often
have very strong opinions about things that he has no
experience in whatsoever like what kind of healthcare system should
we have the fool knows that we should not have
socialized healthcare well does the fool have any experience with
healthcare no of course not but he knows that socialized
healthcare is evil you know likewise you know what kind
of economic system should we have well the fool knows
we should we should go full-on socialist the fool knows
that well this has the fool studied economics and how
economies work no the fool just knows that socialism is
you know capitalism is evil and socialism is good the
fool just knows that um now i'm not endorsing capitalism
here per se i mean there are foolish capitalists as
well as foolish socialists there there are fools in every
category of of ideology on health care on religion on
science on theism on atheism on everything right so we're
on economics so we're not um there are so many
fools to go around you'll find them everywhere so we're
not picking on any any one particular category fool here
but just yeah general a general inexperience when people have
strong opinions about things they have never read even a
single book about like a lot of fools you see
a lot of fools right-wing fools for example who will
who will have very strong opinions on feminism and they
saw feminism is destroying western civilization and blah blah blah
blah blah and you just the best thing to do
with one of these fools is just ask them how
many books of feminism have you read and of course
the answer is zero and yet have they have these
strong opinions about feminism and how feminism is destroying society
now again i don't want to pick i don't want
to pick on these people just that's just one example
right there's a lot of foolishness to go around in
and don't think that i only reserve foolishness for right
wingers i mean there's there's an enormous ocean of of
foolishness within the right wing uh you know politics and
so forth but there's there's plenty of foolishness in the
left wing as well i'm i'm more than happy put
to point out foolishness on the left but there's definitely
more of it on the right the fool sees wisdom
as foolishness so when a fool discovers this channel for
example or this video he'll listen to this and say
this is stupid this is foolishness why would i waste
my time on this see of course because that's how
the fool stays a fool and the fool is is
deeply committed to staying a fool the fool is proud
of his foolishness he's real open about it that's that's
one of the hallmarks of fools is that when you're
dealing with a really dense fool it's infuriating because you
think someone so inexperienced and so ignorant and so unaware
would at least have a little bit of humility but
no no no they they blame you they gaslight easy
the fool will gaslight you because the fool will will
cast himself as the expert in the situation you know
like the fool who has just learned about enlightenment or
something like that or just learned about god the possibility
of god or love will come to you and try
to convince you someone who's maybe been studying this stuff
for five 10 20 years you know doing a lot
of work inner work going to meditation retreats the fool
has not gone to a single meditation retreat has hardly
read a single book about non-duality whatever but then the
fool will come and try to lecture you about non-duality
and act all proud about it yeah and then you
have to suffer this fool and so the fool tries
to get you down to his level it's like uh
it's like that old saw about you know wrestling with
pigs you never want to wrestle with a pig because
uh you'll both get dirty in the mud but the
pig will enjoy it so that's that's how foolishness is
you know a fool tries to entangle you and it
tries to entangle the wise into into a debate into
sort of a mudslinging contest and if you're wise you
have to be very careful to avoid that so as
you become more wise you learn how to deal with
fools in a wise way because if you they try
to get you to act like them once you start
to act like them then you're both fools together and
then of course you lose and he wins because then
he has company and fools love the company of other
fools because then it makes them feel secure it makes
them feel like they're right so one of the most
dangerous things is to find a group of fools who
all behave like fools together and who reinforce their own
foolishness this has been the cause of wars and genocides
and evil for as long as mankind has existed the
fool of course is very close-minded the fool doesn't understand
the importance and value of open mindedness and the fool
will try to resist any efforts to open his mind
and of course the fool will gaslight you the open-minded
one for trying to open his mind by calling you
close-minded for not accepting his close-mindedness the fool tends to
be very judgmental this is one of the easiest ways
you can assess the level of consciousness and maturity and
wisdom of a of a being is to take a
look at how judgmental they are the more judgmental they
are the uh the more like an animal they are
and the less judgmental they are the the more sage-like
and saintly they are so there's a direct correlation between
consciousness and understanding and uh judgment is inverse correlation the
fool is rash impatient easily agitated and very emotionally reactive
the fool is not willing to wait the fool wants
quick results the fool has a very short time frame
that he's operating within he's myopic he can't see very
far into the future he can't plan very far there's
actually a classic psychology experiment where they they take a
bunch of kids like elementary school kids put them in
a room and then they will put a marshmallow in
front of the of the kid and they'll say hey
if you can this marshmallow they put the marshmallow like
in front of the kid on a table and they
say if you can sit here for 15 minutes and
not eat this marshmallow then we'll give you two marshmallows
and then you can eat them both but if you
eat this marshmallow within the 15 minutes then you're not
gonna get a second one and they do this experiment
with a bunch of different kids separately they test each
kid this way and what they discover is a really
interesting correlation is that those kids who are able to
resist eating the marshmallow for 15 minutes and they get
the second one so ultimately they come out with more
in the end those kids end up going on and
being very successful in school and generally in life because
they're able to uh you know delay their gratification and
those people those kids who can't resist eating that marshmallow
well you can tell the kind of results they'll get
in life not very good results so in in essence
this this experiment is distinguishing between those kids who are
fools and those who are wise now of course there's
there's probably deep physiological genetic and other sorts of components
that are involved in this you know how easily you're
able to write regulate your your cravings and impulses this
probably has genetic components and so forth so i'm not
blaming these fools for being fools in fact if i
was blaming people for being fools and being very judgmental
about that then that would make me a fool right
so cause that would be judgment and judgment is foolish
so you have to understand that the majority of people
are fools and then one of the burdens of being
wise is that you have to tolerate these fools live
with them have them as your politicians and leaders and
bosses and and co-workers and friends and family members and
you gotta yeah you gotta tolerate them and that's one
of the burdens of becoming wise that's why a lot
of wise people choose to live on a mountaintop somewhere
or in a cave because they you know after a
certain point suffering these fools isn't very fun uh but
on the other hand it's a good test of your
wisdom because if these fools can knock you off your
center then that means you got more more conscious work
to do of course fools are egotistical and selfish you
could in a sense say that that's what foolishness ultimately
is fools follow the mob they're tribalistic they're highly conformist
because the fool doesn't think anything through for himself he
is just pinging off his environment his culture he just
believes his culture he believes his religion he believes whatever
school taught him doesn't question any of it and even
when he does question it he questions it in a
toxic and distorted way so so here's the irony when
it comes to conspiracy theories and fools is that uh
the majority of conspiracy theorists are in fact fools yet
they think themselves to be being intelligent when they're doing
their conspirizing conspiracy theorizing because they think they're being so
anti-conformist but actually they're being very very conformist when they're
subscribing to one of these wacky conspiracy theories now i'm
not saying necessarily that every single conspiracy theories is wrong
per se uh if you want a more detailed understanding
of my opinions on conspiracy theories see my episode on
conspiracy theories and the trickeries involved there conspiracy theories are
very tricky um i have a nuanced position on them
i don't dismiss all of them per se but my
key point when it comes to conspiracy theories is realize
the majority of conspiracy theorists are in fact fools they're
not wise people wise people don't subscribe to that many
conspiracy theories and that's because conspiracy theories are actually a
misuse of skepticism they're uh grounded in in in emotional
reactivity and paranoia and they're in fact highly conformist you
think you're being non-conformist when you conform to a conspiracy
theory something like the you know nasa fake the moon
landing you think you're being non-conformist actually you're being conformist
in a non-conformist sort of way and so it's tricking
you fools tend to be believers blind followers and they
tend to be very dogmatic because they're mentally rigid and
they're stubborn and they ground their sense of identity and
reality in belief unproven belief and hearsay ideas that they
got from their environment that they never questioned and that
they're too afraid to question because it's it takes emotional
labor to question all of your beliefs and of course
the fool is trying to avoid emotional labor because the
fool is looking for immediate gratification the fool can't control
his cravings tempted by immediate pleasure doesn't see the value
in doing emotional labor wants a shortcut wants a shortcut
in business wants a shortcut in relationships wants a shortcut
to sex with a shortcut to money what's a shortcut
to health you know the fool is the one who
you can convince that hey if you if you subscribe
to my all bacon diet all ice cream diet you're
going to lose weight the fool is the one who
will buy one of those devices that you just strap
it onto your stomach and then you press a button
and it gives you instant abs while you're sitting watching
you know reruns of seinfeld or something the fool is
who buys one of those and of course if you
haven't noticed this already most of society and the entire
advertising industry hundreds of billions of dollars every year go
into the advertising industry it's all designed to prey on
fools politics is all designed to to prey on fools
to get the votes of fools many structures in society
are designed for fools and why is that because the
majority of people are fools and fools are very easy
to fool and to control and to manipulate and to
extract value from to exploit fools leave themselves open to
exploitation so of course there's giant multi-billion dollar industries devoted
to the exploitation of fools how about the media take
a look for example at how fox news and the
entire right-wing media basically nowadays the entire right-wing media in
america talk show hosts youtubers conservative youtubers and so forth
i mean what are they doing they're exploiting fools that's
their that's that's what they do for a living that's
how they earn millions of dollars doing this their their
followers and subscribers are are gullible rubes the fool chases
money sex pleasure and fun the fool is undisciplined the
fool avoids responsibility oh that's a huge one the amount
of responsibility you take on is directly proportional to how
wise you are the fool is like an eel squirming
his way out of responsibility as much as possible and
the more foolish a person is the harder it is
to convince him of the importance of taking responsibility for
a problem see the fool doesn't want to take responsibility
for his problems and therefore his problems keep recurring and
he wonders like why am i so cursed well it's
because you're not taking responsibility for your problems but of
course he externalizes all his problems so because he doesn't
self-reflect he doesn't connect the dots between how the problem
out there is actually related to the problem in here
with himself because he thinks he knows everything um and
so therefore of course if you know if i know
everything then the only problem that can exist is out
there the problem is with you not with me because
i already know everything and i'm i'm i'm i'm the
good guy i can't be the bad guy that's how
the fool thinks and so of course now all the
responsibility is thrown out there then the problems can't be
solved because all problems ultimately boil down to you basically
the fool is self-biased partial and partisan the fool cannot
see past his own self-biases again see my episode about
self-biased very foundational episode super important concept the fool takes
reality and things for granted the fool tends to be
very entitled tends to just expect things to come easily
doesn't appreciate the cost of things for example the fool
just expects something like good government to just be there
and to work for him the fool doesn't understand that
good government doesn't just exist it didn't just grow on
a tree good government comes from conscious citizens creating and
participating in that government and reinforcing it and maintaining it
and safeguarding it against fools but the fool just sort
of assumes that all government good government has been around
forever no good government is a very recent invention and
it's rare even now in the 21st century but see
the fool takes such things for granted very characteristically the
fool lacks balance and moderation the fool is always swinging
his pendulum to one side or the other all sorts
of extremes ideological extremes or gets stuck in something the
fool doesn't understand that balance balance requires wisdom and balance
also requires flexibility because balance is a dynamic notion not
a static notion so while for example some degree of
uh let's say some degree of religion or spirituality can
be a good thing when you push it to its
extremes and you turn the spirituality or the religion into
some into some dogma or some power structure and you
just believe it blindly that becomes a radical form of
it and then that turns into a bad thing so
for example the fool doesn't understand that maybe the ten
commandments were effective two thousand years ago for the people
who lived two thousand years ago that was a good
sort of a general list of guidelines that they should
follow but 2 000 years later now in modern society
applying those 10 commandments and holding them religiously that's not
balance balance would be actually to rethink those rules for
modern times but the fool doesn't have enough mental flexibility
to do that because his mind has just been programmed
with those 10 rules and he's just being robotic about
it of course the fool doesn't learn from mistakes doubles
down on his mistakes and ignorance and also doesn't apologize
unable to genuinely apologize the fool is immature the fool
has a short attention span is that easily distracted by
things spends most of his time distracted by minutia and
not focusing on the really important stuff in life the
existential stuff in life gets lost the fool can't keep
his eye on the ball the fool does not invest
in himself long term uh i guess you could boil
it down to this you know like when winter is
coming the wise person works hard to prepare for winter
whereas the fool parties and has fun and then when
winter comes he has no shelter no food and he
suffers through the cold long dark winter while the the
wise person has built himself a comfortable little nest that
he can use during the winter the fool avoids emotional
labor looking for shortcuts like we've said already the fool
cannot admit i don't know the fool thinks he knows
everything about everything no matter how little he's read or
studied the fool holds grudges and can't let things go
the fool characteristically talks a lot without thinking which is
called blabbermouthery loves to just talk and talk and talk
endless talking the fool can talk for hours loves to
opine on things takes his own opinions so seriously as
though they were the truth you see this with certain
political commentators radio talk show hosts they just blabber mouth
and blabbermouth about things that they have no expertise in
haven't read any books about they're just spitting their ideas
out there as though their uninformed opinions really matter very
much fools love to engage in gossip and speculation the
fool will push advice upon you unsolicited advice and usually
their device is black and white such as like my
advice to you is that you shouldn't do x y
and z because they're bad wrong and evil and this
is true for everybody and if you do these things
you're going to hell so don't do them that's the
fool's version of advice the fool doesn't understand the relativity
of advice that people have different situations there's different contexts
people need different types of advice at different times the
fool is not sensitive to any of these things because
the fool is so selfish and wrapped up in his
own self that he just assumed that everybody else is
just like him and therefore what works for him will
work for everybody else of course in fact his own
advice doesn't really work for him but he doesn't understand
that either because he doesn't self-reflect enough to see that
even his own advice that he's following that he got
from the bible or wherever even that isn't really working
for him but yet he's passionate about pushing it upon
others because that's just a distraction from looking inwards to
see that actually even his own vice advice doesn't really
work for him because he doesn't really have a deep
understanding of himself or of reality or of life but
he needs to pretend like he does so he spends
a lot of time trying to convince others it's a
sort of a compensating defense mechanism the fool makes a
lot of excuses and rationalizes a lot justifies a lot
without realizing that these justifications and rationalizations are just very
convenient narratives that the ego mind constructs it's part of
the self-deception that one needs to self-reflect and to become
aware of these justifications are actually deeply self-biased and are
distorting one's view of reality the fool just assumes that
his view of reality is reality is the truth without
recognizing the the divergence that's possible the deep divergence that's
possible between those two oftentimes being hyper rational and hyperlogical
actually makes one a fool this is one of the
counterintuitive things you would think that well if i'm going
to be hypological throughout my life that's going to safeguard
me against foolishness and actually it ends up being the
opposite because you swing your pendulum too much to one
side the rationality becomes too extreme and too straight jacketing
and too limited such that you're actually not able to
develop wisdom wisdom is not hyper rationality the way that
some highly intelligent overly intellectual overly cerebral people think because
the head the left hemisphere is just one part of
part of life uh sort of the masculine cognitive approach
to reality analysis is just one aspect of life there's
also synthesis there's the feminine side there's the emotional side
there's the intuitive side there's the right hemisphere and uh
and in fact those are more important even than the
than the left but when you're hyper rational you don't
understand this you don't appreciate this and that makes you
a fool and if you're familiar with spiral dynamics then
basically tier 1 cognition is various gradations of foolishness so
stage red is more foolish than stage blue stage blue
is more foolish than [Music] than orange and orange is
slightly less foolish than the ones underneath it and so
as you go up the stages you become less foolish
you become more wise so what are some examples of
fools well i gave you a few already but uh
especially right now in the recent political climate that we're
in uh the best example of a fool is donald
trump he is the king of the fools and of
course it's no surprise that his mega followers all the
people who believe in trump who defend trump who think
that trump is some sort of three-dimensional chess playing strategic
stage yellow genius these people are the biggest fools of
them all it's it's a movement of fools led by
a fool that's what trumpism is and this was obvious
if you were wise this was obvious to you before
trump even became president this was obvious but uh but
if you weren't ridiculously wise it should have become obvious
to you a year or two into the trump administration
and then if you were even a little less wise
then maybe it took you four years until trump lost
the election and if you were a little less wise
it took you until january 6 with the insurrection and
then if you're a total fool then even after the
insurrection you still think that trump is some sort of
genius and savior and see yeah fools fools think that
their foolish leaders are actually geniuses and that's exactly what
you see in the magazine that's why you see they
subscribe to all these ridiculous conspiracy theories that's why they're
prone to violence to emotional reactivity projection denial scapegoating blaming
they're very judgmental the entire the entire list that i
gave you they check every box see and if you're
wise you could have seen that from a mile away
others other examples of fools stage blue religious people spiral
dynamic stage blue so these can be like orthodox jews
christians muslims hindus they're pretty big fools that doesn't mean
that their traditions and their spiritual teachings don't have deep
wisdom within them there's deep wisdom to be found within
christianity within islam within hinduism within judaism but for the
most part the people who believe in that wisdom see
what they do is they a fool will take wisdom
and turn it into a rigid set of dogmas that
they're inflexible about they don't don't they haven't derived they
haven't contemplated they haven't implemented in their own lives they
just adopt them as beliefs and ideas make an identity
out of it and then see the fools took the
wisdom and they turned into foolishness so i'm not criticizing
the original wisdom i'm criticizing the fools and what they've
done with that wisdom and this has been the problem
of religion since the very dawn of human civilization is
that very wise people articulated very wise principles for how
to live life but then because the majority were fools
they took those principles they misunderstood them they turned them
into dogmas they turned them into biases and they started
wars over them even though the whole intent behind the
wisdom was to make people more peaceful and loving and
compassionate towards one another and to realize the oneness and
sameness of of uh of mankind and all living beings
but this is lost on a fool see one of
the trickeries with wisdom is that you can't just teach
it by rote through memorization wisdom is a sort of
a a living dynamic creative force within you that you
cultivate it's not wisdom is implicit you can't explicate wisdom
you can't turn wisdom into a set of ten commandments
as soon as you do it stops being wisdom it
turns into foolishness because wisdom is the ability to have
that keen discernment and to be adaptable you see and
a set of rigid principles isn't adaptable because situations change
time changes new technology evolves mankind is going to be
altering its dna soon and all sorts of things like
this computer technology transhumanism you know man machine interfaces this
is all coming this is going to lead to huge
changes in how humans interact with with reality and themselves
and this is going to require totally new ways of
thinking about life and ourselves and nature and gender and
society and all this sorts of stuff but fools are
rigid and they don't want to change their ways of
thinking because to change your ways of thinking you have
to contemplate and you have to self-reflect and you have
to derive new answers to new challenges and problems but
the fool doesn't do the fool is just acting like
a robot the fool is unconscious other examples of fools
are drug addicts and criminals conspiracy theorists folks like alex
jones so alex jones is a gigantic fool he leads
a kabbalah fool so everyone who follows alex jones is
a fool it's another example of you know a giant
fool leading a bunch of other fools off a cliff
which is so there's not an accident why alex jones
and his audience there's a huge overlap between that and
donald trump and his audience because they're both uh herds
of fools uh in general any time you see a
mob of people it's it's gonna be it's gonna be
foolishness absurd foolishness and uh spiral dynamics stage green progressives
leftists are also prone to some of this foolishness now
stage green is not as foolish as stage blue but
there's still quite a bit of foolishness going on in
stage green so don't think you're out of the woods
just because you're green or just because you're progressive or
a leftist be very mindful of that another example that
comes to mind is sports fanatics the tribalism of sports
this is tailored to fools the entire sports industry multi-billion
dollar industry of sports selling of all the jerseys and
the and you know the the stadium ticket seats and
all this and the sort of tailgate parties and all
this sporting fanatic stuff that society has invented it it's
a mechanism designed to extract money from fools now if
you appreciate sports per se that doesn't necessarily make you
a fool i mean i can appreciate some of the
athleticism and the talent that goes into actual you know
performing sports feats i can appreciate that i'm not saying
everything just because if you like sports you're automatically a
fool i'm saying something more nuanced than that i'm just
saying the industry itself is built upon catering to fools
through the tribalism of most sports even the olympics you
know the idea that different countries around the world will
will gather together and try to outdo one another in
lifting some weight or you know going down some ski
slope but then taking taking deep pride in that and
then trying to you know trying to um denigrate the
other teams like this this is this is foolishness examples
of foolish behavior gambling smoking drugs hedonism not using a
condom gossip tabloids junk media the entire right-wing media ecosystem
chasing get-rich-quick schemes cheating people cheating on people criminal behavior
staying in toxic relationships anger blame scapegoating joining cults and
ideologies conspiracy theories tribalism wasting your life smoking weed and
playing games and uh conformity in general conformity because conformity
is the opposite of thinking something deeply through for yourself
and deriving your own answers now it's important you understand
that there are two types of fools oh yes two
types now the first type is the type that you're
probably thinking of this is the uneducated rube we're gonna
call him these are your maga types these are your
your stage blue religious type of people who just you
know believe you know some fundamentalist islamic you know person
believes in sharia law as the divine word of allah
and so forth and just is stuck in that and
that's it and you won't convince them otherwise so this
is sort of the uneducated group these people have not
gone gone deeply to school they have not read many
books they have not go to gone to university um
their basic problem is they're just uneducated and ignorant and
then everything else basically stems just from that and in
a sense you feel sorry for them because the majority
of mankind is the uneducated rube they have not been
educated and this is not per se their fault a
lot of times it's simply because they were born into
a situation you know many parts in third in third
world countries uh many parts of the world simply don't
afford opportunities for education these are our relatively recent developments
and i'm very grateful that i was born to a
family that grew up in a part of the world
where education was available and i went to good schools
and so forth and i understand that easily that could
not have been the case where i boarded some other
country right so uh so yeah so education education is
extremely important and we need to make it as freely
available to as many people as possible but of course
part of the problem with fools is that they don't
want that so when you when you try to offer
free college education to these rubes like trump supporters they
actually get offended by this idea oh free college education
they call it socialism and of course that's because they
are energy in fact they demonize education they're anti-intellectual uh
many of the right-wingers and conservatives they're deeply anti-intellectual because
their entire world view is an affront to the intellect
so of course they have to demonize the intellectuals and
the uh uh the college professors and so forth call
them crazy socialist liberals and whatever and uh it's tragic
because they're demonizing the one thing that would actually be
a fundamental solution to the problem so so there's these
uneducated rubes and then here's what's a little trickier is
that you have fools who are educated shrewd and ambitious
materialists and because they have been educated and because they
fancied themselves to be very clever and strategic they think
that they have somehow avoided the problem of being a
fool they can't be a fool you know how can
i be a fool if i went to harvard how
can i be a fool if i work at goldman
sachs if i work on wall street if i'm a
ceo of a large company how can i be a
fool leo i'm no fool i'm very strategic i plan
things out but you are a fool fundamentally because you're
still disconnected your priorities are disconnected from the existential this
tends to be true of these silicon valley types the
ceos various kinds of materialistic professionals wall street hedge fund
managers these types of people really if we want to
be honest these people are fools they're fools but they
can be very successful fools they can have high iqs
they can make a killing on wall street they can
be good at doing business banking loans some technology stuff
even they can be real good at that and so
that creates the illusion that they can't be fools and
yet they are because these people they are lost in
materialism and they're spiritually disconnected from existence and in fact
they're leading mankind technologically off a cliff where we have
very high technology but very low wisdom and when that
happens when the when the degree of technol of technological
power increases but the wisdom of mankind stays low or
even decreases thanks to things like social media these days
and and so forth this is very dangerous it's a
situation that's getting out of balance their priorities are backwards
they're still placing the low above the high maybe it's
not drugs maybe it's not dogmatic religion but it could
be sex it could be technology it could be money
it could be success and ambition and fame for their
own sake because usually these people are are spiritually clueless
and disconnected and so i wouldn't call these people wise
even though they're successful and a lot of times in
our culture these days it's easy to confuse success with
wisdom or even academic intelligence with wisdom there are many
i could name names but i won't to uh to
keep from embarrassing them but uh but there are many
even scientists and phds and professors and public intellectuals these
days who i would consider fools though they're very smart
and well-spoken and well-educated and they have great credentials and
degrees but they're still fundamentally fools and they're misleading the
people who listen to them and who are fans of
them now of course being a fool or being wise
comes in many degrees right so we're not just saying
this is a binary so that's why we have all
these different sort of levels and categories of fools and
and so forth so again my my standards i have
a bias here my standards for what i consider a
wise person are very very high most people's standards are
lower so therefore you might look at one of these
scientists or whatever and think of him as wise and
in a certain relative sense he is wise you know
relative to a drug addict yeah he's wise relative to
a rube who didn't finish high school yeah he is
wise but is he as wise as the wisest of
mankind no not even close what are some examples of
those what are some examples of the wise greek philosophers
many of them socrates plato aristotle marcus aurelius the buddha
christ lao tzu confucius rumi mystics throughout the ages yogis
sages saints zen masters the founding fathers of america the
writers of the constitution the us constitution some scientists some
exceptional scientists like albert einstein who were really more than
scientists they were philosophers and then happened to be scientists
as well some exceptional political leaders like maybe gandhi and
others throughout the ages mostly it's the sages why is
it there's there's a there's a correlation there seems to
be between wisdom and philosophy and spirituality interesting contemplate that
you might wonder what is the highest wisdom of all
if we rank all the different wisdoms that there could
be what's the highest the highest wisdom is infinite love
the highest wisdom is selflessness the highest wisdom is that
everything that occurs in the universe is an outflow of
infinite love and infinite intelligence and consciousness the highest wisdom
is god not the idea of god not the god
you were told about in sunday school but actual god
you as god god as the universe now there's a
lot more i could say about that and i have
go check out my episodes about such things as what
is consciousness what is intelligence what is love um see
my episode explaining the ultimate nature of reality i won't
go too deeply into infinite love here but one day
i'm hoping you will discover for yourself what infinite love
is and how everything that occurs in the universe is
an outflow of infinite love and so when you when
you become conscious of that you'll understand why i say
that the highest wisdom is that everything is love and
that's why judgment judgmentalism is inversely correlated with wisdom and
with consciousness is because the more wise you become the
more conscious you become and eventually you become infinitely conscious
when you become infinitely conscious you realize everything is infinite
love at that point all judgment turns into pure delusion
and ignorance and that falls away and then you realize
that every judgment every criticism is uh is utter foolishness
because of course reality is infinitely perfect and the inability
to see that perfection is one's selfishness and ego which
gets in the way so what is the source of
all wisdom where does it come from is it the
brain that's producing wisdom no wisdom actually comes from consciousness
and everything is consciousness the universe is consciousness and the
highest wisdom basically is selflessness so if you were infinitely
intelligent imagine you had an iq of infinity what would
you do how would you behave you would do the
wisest thing that could possibly be done which is you
would choose to be totally selfless and totally loving because
you'd have to be an idiot not to because there's
no point to existence other than infinite love because that's
what existence is why would it be anything else if
you think it's anything else it's just because you're you're
not conscious and you're foolish and so then wisdom becomes
aligning yourself with the truth with consciousness with selflessness with
love and then living your life in accordance to that
and that is the existential dimension see if your life
is missing this existential dimension if you think that what
i'm talking about here's just some woo philosophy stuff it's
disconnected from the pragmatic aspects of life you're missing the
existential core that's why you can't make wise decisions is
because the the mundane everyday little petty survival stuff that
you do has to be grounded in something higher something
more fundamental that's what you're missing and that's why your
life doesn't go so good and that's why you can't
find peace and happiness because you're missing this this existential
component which is why i say that these wall street
types and successful ceo types that they're still fools because
they're still missing this existential component because if they found
this existential component they would leave wall street and they
would leave their ceo job and uh they would do
something else but of course they haven't found it so
they don't know what they're missing now how do you
develop wisdom practically speaking what do you do consciousness work
raise your consciousness the higher your conscious the more wise
you're going to be is this is a direct correlation
here self-reflection introspection contemplation deep questioning of everything the more
obvious the thing is the more you should question it
derive your own answers don't ask others for answers don't
take my answers as truth derive your own answers a
deep curiosity about life which is necessary to fuel you
to do all this questioning and contemplating another way to
develop wisdom is through massive experience failure mistakes and suffering
but you have to do this in a conscious way
so if you're failing in an unconscious way if you're
making mistakes in an unconscious way if you're suffering an
unconscious way then that's not that could just make you
more foolish so you have to suffer consciously make mistakes
consciously learn from your mistakes go out there and deliberately
design your life to give you massive diverse experience don't
live in a single city your whole life or in
a single country travel around explore talk to different people
don't just hang out with christians if you were born
a christian talk to muslims and hindus and atheists and
whatever expand your range of experience read a wide variety
of books study a wide variety of topics this all
gets you experience this helps a lot with developing wisdom
practice selflessness contemplate what selflessness is and why it's the
highest ideal in value because wisdom is directly proportional to
your ability to be selfless also simply value wisdom most
people don't even value wisdom value it love it study
it study wisdom study wise people follow wise people rather
than following fools the majority of mankind listens to and
follows fools so of course they're going to end up
being fools themselves they listen to fools on the news
they listen to fools and on the radio they listen
to pool fools on through podcasts they listen to pool
fools giving their uh political opinions so of course they're
going to turn out to be fools themselves also importantly
study foolishness study other fools the deeper you study fools
the more you're you're shocked and amazed and horrified uh
the more you see the the consequences of the foolishness
the less you want to be like that also of
course study yourself very deeply study your own psychology study
the trickeries of your own mind see my three-part series
called self-deception where i outline many self-deception mechanisms read high-quality
books study history learn lessons from history explore diverse perspectives
this is one of the biggest ways people stay fools
is they get locked into one paradigm one way of
seeing the world whether it's the christian version the hindu
version the atheist version the materialist version none of these
will suffice to get you to the highest wisdom so
explore many perspectives try to go meta on all perspectives
jump outside of these perspectives try to realize the limitations
of every perspective another way to do it is observation
without judgment i have an episode called learning equals observation
go check that out that will explain this process observation
is a critical skill for you to learn if you
want to become wise and one of the best role
models for this is leonardo da vinci the guy was
sort of a genius of just pure observation a big
part of his success was just purely observing things observing
things as they are drawing them thinking about them and
then yeah as you observe you don't judge the thing
you just observe it you'll be amazed at how much
you can learn how much wisdom you can get from
just without any bias or prejudice observing a thing for
a long time very patiently another way to develop wisdom
is through self-education and lifelong learning so the most wisdom
you'll develop is after university university doesn't really build wisdom
it teaches you how to pass tests and memorize stuff
if you really want to learn wisdom you gotta take
your own education into your own hands take responsibility for
your own education and spend the rest of your life
educating yourself and enjoy the process of education highly value
education and turn it into like a hobby that you
do other ways include psychedelics of course psychedelics will skyrocket
your your wisdom through the roof meditation as well solitude
taking lots of time alone this gives you time to
think and to reflect and contemplate solo retreats will skyrocket
your wisdom and lastly stop chasing pleasure your cravings are
distracting you from developing wisdom and they're keeping you a
fool there is no good life without wisdom hopefully you
recognize that if you're a fool and you're proud of
being a fool you're going to be constantly tormented by
life scrambling to survive agitated and never finding the peace
and fulfillment that you know deep down you should be
able to find but you don't know how to find
that's because you're missing the wisdom you're missing that existential
component you're missing philosophy see philosophy is not just some
uh airy fairy ideas that that academics come up with
that's a bastardization of philosophy philosophy literally means the love
of wisdom the love of wisdom so if the things
i've been talking about here resonate with you they make
you feel good they give you sort of a warm
fuzzy feeling when i'm talking about wisdom that is you
resonating with the wisdom that i'm sharing with you that
is your innate love for wisdom which makes you a
philosopher which should make you interested in philosophy the study
of wisdom but not just the study of wisdom the
pursuit and the embodiment of wisdom it's not enough to
read books about wisdom that's just the beginning then you
got to start to actually implement it embody it and
again philosophy is not about how many books you read
or how many philosophers you've studied really what philosophy is
about it's about contemplating deeply questioning reality for yourself deriving
your own answers and connecting with the existential core of
reality that i was talking about with truth with consciousness
with love with selflessness so here's a few last points
on how to apply the information from this episode spend
time contemplating what is wisdom i've given you all the
answers basically but that's not good enough you have to
derive them for yourself because how do you know what
i'm saying here is true you don't know unless you
derive it for yourself so keep contemplating this question until
you develop a very solid intuitive grasp for what wisdom
refers to once you have that it's sort of a
magic ability now it's almost like you've got this new
magic concept or word that you can use to ask
powerful questions for example but this only works when you
know what wisdom means once you know what wisdom means
you can ask questions such as you're in some situation
you can ask yourself is this wise or what would
be the wisest move in this situation or you could
ask the question of like how am i being a
fool in life or you could ask the question how
can i become more wise or you can ask yourself
a question in a certain in a certain situation let's
say you're you're listening to some speaker in some video
or at a lecture or whatever and he's telling you
something you can ask yourself is the stuff he's saying
coming from a place of wisdom maybe you're listening to
a politician on tv is what he's saying coming from
wisdom but this assumes you know what wisdom is if
you know that you can ask that question that's a
powerful question that will that will change how you see
that person or that situation it'll immediately cut through all
the is this coming from wisdom someone's giving you some
advice your parents are giving some advice you can just
ask yourself is that is there advice coming from wisdom
you could ask the question what is the wisest way
to live life for me specifically what is the why
what is this the wisest way for me to live
life and then as you contemplate that you'll get the
answers what's beautiful about wisdom in this whole philosophy process
is that it's a sort of a self-bootstrapping process that's
what's empowering about it you don't really need anyone else's
input i mean you will of course use other people's
feedback and you'll learn from other people sure you'll read
books okay but that fundamentally you don't need any of
that all you really need is your own self turn
the willingness to turn into yourself and to self reflect
and to to work through this stuff i mean it
takes work that's why people don't do it but the
good news is that you can do it and in
this way it makes you very self-reliant once you master
this process you don't really need books anymore you don't
need experts you don't need other people to give you
advice and this is very empowering otherwise you feel like
a victim all the time why are you coming to
me to tell you how to live your life wouldn't
it be nicer if you could just turn inwards and
go to yourself to tell yourself how to live your
own life wouldn't that be much more elegant well you
can do that but you have to develop it you're
not born with that ability you have to practice it
over years and decades until you develop it and then
you'll be amazed one of the most amazing things you'll
discover in life is that the most profound answers are
within you if only you bothered to go looking for
them there stuff you don't even know is there is
there but it takes time to mine it out and
once you understand what wisdom is you have an intuitive
grasp of it then all i got to tell you
is just to remind you to if you want to
live a good life follow the wisest course of action
in every situation now you might wonder well that's very
vague what is the wisest course of action in every
situation well but if you know what wisdom is if
you've contemplated it then you can always ask yourself what
is the wisest course of action in every situation that
i'm in with my finances with my relationships with my
spirituality with whatever see you're going to develop this keen
discernment this keen sense of judgment when i say keen
sense of judgment i don't mean you're going to be
judging people i'm using the word judgment they are more
like a better word might be assessment or evaluation which
is different than judging people for being bad people i
don't mean that and just set the intention to be
wise do you want to be wise if you do
how badly do you want to be wise are you
willing to set your intention to be wise and then
to follow that intention every day for the next 30
years of your life if you do that you're going
to become lies but you have to stick stick with
it it's not enough just to set your attention once
and then forget about it tomorrow you have to keep
constantly reminding yourself this is my intention is to be
wise and to be pursuing wisdom and then as you
do that resources will come your way books you'll see
books articles videos podcasts you'll find the stuff that helps
you to find and locate the wisdom you need and
try to identify sources of the highest wisdom you can
learn to do this too if you're reading a book
or listening to a teacher or a speaker you can
always you can always ask the question how wise is
this guy is he speaking from wisdom or not is
this the highest wisdom and then of course gravitate toward
towards those sources which your wisdom tells you is the
highest wisdom now of course the problem is that if
you're a fool you're going to tend to think that
what you're listening to is the highest wisdom because it's
just reinforcing your biases so like if you're some you
know if you're some maga um rube and you're listening
to some right wing radio talk show host who's telling
you everything you want to hear you know just validating
all of your prejudices and hatreds and judgments and um
and so forth and then you ask yourself well is
this person wise and you're gonna say yes of course
he's wise because you're just you're it's just reinforcing right
so so it won't work if you're a fool the
advice i'm giving you will will only work if you
spend a lot of time contemplating and studying what wisdom
is it'll take you five ten years to kind of
develop that intuition this is some advanced advice so don't
delay get started contemplating what wisdom is just because you've
watched this episode does not mean you understand what wisdom
is you have to now contemplate it for yourself and
if you want to some advice on how to do
that how to contemplate i have multiple episodes on how
to contemplate i have one called how to contemplate using
a journal if you want to use a written form
of contemplation i have other episodes explaining how to contemplate
just in your mind see my episode called contemplation and
how to contemplate i have i have multiples of them
i have an episode on introspection that will also be
very valuable introspections basically a form of self-reflection go check
that out so i've covered many of these techniques in
the past all right that's it i'm done here please
click that like button for me and come check out
actualize.org that's my website you will find the blog exclusive
video content on the blog and other stuff that i
link you'll find the life purpose course there the book
list the book list has tons of wisdom books on
it um you can support me on patreon.com actualized and
the final note that i'll make here is what is
actualize.org but a wisdom school that was the original intent
behind actualizatory is to teach wisdom and if you like
that org you resonate with it it's because you're a
philosopher and because you can appreciate wisdom people who can't
appreciate wisdom won't stay with this channel very long this
is one of the most important and wisest things you
can do in your life is to take that little
kernel of appreciation of wisdom that you have and then
to cultivate that over over the years patiently remember patience
this takes patience this takes a long vision because you
can't do this in just a few days or even
a year it takes a long vision that you're gonna
slowly graduate gradually cultivate your wisdom you're gonna turn cultivation
of your wisdom into a hobby that you do for
the rest of your life and then to chip away
at that every day a little bit by reading a
book by watching a video by doing some contemplation by
going and meditating by self-reflecting by talking to a therapist
you know whatever method you want to use taking some
psychedelics whatever and then it adds up over the years
it adds up it adds up it adds up and
then you're so glad you did it it's the best
investment you can do there's no better investment in yourself
than to cultivate your wisdom and i challenge you to
find a higher source of wisdom than actualize.org because my
whole intention behind my work is i'm always asking myself
like what is the deepest wisdom that exists within all
of the works of mankind let me study all of
those works let me contemplate all of the wisdom that's
there to validate it because i can't just take it
on blind faith let me read it study it compile
it organize it contemplate it add to it improve it
and then share it with you and so i i
dare you to find a higher source of wisdom that's
not to say there aren't really good teachers out there
there are but also you have to you have to
consider the breadth of the wisdom that is being offered
here with actualized.org see we're not just offering the highest
wisdom in a very narrow capacity we're also widening our
approach such that it includes also an understanding of politics
and economics and dating and relationships and health and society
and all basically all of the all of the aspects
of life what would happen if you had wisdom across
all of those how valuable would that be to you
what would that be worth to you is that worth
working for if it is then get started what are
you waiting for you
