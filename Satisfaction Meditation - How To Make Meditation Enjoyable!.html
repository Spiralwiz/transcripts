[Music] all right i got a new meditation technique for
you it's a very simple very effective meditation technique it's
somewhat counter-intuitive and it builds upon a previous episode that
i released about satisfaction the title of that episode is
the root solution to people pleasing and loneliness so a
lot of people like that episode and some people even
asked after that episode like how do i embody that
how do i practice just being satisfied alone by myself
not needing any kind of external validation or stimulation for
my source of happiness so this meditation is really a
companion to that episode you could think of this as
a part two i wanted to do this episode separately
because this is going to be hands-on and it's not
going to be a bunch of theory here we're going
to get into actually doing it it's going to be
sort of i'm going to try to keep this short
and sweet so but just to set us up here
for the practice the point of this meditation is to
take back your control of that reward mechanism that we
talked about in that episode so usually for your happiness
you're relying upon rewards from somebody else somebody loving you
or having some sort of external material conditions go your
way whether it's sex money or some material possession that
you want to acquire or other people giving you praise
things like that and so what we want to do
is we want to develop a practice of just literally
sitting and being without doing anything and just basking remember
that idea of basking in the present moment and just
being deeply satisfied with it and that's it it's literally
that simple but of course the trick is that you
have to practice it and the trick is that your
mind doesn't like just being satisfied with existing with being
with existence your mind wants something more your mind wants
to do stuff your mind wants to think stuff you
want your mind wants to fantasize it has ambitions it
has fears and problems that it wants to turn away
on endlessly and uh all of that takes your happiness
away it robs you of your natural joy so let's
do the practice right now are you ready set aside
all your distractions set aside a good 10 minutes to
do this practice with me here i'm going to guide
you through it and give you some pointers all right
so set away all distractions and let's practice this so
the idea is that you're just going to sit there
with your eyes open and you're not going to try
to manipulate or control anything in your experience you're just
going to sit there you're not going to try to
stop thoughts or trying to achieve any kind of awakened
enlightened state or any kind of mystical experience or anything
like that you're just gonna sit and you're going to
fully be satisfied allow yourself to be satisfied with this
present moment and that's it can you do that try
it right now i'm going to try doing it along
with you here so what you should notice is that
as you're actually doing this it's a little bit of
a shift it's a subtle shift in your awareness whereas
normally your mind wants to think about the future or
go into the past to bring up problems because our
problems exist either in the past or in the future
we lose touch with the beauty and the calm and
the peace that is present right now and we take
what's here right now for granted we overlook its beauty
because it's not relevant to our survival plans and goals
and problems so make that subtle shift of bringing your
awareness into the present right now and sort of proactively
start to appreciate the present so if there's one thing
you're doing in this meditation and i'm going to be
calling this the satisfaction meditation if there's one thing that
you're really doing the only thing you're doing is you're
nudging yourself gently nudging yourself to be satisfied with just
this so just try to nudge yourself to be satisfied
with just this right here what might help you is
just to notice if there's just a sort of a
a positive joyful feeling in your body of maybe comfort
if you're sitting comfortably you can actually find some joy
and satisfaction in that although of course don't hinge your
satisfaction on that feeling of comfort because if you sit
there for long enough you might become uncomfortable and you
still want to be fundamentally satisfied so basically what we're
trying to get you to do is just be satisfied
with existing just with existing and furthermore now when you
start to get a little bit of satisfaction don't get
me wrong it's not going to be some sort of
ecstatic pleasure that you're in here we're not seeking for
ecstatic pleasure just satisfaction it's like ah this is nice
it's just nice to just sit and to be peaceful
and to not have to be chasing anything or thinking
about anything or trying to solve something with your mind
or trying to reach some sort of enlightened state or
attempting to be spiritual or mystical forget all that drop
all that let that go for now you can do
that later and during this moment this period for 10
or 20 minutes you're going to be doing this meditation
you're just going to be satisfied and you're just going
to focus on that satisfaction so actually hone your mind
into that feeling of satisfaction and as you do that
what you're going to do is you're going to almost
create like a sort of a positive feedback loop where
your consciousness of the satisfaction will start to feed on
itself by noticing the satisfaction and by focusing on it
you'll sort of be satisfied with the satisfaction so to
speak and that will build on itself and so just
allow that to build just sit there and become ever
more deeply satisfied for me how that feels when i'm
sitting here being satisfied it's like there's a satisfaction in
not having to do anything and then the more i
focus on that the more satisfying that becomes just not
having to do anything and then it's just a matter
of staying within that satisfaction for as long as you
can and try to keep your mind there because your
mind will want to wander your mind will tend to
wander off into your problems or the to-do list for
tomorrow that you got at work or how the satisfaction
stuff is just a waste of time and it's not
doing anything productive your mind will get very sneaky and
tricky and it'll it'll try to break you out of
the satisfaction you might start getting ideas like well wouldn't
it be nicer wouldn't this moment be improved if i
had some sex on top of it or if i
had some drugs on top of it or if i
had a mystical experience on top of this or if
um my friends were here and we were partying right
so your mind is going to be imagining sort of
like better scenarios than the present moment and as long
as you're gonna be doing that and you're gonna be
falling prey to those fantasies then you're not gonna be
satisfied so you have to let those go and just
be satisfied with this don't want anything other than this
what's here stop trying to chase for a better experience
so do this right now as i'm talking and try
to refine your ability to do this it takes some
practice now if you practice this consistently and for long
periods of time eventually what will happen is that that
satisfaction can turn into a into a very deep satisfaction
and pleasure and ultimately even bliss and it can turn
into love too why love well because if you're properly
doing this then what you'll start to notice is you'll
just start to fall in love with existence itself you'll
just fall in love with being conscious of being conscious
of being conscious of your satisfaction of being conscious of
existence just the love of existing that's ultimately what it
all boils down to that's the that's the rock bottom
of this practice is just a love for existence itself
see ordinarily we ignore that as we go about surviving
in the world we lose touch with just the joy
of existing because we're trying to solve something we're trying
to chase something down we're trying to improve how existence
feels well in this case we're not trying to improve
anything we're just existing and we're just being conscious of
our existence and we're taking satisfaction in that and it's
a it's not a deep ecstatic pleasure it's just a
mild form of satisfaction at first but if you do
this for hours and hours and days and weeks and
months and years you can train that up and build
it up into actually ecstatic levels of joy but don't
expect that and don't go chasing for it so one
of the things that i like about this satisfaction meditation
as we're going to call it from now on is
that personally for me one of the things that i
get hung up on when i try to meditate is
that i have this tendency to want to chase some
sort of mystical experience and this really with my meditation
especially if you've done psychedelics you know the kinds of
amazing crazy high states of consciousness that are possible but
that are not accessible to you right now and so
when you're meditating or you're doing yoga or something you're
it's sort of like there's a tendency to want to
like you're sitting there anticipating okay when is my enlightenment
going to happen or when am i going to reach
that mystical experience when is something cool going to happen
and that trips you up because that's a future oriented
sort of fantasy that you're trying to reach and usually
you never reach it so uh what helps me to
override that tendency that interferes with my meditation is to
just focus on being satisfied so in the past i
would meditate in order to achieve something really when i
meditated in the past i would be meditating towards enlightenment
towards awakening towards a mystical experience and while of course
you can do it that way um it can also
cause interference and become counterproductive because then you're looking towards
the future and really what you want is you want
to be more present and it also becomes frustrating because
you can sit there and meditate for an hour not
reach your enlightenment not reach your awakening not have your
mystical experience and then you feel bad after that hour
because it's over and then you're like ah damn nothing
happened this sucks i'm just wasting my time like how
can i speed this up what am i doing wrong
how can i meditate better and see then meditation just
becomes another sort of means to some end not an
end in itself so what we're doing here is we're
sort of we're turning it inwards and kind of circling
it back around so that the meditation is its own
end so you're not meditating to get somewhere meditation is
just satisfaction in this case see because if you're trying
to chase some higher state with your meditation that always
ensures that you're never going to be satisfied with the
majority of meditation can you see that because the very
definition of unhappiness and or dissatisfaction is that there's something
in your mind that you imagine you should have but
that you don't currently have and you'll only be happy
once you get it that ensures you're going to be
unhappy until you get that thing so the counter-intuitive move
here is to short-circuit that whole thing and just to
say why can't i just be satisfied right now and
then actually practice that turn that into a practice almost
like a challenge you set for yourself it's like how
satisfied can i be with nothing special how satisfied can
i be with just raw existence as it is without
needing to change it and this turns out to be
true happiness true happiness is nothing other than being satisfied
with exactly what is happening right now whatever that might
be that's the root of happiness any other definition of
happiness involves you chasing some future state which means that
you're going to be actually unhappy so how does this
connect with people pleasing and with loneliness as we've talked
about in that previous episode well with people pleasing you're
not satisfied with how things are you need people to
give you approval or love and so you tend to
do a lot of work for other people to get
their praise and to please them and that's become an
addiction for you and so of course you're never satisfied
even when you do get the praise it doesn't last
and it doesn't deeply fulfill you so the solution that
to that is to do this practice and just to
ground yourself in just being satisfied just with existence and
then when it comes to loneliness it's a similar situation
with loneliness in a sense what you're doing is you're
imagining that this moment could be improved by having more
people around you people to talk to to be intimate
with to share experiences with and so forth and while
that's fine there's nothing wrong with that per se if
you do this practice of just being satisfied just sitting
there and existing then what you'll notice during that period
when you're doing this practice is that you're not lonely
you're alone but you're not lonely because you're just satisfied
with existence and you don't need anything more and then
of course so see you can turn this into a
formal practice where you sit down and do this for
20 minutes a day or 60 minutes a day however
long you want you can do an entire week-long retreat
just sitting and being satisfied and nothing else regardless then
when you go out into the world and you're doing
stuff by yourself maybe you go traveling you go drive
somewhere you go to a restaurant whatever you're doing see
after a while you build up that muscle and now
you could just be satisfied you can sort of apply
that satisfaction meditation into real life situations even when you're
standing in line at the grocery store it's a long
line maybe there's some problem with the cash register so
it takes a while you're standing for five minutes waiting
ordinarily you just sort of be pissed off and annoyed
why this thing is not happening faster but if you're
doing this practice you can just sort of stand there
and just let that go and just kind of go
into your satisfaction meditation and just be satisfied standing there
in line and if you find yourself alone in a
situation you can also be satisfied just with that with
being alone now be careful i'm not suggesting that this
is a license to become a recluse and never to
socialize and never be to be intimate with other people
that would be a mistake i'm simply saying that you
develop this skill this capacity for deep satisfaction which helps
you to be non-needy and detached and then during other
parts of your day and of your life you can
go out and you can socialize be with people and
so on and that will actually deepen the satisfaction you
get from those instances when you do socialize so i
want to warn you here it's very important when you're
practicing the satisfaction meditation that you don't secretly try to
use it to achieve a mystical state or enlightenment it's
like yeah i'm doing this practice i'm trying to be
satisfied but leah where's my awakening it didn't happen if
you've still got that sort of lingering attitude somewhere in
the back of your mind you're not doing it right
you got to let that go just be satisfied now
you might say well leo but if i'm just sitting
here satisfied and that's all my meditation is then sort
of will i ever reach my enlightenment and my awakening
well i mean there's no guarantees really no meditation can
guarantee that you ever will there's no guarantee that if
you push for enlightenment and awakening that you'll get it
either and in fact what you'll notice if you have
done a lot of pushing is that it you notice
how counterproductive that can be so if you've done meditations
where you've sat for months and for years pushing pushing
pushing hour after hour after hour and it still hasn't
happened for you or it happens very infrequently for you
then um obviously your method isn't working so maybe it's
not working because counterintuitively that pushing is actually sabotaging your
ability to be in the present moment because you're you're
chasing you're chasing some future fantasy which is not what
awakening is so counter-intuitively when you let go of the
chasing it might seem like oh well now i'm not
being as productive spiritually speaking but see if you make
spirituality about being productive that is already a corruption of
what spirituality is spirituality really is just the ability to
to be satisfied with whatever is and to be conscious
of it and to cultivate your love for existence itself
that is not some future state you got to achieve
that's something you got to practice right now that's what
this meditation is helping you to do now you might
say well leo but what if i can't be satisfied
right now well the challenge is to try at first
your mind might resist it might say well i can't
be satisfied because i have a project due tomorrow i
got to take care of the kids i got to
pay the bills i got to reach my enlightenment or
whatever and therefore i can't be satisfied well the whole
trick here is that you have to notice that those
are tricks of your mind you have to let those
go just let those go remember my episode that i
released a few years ago called the power of letting
go go watch that one because that comes in handy
here you have to let go of that just let
go of needing things to be different and just allow
yourself to be satisfied with what's here right now and
focus your attention on that satisfaction itself and enjoy that
satisfaction so really what's powerful about this meditation unlike other
meditations is that when i do other meditations the problem
that i run into is that i start doing the
meditation but i don't actually enjoy the meditation i'm doing
it as a mechanical technique which i usually don't like
i find it boring or i'm doing it because i
told myself that i have to do it because eventually
it's going to lead to my enlightenment or something or
it's going to lead to happiness in the future but
i'm not happy when i'm doing it and so then
it becomes difficult to sustain the practice because it always
feels like a chore it feels like i'm some it's
something that i'm doing for the future to get some
kind of result that i think i'll want that will
make me happy and that becomes counterproductive so what's nice
about this satisfaction meditation is that the whole point of
it is that you have to be happy now so
it's just about practicing being happy right now you're not
trying to be happy for some other purpose but just
to be happy in a sense you can frame it
like this for yourself in your mind like if you
truly are sitting here right now and you allow yourself
to be happy and satisfied do you even need enlightenment
do you even need a mystical experience i mean in
in the end what more do you want but satisfaction
isn't that what you imagine you would get if you
were enlightened or had your mystical experience or whatever why
are you chasing these experiences because you want to be
satisfied and you believe they will satisfy you well let's
short circuit that and just go straight to the satisfaction
you don't need to jump through all these hoops just
go straight to satisfaction and be satisfied and so if
you practice this you will notice that there is a
bit of a subtle shift in that before when you
meditated you didn't really enjoy it but now when you
meditate it's subtle but now you actually enjoy it it's
not a chore and it's not a grind and then
you actually look forward to this portion of your day
where you will sit and just be happy for the
next 30 minutes of course for many of us this
is this is harder than it sounds because our minds
are geared in such a way after you know 20
30 40 50 years of survival that has gone ingrained
in our minds our minds are so geared now that
we don't even allow ourselves to be happy for no
reason because in a sense that's counterproductive to survival if
we take some hot shot millionaire or ceo or wall
street type of person and we tell him to just
sit for 30 minutes and just be happy what is
going to be his most common objection to that he's
going to say something like but that's just a that's
just a waste of time if i can be happy
doing nothing then how can i keep doing the stuff
that i do on wall street or with my business
or why would i be chasing millions of dollars that's
going to rob me of my motivation for doing all
that activity and that's exactly right but the counterintuitive part
is that that's not a bad thing that's a good
thing that's actually what you want because all that activity
that you're doing on wall street and with the millions
with your business and all that has it really made
you happy no it's just led to an endless treadmill
of chasing chasing chasing and if you keep that up
you're gonna waste your whole life chasing stuff and never
being satisfied so when are you going to wise up
and realize that that's not going to work something fundamentally
different needs to happen so it's when you realize that
that then maybe you'll be open to the satisfaction meditation
you'll actually start practicing it and you're only going to
be doing it for 20 30 minutes at first maybe
an hour the rest of your day you can go
about being productive and doing stuff and chasing stuff but
during this short period of your day you're just going
to allow yourself to be satisfied and then you'll see
that as you practice this and get better at it
it will have a spillover effect into other areas of
your life it will make you happier by definition because
you're directly going to the source of happiness itself and
then if you really practice it intensely it can turn
into a deep joy bliss and love you can just
become so satisfied with sitting in the present moment not
needing anything feeling like the present moment is complete that
it can start to bring tears to your eyes just
it's a kind of joy that most people uh easily
overlook because it's not like a a sharp peak in
pleasure it's not like a drug high or an orgasm
it's just like a a very moderate but even keeled
steady rock solid contentment and what you realize after a
lot of years in your life spent chasing peaks by
partying by drinking by having lots of orgasms by masturbating
by doing drugs by eating fancy food and owning fancy
cars and earning millions of dollars in the stock market
by doing all these things and having these big payoffs
you know gambling and winning jackpots all these are these
are sort of dopamine peaks and they always crash and
they always lead to dissatisfaction because you can't sustain those
peaks that's a trick of your mind a fantasy to
think that you can sustain those peaks you can't there's
not enough winnings you can do on wall street or
at the casino to sustain those peaks and in fact
there's actually uh some scientific evidence behind this they've done
research and there's actually two different reward systems in your
brain your imaginary brain two different reward systems there's a
dopamine circuit which rewards you for sharp changes positive changes
in your survival situation like if you stumble upon a
thousand dollars on the sidewalk that's going to spike your
dopamine but then that's very a short-lasting thing it'll get
spiked you'll feel very happy for the next day or
two and then you'll drop back down this is the
case with lottery winnings with jackpots with big payoffs and
victories in business with finding a new romantic partner these
are all basically dopamine spikes with drugs of course and
then there's a separate totally different reward circuit in your
mind in your brain that rewards you for um it's
not it's not a spike it's just a an even
keel sort of satisfaction that you experience and that's the
circuit that you're developing when you're practicing this satisfaction meditation
the satisfaction meditation is not dopamine based and most of
us have gotten addicted to the dopamine hit even if
we're not doing drugs when you're people-pleasing that's a dopamine
hit when you're socializing with your friends that's a dopamine
hit but when you're just sitting there satisfied and you
feel complete with the present moment that's something else and
that can be sustained that can last and also that
can be amplified by by sort of creating a positive
feedback loop where it feeds into itself and then that
can be brought up and taken beyond just mere contentment
to actual states of bliss and joy and love but
that takes quite a bit of practice so start practicing
it's very simple uh in fact it's so simple that
most people will overlook it and dismiss it and just
pooh-pooh it as like oh well that's some sort of
you know silly hippie stuff what i want is the
real tangible results in life but and you think that
that's you being smart no that's actually you being stupid
that's not gonna work if it worked that's what i
would be teaching you but it doesn't work and of
course if you're not convinced of that then spend the
next five or ten years of your life trying desperately
chasing those dopamine peaks and you'll realize it doesn't work
and also you can read the literature on how dopamine
works when you read it they've done animal studies they've
done studies on humans entire books have been written about
this sort of dopamine hit stuff there's a lot of
good research on it these days what you'll realize is
that it can't possibly work because that's not how the
dopamine system is is geared that's not what it's designed
for the dopamine system is designed to keep you chasing
a carrot on a stick that you will never reach
you know how they hold up that carrot on a
stick in front of a donkey and the donkey keeps
chasing it forever never reaching the carrot that's kind of
like what you're doing with dopamine that's what the dopamine
circuit is for so no wonder most people are not
satisfied in life because they don't actually practice satisfaction and
nobody taught them the difference between these different kinds of
you know reward circuits that exist and the fact that
you have to actually build up your ability to be
satisfied with just being an existing that's a muscle that
is atrophied from most people especially these days because you
know video games movies youtube videos viral content comedy drama
vr games porn all of this stuff this all provides
dopamine hits gambling loot boxes beating somebody in a first
person online shooter like fortnight this gives you dopamine hits
and it doesn't last that's why you always are looking
for the next game no video game has ever satisfied
you in your life you play it for a week
or two and then you're on to the next one
and the next one and the next one and the
next one so when are you going to learn your
lesson when are you going to wise up you see
you need some sort of root solution to this happiness
problem otherwise you're going to always be unhappy now even
though i say this this does not mean that you
will sit on your ass for the rest of your
life and do nothing i still recommend that you go
out there and you work on your business work on
your finances don't be a slouch develop a strong work
ethic and so forth develop relationships if you want them
most probably need them to feel sad to feel you
know deeply satisfied with life um you can do all
those things but that needs to be the icing on
the cake not the cake itself the cake itself is
this practice here and then you're going to try to
carry it over into all those other domains so that
when you go to a park you can really be
at the park and enjoy the beauty of that park
for those 30 minutes that you're there you can be
satisfied at the park because see if you don't cultivate
this satisfaction muscle at all your situation can get so
bad that even when you're in beautiful and extraordinary situations
you will take them for granted and still be unsatisfied
have you ever experienced that i'm sure you have i've
experienced it sometimes you know the situation is perfect like
maybe you're left you're with your romantic partner and you
two are sitting on a mountaintop and there's a beautiful
sunset and you know you've spent the whole day hiking
up up to the mountaintop you're gonna plan to be
there for the sunset and here it is the sunset
is happening it's only gonna last for the next 10
minutes you know sunsets don't last very long and you're
sitting there with him or her and it's like the
perfect moment the weather is perfect the sun is perfect
the timing is perfect the person is perfect but you're
still not happy think of a time when that happened
to you everything is perfect but you're still not happy
and when you're in that situation it's like a double
dose of unhappiness because you're unhappy but you know the
situation is perfect and that you should be happy and
so now you're unhappy that you're unhappy and so you're
double unhappy because then you start to sort of wonder
and almost go into this mode of fear where it's
like well if i can't be happy when all the
stars are aligned for me what chance do i have
to be happy at all ever because this is as
good as it gets as far as the stars aligning
because they're not going to stay aligned forever and then
you're just going to become even less happy see so
that's when it gets real bad and that's actually when
a lot of people will kill themselves or get really
depressed is when everything is going perfectly and they're still
not able to be satisfied and then they're kind of
puzzled as to like well why is this and then
they they think like well it's going to be this
way forever i'm going to be depressed forever now because
nothing will make me happy well that's because nothing can
make you happy other than your own self the only
thing that can make you happy is training up your
satisfaction muscle to the point where you're just satisfied with
existence you've fallen into the trap of trying to arrange
existence in such a way that it pleases you that's
the key trap stop trying to do that so much
you can do a little bit of that you know
like if you're if you're homeless on the street obviously
you got to take care of some of your affairs
so that you can have shelter and then that's fine
nothing wrong with that but but that quickly leads to
diminishing returns and then spirituality is really just about developing
that satisfaction muscle with the present moment and then carrying
that over into every moment of your life as much
as you can you're going to fail at it a
lot it's going to take a lot of practice but
as you practice this over years and decades you'll become
more content with life you'll become more at peace and
then if you do this seriously you should start to
experience some mystical states and even some satoris and awakenings
as you just sit there not even chasing for them
not even wanting them but they will start to automatically
happen to you simply because you're fully surrendered to the
present moment and the present moment is absolute truth this
is god this is spirit right here it's just a
matter of becoming more conscious of it and also see
it's really hard to reach a deep mystical state or
an awakening when you don't enjoy the process because it
does take hundreds of hours sometimes thousands of hours of
sitting and just being present in order to reach those
so how do you plan to to keep that up
if you're not enjoying the process so that's another tip
that i have for you with your meditation practice regardless
of what meditation practice you're doing or how you frame
it in your mind whether it's the do nothing technique
or the counting your breaths or whatever you're doing try
to enjoy it enjoy the process that's crucial don't lose
sight of that if you're starting to regret it and
grind through it and hate it then that's a signal
that you're doing it wrong adjust your method reframe how
you're thinking about this meditation practice in such a way
that you can enjoy it and then try to bask
in that enjoyment for as much as you can because
in the end if your spiritual practice isn't aligned with
joy and satisfaction of existence then there's something deeply askew
there can you see that spirituality is not supposed to
be this grind and in general i would also i
would broaden that lesson out beyond merely meditation practice to
the entire process of self-actualization and personal development and really
even work as well like in the past when i
did work my paradigm was just work grind through the
work suck it up and achieve the result that was
my paradigm a lot through school and through college and
then beyond that for the next 10 years really that's
how i worked it was not a healthy not a
very functional way i mean i accomplished a lot of
stuff but it was not a very functional and it's
not ultimately a sustainable way to work what you want
to do with your work with your business and with
other areas of your life with your personal development too
is you want to enjoy the process make the changes
that you need to make to your work to your
business to your relationships to your family life and to
your personal development to the way that you read books
for example to the way that you listen to videos
such that you enjoy it see you can there's two
different ways you can go about watching my videos at
least at least two one is you can get in
your mind like oh i've stumbled upon this gold mine
of information from leo it's like hundreds of hours of
content now i gotta sit through all of it because
it's all important wisdom and stuff and it's important to
my life and i'm just gonna grind through it even
though these videos are long and complicated i gotta take
notes on it and so you can turn it into
this grind and you can turn personal development into this
grind where it's always about like i'm not good enough
i got to become better i got to become more
spiritual i got to be have a higher self-esteem i
got to have less fear i got to be more
loving i got to be more self-accepting and i got
to be nicer to people and so it's like i
got to do all these things but then you don't
feel good about yourself because you feel like you're so
below all these targets and ideals that you got to
be hitting and you might be below it for years
and you might try to grind through my videos in
this in this fashion or what you can do is
you can actually slow down and see the problem is
that when you're grinding through something you tend to want
to speed through it because it's a grind and you
don't enjoy it so you want to get it over
faster right like you want to get get done with
work so you can go off and relax and enjoy
yourself so there's that paradigm and then there's the other
paradigm which is actually how can i change my work
so i can do it in such a way where
i actually enjoy it and then i don't need to
be looking at the clock and waiting to punch out
and to go do something i enjoy how can i
enjoy what i'm already doing that might mean you have
to really change your whole attitude towards work or towards
your family life or towards personal development or towards watching
my videos watch my videos in a way where you
can actually enjoy it because in the long run you're
going to watch a lot more of my videos if
you actually enjoy them maybe that means going in a
slower pace rather than burning through one video a day
maybe you do one a week but you actually enjoy
it you take time to pause to contemplate to think
when you do that when you slow down and you
really get in the rhythm with with a thing you
go into flow and when you go into flow you
lose all sense of yourself and it becomes effortless whatever
you're doing becomes effortless when you're in flow you don't
put a lot of expectations on it you don't put
a lot of demands upon results and so forth you
just go into flow but if you're very results oriented
and you put demands on everything schedules and rules and
uh even like with reading a book there's a way
to read a book where it's enjoyable and there's a
way to read a book where it's a grind uh
i don't think i've ever shared the story but like
about 10 years ago when i first got into personal
development i very much had this achievement oriented mindset where
it's like how can i develop myself as quickly as
possible to hell with how it feels let me just
you know achieve as much as i can in this
field and then one of the reason one of the
ways i thought i would do that is by learning
to speed read so i got a speed reading book
and i started going through the speed reading exercises and
i thought to myself my plan was like oh what
if i can master speed reading and i can improve
my rate of reading by like tenfold i can read
ten times as many books as i would normally read
and think about over the next ten years if i
could read ten times more books how many books you
know hundreds thousands of books i would read and i
convinced myself that this was a good idea and so
i grinded through about a month of this speed reading
practice it was like every day i had to practice
speed reading for like 30 or 40 minutes or something
doing these exercises they were tedious exercise that i really
didn't enjoy doing and i was grinding it and grinding
it for four weeks and then eventually it hit me
the grind became so bad that it hit me like
why am i doing this this is so stupid um
i would much rather just read slow and normal and
enjoy what i'm reading rather than speeding reading through stuff
and then worrying about whether i remembered it correctly or
understood it correctly because i'm going too fast trying to
achieve something trying to get to the end of the
book counting how many words per minute i'm reading at
how many pages like this this is this is all
actually keeping me from going into flow and so to
this day i read pretty slowly but it doesn't really
matter because the point is not to read x number
of books in your life the point is to enjoy
life if you have to read half as many books
but enjoy it twice as much that's a win take
the victory right stop living your life towards some sort
of arbitrary numerical metrics like dollars in your bank account
or number of cars you own or um how many
books you've read i used to have this mindset where
it's all about quantifying everything this is a very left-brained
dysfunctional sort of stage orange approach to life and it
doesn't lead to satisfaction numbers don't satisfy you unless maybe
you're a mathematician numbers won't satisfy you and even for
mathematicians numbers won't satisfy you in the in the ultimate
sense so this is all food for thought uh and
in general i want you to contemplate more deeply what
happiness is you need to contemplate that if you ever
want to be happy if you can't clearly articulate to
yourself what happiness is how can you ever be happy
and most people can't and it's not enough for you
to believe what i say about happiness you have to
actually for yourself derive what happiness is because happiness is
not a belief it's not an ideology so what is
it well contemplate and figure it out for yourself through
direct experience notice what happiness is when are you happy
when are you not happy and what is causing that
notice that and as you're practicing this meditation here this
will help you in differentiating between authentic happiness versus these
dopamine peaks of pleasure see that's two very different things
make that crucial distinction don't get fooled by these dopamine
peaks as though that's authentic happiness it's not those peaks
that create suffering so another way to frame the question
is is there a form of happiness that doesn't create
a downward shift into dissatisfaction after it ends and if
you do the satisfaction meditation maybe you'll discover that that's
what this is that's what this is pointing you towards
all right that's it so go practice that and post
below in the comments how you feel all right i'm
done here please click that like button for me and
come check out actualize.org that's my website on the website
you will find resources you will find my book list
there are books there about happiness what kind of things
make you happy and what kind of things don't happiness
is a very counterintuitive thing you want to read some
books on it and study it and in the future
i'll post some books actually the reason i'm talking about
dopamine right now is because i've actually been reading a
book listening to an audiobook about dopamine and i'll add
that to my book list in the future i've already
done 10 updates to my book list and i keep
doing more like on a on a yearly basis so
that's coming um you can also find my life purpose
course that will also help you to find satisfaction in
your life what's unique about the life purpose when you
find your life purpose and you set your life on
track with your life purpose is that again the life
purpose doesn't trigger dopamine hits the way that most other
activities in life do the life purpose when you're following
it it actually triggers this other reward mechanism similar to
the satisfaction meditation so it leads to a deep contentment
with your life so check that out as well that'll
help you you can also check out my blog link
down below in the description you can check out the
forum sign up on the forum ask questions on the
forum i answer lots of questions there's other people who
answer questions there you can support me at patreon.com actualized
and check out my second channel called actualizedclips with short
10 minute or less clips of my main videos making
it easier for you to digest and to share so
this episode now gives you a practice that you can
do for the previous episode about people pleasing and about
loneliness so the connection i want you to make here
is that a lot of times i will talk about
some abstract high level idea or topic like i did
in the people pleasing and loneliness episode and i give
you a few practices there but not a very tangible
practice and then in this episode i gave you very
tangible practice so what you need to do with all
of my episodes because i'm not going to do all
this for you is you need to take ownership of
this situation of personal development and you need to develop
practical techniques for implementing all of the high-level big picture
abstract ideas that i talk about sometimes i give those
techniques to you but a lot of times i don't
don't just sit there and expect me to spoon feed
you all the techniques i expect you to take ownership
of that problem because you're going to have to because
leo is not going to be there for you guiding
you every place in your life with personal development you
have to develop the capacity to stand on your own
two legs when it comes to personal development which means
you should be able to read a book or an
online article or listen to a video whether it's from
me or from somebody else or listen to some guru
talking about some insight and it can be just a
short abstract insight and then you need the ability to
take that inside and say aha that's the insight that's
the big picture idea that's the abstraction now how do
i turn that abstraction into something i can implement in
my life so that i can embody it so i
can practice it and then brainstorm some different methods and
then try them out and see which ones work and
which ones don't this skill of going from the abstract
to the concrete is crucial and many of you are
lacking it it's crucial that you develop it and so
this is a case of you know that old saying
of um don't give a man a fish teach him
how to fish that's the difference if i was giving
you all the techniques it would almost be too easy
i would be giving you fish but not teaching you
how to fish so if you really want to get
the most out of my work and videos then it's
not enough for you just to sit there and listen
passively as you cook your food or do your laundry
or whatever or drive in your car that's good you
can start there but then at the end of the
video you gotta like pause take a few minutes with
a sheet of paper just sit down and ask ask
yourself okay so he talked about some high level ideas
and some insights and some profound wisdom and stuff he
gave me a model he gave me a theory it's
just some philosophy it's some metaphysical stuff it's some epistemic
stuff but then how do i make it practical in
my life how do i implement this and then brainstorm
some different ways and then start doing those and then
that's where the results come from the results don't come
from just listening to me idly so beware of that
trap and stay tuned for more you
