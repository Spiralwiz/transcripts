[Music] welcome to understanding duality part two scientific and existential
dualities so as promised I'm going to be giving you
a list of 250 dualities here we covered half of
them in part 1 and now the remaining half now
here in part 2 let's continue right where we left
off before we actually get to the list though let's
clear up a couple of points that are important so
when we use the word duality this is a little
bit deceptive because it makes you think that we're talking
about polarities that always come in pairs of two and
not more right so when I say duality you think
of like black versus white good versus evil cat versus
dog this sort of stuff and then so when I'm
teaching about this topic of duality then you're gonna go
out into the world you're gonna look for these dualities
and what's gonna happen is that you're not gonna always
find a polar opposite for every situation or what you
might find is you might find categories of three or
four or more things and you're gonna wonder how that
fits in and relates to duality so here's what you
got to understand is that when we use the word
duality we're really using it to contrast with non duality
which means with oneness so you could have categories which
are more than two parts it doesn't have to be
just two it can be two or three or four
or infinite number of categories in fact that's how exactly
how it works there's an infinite number of these categories
that that we create so for example take a look
at this we've got theism atheism and agnosticism that's a
three part distinction there that's still a duality okay under
what I'm saying also we have straight gay or bisexual
that's a three part distinction there and you could have
more for example the color spectrum you can have colors
like red blue green yellow purple orange you can even
have infrared and ultraviolet these are all categories that we
create within color but it doesn't just end there it's
even more complicated than that see duality is multi-dimensional so
like with this color spectrum example I want you to
see that what we have here really is duality within
duality cuz yes we can distinguish red from blue from
green from yellow and so forth but that's all within
the duality called color and now color is distinct from
now we're kind of going up one level is distinct
from smell sound feeling emotion and other things like that
thoughts see that's separate so we're creating a multiple part
duality there between these various kinds of sensations and then
we're creating further adue a letís within each duality of
sensations so we can create dualities within color within smell
within sound and so forth like we can have loud
sounds or we can have quiet sounds see or we
can have sweet smells or we can have bitter nasty
smells but those are just sensations of course what is
sensation but another duality because sensation is contrasted against something
else something that's the opposite of sensation maybe you want
to contrast sensation against thoughts or concepts or something else
so you see how this gets very tricky you create
with your mind dualities within dualities within dualities within dualities
it gets very complicated so bear that in mind and
it can have many parts for example you might take
cat and dog as a duality and you ask most
people kind of simplistically what's the opposite of a cat
and they'll say well a dog and what's the opposite
of a dog well it's a cat ok that's easy
a child knows that but then someone in the in
the comments under the last episode asked Leah what's the
opposite of a panda bear see and here you have
to understand that really when we're creating the duality between
cat dog it's not simply that we're defining the cat
relative to the dog we're also defining the cat relative
to a bunch of other stuff so for example really
when we say cat as a duality what we're saying
is cat versus non cat that's the the highest level
of distinction that we're making and then you can find
op it's like dog and so forth so for example
with with panda bear what's the opposite of a panda
bear well when we say panda bear what we're doing
is we're specifying something that's what it means to create
a distinction or a duality these words distinction duality category
I'm using them interchangeably here so in a certain sense
the opposite of a panda bear is a non panda
bear and what is a non panda bear well it's
a table it's a car it's a tree it's any
of those things so a panda bear is distinct from
a tree a car a table a human and so
forth but if we if we want to get all
the more specifically say well panda bear also isn't getting
a very specific type of bear so we could say
a panda bear is distinct from a brown bear a
black bear a polar bear a cartoon bear and and
so so forth you know whatever other kind of bears
there are and then we can also say well of
course bear is a specific type of distinction or duality
which separates that particular kind of animal from other animals
and of course you know you could have a whole
hierarchy of different kinds of amyl animals mammals living things
sentient things all of these are dualities you see so
what's the opposite of toilet paper not toilet paper when
we say toilet paper were specifically excluding everything that's not
toilet paper which is literally the entire universe - toilet
paper you see so we're kind of playing with these
sets here but you might get the sense that even
though I'm talking about these distinctions and dualities that what
I'm talking about is concepts and then I'm talking about
different ideas and beliefs you could have in your mind
different ways of looking at the world but what I'm
saying is much more profound than that we're not merely
talking about concepts and ideas a concept and idea is
itself a duality you gotta really contemplate this is very
very tricky stuff because we're gonna be tempted to do
is you're gonna be tempted to somehow weaken the notion
of duality by grounding it in some sort of thing
which itself is a duality as well so you're gonna
say well Leo you might say these are just these
are just ideas in the mind all this duality business
just philosophy in the mind and then if we throw
all that away we've got like the real hard stuff
the science the facts the stuff you can't argue with
but what I'm telling you is that that thing that
you're saying you can't argue with the real hard facts
the science the the reality the objective truth I'm telling
you that that thing is also a duality so then
where does that leave us it leaves us groundless it
leaves us groundless and that seems like a mistake but
that's not a mistake that's exactly how it is so
watch out for that also I want you to notice
that all qualifications are dualities what do I mean by
qualifications I mean any quality whatsoever so take any object
and we can now qualify it by using language or
ideas to specify qualities of the object so we can
say like well is this object big or small it's
big okay so it's big what what other qualities that
have well is it is it Harry or is it
smooth okay it's hairy and is it sharp or is
it jagged okay its jagged and is it is it
loud or is it quiet okay it's quiet and does
it have eyes or not okay so it is it's
got eyes and does it make noise well we already
said that okay so you know what else is it
skinny or is it tall so we can just keep
going with qualities so any object that you know for
it to be an object it has to have specific
qualities otherwise you say it doesn't exist but see you
also hold existence and non-existence as qualities which is also
quite dualistic see so my point is that I want
you to start to become aware that this this notion
of duality is much more ubiquitous than it first seems
at first it seems like God do a letís they're
just like these little categories that we create but then
you start looking around the world more and more you
realize wait a minute what isn't a duality and that's
exactly right you're starting to see just how powerful this
this notion is so all the ways that you think
about reality are dualistic what would it even mean for
you to have a thought about an object that has
no qualities to it whatsoever you might say well that
object doesn't exist then ah but that's a duality you
create a duality between existence in non-existence so you can't
even say that it doesn't exist because you're qualifying it
by saying that see how tricky this is also I
want you to notice that all of your questions about
life pretty much are infested with dualistic assumptions so for
example you might ask well leo so just be straight
with me are other people real or not now just
take that line of thought are other people real or
not other is a duality people is a duality real
is a duality not is a duality see how about
a question like Leo does free will exist I'm confused
tell it to me straight well free is the duality
will his the duality exists is a duality Leo are
we in a computer simulation tell it to me straight
computer is a duality we is a duality simulation is
a duality leo can computers become sentient tell it to
me straight again computer is a duality sentient is a
duality Leo is God real or not tell it to
me straight God as you hold it is a duality
you might one will who created God creation is a
duality whether you say God exists or doesn't exist you're
creating dualities now of course there's God with a capital
G the actual God the absolute now that's something we
talked about in part 1 remember that there is an
absolute and so that thing it's something but you don't
know what it is and it's not within the realm
of duality it transcends duality Leo will science ever understand
consciousness science is a duality consciousness the way you hold
it is the duality now there is a consciousness with
capital C that's an absolute that's God but when you
talk about consciousness when ordinary people talk about consciousness there
they're talking about a dualistic version of consciousness consciousness as
contrasted with unconsciousness there's no such thing when you're at
the absolute when you're at the absolute there's no such
thing as unconsciousness there's only consciousness capital C but we'll
get to that I'm getting ahead of myself Leo is
it possible to eliminate evil possible as a duality contrasted
with impossible eliminate that's like destruction that's the duality destruction
versus creation evil that's of course a duality between good
and evil Leo is Western culture superior to other cultures
Western of course is the duality culture is a duality
superior versus inferiors a duality is a duality Leo is
masturbation good or bad should I stop masturbating masturbation is
a duality good as a duality bad as a duality
should is a duality Leo should I focus on my
life purpose or on spirituality I'm confused again should as
a duality focuses the duality life purposes of duality spirituality
as a duality in the way that you hold it
confusion is a duality you're either confused or you're not
confused you see so most people they get cut up
on the questions and the content of the questions and
try to get an answer some sort of verbal logical
answer without going kind of meta and just kind of
looking at the questions that they're asking see philosophy and
science is chock-full completely infested with dualistic notions and that's
why science and philosophy struggles to answer some of the
biggest metaphysical existential questions in life because they're not conscious
of the thing that I'm trying to make you conscious
of right now so don't be so focused on getting
your questions answered rather be focused on the assumptions that
are in your questioning and in your philosophy and in
your science it's the kind of questions you ask that's
really more important than the answers you get by the
way it questions and answers what is that but another
duality anyhow enough of this preamble let's get right into
the list so we're getting into the portion of the
scientific dualities the following list of dualities is critical for
you to understand if you're going to be a decent
scientist or intellectual of any kind if you do not
understand this list you are basically negligent as an intellectual
and you will commit dualistic blunders and you will not
have an ultimate understanding of reality and in fact your
understanding of reality will be very confused twisted and distorted
and you're gonna delude yourself and anybody who Reiser follows
your work that's how that's how significant this is so
I pay attention here alright so the first example is
the duality of solid liquid gas and plasma you know
this from physics class right so in in science and
physics they will tell you that well you know matter
goes through various kinds of states it can be a
solid a liquid a gas a plasma and so forth
and then when you're told this you tend to take
it as a dogma and you tend to say well
yeah it's either a solid or it's a liquid or
it's a gas or it's a plasma and it has
to be one of those four and it can't be
anything else but of course what you discover if you
actually start to do serious science is you discover if
you take a microscope and you kind of zoom into
a liquid that liquid is not always pure liquid even
if it's standing at room temperature take a glass of
water standing at room temperature is it liquid well it
seems liquid but when you zoom in on it what
you see is that actually if you want to be
technical and accurate there's always molecules bouncing around and some
portion of the molecules let's say that the majority of
them are liquid if it's at room temperature in its
water on you know standard atmosphere pressure on earth that's
gonna be true but then there's even in that situation
there's always a portion of those molecules bouncing around which
are going too fast and they're literally turning into gas
and they're evaporating which is why if you leave your
glass of water you know in a sort of a
dry environment if you're not in some very humid place
like Florida maybe if you're in a dry place like
where I live in Las Vegas then you leave a
glass of water out overnight half that glass is gonna
evaporate overnight this is so dry how does that happen
in science class they told you you've got to boil
water for the water to turn into gas well that's
not actually true because there's always some portion of that
liquid that's always turning into gas see and so the
reason I'm giving you this example is because it starts
to [ __ ] with your mind and it starts
to break part these rigid categories these simplistic black-and-white categories
that you hold in your mind see and you're always
going to find that this is the case anywhere in
life that you believe there's a firm category and some
firm boundary that cannot be broken if you explore that
boundary deeply enough far enough eventually you'll discover that it
breaks and that it bleeds into something else another example
for you conductor versus insulator versus semi conductor versus super
conductor this is really interesting because we've got conductors and
insulators but then we've got semi conductors what's a semi
conductor sometimes is conductors sometimes it's not what the hell
is that about see so it so the semi conductor
the existence of a semi conductor proves to you the
the permeability of that boundary between a conductor and an
insulator and then we have something even weirder which is
superconductors we have materials for example that don't conduct electricity
at all unless you freeze them to near absolute zero
temperatures and then they become superconductors it's a very counterintuitive
sort of result and it's kind of paradoxical and freaky
see so the value to a scientist of the things
that I'm talking about now is that what it does
is it frees up your mind to think outside of
various kinds of pigeon holes that the scientific establishment pushes
upon you when you learn science in school and in
university so for example a couple hundred years ago people
knew about conductors and insulators but they didn't know about
semiconductors and superconductors right so if you were a rigid
scientist who was schooled in the theory that there's conductors
and insulators and they're opposites and that there's nothing else
then you're going to learn that and then you're never
going to be able to discover a superconductor because you're
gonna look at them the thing you're gonna say well
it must be either a conductor or an insulator but
it can't be both it can't be semiconductor or it
can't be of something as an insulator can't become a
conductor at certain temperatures that would violate these categories yes
but who created the categories of we did of course
humans did you see this is how scientists delude themselves
they think they're doing good science but really their science
is going through the filters of their categories and then
those those categorical filters are what distorts the science and
there's there's so much more that can be said about
this but we have to move on how about the
duality of land versus water do you think well clearly
they're opposites but are they really go to the beach
try to find the boundary between land and water when
you're actually at the beach it's really hard to pinpoint
you've got waves splashing around water soaking through the sand
where does the water end and the sand begin see
it's not so easy not so easy at all and
if you really want to understand how land and how
water work in all of their accuracy and complexity you
can't approach it with this rigid boundary you need to
be much more nuanced and you need to study how
land and water work as forces pushing and pulling on
each other land shapes the way that water flows it
shapes the actual shape of the water is conforming to
some kind of land even if you think about the
entire ocean the entire ocean if we think of one
ocean in the entire world all the oceans added together
that's one ocean and it's being held in a sort
of beaker which is the the earth sea so the
shape of the water is determined by the land but
also of course the land the shape of the land
is determined by the water it goes both ways you
know you look at the Grand Canyon for example which
is pretty close where I live and you you see
how the land was shaped by the water and often
it doesn't take a lot of water to shape a
massive chunk of land see geologists geologists understand this really
well they appreciate this how about the distinction of the
geosphere the hydrosphere the biosphere the atmosphere we can easily
take these as separate things we can have a scientist
who studies the geosphere another one who studies the hydrosphere
another one who studies the biosphere another one who studies
the atmosphere and these scientists could not talk to each
other their entire life because you know they're just kind
of siloed and they've got their blinders on just working
on one of their fields but of course all of
these spheres interpenetrate and work with each other and if
you really want to understand the geosphere you better understand
the hydrosphere the biosphere and the atmosphere because all those
spheres shape the geosphere and you know conversely as well
the biosphere is shaped by the geosphere the hydrosphere is
shaped by the atmosphere and so it's a complicated nest
and it's not so easy to tell where one ends
and the other begins for example you know termites they'll
build a big termite mound out of Earth so that
now becomes part of the geosphere is what the termites
built but it wouldn't be part of the geosphere unless
these biological entities the termites built it and of course
where did the termites come from well of course they're
made out of molecules coming from the geosphere ultimately you
know so there you go how about the distinction of
planets asteroids and planetoids some years back Pluto was Declassified
from being a planet to being a planetoid it didn't
quite qualify as a planet what happened there some people
were upset about it some people who were for it
some people were against it is Pluto a planet is
it an asteroid what's the difference we didn't asteroid in
a planet anyways it's a planet just a giant asteroid
or is it something more and what about plantoids what
the hell is a planetoid something in between a planet
and an asteroid you see it's not so clear not
so clear at all how about the distinction or the
category of life vs. non-life this issue of defining what
is life is notoriously difficult for scientists when they're planning
various missions to other planets like Mars the moon and
elsewhere in our solar system and beyond scientists have been
thinking about this how are we going to even determine
whether the stuff that we find on some remote planet
is actually gonna be life because there might be some
weird stuff there but it might not have DNA you
know we we define life on Earth usually as stuff
that has DNA but what if this alien life doesn't
have DNA it uses some other mechanism and we know
we define human life on earth here as as kind
of like carbon-based life-forms but what if we find life
forms that are silicon based or some other material that
we haven't considered before some other element and how will
we really know and if you if you investigate the
the research into how did life actually come about on
the planet at all it's it's a very mysterious and
tricky topic it's not simple at all scientists have virtually
no idea how life came about from inorganic matter it's
actually uh one of the greatest puzzles and mysteries of
the universe that still needs to be answered how does
something nonliving become living and what is that exact moment
what does that boundary that's crossed that a nonliving thing
becomes a living thing what was the very first living
thing that ever came into existence in our universe was
there even such a thing after all who's creating this
category of living versus nonliving us humans see very very
tricky it's not so easy to devise a test to
determine whether something is alive or not how about the
duality of inanimate versus animate that's another one that's very
similar to the one we've just discussed how about the
duality of plant versus animal at first blush it seems
like well it's easy to tell a plant from an
animal any child can do it can tell a cat
from a tree but when you actually get into the
nitty-gritty details you're going to encounter situations in the in
the biosphere where you can't quite distinguish a plant from
an animal corals for example various kinds of corals become
an interesting example various kinds of fungi and mushrooms you
know they kind of blur the lines between plants and
animals certain corals they have properties of animals but also
plants like they can they can do photosynthesis for example
and they can get energy from from the Sun but
at the same time most corals they actually eat fish
and they eat various kinds of shrimpin and dead living
matter they're interesting so see it would be very wrong
ahead of us if we were trying to explore the
universe to go to a new planet exploring that planet
with a very simple distinction of plant versus animal in
our mind or living versus nonliving in our mind we
need to be much more open-minded otherwise we might discover
something there that doesn't quite fit one of our existing
categories that's one of the whole tricks of doing science
is that precisely because science is about pushing the boundary
of discovery and discovering new things in the universe we
need to be very very open to new categories of
things which which a lot of times honestly scientists are
just closed-minded too because you know they get drilled in
there in their skull this idea that well a subatomic
particle must either be a proton or an electron or
some other on but it can't be some some totally
new thing or if there's a if there's a fundamental
physical object then it must be either energy or must
be matter but it can't be anything else well but
what if we discover something out there in the universe
that's not energy or matter but it's a third kind
of thing are you gonna be open-minded to it are
you gonna be rigid and dogmatic and say that no
Leo it has to either be matter or it has
to be energy and it can't be anything else you'd
be surprised at how many very intelligent scientists who have
won Nobel prizes and have many PhDs but still they
they go wrong on this very simple point so it's
it's simple but it's very tricky how about the duality
of animal versus human we touched on this in part
one how do you really determine the difference between an
animal and a human and after all a human is
an animal right many humans behave more like animals and
many animals are actually more humane than humans so ironic
huh and you know if we start to tinker with
our genetic DNA which is already starting to happen you
know they're already starting to clone feed embryos and babies
and stuff and modify DNA using CRISPR and all this
stuff you've probably heard about this in the news recently
well at what point do we do so much modification
to our DNA that our children are no longer going
to be human what is going to be the first
baby born from a human which will not be human
anymore and what we call it and how will we
make that determination and then of course you know with
that come a lot of other questions like well does
that does this superhuman baby does it deserve human rights
or does it deserve more rights than regular humans and
then what do we do we have two classes now
of of humans we have the old humans and the
new super humans you see how many problems this will
create politically socially culturally there's gonna be all sorts of
you know racist type issues that will come up again
legal issues see very tricky how about the distinction between
hardware and software go take a look at your computer
where does the hardware end and the software begin can
you separate them out have you noticed that all software
is happening within a hardware medium so is there even
such a thing as software when you go to the
store and you pick up a Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft
Office or something like that you get it on a
CD that CD is hardware you may say well you
know I I download I'm too sophisticated go to the
store anymore i buy all my software online i just
download it right but if where is it stored on
a physical server and when it gets to your computer
where is it stored it's stored on some sort of
solid-state drive or some spinning disk where does your computer
hardware end and your operating system begin see this is
a really tricky issue it's not so clear how about
the duality between digital and analog that one's really interesting
too people tend to treat that one as though well
you've either got digital or you've got analog and you
can't have any combination in between but all digital stuff
ultimately is in a sense analog like fruit you might
have a digital CD music CD but if I scratch
that CD with a key then it will skip around
and stop working so see I used some analog thing
like a key to make some scratches these are analog
things on a digital device and I ruined it corrupted
the data or I could take a digital hard drive
like a solid-state drive I could you know hit it
with a hammer that's gonna be an analogue action on
a digital device and of course that digital mechanism is
gonna be broken because of because ultimately it's it's analog
in a certain sense that interesting how about matter versus
energy I think we touched on that in part one
I shouldn't talk too much about that hopefully you can
see how a matter and energy are not so clearly
separate as we once thought Einstein's whole brilliance was the
equation e equals MC squared equating matter and energy to
each other when a nuclear explosion goes off all that
energy comes from a conversion of a tiny tiny tiny
portion of the matter into a lot a lot a
lot of energy C so it turns out that these
these two things are not separate as we once thought
of course now we take it completely for granted that
this is obvious and easy and likely oh so what
everybody knows this what a hundred years ago nobody knew
it and the whole point is that when it's first
being discovered there's so much closed mindedness and dogma and
resistance that people are shocked by these discoveries and they
reject them and they get very fundamentalist about it because
what you got to realize is that the categories that
you accept that you hold as normal are simply those
that weren't doctrine eight into you from birth in whatever
generation era you grew up in about the duality of
matter versus antimatter it's really interesting could there be a
third kind something in between how about electricity and magnetism
as a duality a couple hundred years ago physicists thought
that electricity magnetism were separate phenomenon and then of course
electricity and magnetism were unified that took a genius like
Maxwell with his equations to unify electricity and magnetism that
was a huge discovery leading to all sorts of new
technology and new possibilities seems obvious today but it wasn't
obvious at all took a genius to realize that how
about space and time as the duality most people still
think think of space and time as a duality but
the genius of Einstein and realized that it took a
genius like Einstein to have the flexibility and open-mindedness necessary
to realize that actually space and time are not separate
things the way that Newton thought and others before him
thought but that they're they're integrally connected there's a deep
and profound relationship between the two and from that we
got a whole new physics complete paradigm shift came from
that it's the quintessential example of what a paradigm shift
is and it takes a genius to realize that precisely
because genius requires radical open-mindedness and a very fluid approach
to these categories you have to be able to see
new categories that's not easy to do how about the
duality of quantum mechanics versus relativity a lot of physicists
today they specialize either in quantum anacs or relativity of
course some some can do both but they usually have
a specialty and there's this classic problem with in physics
right now is that general relativity Einstein's theories are really
good at explaining how the universe works at the macro
largest scale at the scale of universes and stars and
planets and so forth really high-quality accurate theorems there and
then quantum mechanics is extremely accurate at predicting behaviors at
the micro tiny subatomic level and we use quantum mechanics
to build amazing computers and so forth even though our
computers not quantum mechanical yet we do use the principles
of quantum mechanics to manufacture CPUs and smartphones and other
stuff that you know you use every day but you
don't even realize depends on quantum mechanical principles and theorems
so so both of these theories are very well tested
but scientists already know that there has to be some
sort of unification reconciliation because general activity does not work
at the micro scale of subatomic particles and quantum mechanics
does not work at the you know explaining that the
very large phenomenon of galaxies and planets and so forth
so how are we gonna reconcile those two scientists still
don't know it's really tricky it's gonna take a genius
to come in there and redraw the lines and redo
these dualities and categories so somehow merge them together but
don't expect that to be something obvious and don't expect
everybody in the scientific community to just automatically accept it
once that person discovers it because they're going to be
operating under the old paradigm under the old dualities and
categories how about the duality of theory versus practice these
two are integrally related a lot of times people will
set it up as somehow opposites or conflicting with each
other it happens within personal development it happens within spirituality
but it also happens for example within science so you
know within spirituality the way it happens that people sometimes
criticize me and say Oh leo you're so theoretical you
talk about all this theoretical stuff but really all that
needs to be taught is just the practices that's very
dangerous if you teach people just practices with no theory
then they're not gonna have the proper framework and they're
gonna misunderstand and miss apply the practices or the things
that they discover through the practices will be misunderstood misinterpreted
and improperly embodied on the other hand of course it's
true that if all people get is spiritual theory and
no practices then they will also be very deluded and
become pathological because you have all these ideas it's just
gonna be mental masturbation no practice and that's not going
to work so you need to delicately balance Irian practice
in fact I have a whole episode one of my
most important episodes of all time is one that I
think most people don't appreciate most you guys don't appreciate
it but it's very practical and important it's my episode
about balancing theory and practice go search for how about
the duality related also to this is the duality between
theory and reality some people to get a little bit
of experience with spiritual work and then they become too
they become too conscious Leo I'm too conscious I'm too
old I'm too woke for theory reality is what I
want [Laughter] you're too woke for theory that makes me
laugh theory is extremely important separate them so easily in
fact by separating theory from spirituality you in fact create
the duality that you're supposed to transcend by being non-dual
how can you be truly non-dual when you don't realize
the intimate connection between theory and reality when you're not
even appreciating the fact that theory is reality theory is
a part of reality you can't separate the two and
what is the exact relationship between theory and reality well
that's a that's really tricky and really profound that's a
not easy to answer so I can't answer it here
for you but that's something you should contemplate if you're
serious about your science or even about your spirituality if
you're dismissing one or the other watch out you're making
a mistake how about the duality of system versus environment
or organism versus environment a lot of times in science
the system and the environment are treated as separate things
because science likes to simplify stuff create simple models and
they can be useful but eventually they all break down
because you can't have an object and its environment as
two separate things because the object is always within the
environment always responding to the environment always living and surviving
within the environment and where does where does my environment
begin and I end you see like I'm sitting here
I'm talking to you and it might seem like I
am separate from my environment but am I really no
because that environment the air that I'm surrounded with it's
entering my lungs right now how do you separate the
air in the atmosphere here with the from the air
that's in my lungs and in my blood and applying
my brain with with the oxygen it means in order
to to process all this information and to to speak
to you right now and the speaking that's happening that's
air waves you know oscillations in air that's happening that
might my throat muscles and and all this the voice
box is producing all this so there's there's a seamless
interface between any organism in its environment and that's extremely
important to understand and of course science does understand this
a good scientist understands this but still oftentimes not deeply
enough not deeply enough to really understand an organism for
example you need to understand the environment it lives in
Charles Darwin made some great discoveries and breakthroughs in understanding
that but still not enough like you have to like
really look at the entire earth very holistically because the
way that for example geese migrate from north to south
and so forth you know that depends on various jet
streams and winds that are blowing you know through the
Earth's atmosphere which of course depends on various temperature changes
global warming solar flares and the position of the earth
relative to the Sun all of this all this affects
how geese navigate and of course the the gooses navigational
system that it has in its brain is of course
dependent on the earth on the Earth's magnetic poles what
if we had a pole reversal which happens every couple
hundred thousand years or so or every million years I
don't know how often it happens but pole reversals do
happen on this planet where North and South gets flipped
scientists still don't really understand why that happens but you
know that's gonna screw with the goose migration patterns might
kill all the geese or maybe some new goose will
evolve all right you got it you got to see
how all this is interconnected and that's systems thinking is
so when you become a really good systems thinking see
my episode intro to systems thinking that's a very profound
and powerful episode to where you start to learn how
to look at the world in terms of systems not
individual elements how every element is interacting with other elements
in this complicated web and this is sort of a
the beginning of holistic thinking very important structure to look
at the world that way and most people can't do
that because they're stuck in their very rigid dualities how
about the duality of inorganic versus organic where is that
boundary between the two how about the duality between prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells eukaryotic cells have a nucleus with DNA
prokaryotic cells don't so the prokaryotic cells came first and
supposedly the theory is and we're not quite sure that
the prokaryotic cells somehow evolved into the eukaryotic cells probably
by absorbing other cell and that other cell that they
absorbed was some kind of nucleus thing and it absorbed
it or some some theory like this so literally the
eukaryotic cell is kind of made up of multiple prokaryotic
cells or at least that's how it might have come
into being so you can't quite separate the two how
about sentient versus non sentient as a duality this is
really profound what is sentience most scientists don't appreciate the
depth of this question what is sentience is sentience something
that an object has like a computer can just become
sentient but a rock cannot or a human can or
maybe a dog can but a you know chair cannot
can a tree or a plant be sentient are they
already sentient are they non scenting are they somewhere in
the middle semi-sentient what was the first sentient thing that
ever came into being in the universe and what had
to happen for it to stop being non sentient and
become sentient or maybe the entire universe is sentient maybe
sentience is a transcendent absolute that's something you have to
discover for yourself how about the duality of nature versus
nurture this is a very thorny issue a lot of
debates have been waged over this you know is something
nature or is it nurture being gay is that nature
is that nurture is that how you were raised or
is it in your genetics could it be both is
it possible that the way you're raised affects your genetics
and that affects whether you become gay or not for
example when you are not yet born but in your
mother's belly maybe something happens to your mother she gets
more testosterone or more stress or more estrogen in her
system for whatever reason which of course you know that
usually comes from environmental reasons like maybe your mother is
in a war zone or she's abused or whatever happens
and then maybe that triggers something within you because you're
now attached part of your mother speaking of which you
know where do you end and your mother begin especially
when you're inside her belly seem very tricky so at
that point you're not even separate from your mother yet
you are your mother literally so the environment affects your
mother that of course affects how your brain wires and
all this depending on testosterone estrogen and so forth these
various kinds of hormones very science and studies have been
done on this you can go research those and you
discover that it matters it matters whether your mother is
in a war zone or she stress or she's abused
or she's taking drugs or whatever that that's you to
the point where it might make the difference between you
being gay or straight or bi or transsexual or whatever
and I'm not saying that's the only cause I'm just
saying it's a factor so where do you draw these
lines between environment and genetics it's not so simple at
all in fact this whole notion of a fixed rigid
set of genetics that you just are born with and
that you have to now live with for the rest
of your life it has been completely debunked in the
last 50 years of of biology it's complete horseshit there
is no such thing as a rigid genetics your genes
are constantly expressing themselves in various ways with a very
complicated interrelationship between you the food you eat your environment
and everything that's going on around you literally my words
the words coming out of my mouth can enter your
ears and change the way that your genetics is expressed
this is called epigenetics it's the notion that genetics are
affected by environment and vice-versa literally that's possible and in
fact if you watch enough of my videos what's gonna
happen is that your whole mind is gonna rewire from
this theory from this philosophy your whole mind will rewire
but what is that but it's gonna also shift your
genetics literally your DNA will change from watching actualized Auri
people don't appreciate any of this and then people become
victims and say oh well Leo I'm just fat I
have a DD I'm depressed I suck my life sucks
because of my genetics it's all my genetics of course
genetics are important I'm not denying genetics but it's very
easy to be to start to use genetics as a
sort of a victim mindset it's very convenient the ego
loves some idea of some rigid genetics and you say
well my genetics my genetics were bad so I'm bad
at math my genetics are bad so I'm bad at
meditation I'll never awaken I'll never become a Buddha because
I got [ __ ] genetics see but this becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy that's a really dangerous and tricky duality
genetics and environment it's not so simple at all how
about the duality between first-person and third-person in science is
one of the major paradigmatic sticking points of current materialist
science is that they tend to split the world into
first-person phenomena and third-person phenomena and they don't just do
that but they also assigned value and priority to the
third-person phenomena third-person results so for example a scientist is
skeptical of first-person phenomena anecdotal results but the scientist is
not conscious that all of his science is itself first-person
phenomena point to one thing that has ever happened in
your life that was not first-person direct experience if it's
not direct experience it doesn't exist for you at all
you might say well leo science you know Albert Einstein's
theory of general relativity that's not a first-person thing that's
based on scientific theory validated you know with double-blind placebo-controlled
studies and experiments and evidence and computers and other scientists
have confirmed it and verified in all of this yes
and all of that is first-person happening within you and
most scientists don't get this it falls on deaf ears
if you don't understand this one distinction right here your
entire foundation of doing science will be misguided and you
will do bad science that's how important this stuff is
speaking of science let's tackle some dualities regarding science I
mean the actual discipline of science for example the duality
between science and philosophy or science and metaphysics this is
another sticking point for many scientifically minded people is they
tend to think that science is distinct from philosophy and
science is distinct from metaphysics science is good science is
rigorous science is true and metaphysics and philosophy this is
just mental masturbation it's just theories has nothing to do
with science except of course this is a totally ignorant
position completely ahistorical if you know your history of where
science came from you know what science used to be
called there was not science 500 years ago there was
natural philosophy science evolved out of natural philosophy of course
that's been forgotten conveniently by many scientists today of course
in theory they know it but in practice they don't
actually practice it they don't embody it because they treat
metaphysics as some sort of separate and bad boogeyman field
that is corrupting science if you engage in it where
actually it's the opposite you see when you're doing science
without having done metaphysics all that means is that you're
doing science using very shoddy unconscious materialist metaphysics you're sneaking
the metaphysics in there into your science into all of
your experiments and all of your interpretations of your experiments
it's completely infested with a terrible metaphysics but because you
deny that metaphysics is important or relevant to what you're
doing you don't even know this that's how ignorant you
are you're so ignorant of metaphysics you don't even know
that you have a metaphysics and then it's completely corrupting
all of your science and all of your thinking that's
how significant this duality is it's easy to discount philosophy
yet if you look historically Hill philosophy is one of
the most significant and impactful and practical fields especially within
Western civilization but I mean even in eastern civilization to
look at how philosophy has shaped Eastern civilization in China
in Japan in India deeply philosophical cultures but of course
in the West it also very philosophical the whole notion
of Western civilization basically stemmed from Athens and from Greece
and from Rome and look how philosophical they were the
greatest philosophers were also the greatest scientists if you want
to be a hack scientist don't study philosophy ever or
metaphysics if you want to be a genius cutting-edge Einstein
level scientist study philosophy and metaphysics it's not an accident
that that our greatest scientists who made the biggest breakthroughs
were deeply interested in metaphysical and philosophical topics whether it's
Isaac Newton or Kurt gödel or Albert Einstein or Niels
Bohr or Schrodinger David Bowie I mean I could just
keep rattling haha on and on this list doesn't end
science is actually just a subset of philosophy that's all
it is it's a subset of metaphysics it's a subset
of epistemology how about the duality between science and math
in universities that sometimes they're treated as separate objects there's
like the math department and the physical science department and
they're separate but of course they're not separate because there
wouldn't be modern science without math and of course what
is math but the science of numbers that's all math
is it's the science of numbers how about the duality
between signs and these seem so separate and so different
you have the artsy people and then you have the
nerdy science people but no not at all some of
our greatest scientists and artists were the other half so
our greatest scientists were amazing artists like Leonardo da Vinci
and some of our greatest artists were interested in science
like for example I posted some some videos recently on
my blog go check them out about James Cameron the
director and what I love about him is he's got
this amazing mind this he's a visionary but what's so
amazing about him is that he's like half artist half
scientist he can draw really well like he's a real
proper artist he can just like sketch you a human
face and body and it'll look real really good but
at the same time he's super nerdy and he's into
all the technology and all the science behind the filmmaking
and so he's pushing the the 3d and all this
stuff the computer animation and CGI and all this right
so it's like this amazing blend of both and you
see how powerful that is and how rare that is
because a lot of times when you have a hacky
scientist or a hacky artist they are only doing science
are only doing art we're actually the really interesting parts
in life or were you are merging various disciplines together
like I would like to see in universities the science
and art department start to bleed together not to be
totally different and then look down upon each other that's
not healthy it's fragmented you see you see how the
human mind fragments the world to the point where literally
we erect walls physical walls physical walls right now the
president United States wants to erect a physical wall between
Mexico and the United States it's it's absurd if you
will do you know or look at the the Great
Wall of China still there after what 2,000 years however
old it is a thousand years a thousand a half
years look at that it's insane you can see it
outer space the human mind is so good at subdividing
reality you you can see our walls from outer [
__ ] space or so it's claimed I don't know
if that's true you see that's how absurd it is
you know and then that creates suffering how many people
died to create that wall they're still buried in the
wall there's skeletons of the people who built that [
__ ] wall inside the Great Wall of China to
this day they're buried in it there's bones how many
families were split apart by that wall interesting and of
course why was that wall needed well because there was
a division created between the Chinese people and the Mongol
people the invaders from the north so they needed that
wall but the notion of a distinction between a Mongol
and a Chinese person it's not as significant as as
they might think how about the distinction or the duality
between science and pseudoscience oh man don't get me started
on this I could shoot a whole episode about this
there's so much ignorance around this topic especially many people
who are spiral dynamics stage Orange they fancy themselves atheists
and scientifically minded the Sam Harris gang as we can
call them those folks who love to be very rational
and fact-based which of course they're not at all they
have no idea what science is but they create this
very simplistic duality between science and pseudoscience and anything that
doesn't fit their existing scientific paradigm they just automatically label
it pseudoscience and really what that is this is like
a dirty word for saying that it's [ __ ]
but they don't realize that this whole distinction is begging
the question its viciously circular because the whole endeavor of
science the purpose of science is that we don't know
what is true or what is false and therefore we
have to go and investigate and discover what is and
what is false we have to sort the wheat from
the chaff that means that science from the very beginning
does not know a distinction between science and pseudoscience it
doesn't know the distinction between true and false so what
that means is that science is in the business of
investigating a lot of [ __ ] to determine what
of it is actually correct you see so the idea
that something like all paranormal phenomena well that pseudoscience that's
horseshit you should investigate that Oh Bigfoot does Bigfoot exists
all best pseudoscience that's [ __ ] science a real
scientist shouldn't study Bigfoot shouldn't study religion shouldn't study meditation
shouldn't study psychedelics shouldn't study telepathic abilities shouldn't study aliens
because that's all horseshit it's it's just utterly absurd a
true scientist has to be so open-minded that he's willing
to study anything no Theory can be too crazy or
too stupid sounding for a scientist to not investigate it
now of course you have to be careful I'm not
saying that every pseudo scientific idea is correct in fact
most of them are [ __ ] but the whole
point is that you don't know now you might say
olya but we know we already know we we proved
that telepathic abilities don't exist and that paranormal phenomena is
all [ __ ] we've proven it all no you
haven't you're wrong you haven't proved a [ __ ]
in fact paranormal phenomena are very real and there's a
lot of signs to back it up the problem though
is that you're not willing to accept that science because
it doesn't fit your definition of science you see the
word science is all about how you define it who
gets to define what science is and what pseudoscience is
is meditation science or is it pseudoscience is the psychedelic
science or pseudoscience if I have a brain injury and
I start to hallucinate flying monkeys and I start to
study that you know the monkeys they fly around I
study them am i doing science if I study what's
happening in my dreams am i doing science if I
go inside of a video game Super Mario World VR
edition and I start to study how Mario moves and
jumps and what his enemies are and what their favorite
food is am i doing science the science of Mario
World and that of course brings us to the duality
between science and religion and science and spirituality these are
held as separate things in university these are in totally
different departments having nothing to do with each other this
is a terrible terrible epistemic blunder of epic proportions that
has kept us literally in the dark ages right now
with regards to our science and our spirituality these two
need to start communicating with each other what is religion
or spirituality but the science of consciousness that's literally what
it is Yoga is the science of consciousness but of
course when you call it that many scientists traditional scientists
and universities they object and say all olio yoga is
so unscientific religion is so unscientific were the opposite of
religion really dude you've got more in common with religion
than you're willing to admit you're just as close-minded as
a religious person only you do it in a university
setting see that's your problem right there conventional science and
universities today has no idea what consciousness is yet mankind
has had complete understanding of consciousness for over 5,000 years
how is such a travesty possible how is it possible
that mankind knows what conscious is for five [ __
] thousand years and yet our best universities today don't
know what consciousness is nor are they even interested in
learning from those traditions that are 5000 years old about
what consciousness is that's how big of a problem this
is how about the duality between science and business many
scientists consider themselves as having nothing to do with business
they're above business and above marketing yeah this is a
very ignorant attitude because actually the university that you're in
doing science in is a business and there are very
heavy corporate interests and forces monetary and corporate forces which
are shaping how human science is done right now such
that for example if it doesn't allow for a business
to earn a lot of money then they're not going
to fund the research and therefore you're not going to
do the science because you're a slave to the to
the capitalist system so see science is corrupted by capitalism
the science understand this the science admit this usually not
at all because that would take science down a peg
it doesn't want to admit science doesn't want to admit
that science is very biased by financial pressures and influences
such that the most important science that we could be
doing right now we're not doing because there's no money
for it because no corporation can market it to the
masses and make a killing make billions of dollars or
they can't patent it for example psychedelics are not being
properly researched in universities businesses can't make a bunch of
money on it because it's illegal that's just one example
meditation is not seriously research I mean there definitely are
universities that research meditation these days but still not nearly
enough not nearly enough and that's because there's just not
a lot of good money to be made from understanding
meditation unless maybe you want to become a guru who
like Osho and then you can make your 91 Rolls
Royces or whatever he had that's that's pretty good money
but still pennies compared to the billions that you can
earn for example if some scientist does some some research
that you know create some new pill that gives you
a boner okay well that that's that's good science right
there and that's what we consider good size they'll fund
they'll fund that with billions of dollars you see how
distorted science becomes and then those people who defend science
they like to say that well leo science is just
the truth man it's just facts it's not biased it's
totally biased it's completely overrun with corporate interests what are
you talking about there are so many things that could
be researched by science that are not being researched because
it is so biased and you don't even know about
it and yet you hold it as the truth how
about the duality between science and culture this is very
important a lot of scientists because they want to be
rigorous they tend to deny that science has anything to
do with culture and that science is cultural in any
way science is not culturally Oh science is factual and
objective culture that's all human fluffy romantic stuff Airy fairy
stuff whereas science is based on hard facts you can't
argue with quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is not a cultural
product of course it is of course it is science
is completely cultural the only reason that science has any
validity or authority rather not validity but let me say
we've read that authority has any authority in your mind
is because you were culturally indoctrinated into believing the value
and power of science understand this it's completely cultural we
could create a culture where science is not valued at
all or we could create a technocracy where our entire
government and everything that we do is ruled by scientists
science is a culture within science itself there is culture
and there's even subcultures within various disciplines of science for
example physicists have their own subculture biologists have their own
different and unique subculture and the humana you know social
sciences they have their own unique culture subculture which often
doesn't get along with the other sciences what you consider
valid evidence what you even consider is within the domain
of science or outside the domain of science that is
cultural so for example most people would not consider yoga
most Western people would not consider yoga to be within
the domain of a science it's pseudoscience at best but
that's because our Western culture has defined it that way
in a thousand years yoga will be completely incorporated into
science such that when we say science and yoga people
are going to know all those are just the same
thing just you know Yoga is a type of science
in the same way that like biology is a type
of science they're not opposed to each other that's a
cultural phenomena and so one of the things that holds
science back so much and the recent science is infested
with a lot of delusion and misunderstanding is because it's
a it's a slow giant cultural beast and it takes
generations of scientists to die before new generations of scientists
are open-minded enough to accept new paradigms and then that's
how science progresses in spite of itself in spite of
itself because it's so cultural science is about gathering a
collective consensus which can only be done in a culture
in a certain sense you can't even do science without
a culture a single individual human you might almost say
can't do science because what what is science without a
consensus of various experts they have to agree with each
other they have to have a common language which is
culture they have to have a common set of values
so that they don't kill each other to even do
their science that's culture so many scientists are to know
how about this now of course I'm not saying that
science is purely cultural it's not just cultural I'm just
saying that these this duality between science and culture it's
not so clear-cut in black and white as you've been
led to believe how about the duality between chemistry and
biology where does one end and the other begin you
can't draw a line between them molecular biology is right
in the middle of both to be a good biologist
got'em she had chemistry to be a good well I
don't know if you need to understand biology be a
good chemist but but certainly those two those two work
and tan them with each other how about the duality
between hard sides and soft science this is one that
you find within universities usually there's like half the university
as hard sciences like physics biology chemistry and so forth
and then the other half a university you know separated
by some kind of wall of course in a different
building maybe there's a park in between something less less
oppressive than a wall probably a park separating from the
soft science is like the humanities any of the people
the hard sciences they laugh at those and the soft
Sciences and say oh look at those those softies over
there they don't really do serious science we're the ones
doing real science here within the physics but in a
certain sense physics is the easiest science to do hard
sciences in a certain sense are the easiest because there
are so few variables there I mean there's still a
lot of variables but relatively so few variables there compared
to a social science that it's so much easier to
create a model of fundamental particles within quantum mechanics than
it is to create a model of for example human
behavior humans are so complex so of course soft Sciences
like psychology for example or history or sociology or anthropology
this sort these are the softer Sciences they're so much
more difficult to do well precisely because there's so many
variables and it's so easy for your mind to deceive
you and it's very difficult to run experiments clear-cut experiments
because for example every human being is different so you
can't just treat them all the same the way that
a biologist might for example treat all rats the same
in a maze and even there that you know it's
not going to work if you treat all rats the
same you still have to distinguish between different kinds of
rats but a lot easier than dealing with humans and
you know a lot of scientists for example the hard
scientists they tend to look at humans as rats and
they tend to treat them as rats and then the
all sorts of things go wrong you know that hard
scientists that physicists he comes home to his wife after
a long day of work and then he treats her
like a rat that's how he treats her cuz that's
how he thinks of humans because you know he's just
so he's so dead set on looking at the world
in an analytical logical frame of mind which is good
for hard science but terrible in your relationships speaking of
which is there are signs of relationships well if there
is that physicist sucks at it of course I'm stereotyping
here there are physicists who are good at relationships but
um just just these are stereotypes and I say them
tongue-in-cheek a lot of times how about the duality between
natural and unnatural or not natural and artificial this trips
a lot of people up they get cut up on
like well is that natural food or unnatural food well
what is unnatural food well it's like well like you
know Coca Cola is unnatural food but why is it
unnatural because a human being made it are human beings
not natural hmm where did you mean beings come from
whether human beings not part of nature see so what
does it really mean that something is natural artificial anything
artificial is made by nature so it's natural human cities
are not artificial they're natural we're just like a fungus
that's growing on the earth that's what we are everything
is natural when you understand that then you transcend natural
and artificial - natural with a capital end so now
I'm talking about the absolute again natural the capital n
that's when you realize everything is natural including all human
stuff a human Factory is totally natural its sprung up
on the earth like a mushroom there it is pumping
out cars the way that a mushroom pumps out spores
how about the duality between evolution creation or evolution and
design oh boy this is very tricky very tricky a
lot of people get diluted here thinking that somehow these
are opposites well you got evolution or you got creation
design but they can't be both evolution is creation and
creation is evolution all design is evolutionary I'll talk a
lot more about this topic in the future about evolution
so I'm just gonna gloss over it here but I
want you to notice that every single design that a
human being has ever made has been evolutionary has actually
been a part of evolution actually came out of evolution
like for example the iPhone you know your model one
iPhone first generation um was one thing and then the
second generation third 10th 10th generation that's all evolution happening
evolution is not limited to biology by any stretch of
the imagination it's it's everywhere everything is evolution you're living
evolution and evolution is not separate from design now you
might say oh you're just playing clever word games here
you're just trying to to make it seem as though
the universes decide when really it evolved so you're just
playing word games no I'm not playing word games you're
the one playing word games I'm actually showing you that
what I'm talking about here goes way beyond words I'm
actually talking about the physical substrate of HUF existence not
words the the metaphysics of existence the actual stuff that
you think is real what I'm telling you is that
that's words that's dualities we're getting there we're not quite
there yet there was gonna be the existential dualities we're
not there yet we're building up to it next duality
inside outside internal external if you look closely at any
object you will not be able to draw a boundary
between its inside that's outside impossible impossible you can't determine
what's inside of a human and what's outside of a
human where is that point where the inside of a
human is the outside of a human is this is
this the outside of a human or is that the
inside of a human and where does it stop does
it stop at my lip does it stop inside my
mouth does that to go all the way in my
in my guts you know a human being is actually
like a doughnut if you think about it's like a
long stretched out doughnut the hole going into your mouth
goes all the way through your belly all that comes
out your ass and that's like you like being a
doughnut see so the inside and outside are two sides
of one coin how about the duality of micro versus
macro what's micro and what's macro these are totally relative
he's a human being a micro or a macro object
well relative to a galaxy I'm a micro object but
relative to a quark or subatomic particle I'm a macro
yeah I'm micro relative to a galaxy I'm macro relative
to a subsonic particle how about the duality between Western
and Eastern medicine that's huge huge you know how many
thousands of people die in America simply because our culture
our scientific institutions our educational institutions and our medical system
has completely botched this duality between Western and Eastern medicine
they reject Eastern medicines which could cure many serious deadly
diseases in the West completely rejected because there's this idea
that if it's coming from the east then it can't
be real it's not it's not proven it's dangerous how
about the duality between rational and irrational you think these
are two separate things take the most rational person in
the world and I'll show you someone who's more irrational
than they are actually rational most rational people their rationality
has been completely co-opted by their ego which is completely
co-opted by their system in their needs so the people
who proclaim that they're the most rational they are actually
the most irrational and utterly driven by their egoic biases
and emotional needs which is precisely why they're so triggered
by irrationality see what a rational person has done is
he's created a shadow out of the irrational because he
doesn't know how to handle it or how to deal
with it so he's actually fragmented himself he himself is
disconnected from his body and his emotions he's living in
like the left hemisphere of his mind his brain and
and as his whole attitude towards the world is completely
severed in this way so then he has to create
this shadow and then any time he sees irrational activity
out there in the world whether it's religion or it's
women or femininity or children or whatever he gets upset
by it because he can't control it and manipulate it
the way that his ego wants and you call that
rational that's the height of rationality how about the duality
between rational and intuitive which are you are you rational
are you intuitive can you be both how is rationality
actually informed by intuition and how is intuition actually safeguarded
and made more concrete through rationality it's very interesting that
the best logicians are highly intuitive people the best mathematicians
are highly intuitive isn't that interesting most of our genius
mathematicians when they're solving some unsolvable mathematical logical proof the
way they do it is intuitively they Intuit the answer
long before they're able to formally prove it quite amazing
good example that is kurt gödel he's very very rash
on the one hand yet his rationality is completely grounded
in intuition on the other hand how about the duality
between skepticism and faith these are sometimes pitted against each
other as opposites but are they really check out my
episode true versus false skepticism where I rant against this
I rant against false skepticism and I talk about how
most skeptics these days they're not true skeptics at all
they're hypocrites because they don't question their own skepticism and
so they're skeptical about everything except for their skepticism therefore
in effect they have faith in skepticism which is of
course very ironic very hypocritical very misguided that's exactly right
skepticism is a very counterintuitive thing because if you were
truly skeptical you would also be sceptical of your skepticism
and where would that leave you that would leave you
groundless but most skeptics these days people who proclaim themselves
as skeptics they're not actually groundless there are dogmatists but
if you actually read the outlines of Piran ISM where
skepticism came from from the from the ancient Greek hero
and from sexist empirica one of his acolytes if you
if you actually read the original Greek skeptic works the
whole point of skepticism was to not be dogmatic and
yet today people have turned scepticism into dogma its own
into a dogma of its own which is a terribly
tragic and highly diluted but good luck convincing one of
these skeptics that he's wrong because he has such absolute
faith in his skepticism I mean it's a joke it
literally is a joke arguing against these rationalists like sam
harris types these sceptics these atheists it's it's just like
it's a farce is what it is it says it
deserves to be like a comedy you can make a
comedy movie out of it this is so stupid it's
so myopic is so non-integral it lacks perspex so lacks
perspective it's so far from truth but I'm getting on
a rant here moving on how about the duality between
fact and interpretation or empirical data versus interpretation sometimes this
is framed as facts don't care about your feelings which
is the most idiotic thing that a human being has
ever said because all of your logic and all of
your citing of facts is completely dictated by your feelings
completely you think you can separate a fact from interpretation
of the fact you haven't investigated this topic at all
if you think that the whole can of worms that
is epistemology is this problem of our inability to distinguish
between what is a fact and what is an interpretation
and what are our reasons versus our feelings in fact
those people who adamantly state that facts are superior to
feelings and that facts can be separated from interpretation in
a sort of simplistic notion of science where's like well
the data doesn't some hair says I think he says
a the data the data cannot lie the math cannot
lie that's that's about a stupid of saying that statistics
cannot lie you cannot make this separation at all but
what I was saying is that uh those people who
adamantly insist that it's possible to separate facts from feelings
and tracks from interpretation they themselves are doing that for
a position of emotional attachment and feeling they're attached to
that so it's not factual it's completely emotional which is
why they're so adamant about it and they get so
emotional about it they get angry and upset about it
especially if you point this out to them they'll start
to do all sorts of mental gymnastics and they'll start
to call you all sorts of names and demonize you
and so forth of course because it's all ego ego
doesn't give a [ __ ] about facts or truth
ego cares about its agenda and all of your feelings
in your entire emotional system is your ego a kadena
that's all it is feelings are just a way for
your ego to get what it wants that's all it
is facts don't matter at all you don't give a
[ __ ] about facts in fact you don't even
know what a fact is what is a fact you
don't have a single fact all you have are interpretations
even the concept of a fact is already an interpretation
see this is the whole problem science science is under
this simple-minded illusion that it can separate experimental data from
the interpretation of that data when actually it can't do
that it doesn't know how to do that how about
the duality of dependent versus independent or contingent versus necessary
it's not so easy to determine what is dependent and
what is independent point to one thing in the universe
that is independent everything is dependent upon everything else how
about the philosophical duality of APIs a priori versus a
posterior a posterior I or II this is sort of
a nerdy duality that you've probably only heard if you've
studied philosophy but this is a big one that they
argue about over and over again centuries of philosophers arguing
versus versus is this truth here is it a priori
or is it a posterior area and what they mean
by that is a priori means independent of experience prior
to experience and then a posterior means dependent upon experience
and of course you can't separate the two you can't
separate the two or there's also another philosophical distinction between
analytic and synthetic there's analytic truths and synthetic truths for
example one plus one equals two is considered an analytical
truth because you can just get that by by just
kind of like looking at what it is looking at
the definitions of the terms it's definitionally you might say
true by definition that's analytic and then synthetic means that
it has to be gathered from facts out in the
world so if I study you know rabbits and I
see that they have two ears that they all have
two ears well that's a synthetic truth you can't make
that distinction and again philosophers have argued about this distinction
for hundreds of years as though you can make this
distinction but you never really could willard Quine the philosopher
has a really good essay talking about the two dogmas
of empiricism and he talks about how you can't you
can't you can't maintain the analytic synthetic distinction which is
of course completely correct but that fact is still lost
on most people doing philosophy how about the duality between
relevant and irrelevant that's completely relative what is relevant and
what is irrelevant completely depends on your ego and what
your go know what you're doing how about the duality
between quantitative and qualitative sometimes scientists and intellectual types will
like to make this distinction it sounds very intellectual to
say oh this thing is quantitative and it's a and
then this thing is a qualitative difference of course there
is no such distinction there is no such distinction the
way reality works is that quantitative differences become qualitative differences
like if you have two people in a room that's
one situation if you have a thousand people in a
room that's a totally different situation that's a qualitative difference
not just a quantitative difference the quantity of people in
the room made a qualitative difference to how that group
of people will behave as heard and then if you
get a billion people together in a room or in
a city or something that's gonna produce yet another order
of new emergent phenomenon going from a quantitative to a
totally new qualitative you know difference for example you can't
create a nation with two people but you can create
a nation with a billion people and that's that's quantitative
turning into qualitative and perhaps the best example of this
is with with nuclear weapons if you get enough plutonium
together by increasing quantity eventually it'll reach a critical mass
and there will be a massive qualitative difference called a
nuclear explosion quantity turns into quality in that nuclear explosion
but if you have just a little bit less plutonium
then enough to reach the critical mass it won't explode
no matter what you do to it very interesting how
about the duality between natural and supernatural this creates a
lot of confusion amongst scientifically minded people because they didn't
hold that supernatural is impossible and unreal but of course
the goal posts on this moves all the time what
is supernatural and what is natural something that is natural
today used to be supernatural five hundred years ago something
that will be natural tomorrow it's considered supernatural today based
on how culture changes so what is considered natural or
supernatural is not defined by actual facts at all it
has something to do with science or physics or or
objective truth it's completely relative so whatever our culture says
is natural is natural and whatever a culture considers supernatural
is supernatural so for example if you consider x-rays natural
today do you realize that 200 years ago x-rays were
considered hocus pocus supernatural stuff if you talked about it
if you took an iPhone got into a time machine
took an iPhone back to the to the ancient Roman
days and show them your iPhone they would think you're
a supernatural sorcerer see stuff that science will discover a
hundred years from now if we talked about it today
in a university it would be called supernatural pseudoscience malarkey
and these are not just word games I actually mean
that there are supernatural phenomena what you consider supernatural phenomena
of course when you actually become fully conscious of these
supernatural phenomena they just become totally natural to you so
for example you can develop telepathic abilities by doing yoga
and psychedelics and so forth and it'll be totally natural
you'll be telepathic but it'll be totally natural to you
but of course to everyone else it'll be very supernatural
and they'll think you're either full of [ __ ]
or that you're which and of course you know we
burned the witches to say or it's very least we
demonize and mocked them to the point where we can
dismiss what they what they have to offer so the
natural supernatural distinction can be transcended to the absolute which
is supernatural supernatural capital S which means that everything is
supernatural electricity is supernatural magnetism is supernatural light a supernatural
super nature pure it is look the human body is
supernatural you can become conscious that if you become conscious
of the absolute that will open you up to new
possibilities new abilities cities and so forth the next duality
mind versus body mind versus brain oh boy this is
huge huge can of worms Western philosophy and science has
been dealing with the mind-body problem as it's known or
over five hundred years at least since Descartes still has
not been resolved officially but of course it's long been
resolved by Yogi's and by mystics um for over five
thousand years like I said the mind-body problem solved from
five thousand years but people don't want to learn non
duality say you got it the only way to resolve
the mind-body problem is by becoming non-dual and understanding the
things that I'm talking about here so what's more primary
the mind or the body is the mind in the
brain or is the brain in the mind ultimately what
you have is transcendence of both a unification and the
merging of the subject the subject and the object and
you have the absolute of mind with capital M so
what you become conscious of is that everything is mind
that chair is mind that building is mind this is
not just a word game you could actually become conscious
of it thereby transcending this duality another common one that's
related to this is physical is mental is the universe
physical or is it mental it's psycho physical or mental
with a capital M everything that you know that is
quote-unquote physical is actually mental but you see mental can
take the form of physical stuff which is something that
you haven't really taken serious as a possibility before so
that chair it looks physical it is physical but that's
because the mentality of the entire universe is doing physics
there it is in its physical form again you might
think this is a word game but it's not a
word game I'm telling you new things you can become
conscious on all this stuff I'm talking about is new
stuff don't think you understand this stuff or that you
have reached the end of this so this is all
new stuff for you that's how you should treat everything
I say how about the duality between physical and non-physical
well everything is non-physical non-physical the capital end how about
material versus immaterial everything is ultimately immaterial a material is
an absolute immaterial of the capital I how about the
duality of same versus different I have a very long
and deep episode about that called sameness versus difference go
check that out if you want more about that but
is sameness different from difference or a sameness the same
if two things are different aren't they then the same
because they're both different this one is such a mindfuck
contemplate that one how about variable versus constant those are
related how about input versus output have you noticed that
every input is some output like the output of the
words coming out of my mouth is actually the input
of various kinds of things that I've studied and contemplated
so the stuff that I study and contemplate the work
that I do meditation so forth that's the input the
output is the words but the output now though these
words are now entering your ears which is now my
words my output is turning into your input now this
information is going into your mind and now this becomes
the input into your mind which then becomes the next
output so now when you go speak to a friend
of yours or to a family member and you say
Oh Leo told me this and let me teach you
about non-duality now my output your input has now turned
to your output and so and so and so it
goes to infinity reality is an infinite chain of inputs
and outputs all criss-crossing with each other in a infinitely
tangled web how about form versus function as a duality
sometimes people talk about these as though they're two different
things but the function of a thing is determined by
its form you can't really separate these two take a
look at any animal the function of an animal body
is its form literally it's embodying functions so for example
maybe the function of a bird you might say is
to fly and in order to do that it has
to have a certain form it has to have a
wing or it has to have a pointy nose in
order to reduce wind resistance or it has to have
light bones with air pockets in them so that it
can fly so the form of the bird determines its
function and of course the same with all human-made inventions
and devices how about the duality between syntax and semantics
sometimes these are separated so they're different but they're not
they're closely related how about controller versus controlled this is
a very thorny issue are you in control of your
life or is society controlling you who's controlling who it
might seem like society's controlling you because society teaches you
culture and educates you and all this so it controls
you but that on the other hand you can also
then for example start your own school and start to
teach your own ideas and now you become the controller
you can actually become like president of the country and
then change the country change the education system in the
country which now you went from being controlled to now
becoming a controller but the controlling you're doing is coming
from the controlled person that you were the way you're
controlling the country depends on how you were controlled by
the country when you were educated and so it goes
in an infinite chain without end so who is controlling
who you think you're in control of your life but
are you really speaking of which that leads us to
do allottee of determinism versus freewill this is a duality
you can transcend this duality to realize will with a
capital W divine will absolute will God's will that's a
it's a very tricky issue which I'll discuss separately in
the future how about the duality between analysis and synthesis
or analysis and holism a lot of what science does
these days is has a bias towards analysis it breaks
everything up into pieces without doing high quality synthesis or
holistic big-picture thinking this creates a lot of problems but
of course you can't just do big-picture thinking and synthesis
without analysis you need to be able to do both
and you need to be able to balance between these
two holism and analysis together that would be holism with
a capital h Seacole ism of the capital with a
lowercase H that's holism which just tries to be holistic
but never tries to do any analysis it rejects analysis
but holism with a capital H transcends and includes both
and that's what's really powerful that's what we need within
science how about the duality of technology versus magic who
is it that has that beautiful quote about how technology
is indistinguishable from magic is it arthur c clarke or
carl sagan I forget who but one of the two
it's a really good quote but it goes way deeper
than most people who say that quote actually realized because
the point is that everything is magic all technology is
actually magic that's what it is reality is itself is
magic but you're missing the magic of it it's not
game you have to actually become conscious that it's magic
how about the duality of cause and effect this is
sort of similar to input and output have you noticed
that every effect is the cause of something else so
for example I might light a firecracker and so the
cause of the Firecracker exploding will be my lighter that
I light it with let's say that's the cause of
the explosion but then the explosion itself let's say that's
the effect or the effect but then the explosion creates
a sound or causes a sound I should say so
the effect of the explosion is this new thing a
sound so it's been caused the explosion causes sound so
the effect now creates a new cause and that sound
is itself now an effect of the explosion but that
sound when it hits my ears it causes me to
now react in some way maybe it's very loud and
so I need to now close my ears or I
feel some pain so the effect of the sound has
caused pain and me and so the chain goes on
and on and on to infinity forever science loves to
break apart reality into causes and effects and usually it
only looks at cause and effect in a very simple
linear manner like a causes B causes C but in
fact reality is like I said with those inputs and
outputs just this vast infinite multi-dimensional nest or web of
cause and effect which all are like ripples in a
pond imagine a million ripples in a you know pebbles
thrown it upon all the Rings intersect with each other
and in this complicated pattern that's how cause-and-effect really works
science has a lot of work to do before it
fully understands the problems that creates for itself with this
cause-and-effect uality it does not understand the depth of this
problem how about the duality of consistent versus contradictory people
often hold contradiction as though it's a mistake or it's
awful or it's a it's a it's a sign of
error or falsehood this is not at all the case
people like to demonize contradiction that's not the case at
all as we talked about in my episode about qoodles
incompleteness theorem it's one of those remarkable discoveries within within
mathematics and logic and all of human science and philosophy
basically because what kurt moodle demonstrated is that any formal
system that uses symbols that is complex enough in order
to be able to speak about itself or to self-reflect
it must necessarily be able to contradict itself so if
the system is rich enough and it seeks to be
consistent it will ultimately become contradictory in the same way
that I can use language to reflect on itself and
I can say something like I am a liar is
it true or is it false that I'm a liar
if I'm telling the truth that means I'm a liar
and that means you can't trust what I said because
it's false but if I'm not telling the truth and
I say I'm a liar then you can't take what
I said as being true and so there's also a
contradiction so it contradicts in both directions because that's a
property of self reflection and the reason that that happens
is because reality is non dual you can't use symbols
to accurately capture the totality of reality because symbols are
a portion not the whole but that's a that's a
lot for you to understand if that's the first time
you're gonna be hearing it contemplate it we're gonna pass
out Kurt Google geo de l next duality discovery versus
invention was gravity invented or was it discovered was quantum
mechanics invented or was it discovered materialists tend to hold
that no leo these aren't inventions these are discoveries gravity
is not an invention discovery it's not so simple though
not so simple at all in a very important sense
gravity was invented in a very important sense quantum mechanics
is an invention not a discovery contemplate that there's a
lot more that could be said about that how about
the duality of heterogeneous versus homogeneous or linear versus nonlinear
we'll talk about that one in the future or a
problem versus solution this one's very interesting because a lot
of times we get stuck on our problems and we
tend to like think of problems and solutions as polar
opposites without realizing that within the problem lies the solution
and then every solution comes with new problems have you
noticed this how you frame your problems determines what kind
of solutions you'll get how about the duality of possible
versus impossible are there certain things that are just impossible
within reality or is everything possible well it turns out
actually if you become conscious of the absolute that everything
is possible because the reality is infinitely infinitely powerful it
has no restrictions or limits on it whatsoever that's what
infinity means unlimited unbounded so literally all possible these are
possible for it so you might say that it's impossible
for anything to be impossible therefore making everything possible this
is possible with a capital P as an absolute that's
something you can become conscious of how about the duality
of the chicken and the egg problem that's a classic
one which came first well of course the chicken is
the egg you can't have a chicken without an egg
and you can't have an egg without a chicken how
about the duality of credentialed versus uncredentialed this is a
big one and within science everyone in science is trying
to become credentialed as credentialed as possible and they look
down upon those people who are uncredentialed because there's some
how unscientific but the irony of course is that those
uncredentialed people can discover true things about reality which belong
within the domain of science so this this demand for
credentials really is very anti scientific if you think about
it because credentials are a human cultural phenomenon whereas making
discoveries about truth which is what science is purportedly supposed
to be about you don't need a diploma to do
that you don't need a PhD you don't need a
Nobel Prize it doesn't matter how many papers you've written
tomorrow you could discover the greatest truth about black holes
or about quantum mechanics or about relativity anyone can do
it now of course it's much much less likely I'm
not saying that you should discount credentials they have some
value I certainly wouldn't want to go to a doctor
who didn't have a you know a medical diploma I
want a credential doctor so that's a nice safety net
but at the same time there are many credential doctors
who are terrible doctors and there are many people in
the world who have no credentials who could heal you
of cancer or other terrible alum ailments that you have
completely uncredentialed that could actually save your life understanding this
one duality could save your whole life if you get
cancer because most people in the West they get cancer
and they only go for credential treatments oftentimes they don't
work of course they could kill you too if you
go to some uncredentialed quack who gives you some sort
of terrible remedy that is gonna kill you it will
kill you so I'm not saying that you should just
you know go use quacks without any kind of mmm
evaluation you got to think this stuff through a bit
too be careful that's what science is the whole endeavor
of science is that it's not safe it's risky you
don't know what's true and what's false you gotta experiment
and when you're experimenting there's risk you could do an
experiment that's gonna waste a lot of years and not
turn out any good result might even kill you you
know scientists did experiments with x-rays and radiation and then
they died from it that's science it's risky whereas today
most people they take science so for granted they just
expect science to like deliver truth to them on a
silver platter with zero risk that's not science that's [
__ ] faith and Dogma that's what that is you
want safety which is what religion is and you're making
a shadow out of religion because you want safety but
then you hate religious people for wanting safety from religious
ideas but then you use scientific ideas in order to
get yourself safety it's absurd absurd how about the duality
of the newbie versus the expert versus the master oftentimes
we like to pick on newbies as though they're bad
or inferior somehow but every master started life as a
newbie everyone no exceptions so if you want to encourage
people to become masters and experts you need to be
nice to them as newbies you need to encourage them
as newbies how many newbies are scared off never become
masters because they're so bullied as a newbie that they
just quit because there's nobody there to to encourage them
you know a really good teacher the whole point of
a really good teacher is that he takes a newbie
and he instills in the newbie a sense of possibility
and vision and inspiration motivation and shows him techniques how
to do stuff and makes him have hope and faith
in himself makes him believe in himself give them a
sense of confidence teaches all that such that the newbie
can become an expert through a lot of effort and
then from an expert become a master and so when
you become an expert usually you're very arrogant towards newbies
but once you become a master it goes full circle
and actually you become very understanding and humble with newbies
because you understand that really it's just one circle you
know it goes round and round and round that's what
life is about here going from newbie to master and
it's not personal you can't judge people for having lack
of experience we all start life with zero experience there's
no point in judging someone for having little experience in
physics or chemistry or medicine or spirituality or psychology or
personal development or business or anything we all start zero
so who are you judging you're only judging yourself you're
being deluded and then we have the final scientific duality
we still have gotten to the existential ones which is
the map versus the territory how many times have you
heard me say that the the map is not the
territory that's a very profound truth yet at the same
time if you separate the map from the territory and
you hold it as two separate polar opposite things you've
created duality and you're deluded so actually what I'm here
to tell you is that the map is the territory
leo which is true you said the map is not
a territory now you're telling me the map is a
territory well of course the map was always the territory
because what is a map but a part of the
territory all there is is territory let me explain so
for example if I'm standing in New York City and
I'm drawing a map of New York see if I'm
gonna draw a really accurate map of New York City
I also have to include an image on the map
of myself standing there drawing the map and inside that
map that I draw I will have to include another
image of myself drawing another map why does this happen
and of course it goes to infinity this shows you
the infinite nature of reality it shows you why symbols
cannot capture all of reality that's why this happens this
is the same issue as we were running into with
kernels incompleteness theorem and self reflection the sort of liar
paradox that I just ran through a few minutes ago
so it's the same problem that's because all there really
is is territory you see so like if I'm drawing
a map here this map it's not like existing in
some other universe or some other dimension it's part of
reality so if we want to capture all of reality
we also have to include into it any Maps models
thoughts ideas or images so thoughts and images are a
part of reality which of course connects back with with
that point I made about the mind-body problem there is
no boundary between mind and body so the floss that
you're having are just as real as your hands just
as real as your head just as real as your
brain of course you have to be conscious that your
brain is actually thought is something you're thinking at least
right now mm-hmm when you're actually looking at it that's
a different story but you're thinking about looking at it
aren't you that's a thought but a thought is real
you just have to distinguish between a thought and a
hand and a foot in a car in a tree
and I mean there are different things but they're not
separate from each other there's still one it's tricky go
through it slowly and really contemplate each one of these
you got understand each one of these do alleys and
I'm talking about you could spend months contemplating each one
I'm giving you a list of 250 of them you
could spend the next 20 years contemplating everything I said
here and you still won't understand everything that there is
to understand here that's how deep this goes that's how
wide it goes as well it goes deep and wide
infinitely deep and infinitely what both at once all right
I'm tired of talking and I've only gotten through half
the material so intermission here don't go anywhere I'll be
right back well I was going to cover the rest
of the list here the existential dualities that I promised
you but there's too much material I think to stuff
into this episode so what I decided is that this
will be part two this is the end of part
two we're gonna sort of leave it as a cliffhanger
and then next week there will be part three but
I'm warning you it's very important that you stick around
for part three because the whole point of this series
was to build up towards the very end and now
finally we've got to the point where now we can
talk about the existential dualities that which is the foundation
of all of existence to put it mildly so you're
gonna want to stick around for that and then I'll
have some concluding remarks to tie it all together and
to show you the significance of this master list that
I'm giving you what I want you to do for
me though over the next week is I want you
to start to put the things that I'm telling you
into practice and to start to notice these dualities functioning
in your everyday life and I want you to start
to keep a list so maybe use the examples I
gave you to start off your list but then come
up with your own I want you to actually start
keeping a list of duality that you're noticing at school
at work in your family with your arts when you're
watching television whatever it is start keeping a list because
I want you to start to get a sense of
the extent of this both the the depth the breadth
and the depth of it all right this is the
nature of all of existence right here that we're talking
about from the little to the big from all the
parts to all the holes so we're explaining it all
but you have to actually contemplate these examples for yourself
you have to kind of work through them almost like
a logical proof or like a mathematical equation that you're
solving that you've been given in math class because the
danger here is that I'm giving you this massive list
which has partially taken me over a year to compile
thinking about it contemplating it and then it's taken me
many years before that even to to study duality and
non-duality to reconcile all these things in my mind through
various examples and experiences for myself so the only way
that you're gonna really get the value of this list
and really be able to appreciate it and have it
to change your life so that it's not just theory
and philosophy is if you start to actually do the
math problems so to speak here right take one of
these examples think through it if one of these examples
that I gave to you doesn't make sense or you
disagree with it or you think I'm wrong or whatever
good investigate that this is not about you believing my
list as though I'm some sort of authority figure with
a list for you to believe like some sort of
Ten Commandments that's not what actualize that or it is
I'm just giving you pointers and hints at stuff that
you can explore for yourself and then see what the
result of that is it's not helpful for you just
to believe me and to say oh well yeah I
trust you leo I think you're smart so I'll just
I'll just believe your list that's not gonna help you
in the same way that it's not gonna help you
to just believe your math teacher giving you answers to
math problems to learn mathematics you have to go through
the work yes it takes work the point is that
it's actually highly useful and practical but only when you're
doing the work not as a philosophy it does no
good for you to go around telling your friends and
your family oh well I know about duality let me
tell you about how the world is dualistic and yadda-yadda
you just you just talk and talk and talk about
all these that maybe you memorize all the examples and
give you and then you just spit it out at
them that doesn't help to improve your life that doesn't
make you any happier the point is that you need
to like see how it's working and see the limitations
of that dualistic frame of mind that you are applying
to all of the world in business and relationships at
school it was in science and and everywhere else right
that's where the results come from so spend the next
week starting to do that and then I'll give you
some more profound examples to wrap it all up and
then you can do some more months and years of
following up on the stuff that I give you in
part 3 so make sure you stick around for that
you
