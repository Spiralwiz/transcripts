for a long time now I've been wanting to shoot
an episode where I distill over 20 years of my
life experience trying to figure out life I've been at
it for about 20 years like really trying to figure
out life distill all of that down into the most
powerful the most potent advice tips and wisdom that you
need if you were like a newborn if you were
just dropped on this planet let's say you weren't a
baby you were dropped on this planet as an adult
let's just imagine hypothetically and you needed to figure out
like what to do in life how to live forget
all the kids stuff forget all the toys and all
that how do you actually live life what is life
about what do you really need to know to ace
life so let's talk about that oh man the the
problem with with shooting such an episode and giving such
advice is that there's just so much I almost imagine
like shooting it as though like to to my future
son let's say I pass away whatever and then my
son at one point just like sits down and watches
one video like what do I got it what do
I got to tell you in the next hour to
to to make a different the most difference in your
life so let's look at it like that and then
yeah the trick with it is where do we begin
there there's so much there's so much perhaps the first
thing you should know about life is that life needs
to be lived to be understood we're born almost like
blank slates knowing nothing we're born completely ignorant and then
we get bombarded by life life is not a theoretical
pursuit life is here it's embodied you're in it you're
feeling it there's pain there suffering there's intense pleasure and
joy and everything in between it's the full range and
there's so much going on and is so enormous it's
so enormous that most people it takes him a long
time if ever that they realize the enormity of what
life is and I'm not even going into some deep
metaphysical topics yet I'm just talking about ordinary even ordinary
human life it's still it's enormous there's so much to
do in life so much to learn so much to
explore so many mistakes to make so many traps to
fall into and perhaps that's where we should start is
with the notion of traps there are many many many
traps that you will be falling into in life if
you're not careful and really the point of this conversation
right now is that I want to point out to
you the most serious traps the most common traps that
people fall into and there's hundreds there's thousands of these
traps so I won't be able to enumerate them all
for you but I will point out the most important
ones the deepest ones this is the kind of stuff
that they're not gonna teach you in school so we'll
be explaining many many traps over the next hour to
as I'm talking so just keep that notion of traps
in the back of your mind already just just having
that one idea of Oh life is filled with traps
I got to be careful that already is is a
really powerful concept to keep in the back of your
mind as you're going through life in various situations now
that's not to make you paranoid and to make you
afraid of every situation that that would also that itself
would be a trap fear is of is one of
the biggest traps but we'll get to that so I'm
not I'm not saying it from love to make you
paranoid I'm just saying there are many traps there are
many ways to screw up life but also life has
enormous potential so one of the things you should know
is that life can get really really bad much worse
than you could ever imagine and life can get really
really good much better than you could ever imagine so
the spectrum because life is so enormous the spectrum is
really really wide and it's not a one-dimensional spectrum or
even a two-dimensional spectrum it's multi-dimensional and that's also something
you should know about life is that life is multi-dimensional
there are so many dimensions to it that's what makes
it complex life is enormous ly complex there's no simple
five minute advice that I could give you there's no
simple one book that can be read that will teach
you all the stuff you got to know there it's
it's it's massive its sprawling there are so many variables
and one of the biggest variables depends upon who you
are so see to live a good life what's you're
gonna have to do is you're gonna have to both
learn and figure out how life works but also learn
and figure out how you work and how you fit
into life and nobody can tell you that because you're
uniquely you you're different from other people you're different from
me now I can give you general guidelines general wisdom
general advice of course there's much we have in common
but in the end you got a customized life to
you to make it really work for you I don't
know all of your ins and outs sometimes I make
assumptions about how you're similar to me you might be
different than me in important ways and so the first
rule is you got to really be true to yourself
be willing to honor your uniqueness and to figure out
life for yourself you see you got a wonder at
some point why am i alive why am I here
at all am I just here to repeat somebody else's
life am I just here to live the same life
that might lived that my teachers lived that might church
leader lived that my ancestors lived or am I here
to do something new and what I'm suggesting to you
is that you're here to do something new reality and
the universe is a deeply intelligent thing don't take it
for something stupid it doesn't just repeat itself over and
over and over again generation after generation after generation what
you see if you observe society from a big-picture perspective
is you see society evolving every generation is different and
new and figuring out new challenges in life discovering new
opportunities new potentials that can be actualized and so on
life never stands still and so now you're here and
one of the biggest things you should be asking yourself
now is why am I here what am I here
to do and don't look for that answer to come
from somebody else like your parents or your teachers or
your church leaders to tell you why you're here and
what you need to do but turn inwards and that's
one of the biggest secrets of life is spend more
time reflecting and turning inwards and really asking yourself deep
questions about life rather than reading them or trying to
get them from other people which brings us to perhaps
the biggest trap of all in life and that is
the trap of ideology and the trap of falling into
belief systems that other people have invented see because you're
born like a blank slate your mind is pure it's
clean when you're first here but then very quickly as
you see in order to survive in life and that's
what life is it's a process of survival we'll talk
more about that in a minute that's very important but
uh in order for you to survive you need to
quickly learn lessons quickly pickup lesson after lesson after lesson
when you're young you're forced to do this and of
course your mind is so open it's such an open
slate that almost anything can be written on it it's
almost like a blank piece of paper or a blank
canvas but you're born into a society and human beings
as you've probably already noticed are very social species everything
we do we do in a society you're not an
individual you're part of a larger super organism your city
your country your culture the world the human species your
family unit your religious group the scientific community if you're
a part of that whatever the language you use all
of these are social institutions and tools and inventions and
so the challenge is is is that the individual and
the collective are so intertwined if you're a human that
it's both a blessing and a curse it's a blessing
in the sense that Society allows you so many cool
things technology and various comforts of living that you get
entertainment and and interesting cultural stuff cultural artifacts art and
reading you can tap into the collective wisdom of hundreds
of generations of humans that came before you so you
don't have to figure life all out from scratch by
yourself yet on the other hand if what you do
is you just blindly let yourself be programmed by your
culture by society by your religious group or even by
the scientific community then your mind is going to get
filled with belief systems and ideologies and these will seriously
rob you of your happiness and your potential to use
your mind - really ace life and so trap number
one is falling into ideologies and belief systems and taking
those as dogma and then defending those and fighting over
those and debating those and getting involved in this ideological
game whether it's with religion with science with atheism with
politics with economics with gender identity with philosophy with cosmology
with spirituality with various kinds of New Age belief systems
whatever it is the number one trap is getting your
mind locked into one of these belief systems because these
belief systems are like the operating system upon which the
rest of your life will hinge the operating system then
dictates what kind of software can run in that environment
what kind of apps you could install and load and
how they work see so the real work here is
making sure that you're not working at the surface level
of changing the apps rearranging the apps on your computer
but that you're working at a deeper level of looking
at the internal workings of the operating system and making
sure that you're not limited or straitjacketed by some operating
system some ideology some paradigms and belief system and then
even going deeper we're gonna get even deeper we're gonna
get to the kernel level or you even pick apart
the the the heart - the kernel of the operating
system and you get to the to the very root
to the nugget of the whole thing how it all
works and then that will take us into metaphysics and
spirituality but let's not get ahead of ourselves yet so
the quality of your life is gonna directly hinge on
the quality of your mind and how you use your
mind see this is one of the things that separates
humans the most from animals is that animals live a
very physical embody existence whereas us humans the most important
things we do is how we use our minds this
is both our greatest strength and our greatest weakness we
can get trapped in our minds and completely lost to
the point where we become suicidal in the worst-case scenario
or even start going insane mentally unstable or we can
develop a sharp clear mind and learn to use it
effectively to learn lessons about life and to master life
and to construct the kind of life that we want
and it all depends on how you use your mind
see for animals that's not so important but for humans
is very important and we're living in a society where
in our society the people who earn the most money
and are the most successful in our society they are
not manual labourers they are not construction workers they are
the deep thinkers they are the strategists they are the
political leaders they are the visionaries the inventors the creators
this is all coming from the mind so whatever you
do in your life master your mind and most of
the traps that I was talking about are gonna be
traps of your own mind see your greatest enemy is
not out there somewhere it's not somebody else it's yourself
and that's one of the biggest lessons that you need
to understand really early to learn in life is that
there's nobody out there to blame for what's happening in
your life if you want to ace life you need
to take responsibility and ownership for your own mind and
how you're using your mind and to start to notice
that by introspecting you can see how your own mind
is contributing to the kind of results that you're getting
in your life and so if there's something in your
life that you're not happy with you're not getting the
kind of emotions you want the kind of love you
want the kind of material success you want rather than
blaming somebody or creating a story an ideology about how
you're being victimized or how life is unfair and so
forth always especially when it's difficult especially when you want
to blame somebody else especially when you feel victimized especially
when you feel like you've been wronged turn even deeper
within and ask yourself how can I take ownership over
this situation and how is my mind playing a part
in these results that I'm getting that's gonna be your
ticket out see you can either be blaming others or
you can take ownership and then look for a way
to to change the situation and I recommend you take
that second option now the trick is that the mind
oftentimes doesn't want to look inwards it likes to project
outwards and another trick is that reality is such a
weird and twisted thing that it seems as though we're
in a physical material tangible world here where there are
tangible facts you could knock on a wall it's made
out of solid concrete or whatever and that's just a
fact you can't do anything about it and there are
many such facts in the world and we have to
kind of deal with this and that the world it
seems like the world is a costing you from the
outside stuff is happening to you and then you're just
sort of forced to juggle the balls as best as
you can this is in fact an illusion and one
of the most important things you got to understand about
life is a your mind is projecting and creating reality
it is not simply that there is a reality and
you were born into it no your mind is interwoven
with physical reality itself in such a way that your
thoughts and emotions and your belief system and your ideology
all of this it's all creating the kind of reality
that you see out there there's many layers to it
okay so right now you may not understand how you're
creating a wall or how you're creating a house or
a tree these physical objects and for most people they
have no idea how they're creating it and they never
will because they're at a level of consciousness where they
can't access that but there actually are levels of consciousness
where you can become start to become conscious of how
you're even manifesting physical objects let alone various problems in
your life and so forth now of course now we're
getting into some complex territory getting ahead of ourselves here
but just understand that your mind is interwoven with physical
reality itself you don't know exactly how that works yet
it's a complex process it's not so simple it doesn't
just simplistically mean that all well I can just think
a million dollars and here it is it's not that
simple it's a lot more complicated than that but your
mind is intertwined with physical reality and so the world
you see is not just a world that existed before
you and that now you're inside of it but rather
your mind is playing an active creative role not just
in how your personal life unfolds but if we're getting
to that sort of kernel of the operating system we
want to go really deep your mind is generating reality
but this of course requires a much more nuanced and
complex notion of mind then most people in your culture
in your society would have you believe so you see
here's the real trick with understanding life is that if
you're gonna try to understand life by simply subscribing to
various kinds of belief systems that others give you you
will never fully understand how life works and you will
forever be at the effect of it its victim and
you will get stuck in various kinds of belief systems
and ideologies and you will be incapable of really grasping
what life is so one of my pieces of advice
for you is that you start to take the process
of learning and understanding extremely seriously your job here in
life is not to screw around and to have fun
and to watch TV and play video games and eat
good food and all that sort of stuff you can
do all those things I'm not denying any of those
to you you can enjoy all the pleasures of life
so what I teach my philosophy is not some hardcore
ascetic philosophy where you deny yourself all the pleasures no
not at all enjoy the pleasures but realize that those
are all desserts those are all secondary tertiary and even
further down the list sort of things your first priority
should be understanding and learning if you can if you
can nail understanding and learning that's gonna be the master
key that unlocks everything else for you every other domain
in life that's what you'll discover and if you don't
get a handle on learning and understanding then how will
you ever understand what life is how will you ever
understand all of its subcomponents and sub domains you won't
and by not understanding it you're gonna act like a
fool thinking you understand something that you don't really understand
oversimplifying things and then getting yourself into trouble see you
think you understand how you're gonna generate happiness in your
life so you go do some heroin or some drugs
and then you discover all that you get trapped in
that and then through a painful process you discover that
your understanding of how happiness works was completely backwards which
is why you went for the drugs and then you
you have to return make a painful turn out of
them to find true happiness you see but why did
that whole process happen it's because you didn't have enough
depth of understanding of what happiness is and how to
get it this is just but one example this understanding
or this this learning this this will this will be
something that you'll be doing for the rest of your
life and it's important you start as soon as possible
to start understanding reality at deeper and deeper levels as
soon as possible try to independently for yourself understand everything
you come into contact with are you inside of a
house try to understand what a house is how is
it built where did it come from are you walking
down the street and walking through a park try to
understand what a park is where trees come from how
they grow what they do what their function on the
planet is are you in a relationship with some friend
try to understand what a relationship is wonder about that
try to understand the dynamics of relationships are all relationships
the same or are they different is there a difference
between man man relationships versus man-woman relationships sexual relationships versus
platonic relationships see friendships versus boss worker or boss employee
relationships what kind of common factors are there between different
relationships and through this process everything that you're interacting with
life try to recognize that if you're new here it's
all foreign to you you're learning it for the first
time you have no idea what anything is and one
of the greatest mistakes you can make is just to
take other people's words for what things are you need
to cultivate an attitude of independence of mind where you
are independently curiously thinking through what things are for yourself
of course you can read books and you can watch
videos and you can take advice from others like myself
but ultimately you're going to have run all that through
your own independent intellect even this advice that I'm giving
you right now how do you know it's true how
do you know it's good how do you know I'm
not leading you into a trap how do you know
I don't have some ulterior motive you don't know so
what do you do in this case do you turn
off the recording and then not listen to some good
advice no you have to think through it and work
through it yourself that's why you're here that's why you
were born is to figure all this stuff out there's
a bunch of different puzzles here and you're figuring them
out every single day every single year of your life
you're being faced with new challenges new puzzles and you
got to be figuring it out whereas most people most
of your friends and colleagues and family members they're gonna
be lazy they're not gonna want to go through the
intellectual work of trying to understand things at a deep
level they're gonna be satisfied with surface level understanding of
things and that's how they get trapped so how do
you go about understanding well questioning questioning is perhaps the
number one key there start questioning everything leave nothing unquestioned
leave no stone unturned question religion question science question philosophy
question school question your elders question your teachers your parents
your co-workers your friends those beneath you those over you
question politicians question those in power question the military question
the medical system question society and question yourself questioning seems
very simple but it will get you very far questioning
is what activates your mind to work in penally so
asked higher-quality questions and constantly be contemplating what life is
and how it works there will be a lot of
people who will want to tell you all the answers
unfortunately life can't work that way you have to discover
the answers it's not a matter of getting the answer
the point of questioning is not per se to get
the answer it's to go through the process of the
questioning and the thinking through it if I just give
you some answer but you haven't gone through the process
of deriving it yourself you're not gonna get the value
from it it's just gonna go in one ear and
out the other sometimes to get an answer to a
deep question about life might take you 5 10 20
years of work questioning contemplating of curiosity of passion speaking
of which I should I guess point out a couple
of other key pillars that are very important for life
curiosity develop a curiosity about everything be curious look at
how amazing this thing called reality is don't just take
it for granted and don't just assume that you understand
what it is you don't act as though you are
the first human who is ever born and that you're
discovering all of life for the first time cuz in
a sense that is how it feels from your point
of view so be curious about everything this is what
will drive you to buy books to watch videos to
listen to recordings to take courses to constantly be learning
don't let learning be some dry stale process that only
happens in school or during homework time learning is something
you got to be passionate about this is why you're
here this is why you're alive is to be learning
whatever they're teaching you in school that's a mockery of
the learn process sure it's still necessary and it's still
good there's gonna be a lot of important stuff you
learn at school and I recommend you take school seriously
you don't slack off and play games they're too much
but but what really matters is that you become your
own lifelong learner and educator be passionate about teaching yourself
about how life works through questioning through independently going out
there and reading books not just the books that your
teachers assign you but the books that you're interested in
study the subjects you're interested in which brings us to
the other pillar which is passion what is the point
of living life if you're not going to be passionate
about it yet as obvious as that sounds when you
look around you and the older you get the more
you're gonna see this you're gonna see more and more
of your co-workers and friends and family members living listless
passionless lives where the passion has been robbed of them
they've been robbed of their passion and somewhere along the
way they lost their passion for life or maybe they
never even developed it these people take life for granted
and that really is the worst thing you can do
with life is to take it for granted you're here
something amazing is going on it's a mystery you don't
really know what it is now start learning start discovering
start being curious and start being passionate and of course
that leads us to the next huge chunk of life
advice which is have something in your life that you're
deeply passionate about multiple things in fact you should be
so passionate about life that it's hard for you to
choose which handful of things to be passionate about because
your passion is endless and sprawling but nevertheless you have
to hone your passion down to find a few things
that you want to devote your life to and the
sooner you can find this in your life the better
this is gonna be the foundation of your life and
basically all of the advice I'm giving here is gonna
be the foundation of your life but really without passion
you're not gonna be motivated you're not gonna be motivated
to get up in the morning and to do the
work that needs to be done you're gonna be lazy
you're just gonna go through the motions of living life
you're gonna turn into a zombie so start pursuing the
stuff that makes you passionate and passion is like a
snowball it starts very slow starts rolling down the hill
and it builds and builds and builds and builds and
grows and grows and grows and grows and grows so
it's important that you find something that you're going to
devote a significant chunk of your time to a significant
chunk of your life to you're both passionate about that
you have maybe some skill or some talent in and
that you're interested in working on because hey you're here
and life is a function of survival everyone in life
no matter what they're doing they're surviving they're surviving in
different unique ways so you're gonna have to be surviving
too doesn't matter who you are you're gonna have to
have some kind of job anytime to have do some
kind of work I recommend you find a job and
work on your terms rather than on somebody else's terms
create a career for yourself not just a job a
career for yourself and even beyond a career but a
life purpose for yourself something that's gonna be the fuel
for the rest of your life that explains why you're
going to work and somehow ties in with your deepest
passions about life it could be music it could be
film it could be video games it could be writing
it could be art it could be politics it could
be science it could be Benison it could be a
million things it makes no difference what it is as
long as it suits you and that's coming back to
the very first point that I made is it you
got a customized life for you nobody can tell you
whether you should be a lawyer or a doctor or
a scientist or an engineer or a programmer or an
artist or a movie director only you can know that
pick the thing that you're really really passionate about and
to find those things you got to go and explore
life a little bit if you're sitting there and you're
saying well I got nothing I'm passionate about that's because
first of all you're taking life for granted there's a
ton of things to be passionate about but you're so
taking life for granted so stop doing that get really
curious go start exploring life see all the potential that's
out there and then as you're doing that stuff will
resonate with you stuff will move you it'll make you
emotional maybe you watch your movie it makes you emotional
good go down that road you're getting some kind of
emotional response there some kind of passion is coming up
maybe you play a video game that stirs up some
passion maybe you watch some science documentary that serves up
some passion you maybe you see somebody being a doctor
and that stirs up some passion you whatever that is
start exploring those things and start start following your passions
without that you're gonna have a law of miserable life
because you're gonna be working roughly from the age of
20 to the age of 65 at least if you
don't work on your terms Society will force you to
work there's no escaping work you're gonna have to work
in life not only are you gonna have to work
you're probably gonna have to work 40 hours a week
for a good 45 years at least maybe more that's
gonna be a giant chunk of your time we're talking
about a third of your life a third of your
waking hours maybe even half or more of your waking
hours will be devoted to work so it just makes
sense that you want to have a lot of passion
in your work you want to feel like your work
is meaningful and meaning is not something else found out
they are meaning is something you create again remember like
I said your mind and reality are intertwined so passion
is not just something that comes to you from outside
passion something you can generate you can learn to generate
it it's about how your mind interacts with reality if
your mind is listless than and lazy and you expect
just passion to hit you from outside well you might
never find it that way but if you're proactive and
you're going out there looking for it with curiosity and
questioning that is going to help attract the passion to
you you're gonna actually create it you're gonna generate it
see desire and ambition are very important aspects of living
a good life now of course sometimes people demonize desire
is a bad thing but there's many different levels and
qualities of desire there's low quality desires like the desire
for heroin and there's very high quality desires like the
desire to be selfless so it's it's really a question
of purifying the quality of your desire and the magical
thing about reality and here's one secret that you can
use to really create any kind of life you want
is that desire is far more important than knowing how
to do something so maybe you desire to be a
doctor but you have no idea how to be a
doctor it might seem like that's a big problem and
it might seem that well yeah I have my desire
but but the desire what is desire it's just some
subjective emotional feeling some emotions some fluffy stuff it's not
tangible you can't really bank on it it's not physical
or concrete and then you know being a doctor that's
like real skill and that's like you have a job
and somebody pays you good money for that like that's
a tangible thing but all the tangible things in life
whether it's money houses sexual partners marriages children you know
all the tangible stuff in life that you might want
really it all begins with desire desire is how you
get it and if you think about it when you
enter life you have no idea how life works but
you learn along the way how do you learn through
a desire to get a thing accomplished how did you
learn how to walk you had a desire to go
across the room maybe to grab some candy or whatever
or just to peek out the window and then how
did you learn to move your legs did someone teach
you that someone tell you did you read an instruction
manual did it matter that you didn't know how to
move your legs did you sit there and you say
to yourself all man I'm such I'm so depressed because
I don't know how to move my legs no it's
that desire that pushed you that ambition you had ambition
that pushed you to want to start walking and then
running and then jumping and doing all the other stuff
and that's gonna just keep going and expanding further in
your life as long as you Stoke up that ambition
and that desire and you make sure it's a high-quality
one that's what you're using as your engine to drive
your life if you don't have passion and abyssion and
desire in your life you have no engine you have
no motivation to do anything you're just gonna go with
the flow and you're just gonna get this the default
the status quo and the status quo is just what
everybody else has around you it's not going to be
very exciting it's not going to be very interesting it's
gonna be rather miserable you're gonna be going to a
boring job doing boring work for some boring person contributing
perhaps even in harmful and evil waste to the world
so one of the most powerful questions you can ask
yourself remember going back to that piece of advice about
being really good about questioning and also the advice about
introspecting ask yourself the question constantly what do I want
what do I desire out of life what am i
passionate about how can I be more passionate about life
because really it's quite simple do you want a passionate
life or not those are your like two only choices
you're either going to get one or the other and
if you're not proactively pursuing a passionate life you're gonna
by default get a passionless life it's pretty simple this
isn't rocket science for me my passion and ambition and
desire stems from a deep metaphysical sense that life is
something precious that my life is important not in any
kind of egotistical sense that I think that all I
have some important person not in that sense fully I
fully recognize that life is an illusion and that all
meaning is self generated and I've recognized this since I
was a child all right so if you think that
life has some ultimate meaning grounded in some one thing
it doesn't life's meaning is whatever you create it to
be you are the creator of your life's meaning so
if you believe that life has no meaning that's what
you'll create and that's what you'll get and then you'll
probably be depressed and nihilistic and you probably won't have
much fun if you believe that life is very meaningful
if you believe it's very meaningful to save other people's
lives by working in an emergency room as a doctor
then that's what you'll create that will be your life
and if you believe it's meaningful to sit on a
computer all day and you know post away on the
internet then that's what she'll do you'll find that meaningful
and that will be your life and if you believe
it's meaningful to read books then that's the kind of
life you'll create for yourself see now is it really
meaningful this is a silly question there's no such thing
as really meaningful meaningful is whatever you say it is
and of course what others around you say it is
too so of course your culture in your society plays
a big role as well and of course there's things
that your body requires their survival demands for humans and
so of course that that appears meaningful to us but
but this leads us into the next point which is
now we're starting a little bit more metaphysical is that
reality is subjective it's a subjective thing it's not like
a physical object found somewhere in the universe that's not
reality reality is a subjective thing you're living through it
don't let the scientists and materialists convince you otherwise be
in touch with your feelings be in touch with how
reality feels don't just think about reality it might seem
like I'm telling you to question it your introspect a
lot which puts you a lot into your kind of
cerebral mind and that's important but uh but but know
your mind includes not just thinking it includes feeling and
in fact getting in touch with your feelings and your
intuitions is far more important than just thinking and this
is one of those aspects that mainstream society and school
won't teach you is how to feel deeper really spend
a lot of time feeling feel physical objects feel emotions
feel the difference between anger and sadness and frustration and
depression and sexual arousal and different kinds of sexual arousal
start to draw find distinctions and degrees recognize find degrees
between these different things and many many more feel everything
even just when you walk into a room into a
building how does it feel to you what is your
intuition telling you connect with your intuition that intuition it
seems sometimes like is a fluffy Airy fairy thing Society
will tell you that intuition is its you can't bank
on it it's not scientific enough it's not reasonable it's
not logical but intuition will get you a lot further
in life than just cold reason and logic will your
heart is where your passion comes from it's where your
love for life comes from and love is still an
important topic we have yet to scratch the surface of
but like I was saying I would have been on
tangent my passion for life comes from sort of a
deep metaphysical sense and really is a spiritual sense that
something incredible is going on with reality and by which
I mean reality itself is an incredible thing and if
you just tuned in for a second that you exist
just tuned into the fact that you were born is
you think you are you were born conventionally-speaking you exist
here you are you're a part of reality or participating
in the subjective experience of reality just like turn inwards
for a moment put your awareness on that and just
kind of go whoa how did I even get here
it's a miracle that I was even born so by
connecting with that sense then the next step for me
in my thinking process is I say well wow it's
incredible with this this reality that I'm that I'm here
it's incredible I'm not quite sure what it is it's
amazing it's beautiful look at how beautiful everything is it
seems to work in an intelligible way it's not just
a hodgepodge of random crap that's happening there's a sort
of consistency and in order to it reality is highly
ordered this order can be studied and understood which is
why we're talking at all here so there seems to
be sort of logic to reality but but at the
same time we're not really sure like where's reality going
where is life going what's the point of it so
these are very high-quality open questions you can keep questioning
these for years and you'll you'll go down the right
path as you keep questioning all this yeah just recognize
how amazing it is to be alive it's a rare
gift to be alive it's a rare gift and you
got to wonder in the back of your mind like
why was I the lucky one why was I chosen
to be here because you can imagine that you might
I've been born at all you were that lucky egg
and that lucky sperm that that met combined together and
then here's you from that process at least that's what
science tells us so let's just go with that for
now but still you know there's your your mom has
hundreds and maybe thousands of eggs your dad has millions
and billions of sperm what are the odds that they
meet and then you come out of it and here
you are especially if you have decent health if your
body's not disfigured and 'disformed deformed I mean then hey
look how lucky you are if you live in a
relatively decent country not in some war zone look how
lucky you are if you don't have some terrible disease
or cancer look how lucky you are if you come
from a decent family where you weren't terribly abused physically
and emotionally look how lucky you are but even if
you have some of those things and some of those
are holding you back and I know that some of
you do and some of you you know suffer from
those things that's okay too it's just you're gonna have
a little harder time and and that's fine you know
one of the biggest lessons you have to learn about
life is that you have to deal with the hand
that you've been dealt like in poker right you don't
get to choose which cards you're dealt sometimes you're dealt
some crummy cards and part of the challenge of life
is rolling with those punches and figuring it out anyways
so make a commitment to always be figuring it out
and sometimes life will get really challenging and you'll be
thrown a curveball but you gotta like commit to really
living a good life which I guess ties it all
together here you know once you recognize that your life
is precious that it's this amazing miraculous thing then you
ask yourself okay so I've been given this miracle of
life whereas others don't have it I've been given the
miracle of relatively decent health that maybe others don't have
I've got I'm ahead of me I've got 30 40
50 years whatever left of my life 80 years you
know maybe some of you what's worthwhile to do if
life is a miracle if life is amazing and I've
been blessed with it what is my obligation my obligation
is to make the most of my life so your
question is how do I live a good life that
should be one of the top questions on your list
of questions to ask and this is not a question
you asked once or twice this is a question you
asked for the next 40 years of your life how
do I live a good life what do I desire
what is worthwhile doing what is meaningful to me what
do I want out of life not what my parents
want from me or what my teachers tell me or
what my culture wants for me but what do I
want and to know what you want this gets back
to the to that point about feeling you see you
can't just logically think through what my passion should be
it's like well should I be a doctor or Laura
let me logically way the to let me see how
much does a lawyer earn how much does the doctor
ernõ all of the lawyer earns more and how many
hours does doctor work doctor or thought okay so did
we just tally all that up and then we say
okay lawyer is the best one say no you got
to feel it you see you got to intuit it
you got to be connected with your heart not just
with your logical left hemisphere you can't just be analyzing
life all the time you got a deeply connect with
what moves you because what moves you in the end
is not logic its emotion and here I'll point out
a really common trap that many people fall into these
days in the 21st century in the developed world is
we're hyper logical science has been very successful in the
last couple hundred years has produced a lot of technology
there's a lot we could say about science but science
has some dangers with it one of the dangers of
science is that it over analyzes everything it looks upon
reality as a physical material object to be dissected and
deconstructed in an objective manner detached from it dissociated from
it see the scientist ideally in a scientist mind the
scientist thinks that the best way to understand reality is
to be separate from reality the scientist almost wants to
extract himself out of the universe and then look down
upon the universe and as though like through a microscope
and study it at a distance not himself being involved
with the subject that he's studying at all and this
works in certain narrow situations you know if you want
to study some bacteria in a petri dish you can
do it that way safely at a distance but life
itself notice life is not safely at a distance life
is the exact opposite that it's completely you and your
body and your mind enmeshed with physical reality such that
the two can't be even separated from each other the
object and the subject are one you are here and
you are connected right you're plugged right into life you're
plugged right into reality so when I cut you with
a knife you feel it you can't act like a
scientist some distance removed where you might take a knife
and cut off your arm and then take your arm
and then and then study it under a microscope and
then maybe eat it for dinner that's what life would
be like if the scientists were right if life was
purely logical and analytical but it's not and the trap
is trying to treat reality as though logic is the
ultimate lens through which to understand reality it's not logic
is highly highly limited and in fact logic is easily
abused and misused to justify any kind of ideology or
belief system like I talked about before logic becomes its
own trap now of course emotions can also become huge
traps so there's no easy answers here and that's other
lesson about life is that life is is highly complex
there are no simple answers usually it's it's a delicate
balancing act there's no one clear right path or one
clear answer about what you should do or how you
should behave or what you should be passionate about or
what's right and what's wrong or what's good and what's
evil there are no clear answers to these things that's
what makes life so interesting if it was just black
and white and simple what would be the point of
living it you see so don't want it to be
simple in black and white learn to love the complexity
the complexity gives you grist for the mill of your
mind you have something to learn something to study something
to figure out you have a bunch of puzzles to
solve in life see that makes life interesting emotions are
more powerful than logic even the most logical people in
the world who will try to tell you that their
philosophy and attitude towards life is all logical in reality
their life is run 95% by emotions 5% by logic
emotions are what moved people emotions are more fundamental than
logic and then thinking emotions drive your sexual behavior emotions
drive your what you eat what you don't eat what
you like what you don't like who you're willing to
sleep with who you're not willing to sleep with what
you're scared of what you're not scared of when you're
pissed off at somebody and emotions save your life when
you're walking through the forest and a bear jumps out
at you you get scared and you run away saves
your life that's why emotions are more powerful than logic
because with logic you just be standing there thinking about
like oh that's a bear let me analyze this bear
all--it's is it a brown bears and a black bear
is this bear is the fast Bears or slow bears
you can attack me no no you just feel fear
and you run and that saves your life if you
were analyzing for five minutes there the bear would eat
you see so get out of your head and more
into your body feel yourself if you don't feel good
in your body if you don't feel good about your
life no amount of logic and no amount of external
conditions will do it for you because in the end
what do you want you want to be satisfied and
you want to be happy and you want to be
passionate that's what you really want out of life that's
what constitutes a good life now of course the details
of that will vary person to person but that's generally
what every person wants but notice those are emotional things
satisfaction happiness peace of mind these are these are emotional
things they're not logical things see so if you can't
feel good in your body you can't ever be happy
and if you try to approach life from this dissociated
place where you are like back here then there's a
glass wall over here and then there's life over there
and you're trying to live it at a distance this
is also you people who do that they really do
that because they're afraid of feeling life and of course
that's totally understandable because sometimes life can feel shitty there
can be a lot of deep suffering and pain but
here's one of my pieces of advice for you when
you're suffering and you will be suffering a lot that's
guaranteed you will be suffering a lot when you're suffering
when you're feeling bad lonely sad depressed angry jealous mm-hmm
and any other negative emotion rather than numbing yourself or
distracting yourself have the courage to feel into that more
deeply a common trap that people fall into a life
without even recognizing it is that they they think that
well I want the positive emotions but I don't want
the negative ones so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna feel the positive ones and then suppress deny
ignore and numb out the negative ones huge mistake huge
mistake actually what you need to do counter-intuitively is you
need to feel deeper into the negative emotions that will
allow you then to become good at feeling in general
that will allow you to then feel deeper into the
positive emotions as well suppression and denial and ignoring things
this is not the attitude you want to take towards
life this is the wrong approach stuff that you deny
or suppress or sweep under the rug in life it
will always come back to haunt you it'll turn into
a festering wound so be careful about that try to
face problems and difficulties head-on rather than trying to avoid
them this avoidance behavior is really problematic it leads to
a lot of neurosis and psychological dysfunction and that's what
will happen if you live life improperly if you try
to [ __ ] yourself if you try to lie
to yourself if you try to deny things if you
try to play manipulative games this will create a neurotic
toxic psychology in you you're not gonna get away with
it you see there's a cost to these things there's
a cost to lying manipulating stealing cheating you're never gonna
get away with these things and one of the worst
things you can do is lying to yourself so I
recommend as one of the core pillars of your foundation
for life is that you make a commitment towards maximum
radical self honesty you can [ __ ] others to
a degree and get away with it but at least
make the commitment to always be honest with yourself always
be truthful with yourself because if you're not truthful with
yourself what's gonna happen you're gonna [ __ ] yourself
you're gonna deceive yourself and that's gonna take you in
in the wrong direction in life consider if you don't
know the truth about a situation and you have some
false story about it then what do you got do
you have what it really is do you have the
substance of the thing you have the reality of it
or do you have nothing you see when you think
about that and you realize that if you don't have
the truth about a situation what you have is you
have literally have nothing because reality is what's true that's
why truth is so powerful and truth is so important
and this other piece of advice I have for you
is take truth really seriously truth and honesty these are
not merely things that you do for the benefit of
others so that others don't get mad at you so
it's not that you tell your mother the truth because
if you didn't then she will ground you or something
like that no no this is this is totally inadequate
of an understanding of why truth is important truth is
important because truth is what everything is and the only
thing that there is truth is reality reality is all
of the stuff that you see around you so if
something isn't true it isn't real and if isn't real
it isn't here and if it isn't here it's not
in your experience and if it's not in your experience
then it's nothing to you it doesn't exist literally so
so ask yourself this for the rest of your life
do you want to be on the side of truth
or do you want to be on the side of
playing games and bullshitting and deceiving yourself and deceiving others
and lying to yourself in line to others which do
you want to be on do you think you can
create a life a good life based on deception manipulation
falsehood denial suppression no in ignoring so I recommend you
make a serious lifelong commitment to to really be committed
to truth at all costs even when it's painful and
that's that's the trick with truth is that to really
make a serious commitment to truth it's like marriage it's
like a it's a commitment more serious than marriage really
because what it means is that I'm not going to
be with you just in the good times I'm gonna
be especially with you in the bad times that's what
you're committing to so with the truth of course it's
easy to love the truth when the truth serves you
and the truth is on your side but you will
discover and everybody does that at some point the truth
will be against you the truth will not be in
your survival interest the truth will cost you money the
truth may cost you a friendship or a relationship the
truth may may hurt may hurt you it may hurt
somebody else might hurt their feelings might hurt their pocketbook
it might lead to the collapse of a business it
might lead you to losing a job being truthful and
honest and in those moments you're gonna be tempted to
to lie to manipulate to deceive to to not be
fully truthful with others but even more importantly with yourself
because you can't lie effectively to others without lying to
yourself if you think that all just lied to my
mom and I'll lie to my dad and I'll lie
to my boss but with myself I'll be honest who
are you kidding see now you're already lying to yourself
you won't be able to maintain your lies to others
without lying to yourself and there are so many things
that you lie to yourself about there's so many deep
levels to it see so a couple of other quick
pillars that I'll give you here for your foundation is
one pillars that life is deeply counterintuitive that's exactly how
people fall into traps is that they think that oh
this will work one way and it turns out that
it works exactly the opposite you think at all well
that heroin produces a nice pleasure or hi for me
that and I can just keep do that every day
and that's going to lead to happiness and then you
find out no it's actually exactly the opposite or you
think that oh logic I can just use logic to
analyze all of reality and then all of a good
life because emotions are bad and emotions are negative they
get in the way well if you do that you'll
find out actually it works exactly the opposite way you
got to feel more another pillar I'll give you here
is being proactive you can take sort of a lazy
backseat approach to life where it's like you're in the
in the backseat of the car and you're letting somebody
else drive you or you can take a proactive approach
which is what I recommend you do proactive approach means
you want to be in the driver's seat and you
will not stand for situations where people ask you to
be in the in the backseat not when it comes
to your own life now of course in other situations
you can take a back seat but but when it
comes to setting the direction of your own life you
have to be proactive about that you have to be
proactive going out there learning researching looking for things you're
passionate about setting goals for yourself motivating yourself you know
whatever that takes maybe visualization exercises or whatever to motivate
yourself you know being proactive like this going above and
beyond the bear minimum of life and this this applies
to everything you do so if you're going to school
be proactive in school that means you don't just do
the bare minimum to pass the test or to get
a C or even a B or even an A
that's not good enough if you're truly proactive about learning
you're not going to be satisfied with the learning that
you get in school you're gonna want to read books
on your own after you're done with homework then you
pick up a book and just read whatever book you
want that you're passionate about that's what proactivity looks like
in school and at work you don't just go in
there and to work and just do the job that
your boss tells you to do you're proactive you have
your own ideas and visions about how this job can
be done better how you can help your boss more
how the company might be better served by some other
idea that you have that's what it means to be
proactive at work and so on across the board throughout
your whole life be proactive you're here you want to
be engaged in life to be engaged in life you
have to find something about it you enjoy and look
at how much there is around you to enjoy of
course there's there's dark stuff there's negative stuff I'm not
I'm not being naive here there's a lot of darkness
to life but even so there's still something you can
find that you would really enjoy whether it's art music
engineering design architecture history science spirituality sexuality so many things
and really we're living in a time now that you
can literally create a successful career in any of these
fields the bottleneck towards your success your material success if
we're talking about money in any field is going to
be your passion if you want to be materially successful
find something you're ridiculously passionate about you could pour thousands
of hours into develop mastery in something that this is
another pillar that I have for you you need to
pick at least one or two things in your life
that you will develop mastery in that you'll be working
towards that doesn't mean you have to master it now
it just means you pick a thing you're concrete about
what that thing is and then you get to work
mastering it and you slowly chip away at that on
a daily weekly monthly yearly basis for decades so again
this should be something you're deeply interested in passionate about
and curious about it could be martial arts could be
music could be film critique could be video game design
could be web design could be calligraphy it could be
yoga it could be weightlifting it could be science it
could be astronomy it could be geology it could be
hunting for dinosaurs it could be art it could be
tailoring or sewing stuff like it really makes no difference
as long as you enjoy it and you find some
deeper meaning in it and you're constructing that meaning remember
so you pick one or two of these fields and
you develop skill in that because you want to become
useful to mankind this is important because going back to
that original thing about your job and your career and
your sense of life purpose you see since you're gonna
be working a third to a half of your life
waking hours going towards work for you not to be
struggling material in your life for you to have the
kind of luxury and comfort and freedom that you want
you know a decent place to live decent food the
ability to send your kids to school or to college
the ability to pay for your medical expenses stuff like
this the ability to go travel do some this kind
of stuff you want you don't need millions and millions
of dollars but you want you want a decent salary
how do you get a decent salary the only legitimate
way to get a decent salary in society is to
become useful to society in some way now you can
become useful to society on its terms or on your
terms if you do it on its terms that means
that you know society tells you hey we need somebody
to work at Starbucks pouring coffees we'll pay you ten
bucks an hour here you go do this monotonous job
for the next 20 years and we'll be paying you
a minor wage with fairly crappy benefits and you could
lose your job at anytime and you can do that
that's that's on society's terms see because you were proactive
enough you were passionate enough to go out there and
really master something develop some serious valuable skill in something
now the alternative scenario is that you become so passionate
about something you spend years and years studying it exploring
it developing skill and talent in it and then what
happens is that you get so good at that thing
that you're able to create and produce some original unique
work that other people find valuable in society it could
be music art film engineering schematics architectural schematics some business
skills that you have that you're able to help somebody
run their business so they hire you for that maybe
some lawyer in skills some doctoring skills whatever the better
you get the rarer you are compared to others around
you the more valuable your skillset is the more people
are willing to pay you to help them and to
partake in whatever creative work that you're doing to view
it to buy it to hire your services whatever and
from this upon this foundation you can then build a
relatively comfortable life for yourself with freedom and such that
you never really have to worry about much about money
at all whereas if you don't do that if you
just do the default and by the way if you're
not proud and you're not ambitious you won't get that
if you just are lazy and you do the default
what you'll get is still get the Starbucks example you'll
have a boring monotonous job and if you if you
get that then you'll be worrying and stressing about money
for the rest of your life and also your opportunities
for exploring reality will be severely limited because you won't
have the freedom to take a vacation whenever you want
you won't have the money to buy the kind of
stuff you want that will help you to explore life
see for me money is quite important not because I
want a fancy car and the sorts of stuff although
of course nothing wrong with that and you could enjoy
some of those things to some degree but more importantly
what you want is you want the freedom that money
buys you money buys you the freedom to work on
your own time to have a more flexible schedule to
not have to be worried do not have to always
take the worst available job just because you need it
just because it pays you the money you know sometimes
you can pass that up and go for a better
job but to do that you need some money to
hold you over the mean time money allows you to
fund your ideas if you are entrepreneurial person you have
some creative ideas you're gonna need money for that you're
gonna need supplies you're gonna need equipment you're gonna maybe
need time off of work to work on your personal
projects and so forth I recommend that you're always working
on some personal career related projects in your life even
if you have a job traditional job have some career
related projects that you're working on some music project some
film project some engineering project whatever through these project is
how you're going to develop and build your skills and
your experience never ever ever let the phrase but I
don't know how stop you from doing something or from
attempting something if there's something you don't know how to
do research it by books about it go to Google
and type it in there read articles about find videos
about it on YouTube ask friends about it ask people
about it find the people who know how you don't
need to know how to do anything in life all
you need to have is you to have the desire
and the clear intent that you want to do it
from that everything else will be generated as if by
magic and without that nothing will happen even if you
know how to fly to the moon you're not gonna
fly to the moon unless you have a deep ambition
and desire to do it on the other hand if
you have only an ambition and desire to fly to
the moon and you have no idea how to do
it you can still do it because you'll be able
to use the ambition and a desire to figure out
how to read to research to hire the people you
need to to build you the stuff you need to
get you to the moon imagine this that if right
now if you're relatively young if you're in your 20s
or your 30s and right now you set the intention
in your mind that the most important thing for me
in my life is that I'm gonna be on the
moon I have no idea how I'm gonna do it
I don't have the money I don't have the skills
I don't have the engineering know-how all I know is
that I want to be on the moon by the
time my life is over if you set that intention
for yourself I can almost guarantee that you will do
it you will find some way to do it that
doesn't mean you're gonna build your own rocket ship or
maybe you will but it could mean that you become
a Wall Street stockbroker earn yourself a bunch of money
earned yourself a billion dollars like Warren Buffett or something
in the stock market and then use that money to
build yourself a rocket ship that's what you would do
if you really desire to get to the moon now
of course most people have no such desires so it
never happens it's really that simple like it's not theirs
again it's desires not a binary thing like I desire
it or I don't know no there's many many degrees
of desire how much do you desire something and then
how ambitious are you about it I should the next
point I want to make is that it's very important
that you understand that human beings are different it's gonna
seem to you for the first 20 or 30 years
of your life at least that human beings are very
similar you're gonna look at human beings as though they
are copies of you it's gonna seem that they feel
like you they behave like you they look like you
it takes a while it takes a good 30 years
or so of observing people to start to notice the
important distinctions and differences between people so what you what
I want you to understand about people really quickly is
the following thing if you observe if you just go
to a shopping mall or a crowded area and you
observe people walking around at Walmart or something and just
sit there and people watch for half an hour observe
people's physical appearances only pay attention to how their bodies
are different if you sit there you do that for
half an hour what you will see is how seriously
different people's bodies are you're gonna see short people tall
people skinny people fat people really really fat people you're
gonna see white people black people Asian people Indian people
Somali people African people you're gonna see disabled people you're
gonna see people that are beautiful ugly and somewhere in
the middle you're gonna see people with lots of pimples
you're gonna see people who are lots of moles you're
gonna see some people walking funny you're gonna see some
people with only one arm or only one leg some
will be in wheelchairs some will be old some will
be young some will be in the middle some will
be really really old some will be just little infants
some will have gigantic breasts some will have no breasts
and everything in between some will have weird colored hair
tattoos and piercings and all this sort of stuff others
won't it will also of course all be dressed differently
some will be dressed real nice some will be dressed
like like homeless people and everything in between so you
observe all that that's you observing the person from the
outside now I want you to translate that lesson to
what's going on on their inside their mind so the
most important point here is not that people are different
externally physically what's more important is that people are different
internally in their minds so the key mistake and traffic
that is made here is that because we can't see
the mind we tend to assume that well yeah physically
it's hard to deny physical differences you know there's a
man there's a woman they're obviously different ones black ones
white ones fat ones skinny whatever very clear but we
can't so clearly look into a person's mind so what
we do for the first 30 or 40 years of
our life is we sort of project our own mind
into others and we tend to assume that well if
if I am introverted then that person must be introverted
or if I like going to a party then everyone
likes going to parties or if I like being a
doctor then most people should like being doctors and and
so on this is not the case this is not
the case in fact people are so different in their
minds that consider the following possibility this is a radical
possibility is that imagine that your mind is so different
Rembert like I said the mind and physical reality at
a deep level metaphysically are actually interconnected they're not separate
things people's minds are so different that it's almost as
though they're living in different realities now of course our
realities interpenetrate which is why we can all stop at
the same stoplight and not crash into each other our
realities are coherent and consistent in that way but there
are other ways in which our realities are not where
they're individuated we might say and so this is the
point I want to emphasize here is really try to
understand that people have different personalities different genetics different brain
chemistry different ideologies and software that is running their mind
a different operating system sometimes you're talking to somebody it
seems it's really it's like physically you two might look
even close and similar but internally the software that you're
running is so different that it's like communicating between a
Mac and a Windows PC or even like a Linux
or even something totally alien and sometimes like talking to
an alien you're just not on the same page at
all people have different levels of ambition different levels of
motivation different fear profiles what they're afraid of different degrees
of neurosis and trauma they experienced in their past different
energy levels different moods some are more happy some are
more depress some are more positive someone more negative optimistic
pessimistic whatever somewhat introverted some are extroverted different personality types
people are at different stages of development different levels of
consciousness and sometimes they even have different access to different
aspects of reality they don't see the same things that
you or I see of course we like to lock
some of those people up in now in mental institutions
but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's something's wrong with
them it just might mean that they're different and you
might be one of those people you might be different
so the reason I'm telling you this is first of
all when you recognize how different people's minds are that
helps you to again really try to customize life to
yourself because what works for somebody else does not necessarily
work for you you can't just assume that that would
be true if if everyone's minds are the same but
that's not the case also that advice isn't the same
for everybody some advice will work for some types of
minds but not other types of minds this also helps
you to to start to turn inwards more and to
honor your own self and to really question yourself deeper
because life is not just a process of exploring external
reality and other people it's a process of exploring your
own self because you don't really know who you are
and I don't mean in the Enlightenment sense I mean
you don't know who you are as a personality as
an ego you don't know who you are you don't
know what kind of food you like when you start
life you don't know what kind of sex you like
you don't know what kind of marriage or children you
would like to have or whether you would like to
have them at all you don't know what kind of
career you'd like to have you don't know what kind
of school you'd like to go to and what kind
of country you'd like to live in what kind of
weather you like you don't know these things until you
go through a deep process of discovering yourself at a
personality level and that's what the first few decades of
your life are spent doing after you're an adult you're
your 20s and your 30s you're really in a deep
process of discovering yourself as a personality and this is
a very important process a lot of people skip over
this process and they skip over all of my advice
in general and instead what they do is they they
waste their time falling into the trap of entertainment or
just going with the flow of what society the latest
trends in society which is usually low consciousness lowbrow type
of stuff which now leads me to very important to
a very important point that connects back with the idea
of ideology and belief systems so you were born into
a culture whatever culture learn a country you're in whatever
era you're living in this culture has been programming you
in indoctrinating you literally indoctrinating you with beliefs desires fears
philosophies attitudes ideologies since you were born and if you're
listening to this at age 15 or age 20 or
age 25 something like that you're still young but your
mind has already been programmed by 10 15 or 20
years of this programming of your culture and this has
already deeply screwed up your ability to understand reality so
a significant well the most significant challenge you'll be dealing
for the rest of your life if you really want
understand reality in yourself is the epistemic challenge of figuring
out what's true and what isn't and deconstructing all of
the programming that you received during the first 20 years
of your life through your childhood and through your education
basically through the first 12 years and if you went
to college then college as well that is like the
foundation that is set for you but that foundation comes
from your culture and any limits or bottlenecks or falsehoods
or deceptions or lies within your culture are gonna get
programmed into you in fact not only will that happen
it's already happened but you don't know what all those
are so in the process of discovering yourself you're gonna
have to shed layer upon layer of all the false
programming and conditioning that you've been programed with that is
keeping you from living a free open life you see
the way human development works it's very very delicate and
fragile especially during the first 20 years of a humans
development because when you come into this life as a
baby you're so fragile that any sort of shock to
your system very early on in life will have a
cascading effect and cause you to become very dysfunctional for
the rest of your life if you have a bad
mother who abuses you or a father who molest see
or something like that that will deeply traumatize you but
don't think that trauma is just something that happens you
know in rare instances of horrible neglect or family abuse
basically all of us in a certain sense grew up
in dysfunctional families to various degrees now granted some of
them were extremely dysfunctional others only minorly dysfunctional but still
there were many layers of dysfunction in your family because
whatever dysfunction your parents had they transferred it on to
you they couldn't help themselves that's how dysfunction works because
your dysfunction infects your interaction with others so what happened
was is that you received various kinds of traumas throughout
the first five 10 15 years of your life especially
incidents with your parents maybe you were bullied at school
maybe people made fun of you sometimes it's minor stuff
it can literally be you know you in school and
somebody just laughs at you or pulls your pants down
in front of the class something like that and that
that event can traumatize you you know it's not a
really serious event just really nothing in the grand scheme
of things but something that can traumatize you and it
can leave you afraid of being social with others it
can leave you resentful or jealous or depressive or neurotic
in some other way and so the reason that I
bring up this trauma business is because almost all of
us have it to some degree some of us have
it very badly some of it have us some of
us have it moderately almost none of us have it
minorly moderate you should probably assume you have moderate amount
of trauma this trauma is often repressed swept under the
rug forgotten and it seems like it's not a very
big part of your life now you know once you're
30 40 50 you might have forgotten all about it
but actually it's a big deal it's very very deep
within your subconscious deep within the foundations of your operating
system of your mind and even deeper really at the
kernel level so the earlier you receive the trauma the
closer to the curdle of your operating system it's going
to be the later in your life like if you
got some trauma in your 20s or 30s it's still
a problem but it's gonna be more towards the surface
level not so deep the deeper the trauma the harder
it is to heal the more surface level the easier
it is to move past so the reason I bring
this up this trauma business is because that trauma is
gonna be like a weight around your shoulder on your
neck dragging you down for the rest of your life
so one of the most important things I recommend you
do in order to free yourself and to really start
to go deep in life and be passionate about life
because the trauma will prevent you from being able to
be passion in life is you're gonna have to heal
yourself of that trauma now that's a tricky thing to
explain how to do I don't have time to explain
all here I'll have separate episodes about that in the
future but I'll just say this the deeper it is
the the deeper the work will have to be you
can work with a psychotherapist you can use psychedelics to
heal that trauma you can just do introspection and contemplation
or journaling by yourself you can heal it by talking
it out with an intimate partner I mean there's a
lot of different ways that you can heal that trauma
there's there's people you can hire who you can work
with to help you with that stuff coaches even psychics
and so forth can help you to deal with with
that trauma and get over it and to have you
face it and confront it but this is very very
important for you to do especially if you had a
good dose of it because you grew up in some
dysfunctional family in some dysfunctional part of the world you
know this functional families exist everywhere they exist in functional
and dysfunctional parts of the world so don't confuse those
two things so be honest with yourself ask yourself on
a scale of 1 to 10 how much trauma do
I think I had in the first 15 or 20
years of my life this trauma could have been physical
could have been emotional could have been verbal could have
been fights you got into with your siblings or with
your parents it could have been financial maybe you grew
up in crippling poverty that created trauma for you or
maybe even just mild poverty it could be because your
dad or your mom went to jail it could be
because you got arrested when you were a teen for
doing something stupid you know whatever it could be because
you got bullied at school or you bullied others at
school you were picked on you were laughed on you
became embarrassed basically whenever you weren't in some way approved
of or loved you got trauma something that shocked you
or scared you and denied you the love and acceptance
that you should have gotten that's what creates trauma this
trauma then creates a sort of a neediness and then
you're gonna spend the rest of your life trying to
get that thing that you've been desperately craving which is
love in that specific form that you wanted it might
be sexual it might be financial it might be you
want Fame because your mother didn't love you so now
you want to become famous as a compensating sort of
force or your your family was poor and your dad
wasn't able to afford to buy you the kind of
shoes you wanted so then when you grew up now
you're gonna be spending the rest of your life chasing
money or maybe you were picked on in school and
bullied and now you're gonna spend the rest of your
life being an [ __ ] towards others who remind
you of those bullies stuff like that this becomes very
dysfunctional neurotic and it robs you of the passion and
the clarity you need to be able to pursue reality
deeper to understand reality deeper to live look deeper so
again remember don't let the how to question prevent you
from resolving a problem so if you have some of
this trauma and you're thinking right now well but Leo
how I don't know how you didn't tell me how
to fix my trauma how do I do it it
doesn't matter how just understand that you need to resolve
it and then set the desire and the ambition that
this is something that I'm gonna resolve because I'm not
gonna let this thing weigh me down and cause me
to to not fulfill on my amazing life that I'm
building for myself I'm not gonna let some trauma get
in the way of that I'm gonna find the expert
that I need to heal me I'm gonna find the
books or watch the right videos or take the courses
or hire the professionals that I need or maybe I'll
even just figure it out myself you can do that
too grab a journal and start contemplating and you can
figure it out you get at the bottom of it
but anyways enough about that now since we're running out
of time here I really want to get to the
core of the advice that I have for you so
we've covered a lot of sort of practical stuff by
this point what are we kind of Luke are a
lot of career we covered a lot of taking responsibility
and being proactive and having motivation and passion this is
all good as a study have a foundation we talked
about learning we talked about understanding reality we talked about
truth and honesty all great stuff we still haven't really
touched upon health very quickly let me touch upon the
pillar of health when you're young it's easy to take
your health for granted but as you get older health
becomes more and more of a challenge so I talked
about how your culture imprints you with a bunch of
bad conditioning that you're gonna have to undo and deconstruct
one of those is health and one of the biggest
traps your culture will throw you in unless you're careful
is they will they will feed you garbage and poison
they will toxify your brain and make it such that
it's going to be difficult for you to properly use
your mind and also it's going to be difficult for
you to feel properly into your body because you're going
to be so overweight and overfilled with toxins and and
chemicals so what I recommend for you at a very
high level here is learn about proper nutrition go buy
some books about how to eat healthy and start to
look carefully at the kind of food that you're eating
our culture right now in our society is quite dysfunctional
and quite toxic and it's very commercialized which means the
food you get at restaurants in fat fast food places
this is not high quality organic food it's made to
be the saltiest sugar iasts unhealthiest food that is the
cheapest to produce and tastes the best right but if
you fall into this trap of eating at these restaurants
and at this fast-food and eating all this junk food
potato chips and cheese burgers at McDonald's and Coca Cola
and candy and various soft drinks and cake and you
know hot pockets and all this sorts of stuff Pizza
if this is your diet you are not going to
be able to fulfill on living an amazing life it's
just it's it's gonna catch up with you and it's
gonna turn into a glass ceiling for you so I
would take precautions I would read some books about nutrition
basically focus on eating Whole Foods vegetables fruits high quality
meats and fats yes it costs more but you need
that raw fuel raw clean fuel in order to do
everything else in your life you're gonna need those energy
levels you need to keep your energy levels high you're
gonna need to keep your brain functioning well speaking of
which drink purified high quality water don't consume products and
foods that might contain heavy metals like mercury and lead
there's really good research now that shows that actually getting
lead and mercury in to your brain results in rising
criminality rates in populations it's it's quite bad in the
1970s and 80s in the United States we had very
high crime rates and the reason we had such high
crime rates they discovered is that actually they passed some
regulations which improved the environment environmental pollutants basically companies chemical
companies were no longer allowed to just dump pollution into
like lead and Mercury and stuff into rivers and and
and lakes and into our food supply and that and
then we saw in the 1990s after that legislation took
effect and there were some regulations on those industries we
saw that the crime rates fell and not much really
change society except that now there was lower lead concentrations
and in babies and children's brains so take that stuff
seriously as you go forward and you want to reach
the deepest levels of understanding you're gonna need a very
clear mind you're gonna need to be able to focus
you're not gonna be able to do that when you
have a bunch of chemicals and and toxic stuff that
that you polluted your brain and your body with over
ten or twenty or thirty years of eating junk food
and drinking dirty water and this sort of stuff so
you need that basic foundation also recommend you learn to
exercise a bit as well whether it's weight lifting or
cardio or a combination of the above or yoga or
whatever okay so we got that now let's move on
to the most important the most important piece of advice
I have for you now we're gonna get metaphysical and
a bit spiritual okay and we can't help it because
in the end life is a metaphysical and spiritual thing
so here we go reality is not a physical system
like I alluded to in the past its consciousness everything
that you see or experience is consciousness different levels gradations
and layers of consciousness consciousness is a very complex thing
and the way that you understand consciousness is by experiencing
it and by being conscious of it who'da thunk see
my body is man of consciousness this video if you're
watching it on YouTube is made of consciousness if you're
listening this to this as an audio the audio waves
that you're hearing a man of consciousness your ears are
made of consciousness your brain is made of consciousness everything
is made out of consciousness why is this so important
you might wonder you might say well Lea what's the
difference whether it's consciousness or its atoms what's the difference
there's an enormous difference because if reality is made of
atoms then that makes it seem as though reality is
separate and distant from you again it feels like you're
falling in that scientific trap of like there's the object
and there's the subject and the subject is separate from
the object that means I'm over here and I'm looking
at the atoms over there but that's not your experience
of reality your experience of realities that you're meshed in
with it this physical room you're sitting in is a
part of your head there's no boundary between it and
you this is very important because this opens up a
totally radical new possibility because if reality was separate from
you external to you then there's always a sort of
a boundary or a veil through which you can never
pierce to get to the root bottom of reality maybe
you can look at reality through a microscope but you
need a microscope and even then you're just looking at
some atoms and it doesn't really reveal much about reality
to you but remember our number one priority is to
understand reality and the deeper we understand it the better
we are able to live because reality is all that
there is so if you don't understand it you'll be
living poorly and if you do understand it you'll be
living splendidly so to live the most splendid life you
want understand reality the deepest level and to do that
you need to understand that it's all consciousness and you
need once this possibility once you grasp this possibility once
you grasp it the object and the subject are actually
interconnected that means that you now have direct access to
reality itself reality is not hidden from you you're able
to access it because it's all consciousness just different levels
of consciousness and so the number one key to living
a good life is to be more conscious and to
raise your level of consciousness and there are many levels
and different degrees and states of consciousness right now you
happen to be in one state when you're sleeping you're
another state when you're dreaming you're in another state when
you're sexually aroused you're in another state when you're drunk
on alcohol you're in another state and so on reality
is infinite states of consciousness that's all that it is
but it's very important to what kind of states you're
in you can be in some very bad states very
contracted states and you can meet some very good states
very expansive states the more conscious you become the more
understanding you have of how everything truly is the less
conscious you are the more you're sort of in a
daze the more you're a zombie the more you're sleepwalking
through life the more you lie to yourself the more
you manipulate the more selfish you are the more fearful
you are the more petty you are and this now
leads us to sort of the key challenge of life
is that really life is about two forces fear versus
love those are the two forces but I'll also phrase
it this way it's about selfishness versus selflessness this is
what all of life boils down to had a metaphysical
level and really when I say metaphysical I also mean
physical sometimes people hear the word metaphysical and they think
oh that's some blue New Age stuff no no no
we're talking physics here basically your life is run by
fear and love all of humanity is run by fear
of love and so is the entire universe this is
not what science will teach you but science like I
said is operating under a false materialistic paradigm so in
your life I want you to really deeply notice that
you're either afraid of things and you're doing things out
of fear or you're doing things out of love now
love is the complex notion I'm not gonna explain it
fully here I have in the past in other episodes
you can look for those but uh you know we
talk a lot about passion and desire and ambition what
do you think that is what do you think desire
is when you connect with the miracle that your life
is what do you think that is that's love we
talked about trauma when you don't get the love that
you needed from your parents your mother especially but also
your father your siblings your friends your co-workers your teachers
your students and all that when you don't get enough
love what happens is that you recoil and you go
into fear and that creates trauma creates dysfunction it makes
you needy and then that sabotages your whole life so
if you want to know why you're here and what
life is really about life is a training ground to
teach you how to love and how to be selfless
and these are difficult things to learn learning these things
requires going through great struggle and suffering falling into many
traps and much trial and error so what reality is
what the universe is it's not just some stupid physical
system that exists randomly because of some Big Bang and
some molecules bouncing around and then just there happened to
be a planet Earth and there happened to be some
apes who evolved into some humans it's not that the
entire system has been designed by consciousness so that consciousness
can teach itself what it is which is love and
so that I can explore different ways in which love
gets expressed and how love gets manifested and actualized and
of course fear is just an absence of love so
it's not like fear and love are two polar opposite
forces it's actually one thing you could call it fear
- love fear is love of a very contracted sort
and love is of course love fully expanded without any
fear so think of it like light if we have
a dimmer switch here for this room I could tune
it down and the lights come down until it becomes
totally dark that would be absolute fear terror if you
were if you were if you encountered you know a
grizzly bear in the woods that dimmer switch would go
all the way to black you'd be so scared especially
if he was chasing you down and then if now
if we tune this dimmer switch upwards then that moves
us more towards brightness more and more light and more
and more light is just more and more love you
see so the reason it's important understand that everything is
consciousness is because when you think everything is atoms the
way science tells you when you think that way then
it seems like well but love how does love fit
into a physical reality because physical reality is over here
it's a bunch of atoms and my mind is over
here I'm the subject and I experience love these are
feelings these are like girly emotional feelings love is just
a feeling and so it seems like these two things
are separated and it seems like now olio you're talking
about love but that's just some hippy dippy woowoo [
__ ] then there's physical reality that's more primary this
is this is what's real this is fluffy stuff that's
under the materialist paradigm but when you realize and acknowledge
that this here is consciousness and everything is consciousness when
you understand that now it becomes a lot easier to
understand that love can be a fundamental feature of reality
because reality never was some molecules or atoms it was
consciousness technically the molecules and atoms that scientists study they
are consciousness consciousness is dreaming up molecules and atoms it's
also dreaming up scientists and science and it's dreaming up
the entire universe the entire universe is not a physical
object the entire universe is a giant infinite mind of
unlimited imaginary potential which means that life is imaginary that's
right you're at a dream and even though you're in
a dream and I'm just a figment of your own
dream never the life that's nevertheless life is still serious
it's still the realest thing there is because there's no
alternative to the dream therefore you've contributed the dream for
reality now I don't want to get too bogged down
into the sort of the philosophy and metaphysics of this
the reason I bring this up is just to help
ground the notion of fear and love so this is
actually very practical in your life every single day you're
fearing fear you're feeling fear and you're feeling love and
you're sort of getting tugged in either direction by these
different forces and the quality of your life is going
to hinge upon how much you give it to the
fear versus how much you pursue the love pursuing the
love is difficult but then again like I said consciousness
being a giant infinite universal mind what else is it
here to do it's got nothing else to do but
to explore different ways of loving itself you see consciousness
can either be in love with itself or it can
recoil from itself when you see something nasty or ugly
or vicious or evil quote-unquote evil you recoil that's consciousness
recoiling at it's own self your job in this life
is to learn to love life more and more and
more and more and more especially those things that recoil
you to love them more and more and more until
eventually you can become completely unconditionally loving or at least
try to approach that as much as you can and
to do that that requires becoming more and more and
more selfless which is the opposite of selfish so the
more selfish you are in life the worse your life
will be the more selfless you are in life the
better your life will be and this is one of
the most counterintuitive things because simplistically it seems like well
but if I live my life selfishly that sounds like
a good strategy right because like I'll be selfish and
all I'll hoard myself a bunch of money and I'll
be selfish and I'll just you know be manipulative in
my relationships and I'll be selfish I'll just lie to
people in order to get them to do what I
want and I'll be selfish and I'll just to take
all the good food and leave none none for everybody
else but I will get it and when I get
it I get all the pleasure and all the everything
comes to me so if everything is coming to me
then that's what life is about right life is all
about attracting everything that I want the most pleasurable stuff
to me and then that's the height of life that's
what it seems like and then what you discover after
maybe 30 40 50 years of trying that is that
it's exactly the opposite life the quality of your life
is about how much love you can radiate out to
others to the point where you love so much there's
nothing left of you you've given all of yourself away
now I don't mean doing this in a neurotic sense
where some women do this in a relationship where they
they try to please the man try to please the
husband over and over bend over backwards for the husband
and and then and whatever the husband abuses them and
they still bend over backwards and they keep pleasing the
husband night I'm not talking about this abusive wife syndrome
that's a neurotic form of love I'm talking about giving
and radiating love on your terms so remember I talked
about passion and what do you want to do with
your life you've been given this miracle of life and
really the question that so-to-speak God has put to you
now is this one how do you want to radiate
love you've been given this opportunity and now God is
telling you like this okay show me what you got
show me what you can do we've got consciousness here
we've got this amazing world that I've created for you
all this stuff that you can do you can go
out there you can be a murderer you can be
a thief you can be a dirty politician you can
be a crook you can be some Wall Street broker
you can be a doctor you can be a mother
Teresa you can be a saint you can be a
Jesus you can be a Buddha you can you know
you can make money you can have children you can
make a family you can make music and games and
you can be an engineer you can be you can
do anything you can go to the moon out of
all these things what are you gonna choose to do
all of these things are different manifestations of love some
are low manifestations some are very high manifestations how are
you gonna manifest your love how godlike are you willing
to be and what God like means is simply selfless
and loving if you were ever to become infinitely selfless
and infinitely loving you would become God and to the
extent that you're not is the extent to which you're
still God but you are lost within the lower realms
of consciousness you're not conscious enough to see why you
should be selfless and why the smartest and wisest most
intelligent choice and path in life is the most selfless
and loving one see you can't see that yet because
you're not conscious enough of it yet and the only
way it can become more conscious of it is by
living through life and going through this trial and error
process and suffering through it and it's the suffering that
will teach you how to be more loving and how
to be more selfless so if you really want the
best life possible try to understand what I'm telling you
here try to notice that it's true and commit to
being as loving and selfless as you can be on
your terms not in a dysfunctional neurotic way you're not
being loving and selfless because you want to live up
to some image of being a saint and you're not
being loving and selfless because you're gonna do that for
somebody else so that they can repay you even more
you see cuz that's actually a hidden form of selfishness
that's in a sense what the what the wife is
doing the abusive wife is doing what the husband is
that she is actually trying to to please him overly
much even though he's abusing her and she keeps doing
that because she needs him and there's a sort of
a codependency there and if he breaks up with her
she's gonna suffer and she doesn't to go through that
so see in that sense it's not really it's not
genuine love that's a neurotic form of love that comes
from past childhood traumas and so forth what I'm talking
about is just a pure radiation of yourself of your
personality of how you want to live of how you
want to use your body how do you want to
use your your your creativity your god-given talents in all
of this I'd like to say that life is like
a sandbox game it's not like one of those linear
games like Call of Duty or one of those Mario
side-scrollers you know Mario side-scroller you're just scrolling in one
direction the whole time there's no choice in you know
where you go every obstacle is already pre-designed preset life
is more like Sim City or minecraft where you're just
thrown into this into this matrix of possibility and you
get to decide which which things you want to actualize
and you can be a good person you can be
a cruel person you can be a manipulative person you
can be a generous person you can be highly creative
you can be a great lover you can you can
raise beautiful children or you can do the opposite of
those things you know you can abuse your children you
can beat your children you can be a terrible lover
you can be a needy lover you can be demanding
and exploitative and abusive and all the sorts of stuff
and there's no judgement in it there's no good or
bad because remember all meaning is created by you it's
an experiment in creativity that's literally why life is an
experiment in creativity not just life but the entire universe
it's an explosion of creativity so I recommend that you
don't fall into the trap of judging what is being
created around you don't waste time judging others criticizing others
don't waste time judging yourself or criticizing yourself simply focus
on what you want to create and try to radiate
as much love as you can stomach and then when
you find that you're not able to stomach anymore because
you've hit your limit then you ask yourself what how
can I love even more because I've hit my limit
how can I raise my limit that's the question you
ask and when you ask that question and then you
don't know how and you say but but how I
don't know how and then you remember oh yeah Leo
told me I don't need to know how all I
need to have is the desire the passion the ambition
for it and then what you realize that I don't
need to know how to love I just know I
need to know that I want to love and so
you set that desire and that intention very clearly to
be selfless to be godlike and then you work towards
that and then you do the research and you attract
the people and the circumstances the books and the videos
and courses and professional help that you need that will
help you to be more loving to raise your ceiling
for love and selflessness and you keep doing that and
doing that and doing that and doing that and doing
that until you've aced life tada that's how you live
the good life and that in a nutshell is what
spirituality is about now let me make a few final
remarks about spirituality because spirituality is a very problematic topic
filled with even more traps than all the other topics
so many traps within spirituality the biggest trap of course
is ideology and belief like we've already said your culture
has about a bunch of preconceived notions about how reality
works in what spirituality is and most of them are
wrong so the only way that you're really going to
deeply understand the things that I'm sharing with you here
because this is advanced advice this is not advice that
you're gonna hear almost anywhere else in society or in
your culture so it took me 20 years of hard
labor and brutal trial and error a lot of suffering
went into discovering this advice to the point where I
can I can just give it to you off the
cuff here this is off the cuff advice I didn't
take any notes just off top my head here the
only reason I'm able to give this advice to use
because I've went through hell to to figure this out
because I really wanted to figure it out and I
finally figured it out and it's possible to figure it
out believe it or not but in order to do
so you have to really be careful with how your
mind tricks you and you have to deconstruct all of
your beliefs about reality and all your ideologies and you
have to be completely and radically open-minded and you have
to derive all of this for yourself you're not gonna
be able to go read some Bible and get this
sort of depth of understanding even listening to this video
you might say well but Leo I got all the
info I got all the answers right here you gave
me all the answers assuming they're right let's just assume
for a second they're right if they're all right you
still haven't really gotten the answers because like I said
before you have to derive the answers for yourself it's
helpful for me to tell you this stuff but I
went through 20 years to derive these answers for myself
so the effect these answers have on me is very
different than the effect they have on you you have
not gone through those 10 or 20 years yet so
you're gonna have to go through that process so I
recommend you get started and if you're wondering well Leo
but what if you're trying to trick me or what
if you're deluded or how do I even know any
of this advice is good what if some of this
advice is bad well here's my advice about that of
course you shouldn't believe me if I was asking you
to believe me or to turn this into an ideology
then that would just be the ideology or belief trap
I'm suggesting something very different I'm suggesting you test this
through trial and error over the next 10 or 20
years and hey if you don't want to start with
my ideas go read some other books or pick up
some other ideas but you got to start somewhere when
you're doing testing or experimentation and this is true of
how science works you have to start somewhere so where
you gonna start well you start with your best intuition
of where you think is the best place to start
with so hopefully if your intuitive and you have a
good mind then the stuff that I said here will
resonate with that intuition and you will you will realize
that this is a very good place to start by
following this advice but if you aren't wise enough to
see that by all means go follow other advice go
shoot yourself up with some heroin or go have a
bunch of sex or go buy yourself a Ferrari you
know whatever you got to do experiment with life in
the end it's a trial and error process see and
that's why you shouldn't judge people because they're just they're
just exploring reality some of them are exploring it in
stupid ways but then again how else do you learn
but doing stupid things so because consciousness is all there
is and this is consciousness and everything is consciousness you
have direct access to reality and to truth at all
times right now right here you're directly connected with it
reality and truth is not somewhere hidden behind the veil
or curtain of of perception perception and appearance is consciousness
is reality this is it you have direct access to
it you are it so don't underestimate how deeply you
can understand yourself you can understand yourself totally infinitely in
fact that's what I suggest you try to do is
gain infinite self understanding and see where that leads you
it's possible because you are conscious you are conscious right
now and that consciousness is everything that there is there's
different levels of it though you have to train your
mind to access those other levels how again you can
always do research to find out how right now we're
more concerned about why and developing the desire in you
to do so to want to do so direct experience
is king that's one of my principles direct experience is
king you right now are experiencing reality experience notice is
all that you have of reality you don't have anything
else can you name me one thing that you have
a reality that has not been experienced by you try
name one thing that you have not experienced which is
real you can't anything real you have experienced because reality
is experience look turn within and look these are not
things I'm asking you to believe you don't believe me
and take on as an ideology that direct experiences King
you test it in your direct experience and see what's
going on can you invalidate it try of course it's
tricky because your mind can always trick you your mind
can always tell you that oh yeah there is something
besides experience there's reality behind the experience well that's part
of the work is is it's noticing how your own
mind tricks you and how you get you know sucked
into these various kinds of philosophical metaphysical traps and epistemic
traps so you do have to be very careful you
have to practice observation meditation you have to be aware
you have to turn inwards self reflect introspect question deeply
contemplate I have videos and episodes covering all those different
topics and how to do them and you can find
books that have been written about this and so forth
but in the end everything I said here it has
no truth or no validity to it unless you validate
it for yourself in your direct experience so really all
that I'm suggesting you do is I suggest that you
turn your life into a scientific investigation into a scientific
experiment and the of your experiment is to simply figure
out what is reality what is consciousness what is life
and how do I live the good life how do
I live the best life possible these are the four
or five key questions you need and as long as
you're deeply curious about these questions and you contemplate them
every day and you really desire answers to them that's
really enough from that you will be able to derive
everything else that I said here might take you 20
30 40 years you'll have to go through hell to
do it the way that I did but eventually you'll
do it and hey what else is there to do
with life have you got a better plan have you
got a better idea what are you gonna do are
you gonna spend the next 10 20 years work at
some dead-end job coming back home dead tired turning on
Netflix and sitting there crashing for three hours falling asleep
then doing it over the next day and doing that
over and over and over again until you're dead until
you're fat until you're 50 pounds overweight until you hate
your life until you're miserable until you're numb until you
can barely feel your own body anymore you're stuck in
your logical mind and this is what your life becomes
are you gonna be lazy with your life are you
gonna be proactive are you gonna treat it like the
miracle that it is or are you gonna numb that
out of your mind by watching TV or browsing online
endlessly through social media I think a lot of people
simply don't take life seriously and I don't mean seriously
in the sense that like a lot of people go
and be serious about becoming a lawyer or a doctor
or there'll be serious about starting a business and earn
lots of money I don't mean that that that to
me that's still not serious I mean there there are
many people who are so unserious they just work at
Starbucks and watch Netflix then there's a little bit more
serious people who actually start businesses and become doctors and
lawyers and then there's the really serious people they're really
serious people are the ones who are metaphysically serious that
means they're actually serious about questioning consciousness itself and how
you got here and what you're doing here and actually
trying to figure out life these are the philosophers they
are the really serious ones now of course there's a
lot of [ __ ] philosophers as well but when
you do philosophy right when you really deeply conte contemplate
in question reality it's not a mental masturbation exercise the
way that some people think it produces genuine results so
when I started doing philosophy when I was about 16
or 17 years old many people around me like when
I told them that I enjoy philosophy they would say
oh a philosophy that's some that's some airy-fairy [ __
] that's not practical that's not useful my parents would
tell me that they would make fun of me various
friends and and and and sort of colleagues that I
had would also treat philosophy in this very dismissive way
it's like Oh philosophy is just some some ancient Greek
[ __ ] that they did thousands of years ago
that doesn't work any or there's no point to it
is just like an intellectual exercise right no in 20
years I use philosophy to completely unravel the entire mystery
of the universe and I've completely figured it out now
of course I still have more to do I'm not
gonna be so arrogant as to say that my work
is done there's still a ton of work ahead of
me but I've reached the point where like literally it's
I mean it sounds arrogant to say but I've reached
the point where I've completely figured out the universe that's
possible I mean and and all that it required was
a utterly radically open mind and enough curiosity and passion
and the desire to do it like to me that
was the point of life there was no other point
in life other than figuring it out everything else was
a was a fun distraction nice little sideshow I of
course I did all that stuff you know this is
the sex the money the business yeah I did I
did that and I'm still doing that to some degree
and it's it's fun and all that but this is
all a sideshow I was serious about life very early
on and I would suggest as my final advice to
use get serious about life get metaphysically serious about life
figure out what life is figure out why you're here
figure out what it's all about these are not aimless
questions that have no answers and this is not just
purely subjective speculation was like oh yeah well Leo says
life is about love but somebody else says life is
about this and somebody else thinks about that is some
Christian person says this no no you can actually get
to the absolute truth of the matter you can get
to the bottom of what life is about and I
hope one day you do all right that's it for
me here I hope you like this life advice I
try to make it practical but also profound of course
we we've only scratched the surface I might have to
do a part two here we've covered a lot we've
we've built a nice little foundation mmm there's still so
much advice that I could give to you but I
have to cut it off at some point we're already
past two hours just ask guys as a final warning
I'll just tell you the biggest obstacle for you doing
this is going to be your culture and the beliefs
and ideologies that it's programmed you with you're gonna have
to do some very very deep inner introspection to deconstruct
all of that to free your mind to jailbreak your
mind and you're gonna have to overcome not just your
cultures programming but your own internal self deceptions see my
three part series about self deception mechanisms you have to
overcome all of your own personal self deceptions in order
to to fully actualize what I'm saying here but but
then again that's why I'm here that's why I hope
my work is here is to help you to do
that alright so that's that's the end please click the

purpose course it's all by the way it's exclusive content
so the stuff that you find in a life purpose
course is completely original completely brand new stuff that I
haven't talked about on my channel or anywhere else right
so it's it's it's worth the price of admission check
out my book list the book list by the way
is also a great resource that gives you hundreds of
some of the highest quality resources that I've used to
figure out how how to do this stuff how to
answer these questions I had these questions these top burning
questions in my mind that I mentioned of like you
know what is life how to live the good life
and what is conscious I've had these tough questions and
so I found hundreds of books and I read hundreds
of books that gave me good clues as to where
to look now of course I didn't just read these
books and believe what they said I read the books
and then I verified everything there for myself and that's
what I recommend you do is that you verify all
this stuff for yourself test it see if it's true
so check out the book list check out my blog
I post exclusive videos and content on the blog and
if you'd like you could support me on patreon by
going to patreon.com slash actualised where you can chip in
five bucks a month or something like that and that
supports me and gives me a little bit more funding
to do more of my basic expand my work in
the future which I will probably be doing and I
appreciate those donations that's it now some final concluding thought
just so complex and massive life is so massive that
one of the challenges with explaining how life really works
is that our culture these days is so shallow everything
is broken down into five second sound bites or five
minute segments between commercials and and stuff like that that
it's rare in our culture to find deep content that
actually is metaphysically serious you see our culture is not
metaphysically serious our news is not our entertainment is not
our schools are not our TV programs are not it's
almost the opposite of that it's it's like they're there
it's almost like they're deliberately metaphysically flimsy it's like they
deliberately avoid acknowledging the the fact that we exist it's
not existential nothing in our culture is is existential it's
all a distraction from that it's all surface novel stuff
so one of the things that originally excited me about
starting this channel actualized org and creating this deep catalogue
of video content the thing that inspired me to do
this was that I saw the potential I had a
vision of the potential that this catalog of content has
for going and taking people deep I want to actualize
it work to be something different something unique that you
couldn't find almost anywhere in society metaphysically serious self-improvement advice
it's practical but it's also profound it really gets you
to the kernel to the kernel of reality to the
kernel of your operating system a lot of self-help advices
is frivolous stuff how to earn a little bit of
money how to have better sex how to be nicer
to your husband how to have raise good kids how
to do I give some of this advice and it's
nice but it never it's never enough that kind of
advice is never gonna be enough it's not gonna fundamentally
change anything about your life it's not gonna answer the
deep question of why are you here what's really going
on and how to live the good life for that
you need an understanding at the kernel level which was
why we spend a lot of time covering foundational topics
which seem like they're irrelevant or a pract impractical stuff
about epistemology and metaphysics and spirituality and so forth sometimes
it seems like it's all not really relevant to your
life but I promise you it is it's just a
question of how deep you want to go the deeper
or the rather I guess the the the way to
say it is uh the taller you want to build
your skyscraper the deeper you have to dig the foundation
and if you want the tallest skyscraper you need the
deepest foundation so that's what we're doing here I recommend
you stick around keep watching and take this material seriously
take it as though you've discovered the Holy Grail here
not because I'm the best or something but just because
truly honestly where else are you gonna find a resource
of content a catalogue of content that breaks down life
at the level that I break it down at you're
not gonna find this almost anywhere else both in terms
of its depth but also breadth I try to do
both you see a lot of a lot of teachers
they'll either take you wide but they won't take you
deep or they'll take you deep but very very narrow
and here we try to do both and hard to
do it's like trying to swallow an elephant all at
once it's so big it's so epic like all I
can say in conclusion is that it's so worth it
this work is so worth it understanding reality truly understanding
reality not as an ideology not as a belief system
not as some cultural artifact - really independently investigate and
understand reality for what it is and how it works
it's so [ __ ] incredible it's so ingenious it's
so beautiful you won't regret it it's going to be
a lot more work than you ever thought but the
payoff is going to be infinite you
