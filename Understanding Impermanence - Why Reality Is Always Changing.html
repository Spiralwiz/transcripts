[Music] you welcome to this episode on understanding impermanence impermanence
is a concept that I've been wanting to share with
you for a long time and now it's finally the
time to do it impermanence is a fundamental teaching of
Buddhism and Hinduism I want to introduce you to this
concept and this term because I'll be referencing it again
and again in the future because it's very fundamental to
living a quality life and it's a concept which unfortunately
isn't very well understood in the West so in pali
the language pali which of course is buddhist related to
buddhism they have a term called Anita Anita which means
impermanence and literally you can break that word down into
its two components ah which means none and Nietzsche or
Nika which means constant so Anisha is non constant or
impermanence but then there's also a parallel word from Sanskrit
which is more connected with Hinduism and the term there
is Anita on nitya which also means something like non
constant of course these are just Eastern traditions Buddhism and
Hinduism don't think that this this concept of impermanence is
only coming from these two traditions this really this concept
is a spiritual concept that comes from and is present
in most of the world's spiritual traditions whether east or
west although of course in Western traditions oftentimes some of
these concepts become very corrupt or they get relegated to
the sidelines as as these religions become about power more
so than about transcending the self so what's so important
about this concept impermanence simply means that all form is
non constant it's always arising and passing away and by
this term or word form just to be clear what
form is form literally means everything form is a more
broad word even than object so when I say object
you think of a car a tree a human a
dog etc that encompasses a lot of stuff but the
word form is even more broad and universal than that
because usually for example when we say object you don't
think of a of a thought or an emotion or
a feeling or something nebulous like that as being an
object object is a rather materialistic term whereas the word
form encompasses feelings emotions and all sorts of nebulous non-material
type stuff that is also a part of reality so
form is everything so what we're saying here is that
no single form can be frozen in reality it's a
question of time how long the form will stick around
but they always pass away there's always a moment of
arising and a moment of passing away and this is
true of all forms now this seems almost like a
truism you might say well okay leo sure you're probably
right sounds right but so what this seems like such
a simplistic truth that it can't really help me in
my life well that's why we have to spend an
hour or two talking about impermanence giving you all sorts
of examples and convincing you of just how powerful this
this idea is and then also we're gonna have to
give you some homework assignments to actually practice impermanence to
be able to see the power of this concept but
it does it does benefit us to spend some time
just thinking about why reality is impermanent at an existential
sort of level what is so special about impermanence why
must reality be structured this way and not some other
way and the reason that is is because God is
a shapeshifter God is a shapeshifter but here I'm introducing
the concept of God we have to be careful because
there's a lot of misconceptions that people have about God
so make sure you don't fall into the trap of
thinking that I'm introducing you to some sort of religious
or ideological notion of God I'm not I'm talking just
about your true nature I'm talking about the entire universe
when I say the word God I mean this present
experience you're having right now and the universe as a
whole for more on that go check out my two-part
series called what is God where I explain it all
in a in a simple rational way and I answer
a lot of questions and objections that people commonly have
a lot of misconceptions and myths around what God is
God is you God is that thing sitting there right
now listening to me that's God and God is me
sitting here speaking to you God is everything God is
consciousness this is all consciousness everything you think is physical
is actually consciousness but as I talked about in my
episode called Astec non-duality remember that one where I talk
about Toyota Toyota is another word for God the Aztec
word for God so in that episode which is one
of my best ones go check it out it's a
really good one I put a lot of work into
the research of it with a lot of quotations and
so forth it's a beautiful description of non-duality and spirituality
and God from the Aztec perspective in that episode I
talked about how to yodel is a shapeshifter well we're
coming back to that idea that's a very powerful idea
most people when they think about God to think about
God is a static object some bearded man in the
clouds but that fundamentally misunderstands what God is God is
a shapeshifter and of course by that what I'm saying
is that you are a shapeshifter and of course I'm
also saying that the universe itself is a shapeshifter reality
itself as a whole is a shapeshifter right now you
are that God which itself has no form God is
totally formless but it takes armed different forms as a
shapeshifter and right now it happens to be taking on
the form of that human creature sitting there right now
listening to me or sitting here right now speaking to
you so the nature of a shapeshifter though is that
it doesn't have any form it's like the Invisible Man
who can take on and put on different disguises the
disguises don't define him because he can just take it
off put on another one so this is why reality
is fundamentally impermanent because consciousness which is what God is
consciousness is empty and takes on different forms and the
reason that is is because consciousness is infinite go check
out my episode two-part series understanding absolute infinity if you
don't understand what infinite means really when I say infinite
I don't just mean it's big in size I'm not
just talking about its length and depth and breadth its
physical dimensions I mean infinite infinite actually infinite infinite consciousness
you can't really know what that isn't unless you have
some deep awakenings but anyways consciousness is an infinite and
because it's infinite it's trying to maximize its diversity and
love it's trying to maximize as creative output that's what
infinity is it's an infinite expression of creativity for it
to do that for it to be everything for it
to be unlimited God must constantly keep changing forms in
the same way that a TV screen fundamentally the function
of a television screen is not to display one image
it's to be flexible enough to display any possible image
and in a sense if a TV screen ever displayed
only one constant image then it would be a dysfunctional
TV screen it would be a bad TV screen because
you want to I clip the channels on a TV
screen you want to be able to see any picture
right but what that means is that the TV screen
itself must be unattached to any particular picture can you
imagine if you were like flipping through the channels and
then your TV screen had a mind of its own
and it clung to one particular image like you were
flipping through the channel and you got to some porn
channel and the TV screen was like a whole I
liked this porn and then it gets stuck on that
image and it only displays that one image that it
loves it pulls one image out from from all the
porn you watch and the NASA thing it displays well
you would say that this is this is a malfunctioning
TV screen you see because you want to be able
to flip to other channels sure the poorness is fine
it's nice but then after you're done watching it you
want to be able to switch to something else except
now it's getting stuck if it gets stuck it gets
limited you see if god got stuck on one particular
form then all of its attention would go to that
form and then it wouldn't be as diverse and as
infinitely loving and creative as it could be if it
kept moving on but to move on it has to
let go of the thing that it created see so
in a sense God is like a blank canvas on
which all of reality is drawn but then it has
to be wiped clean you might almost think of it
like one of those etch-a-scketches you know those little sand
draw thing where you you turn the knobs and it
draws on the sand and then you can shake it
side to side and then it clears the whole thing
and then you can draw again that's the nature of
reality now by the way I want to point out
that this this notion that the only constant thing in
reality is change itself is a very powerful idea of
that notion I introduced to you in the past in
my episode called the theme of things going full circle
where I give you a bunch of examples of ways
in which these sort of dualities like constant versus change
how these dualities collapse and they circle back around into
each other see if you go through so much change
that it's infinite change eventually that infinite change is the
one constant of the universe the universe is a perpetual
motion machine actually not in theory not a science fiction
but the universe as a whole I'm not saying that
a part of the universe is a professional motion machine
that seems to be impossible given conservation of energy and
various other physical laws that we know of but when
you take the universe as a whole that consciousness or
God that itself is an actual Peschel motion machine it's
always in motion forever to infinity but if the universe
was at a professional motion machine then it would get
stuck and get bugged out sort of like a computer
or like that TV screen that we were talking about
the trick though is noticing this and accepting this it's
difficult for living organisms and humans who are selfish to
accept that this is how the universe works it's difficult
for limited beings to accept impermanence because impermanence is an
unlimited infinite quality and so humans what we like to
do because we're selfish is we want to make that
TV screen or that computer gets stuck according to our
self biased needs go check out my episode on self
bias to understand what that concept means it's an important
one that we need to leverage here so here's a
good way to explain it imagine you have a daughter
and you love your daughter very much she's beautiful to
you and perfect in every way and now imagine that
you were given the power to freeze her forever as
she is you were able to make her immortal she
could live forever nothing could ever harm her she could
never suffer she would exist for a billion years you
just had to push this one red button if you
oh [ __ ] she's gonna become immortal and she's
gonna stay in her current form she's not gonna grow
she's not gonna grow old her teeth are not gonna
fall out her breasts are not gonna sag she's just
gonna stay exactly as she is right now perfect and
beautiful as you love her all you have to do
is push that button so the question I have for
you is would you push that button and of course
most egos would push that button because that's what attachment
is you're attached to that particular form of reality you
don't want your daughter to change you don't want her
to grow old and to die and to have diseases
and to get saggy skin and have all sorts of
other problems you want her to stay as perfect as
you want it to be but that's you being selfish
in my Opik you see when you're thinking this way
you're only thinking about that one part of reality and
you're ignoring everything else you're not considering how pushing that
button would affect other human beings how it would affect
the universe as a whole see because you're biased you're
only thinking of her as your daughter you're not thinking
about other human beings you don't see how pushing this
button would hurt the rest of creation would diminish the
rest of creation because you don't care your responsibility is
not to the whole of creation your responsibility as a
parent is just to that little itty little bitty tiny
piece of reality that you've identified with and taken responsibility
for but see God as the intelligence which is running
the entire universe can't think this way it can't be
self biased and selfish like you it has to take
into consideration everybody else as well and as much as
you think that you love your daughter and that the
reason you're doing this and pushing this button is because
you love your daughter more than any else in the
world actually you're deluding yourself because God actually loves your
daughter more than you and it's actually because God loves
your daughter more than you that God will not allow
you to freeze her because to freeze her would be
detrimental to her and to the whole of the universe
because you see while you are attached to her being
in her current form what God understands is that this
daughter of yours is actually God itself is the entire
universe so to lock God into that one limited form
because God is a shapeshifter you confining her to that
one form would actually be the greatest evil you could
perpetrate upon your own daughter because if she was locked
into that form that means she would stay that way
forever that means she could never die that means she
could never awaken to her crew infinite nature as a
shapeshifter she would be stuck in that one particular form
in the same way that if I locked my TV
screen to one particular image I would ruin that TV
see but if I loved that one particular image so
much you can see how I might be tempted to
be able to lock that screen into that image forever
like burn it in there permanently so here it's very
counterintuitive because it seems to most parents for example if
their child dies or something bad happens to a child
it seems to most parents that oh my god why
would God be so cruel and allow my child to
go through all this you know to to grow up
and to get abused and to to face the evils
of the world and then to have cancer and then
to die why would God allow all this but the
reason you're confused is because your vision is too narrow
you're too attached to your child but you trick yourself
into thinking that actually you love your child so much
no your love for your child is extremely limited if
you fully loved your child the way that God loves
your child you would let her go see that would
be true love love is a very radical and counterintuitive
thing go check out my two-part series what is love
part 1 in part 2 where I explain some of
this stuff so actually God loves your daughter more than
you and that's precisely why your daughter must be impermanent
and your job in this life is to surrender enough
of your own self so that you're not so attached
and so limited with your self biased perspective that you
take on the perspective of God and you realize that
ah to really love my daughter as much as God
loves my daughter I would have to let her go
and I would have to appreciate her impermanence of course
not just her impermanence but the impermanence of everything and
including my own my own physical body as well so
ironically clinging to your daughter is a limited form of
love whereas letting her go is the unlimited form of
love see unlimited love is a very radical thing because
it doesn't cling it loves indiscriminately see the problem is
that you love your daughter only under certain circumstances you
love her when she's beautiful you love her when she's
not sick you love her when she's not abused you
love her when she's not dead but God loves her
under all conditions and of course what God wants the
most for her is for her to go through all
of the possible incarnations and to experience the infinity of
what she is you see but this is such a
radical thing that of course it involves suffering and pain
and disease and death and aging and rebirth and all
this which is a lot for a parent to accept
it's a lot for an individual to accept you can't
accept it in your own life so therefore of course
you fear the same for your daughter you project all
of your personal fears onto your daughter you teach all
of your personal fears onto your daughter you've taught your
own daughter that death is evil that's what you've done
in your own ignorance because you don't know any better
because you don't know that you're a god yeah it's
very counterintuitive stuff so it might seem like the loss
of beautiful and good things is evidence of evil in
the universe or is evidence somehow of God's imperfection like
for example some you know some fundamentalist religious preacher might
lose his daughter to cancer and then he might have
a a crisis of faith where he starts to question
his Christianity for example and he starts to question whether
God is even real because you know if God was
real how could God allow for this my daughter to
die of cancer but what he's not understanding is that
that that death of the daughter by cancer is the
very evidence of God's perfection and love loss is not
contrary to the perfection and goodness of the universe loss
is evidence of absolute love you just need to really
understand what absolute love is you need to radically recontextualize
what loss means and of course that's impermanence so this
is why this concept is so important you see because
whether you realize that right now or not as you
go through your life you're gonna face all sorts of
crises and problems diseases health dysfunctions evils of various kinds
and you're gonna have to face them one way or
another even if you're a scientifically minded person even if
you don't believe in God and you don't believe in
spirituality you think it's all nonsense you're still gonna have
to somehow explain evil to yourself and to your loved
ones because you're gonna encounter evil in the world whether
you like it or not whether you're scientifically minded or
not you might even be so scientific that you might
even say to me well leo evil doesn't really exist
but see that is your explanation to yourself of evil
as you say it doesn't exist but see it's one
thing to just in the abstract say that all well
evil doesn't exist but what happens when it actually happens
to you you might not ideologically believe in evil but
when evil is done to you some great horror is
done to you like you have cancer in your life
or someone close to you dies or suffers greatly or
whatever one of these sorts of things maybe somebody Rob's
you of a bunch of money somebody behaves unjustly towards
you attacks you viciously violently smears your name whatever if
one of these happens to you you're gonna feel very
upset by that it's gonna disturb you greatly it's gonna
affect the quality of your life it might even lead
to an existential crisis for you see so rather than
waiting for that to happen and to be able to
and in effect reacting you know sort of a knee-jerk
unconscious way when this evil happens to you what I'm
proposing is that you actually train yourself to properly understand
what evil is by understanding impermanence really most of the
things that you call evil are just examples of impermanence
you perceive it as evil because you've attached yourself to
one particular form and you want to freeze that form
and you want reality to just stay like that forever
but the truth is that everything is in constant motion
so you had no right to expect that thing to
stay frozen whether it's your daughter or your bank account
or your life or your husband or your career or
whatever and the reason you attach yourself to these different
things and you try to freeze different parts of reality
is because that's literally what survival is about check out
my my series on understanding survival it's very important episode
see true love is so deep that it cannot cling
to any one particular thing because it loves all things
equally how are you gonna choose you see that by
loving your daughter you're limiting your love such that all
of your attention goes to your daughter but then what
about all the other daughters in the world why don't
you love them see God can't just worry about your
one daughter God has to worry about all living beings
in every possible universe across all time you see so
the considerations that God has for how to design the
universe and what needs to happen and all that it
has to take in far far more than what serves
your personal little egoic needs and your agenda sometimes what
that means is that your daughter will have to die
from cancer for the greater good of the universe but
of course that doesn't that doesn't soothe you that doesn't
console you when you're a parent and you're attached or
your daughter because you don't want to sacrifice your daughter
for the greater good of the whole universe you want
her to live and so of course then you blame
God and you say oh god how could you you're
not you're not good and you're not perfect because you
weren't able to save my daughter from some terrible evil
like cancer because supposedly hey you know Leo if God
is infinite shouldn't God be able to construct a universe
where nobody dies of cancer see that's the kind of
logic that an ego takes because it doesn't see the
bigger picture of things you know this reminds me of
a story when I was young when I was about
10 years old or so I really loved animals I
mean I still love animals but I was really into
it I like I wanted to get every animal as
a pet pet rabbits and snakes and fish and cats
and birds I've had a bunch of different kinds of
animals throughout my life but at that point I was
really into rabbits and there was this pet store that
we would always go to buy my house and there
was a pan of rabbits there all the time you
know like most pet stores have rabbits or let the
cheapest pet and there was like usually 20 rabbits or
so in this kind of open pen with straw in
there and shavings and stuff and you can just pet
them it wasn't a cage or just a pen with
an open top and I would always my mom would
take me there and I would go with her and
I would like run in there and I'd be so
excited to to pet all the rabbits and my thing
was I don't know why it got in my mind
but like I felt bad that all the rabbits didn't
receive the same love and attention like I saw that
some people would be petting like the prettiest rabbit or
the cutest rabbit but then ignoring the other ones and
I felt like well if these rabbits are sitting in
this cage essentially the whole day like the one consolation
they get is like they get petted so to me
it was like well petting them is like is what
they want so I in my mind I thought of
it as like all the rabbits need to be petted
equally with no one rabbit getting extra special love or
a ten and so like when my mom would be
petting one rabbit I would force her I would tell
her noe if you pet that one you have to
pet all the other 20 ones and so every time
we would go in there I would force her to
pet every single rabbit in the pen and not leave
anyone like unloved unpaid internships work now what I realize
is that what I was doing there is I was
literally trying to embody unwittingly embody God's unconditional love that's
the difference between loving you know in a sort of
a narrow way versus loving in a kind of a
broad Universal way now of course this can also become
dysfunctional when you know you try to love everybody in
the end the problem is that is you know it's
very hard for a mere mortal a limited human being
to love everybody and everything equally really only God can
do that you have to be totally formless and infinite
to be able to do that but luckily you are
God and you are formless and infinite so you are
able to do it but only when you're in that
state of consciousness not in your usual state of consciousness
that you're in like right now not in your dualistic
human form so here's a key insight for you devilry
occurs when you try to make the impermanent permanent go
check out my episode what is the devil where I
talk about that devilry is a self biased clinging to
reality so by definition what the devil does is try
to freeze reality in different ways so one of the
challenges of the design and architecture of the entire universe
which is the brilliance of God's design is that God
has to arbitrate and mediate between all the different Devils
that exist the different partitions of God that exist and
somehow make sure that they all function in some sort
of harmonious way because if everyday got his choice then
for example if every parent was able to freeze their
child in one particular form then what would happen 7
billion people on this planet would all push that red
button all the parents would turn all their children into
these frozen forms that could be immortal that would be
immortal and would never die and therefore all of the
human race would come to a stop human evolution would
come to a stop societal evolution would come to a
stop because the evolution of society depends on human beings
being born and dying and new generations arising if you
froze everybody in place this would be a net negative
for the whole universe see so it seems good in
the short term but it would be terrible in the
long run which is why it can't be done tah-dah
see God doesn't really allow you the power to be
a devil forever you can only be a devil for
a short while devilry is temporary only God is permanent
a devil is what God becomes when it limits itself
into a particular finite shape or form and the reason
we call it devilry is because once you've attached yourself
to one particular finite limited form that form then goes
into survival mode and manipulates lies cheats steals and does
all sorts of quote-unquote evil to maintain that form so
by pushing that red button you are accepting the devil's
bargain and thereby committing the very evil that you wish
to protect your daughter from you see because you see
the death of your daughter frees up all those atoms
and molecules all that energy that is in your daughter's
body it frees all that up to create new life
this is the cycle of life if every human body
was frozen to maintain its current configuration that means that
energy and those molecules in that matter couldn't be used
to feed the worms which grows the grass that grass
grows the cows and other animals and the birds and
then those birds are eaten by humans and this whole
cycle continues and new life evolves and then you know
we have apes and then from apes we've got humans
evolving and beyond humans will have something else evolving right
this whole chain of evolution the cycle of life it's
it's always continuing but if you if you froze it
imagine what would happen if some species froze itself a
billion years ago when it was in a very primitive
form then there couldn't be more beautiful creatures there couldn't
be tigers and lions and there couldn't be dinosaurs and
there couldn't be Apes and ultimately there couldn't be humans
all of that beauty all of that creativity would be
lost because some species a billion years ago pushed that
red button and froze itself in his current configuration because
it was so selfish and it's thought that it was
already at its best form why do you think your
daughter right now is at her best form are you
thinking a million years into the future of what your
daughter will become after a thousand incarnations when she turns
into some other species on some other planet no of
course not anything about any of this because you're completely
locked into this very myopic limited human perspective you're not
even thinking about like the next generation of humans you're
not even thinking about bye-bye pushing this button you will
take away or Rob some future human being of his
birth or her birth because there's only so much matter
on this planet there can only be so many humans
on this planet so if your daughter takes up one
slot let's say let's say there's a hundred billion slots
for humans on this planet that's like the carrying capacity
of this planet Earth well if she takes up one
of those slots that means she's stealing that slot from
somebody else who could have been born and of course
so are you that's the nature of survival that's the
nature of coming into reality as a form by being
a particular form you're you're robbing some other form of
being in your place you see that this is very
important in this case we're literally talking about a zero-sum
game the weird thing about reality is that even though
it's infinite when you're in coordinating as a particular form
it's finite and it's a zero-sum game so for example
for you to have been born a human that means
you couldn't have been born a kangaroo you couldn't have
been born a panda you couldn't have been born a
space alien you couldn't have been born as some other
human you had to be born as you to be
born as you that robbed somebody that robbed consciousness of
some other possibility see appreciate that therefore you have to
appreciate that you're gonna have to surrender that you can't
make that permanent and to try to make that permanent
is the very definition of devilry and of course as
a devil you want nothing more but a way to
make it permanent you want a red button that you
can push to keep yourself alive forever as a finite
form but God will not allow you to do that
because if he did that would undermine the infinity of
the entire universe and would actually rob you of the
greatest gift which is the realization of your own infinitude
so I want you to contemplate for yourself the following
question which forms am i trying to freeze in my
life it could be people animals things ideas stuff about
your personal body your appearance your own life your finances
whatever it is make a list of the forums you
try to freeze and try to identify the ones that
you are most attached to freezing because that is literally
what is creating evil in the world if every human
stopped trying to freeze different aspects of their life all
evil on earth would be extinguished in one day so
this is a powerful exercise of course until don't expect
that to happen cuz nobody wants to do this exercise
nobody wants to let go of trying to freeze certain
things they want to make exceptions they want to say
well okay we all let this go and I'll let
that go but I won't like this I won't let
this thing go this thing here I need right and
that's what makes you a devil so don't be surprised
when there's a bunch of evil in the world because
the reason the evil happens is precisely because everybody makes
that kind of exception just like you did they say
well I'm willing to let everything go except I'm not
willing to let go of my position of power or
I'm not willing to let go of my money or
I'm not willing to let go of my of my
business for example some you know some some oil executive
is you know ruining the environment by by extracting oil
in environmentally friendly ways and then you ask him well
can you let that go for the sake of the
environment and he says no I won't let it go
right cuz that's his baby that's his daughter so when
we ask you to let your daughter go what are
you gonna say are you gonna say yes are you
gonna say no you're gonna say no you're not gonna
care about all this theory you're not gonna care about
god you're not gonna care about love no you're a
selfish [ __ ] you're a devil you're gonna say
no and then you wonder why there's so much evil
in the world look in the mirror there's your answer
fundamentally impermanence happens because of oneness impermanence is one of
the consequences of oneness of non-duality one this means that
reality is one thing if reality is one thing that
means that no part of reality can gain an absolute
monopoly over any other part because all parts are equally
powerful not at one moment in time but across all
of time see so for example right now there might
be some corporation which is extremely powerful because it's in
some sort of industry which is doing really well maybe
Google you might say is a very powerful corporation has
billions of dollars doing really well because online search is
a very powerful and valuable thing in 21st century society
but there will come a time in the future where
Google as a company will die because the times will
change the circumstances will change what used to be important
and powerful will no longer be important and powerful or
there will be some better tool some better way to
search the internet or there will be something even better
than the Internet which transcends the internet and makes the
internet obsolete or makes internet search obsolete or makes Google
obsolete so even though Google might have a monopoly on
internet search right now and it might seem like that
will never end it only seems that way because you
take a very short time horizon you're only thinking in
terms of decades and maybe centuries but if you start
thinking in terms of of millennia and even beyond that
you start to see that this forum called Google can't
persist it must die and the reason that is is
that because over time when you take infinite time when
you look infinitely far to the future what you see
is that all parts of God have the same power
so what the universe is doing is it's like God
armwrestling with himself or playing chess with himself that's what
oneness means that means that there can't be one part
of God which is more powerful than some other part
of God so even though God can't arm wrestle with
itself and sometimes it'll win you know sometimes this arm
will win sometimes the other arm will win in the
ultimate big picture it must all balance out and no
one part of God can be all-powerful and dominate the
other parts but of course every part of God is
trying to do that and that is the very mechanism
of devilry see devilry is when one part of God
tries to overtake all the other parts and to create
a monopoly of power see but fortunately this can never
happen but of course from the parts perspective when I
say fortunately I'm speaking from God's perspective from the perspective
the whole but from the perspective of the part it's
very unfortunate from your perspective it's very unfortunate because you
call that death you call that mortality and for you
mortality seems very unfortunate for the devil mortality seems very
unfortunate but from the bigger picture perspective you want the
devil to be mortal you don't want the devil to
be immortal and that's exactly how the whole thing is
designed at first glance impermanence will seem depressing and negative
to you because you're a devil and you're selfish but
actually impermanence is a great gift and that's what I'm
trying to your mind too here to teach you here
and that's what some of the homework assignments that I'll
be giving you will be about is teaching you the
great gift of impermanence so the way that we reform
devils and cure them of their evil and devilry is
by showing them that actually impermanence is not something that
you fear and resist and manipulate your way to avoid
but something that you embrace and that's what spirituality boils
down to is to the the embrace of impermanence not
only does impermanence liberate you in the end and reduce
suffering it also heightens appreciation love enjoyment and beauty of
the formed world start to notice that the best things
in life that you love the most are so good
precisely because they're temporary it's their impermanence that makes you
appreciate them so much here are some examples ice cream
or caviar or your favorite food why is it so
good it's precisely because you have it so rarely if
you ate the same ice cream ten times a day
for a year you would be so sick of it
you would find it disgusting if you ate caviar every
single day for a year and it was your only
meal you would find it disgusting very quickly you know
have you ever ate caviar I'm talking about real sturgeon
black caviar really good stuff the Russian stuff I'm Russian
and I remember times when I was younger when my
dad he would travel to Russia on business and so
forth and he would come back and oftentimes he would
bring back a big kilogram a kilo tin it was
about this round and about this tall so imagined a
tin like this of just a solid tin of like
the best black beluga caviar this this [ __ ]
is expensive and this was back maybe 15-20 years ago
when it was still legal to import this stuff and
even then of course it was still expensive but you
can get it much cheaper in Russia than you can
in the States but still a tin like that would
cost I don't know four or five hundred dollars I
think nowadays it's illegal to actually import into the US
and they have a really big problem with poaching and
they're endangered these sturgeons it's it's pretty bad in Russia
they're totally over fished but these ten nowadays a kilogram
10 of Beluga black caviar would probably run you definitely
over $1,000 maybe $2,000 would be $5000 I don't know
what it costs now but that [ __ ] is
delicious if you've never tried some you're missing out it's
delicious so it's it's it's worth the price but you
know even that as delicious and rare as that is
the reason is so delicious part of the reason that
is so delicious is because you have it so rarely
there were actually old Russian stories of like peasants who
used to live on like the Volga River one of
the major rivers and Russia is called the Volga and
they have a lot of sturgeons they were at least
they did until they over fished them all but like
two hundred years ago you know the repents who just
lived there their were so many sturgeons back then because
they weren't over fished that there were stories of how
these peasants they they would have nothing to eat except
there'd be so much sturgeon that they could just fish
sea sturgeon and they would literally have buckets of caviar
for breakfast buckets of the best black caviar but they
would but precisely because they would eat buckets of this
caviar every single day they were sick of it to
them they want something like like meat you know to
them meat was a luxury because there was no no
meat but there are so much caviar so that's how
life works why is childhood so precious and uh and
beautiful because it's so fleeting you have fond memories of
your childhood hopefully unless you have some abusive childhood you
should have some good memories there and and then you
look back on it with fondness and nostalgia precisely because
it's impermanent and it's gone now your family you only
really appreciate your family due to impermanence otherwise you know
if your family is constantly in your life it actually
grinds on your nerves if you have to live with
your mother your whole life that would be hell you
have to kind of keep a safe distance from your
family so that you see them occasionally but not too
often to the point where they get on your nerves
and it just becomes too constant and then of course
their death as sad as that is to you and
as much as you would hate to have that happen
ultimately you need it to happen so that you can
appreciate them more you're only gonna really appreciate your parents
after they're gone or your children after they're gone your
pets same thing you only appreciate them because you can
only have that pet for so long and you know
that going into it there's a time limit on your
pet how about video games movies films all forms of
entertainment songs and so forth they're only wonderful and exciting
and awesome because they're not constant if you constantly have
to watch the same movie all day long for a
year that would be hell if you had to replay
the same video game if there was only one video
game in the universe and you had to replay it
over and over an organ let's let's imagine that the
only video game that existed because somebody some devil push
that red button was the original Mario game Super Mario
Bros on the NES you know that one the classic
one so let's say that you know after that game
was invented by the designers at Nintendo and then you
know they had a button and said okay this is
the only video game that's ever gonna exist we're just
gonna freeze it like this we don't want other video
games to compete with us we're gonna have a monopoly
on video games and every video game must be a
Mario game and it's gonna be this exact Mario game
we're not even gonna add any more new levels we're
just gonna keep printing this game over and over again
on every computer and game system this would be this
would be terrible it would destroy the diversity and the
flowering and the creativity of the entire domain of video
games that you love if you're a gamer same for
movies same for books and for everything you see so
so from the big-picture perspective what God is trying to
do is try to maximize the creative diversity of life
and it can't do that when one species tries to
gain a monopoly over all of life which is one
of the problems that the human species is doing right
now is we're we're overcrowding the planet to the point
where we're killing off species by the hundreds and by
the thousands and this situation can't last see humans can't
just be so selfish that we occupy the entire Earth
and populated only with humans see after a certain point
of doing that we would actually start to see the
detrimental effects of it which of course we're already starting
to see something is lost by losing the diversity of
life this this notion of diversity is a very profound
existential component of reality one that many people who are
anti diversity don't understand and don't appreciate you know especially
ethnocentric people people who really love their one culture or
their one race you know like that sort of white
supremacist philosophy of like well the white race is a
superior one and we want to just like purify the
nation of any brown people and black people and weird
people and whatever we just want it to be just
like pure white European as' the sort of Hitler mentality
you see that's devilry literally that's devilry and why was
the result of Hitler's philosophy the sort of destruction and
evil that we saw precisely because his agenda was to
freeze that sort of white Aryan identity that he glorified
to freeze that and to to promote that sort of
philosophy around the world but it couldn't have worked you
see it couldn't have worked there was no way that
Hitler could have sustained that even if Hitler could have
won World War two maybe let's say the Germans invented
a nuclear bomb before others did and they have so
much military power that they could have just like dominated
Europe and even America and so forth it still couldn't
have lasted eventually it would have had to collapse from
within because no monopoly can be maintained no racial monopolies
no species monopolies no monopolies of any kind because the
nature of reality is impermanence your own life itself the
reason your life is exciting and juicy and fresh is
because it's short and you realize that you got to
make good use of your time if you were gonna
live forever your life would get very boring and stale
and it would quickly devolve see you wouldn't even know
what to do with immortality if you got it it
would make you such a devil a kiss for example
is made so much better by the impermanence of it
you don't want to kiss that lasts forever short kiss
short kiss that leaves you wanting more that's really what
you learned you want to be teased by life you
don't really want all of your desires satisfied you think
you do but really you don't you want to be
teased so there's always something over the horizon the next
thing to look forward to because you only really appreciate
differences you only really appreciate things when they're gone you
appreciate not having a thing and then getting it and
then losing it like you're poor then you earn a
lot of money and then you lose that money and
you can appreciate that whole cycle because when you go
from being broke to having some money that's it's like
a huge relief and it's so nice and it's so
wonderful but then if you bask in that wealth for
too long it corrupts you it turns you into a
devil it makes you complacent and lazy and you don't
work hard anymore you're not creative anymore so it's nice
that you gain your money but then you lose some
of that money so that you have to work again
you have to be creative again you have to start
a new business you have to you know you have
to get off your ass otherwise you're gonna turn into
some creature like a job of the Hut who just
sits around and stews in his own wealth and in
his own crapulous in his own obesity and all that
in his own luxury say and then it actually makes
them evil so train yourself to appreciate the beauty of
loss this is the cycle of not of life the
death of one thing creates room for the life of
something else the only reason you're able to be alive
right now is because all the other humans and animals
who lived generations before you had died if they hadn't
died you couldn't be here to be alive the loss
of a beautiful thing only underscores how beautiful that thing
was which brings us to the jab concept of moto
no owari or just a soiree for short aw ar
e like aware but pronounced al are a here's what
wikipedia says about a soiree and here I'm quoting Wikipedia
which is quoting Fiona McDonald it says quote Moe no
no owari is the ephemeral nature of beauty the quietly
elated bittersweet feeling of having been witness to the dazzling
circus of life knowing that none of it can last
it's basically about being both saddened and appreciative of transience
and also about the relationship between life and death and
then wikipedia says quote awareness of the transience of all
things heightens appreciation of their beauty and evokes a gentle
sadness at their passing end quote so hear another word
for this uh soiree is just melancholy that melancholy feeling
you feel when there's a sort of a loss of
something in your life and this is a very important
skill to develop the ability to be able to enter
into melancholy without going into depression or into anger or
bitterness or nihilism if you make that distinction in your
mind between the two maybe you can think of a
time when you experienced some loss in your life but
you didn't take it personally you didn't get butthurt about
it you didn't cling to it but you just sort
of realized that yes it's sad to lose this thing
but it was time for this thing to go that's
melancholy that's a healthy form of coping with loss whereas
an unhealthy form is you're so attached to it that
you get butthurt about it you start to cling to
it you want it back you ruminate and think about
all well if only I could get this thing I
would be happy and I'll never be happy again and
you get suicidal and bla bla bla bla bla for
example I had a I had a Siamese cat that
I got when I was in fourth grade and I
loved I loved her probably more than then I mean
as much as as you would love a child like
I I nurtured her she was like my baby I
slept with her like I had her for for 17
years and then she started getting old she got sick
her kidneys stopped functioning properly and eventually she just like
it was clear that she was on her last days
and we had to take her to the vet and
euthanize her and I remember the moment that I had
to do that and at the on one hand it
was it was very sad cuz it was a 17-year
relationship like that I built with her literally I felt
like she was my daughter that was the depth of
the connection there but at the same time when I
took her to the doctor to get euthanized and went
through that whole process as sad as it was in
the back of my mind I thought like well she
lived a good life 17 years a lot of great
experiences memories like I don't know what more can you
ask of in life she basically had it all she
she played and we had fun and we cuddled and
we slept together and she went outside she you know
she hunted for rats and for birds and for this
and she wasn't cooped up in the house all the
time she was outdoors a lot and all this and
she lived through a lot of stuff and all these
experience ort of journey you might say of life and
so I felt like nothing was really cut short and
that if I was clean to hurt if I was
just saying well but why can't I just get one
more year with her what if what if she could
have lived to 17 or to 18 to 19 to
20 what if we could have kept her on some
sort of medication and what if we could have made
her and more like for this see if I started
going down that road this would have been the road
of devilry and it would have created suffering whereas I
sort of just entered a state of melancholy for for
a while it was a healthy way of coping with
the situation and it's fine that's what you want to
cultivate and develop that's a soirée as the japanese call
you know another good example of a soiree is that
movie lost in translation with Scarlett Johansson and with Bill
Murray a really good movie recommend you go check it
out because that whole movie the theme of that movie
the really what makes it so good is it's got
this mood to it it's got this melancholic sort of
mood and I don't know if this was done consciously
by the director or not but it captures that sense
of a soiree and speaking of loss of translation that's
a really good title for spirituality because that's what spirituality
is all about that's what life is about that's what
God is all about God is lost in translation God
is that which you can't put into words you must
experience it for yourself and a soirée is the as
an important feature of God and of course of yourself
when we're talking about God we're just talking about you
so what impermanence means is that you will lose your
family you will lose your fame your status your wealth
you will lose your good fortune you will lose your
health you will lose your youth and your good looks
you will lose your sharp mental faculties if you have
them you will lose your memories you will lose being
the strongest and the best at whatever you're at you
will lose all of your skills and all of your
mastery that you've developed throughout life every relationship you have
will die every religion will die every corporation will die
every organization political parties social movement and cult will die
every fad and trend will pass every language will die
every scientific theory will ultimately die every spiritual teaching will
die and become corrupt every book will be lost and
forgotten every person will be forgotten every city and country
will die every civilisation will die every culture will die
every tradition will die every species will die and go
extinct humanity will die and go extinct even continents die
and go out of existence because they transform to something
else every physical object will die every atom will be
destroyed every star and planet will die even the universe
will be extinguished every victor will ultimately end up defeated
every monopoly and concentration of force will be up ended
and overturned every part will be made whole every duality
will collapse every devil will merge back into God that's
what oneness means that's what impermanence means because life and
death is a duality and so the cost of being
born is death that's how it works you see but
a lot of people are in denial about this they
spend a lot of time trying to seize on one
of these things and to cling to it and to
defend it at all costs think about especially for example
religions religions tend to be very Orthodox oriented and very
traditional and they want to be very rigorous in preserving
the original manuscripts the Scriptures the Bible the holy book
the teachings of the founder but the irony is is
that religion itself needs to teach that religion cannot survive
as it was at the founding it will always deviate
splinter sects will arise and those sects will become corrupted
and they will die spiritual communities will come and go
the religion will be over thousands of years bastardized and
transmogrified into something totally different than what it was at
the founding he might even turn into the opposite of
what it was which is what we see with Christianity
especially but most other religions even with Buddhism even if
you think Buddhism is a good religion well which Buddhism
are you talking about there's at least three major branches
but really every one of those has uh you know
a dozen more sub branches within it and you see
the the desire to cling to one true canonical religion
to say well you know Mahayana Buddhism is the best
one and the Vajrayana Buddhism that's the inferior one and
this other Buddhism this inferior one and my particular sect
of Mahayana Buddhism that's the the one true one and
we're just gonna memorize this Buddhism we're gonna write it
down it's just gonna be perfect like this it's gonna
be taught in this one two three step way and
this will be the one true religion no this is
delusion this is devilry by doing this you bastardized religion
I was arguing with somebody on my forum about sadguru's
spiritual school and this guy was really into Sadhguru you
know look at the famous YouTube guru and I got
nothing against Sadhguru I like him he's a smart guy
I think he teaches good stuff overall as far as
I know but I was telling this guy don't cling
to it because everything's gonna die everything is gonna become
corrupt including Sadhguru stitching's and he was saying no sadguru's
teachings are the best the most perfect teachings they're never
gonna become corrupt it's never gonna die because Sadhguru forces
everybody to memorize all his teachers and students they have
to memorize how to teach it have to teach it
like by a script and all of this this preserves
the purity of the teaching and it's the best and
done it up no it's not gonna stay this way
see in fact the very attempt to try to codify
Sadhguru x' teachings into some sort of perfect system that
you have to memorize this very mechanism is the very
thing that the devil will co-opt in order to corrupt
the teaching see because by blindly memorizing things is very
easy for you know rewriting a couple of lines then
people just memorize the wrong lines it's like a game
of telephone you know over the next hundred years two
hundred years long after Sadhguru is dead a thousand years
will pass and then people will be memorizing stuff that's
how a guru never even said or taught Sadhguru will
be rolling in his grave at the things that are
done and said and practiced in his name in the
same way that Jesus must be and basically all all
spiritual teachers face this problem see that's because their students
didn't fully integrate and understand the notion of impermanence it's
not enough just to understand it intellectually you have to
really grasp it at a cellular level and that's why
this whole desire to to be very strict and formal
about your religion or your spirituality it ain't gonna work
you're just clinging or for example you know some conservatives
they will cling to a language and they'll say well
the English language it has to be this way there's
one proper way to speak English you don't want to
be introducing new words that's corrupting the language but the
language that we're speaking now the English language that you
hold as the canonical one where'd it come from it
came from a process of evolution it wasn't just birth
that way go read some Shakespeare you'll see the English
language and Shakespeare is is monstrous you can hardly understand
it so what's the one true language there isn't one
there never will be one in a thousand years if
the English language still exists it will be very different
than the English language of today the mistake is trying
to preserve the current English language as it is tried
to fix it trying to freeze it that's the mistake
corporations often follow through this trap a lot of times
there are corporations that were very successful in the past
because they were writing some sort of technological trend or
wave but then that technology that trend played itself out
and now it's in its downward phase but these corporations
because they're fighting for their survival basically like a tumor
they just want to keep growing and growing and growing
they don't want to accept that it's time for us
to maybe shut our doors time to accept that this
technology wave has passed and I'm thinking about corporations maybe
like Kodak Polaroid blockbuster these sort of corporations you know
that went out of business but they went out of
business for good reason because they had bad business models
because they didn't keep up with the technology and that's
what happens but the problem becomes is when a corporation
tries to cling to its to its business even after
it's been shown that the business is dysfunctional for example
right now we have corporations who are selling cigarettes long
after we've discovered that cigarettes cause cancer and our you
know ruining people's health and contributing to unconsciousness in society
but these corporations they still claim to it why because
it's a good return on investment still even still cigarettes
are like last time I checked it was like an
eighty billion dollar market worldwide for cigarettes huge market but
see really these these companies they need to admit to
themselves that you know guys and one-point cigarettes were acceptable
but at this point they're not acceptable we need to
quit we need to find something new to do we
need a new business but they you know they keep
clinging to it they just keep investing you know these
cigarette companies now they're investing in e-cigarettes and vaping and
all this and now of course vaping an e-cigarette so
you've seen the news now there's health concerns with that
they seem to be even worse than cigarettes in certain
cases and so now now the vaping companies now they're
gonna be clinging to for dear life and survival because
you know once you've built up this successful vaping company
you don't want to admit that you're vaping that you're
vaping is killing people and it's bad for people's lungs
and so forth see devilry this is the very definition
of devilry I want you to notice how you contribute
to this how you do this see it's easy to
criticize others for claiming to stuff except when now it's
your ass on the line notice how much you cling
when it's your ass on the line that's because you're
scared why are you scared because you're attached to your
identity you fear loss of self go check out my
two-part series on how fear works part 1 part 2
so foolish people try to cling and freeze reality into
certain forms wise people make the counterintuitive move from my
episode called the counterintuitive nature of life we're talking about
counter to boobs well here's one more for you add
it to the list one of the biggest counter tudi
moves is to teach yourself to embrace impermanence rather than
manipulating your way out of it except that the cost
of life is death not just at the individual biological
level I'm talking about all levels we're not just talking
about biology here we're talking about corporations we're talking about
religions we're talking about ideas and languages see how it
goes way beyond biology evolution goes way beyond biology which
the biologists don't fully appreciate the cost of being a
form is that eventually you must change form and really
that's all the death is it's just a change of
form you're changing into something else you're not really dying
you're a shape-shifter you're shifting your shape you've just deluded
yourself by attaching yourself to this one shape and oh
my god I'm gonna die no you're not I die
you're just gonna change your [ __ ] shape get
over it immortality is impossible through attachment to form this
needs to be understood that's one consequence of impermanence and
oneness it will never be possible so I'm actually making
a very scientific and empirical prediction here when I say
this what I'm saying is that even after a million
years of technological development from today if mankind is still
alive a million years from now just imagine how much
amazing technology will we will have invented in a million
years there will still not be a method for immortality
through technology but immortality is possible by detachment from form
and for that you don't need to wait a million
years or some fancy technology some cryofreeze or some genetic
modifications or some technological uploading of your brain into some
computer or some [ __ ] like this you don't
need that all you need to do is you got
to surrender everything and realize that your true nature is
out of a shape-shifter this impermanence brings with it good
news and bad news the bad news is that everything
good that you gain in life will be lost but
the good news is is that everything bad that befalls
you will also be lost and will not be permanent
which means that this is your safety valve see God
created a safety valve into every life and that safety
valve is death so if you're trapped in life and
you're suffering terribly and all this and there's no way
to escape it at all well the consolation is that
it won't last it's impermanent but of course the flip
side of that is if you're bored it's some beautiful
life you're bored to be a billionaire with a golden
spoon in your mouth and you live in the best
part of the world and everything is is perfect for
you well that too won't last one comes with the
other it's two sides the same coin and that's a
very important consequence I want you to to remember here
this will help you when you're in very difficult times
remember that hell and suffering cannot be a permanent state
all suffering must be temporary because it's limited all suffering
is finite you cannot get stuck in unconsciousness forever eventually
all beings must wake up and return to God and
to awaken to themselves as God and this is the
safety valve is God's love and mercy that's the intelligence
of God's design of the entire universe is that this
safety valve has been built in the only problem is
is that you're terrified of this safety valve you've labeled
the safety valve the greatest evil that's the irony of
it you've labeled God's infinite intelligence and and love and
mercy as the greatest evil precisely because your mind is
limited and can't see the full infinite perspective of the
design you're to self biased you're too attached to see
it and spirituality is about detaching yourself enough gaining enough
elevation and transcending enough self bias to be able to
see it and it's this which saves you it's this
which makes life beautiful and allows you to appreciate how
amazing life is without this life starts to seem evil
and terrible and depressing and pointless and cruel what we're
talking about here in other terms is attachment attachment creates
suffering and disappointment and what the Buddha taught was how
to transcend attachment and to liberate yourself but of course
not only did the Buddha teach this but every great
sage and mystic all around the world from Christ to
Mahavira to the Jews and the Yogi's in India all
of them taught this to transcend suffering you need to
realize that nothing in life should be clung to your
key mistake is that you have mistaken yourself for a
human being that's not what you really are that's a
false identity your true identity is that of an infinite
shape-shifter so what you need to do if you want
to live the good life is to realize and take
back your identity as an infinite shapeshifter see when a
shapeshifter clings to one shape or one form it suffers
precisely because it's untrue to its identity to what it
is see you're like a TV screen that got stuck
on one image and that's why you suffer and the
point of our work here is to get you unstuck
to get you to surrender your human identity to realize
that your human identity it's there but it's temporary it
will be lost you cannot preserve it no matter how
much you want to so you have to let it
go and one thing you should have noticed already in
your life as evidence of what I'm saying is that
your identity has not been constant throughout your life your
identity has always been changing in a sense you've already
died too many times in your life if you're 30
years old right now if you're 40 50 60 think
back compared to what you are I mean compare what
you were when you were ten years old to who
you are now totally different some stuff seems similar but
you can't even remember how different you used to be
we trick ourselves our mind tricks us to to convince
us that well I didn't really change I was the
same my whole life no you changed enormously even if
you didn't do self-improvement work even if you didn't do
spiritual work you still changed so much that it's hard
to even call you the same person your body has
changed every cell in your body has has died and
been reborn in this time multiple times this happens to
you at least once or twice a decade all of
you of all the cells in your body reincarnate we
might say your belief system has changed your career has
probably changed your likes and dislikes have probably changed see
you're constantly going through this process because you're shape shifter
and that process will continue and then of course it'll
get more and more radical over time as well especially
if you do this work so while your temporary human
identity can be lost and it will be lost it
must be lost your identity as a shapeshifter as an
infinite shapeshifter that can never be lost that's the only
permanent thing there is impermanence impermanence shape-shifting these are just
synonyms for the same thing as an infinite shape-shifter you
are immortal but you have to really it's not enough
to hear me say this you can't just take it
on as a belief you have to actually become an
infinite shapeshifter that's what Awakening is about and I want
to read you a quote here about shape-shifting from Xena
Shrek she says quote shape-shifting requires the ability to transcend
your attachments in particular your ego attachments to identity and
who you are if you can get over your attachment
to labeling yourself and your cherishing of your identity you
can be virtually anybody you can slip in and out
of different shells even different animal forms and dating forms
and quote and that's exactly how it works now you
might wonder but Leo isn't impermanence versus permanence its self
a duality so it seems like you're setting up a
new duality in this episode between these two and of
course you're right because as I've told you before in
my three-part series about understanding duality I told you that
language is inherently dualistic the only way I can speak
to you or communicate to you or even think is
by creating dualities so of course when I'm communicating I
must distinguish between permanence versus impermanence and this is valuable
this is how we learn but also you need to
be able to read between the lines go meta and
to transcend this and look at the thing that my
finger is pointing at not just look at my finger
so yes even though I'm talking about the difference between
permanence versus impermanence ultimately you have to recognize that these
are gonna come together and they're gonna go full circle
and they're actually gonna be identical so here's the paradox
of it on the one hand we have Maya samsara
or the world of form as the Hindus and Buddhists
refer to it this is the relative domain of all
the humans stuff that we do this is all impermanent
on the other hand we have the Godhead emptiness nothingness
formlessness Nirvana this is the permanent true self we might
say this is the thing you think that we're gonna
move you towards as you're doing this work in your
Awakening and your liberating yourself right go here this is
supposedly but true enlightenment is when you realize that these
two things are really identical Maya and samsara is Nirvana
form is formlessness and that's what the highest Buddhist and
Hindu teachings teach you is precisely that but that takes
not just one awakening to realize that takes multiple awakenings
because in your first awakening what you're gonna realize is
the distinction between Maya and Nirvana between form and formlessness
your first awakenings will be you moving out of form
into formlessness and that's gonna be a huge epiphany for
you because for the first time you'll discover that not
everything is form there is something beyond form formlessness the
Godhead and that will be amazing but they're still gonna
be a duality between the two in your mind and
you're still not gonna be fully awake until you awaken
even deeper and you realize that ah but this formlessness
what is this distinction between formlessness and form ah that
also is a relative imaginary construction which must also collapse
and then you have the full unification to the point
where you realize that Nirvana is not someplace that I
go to to escape this this place here but you
realize that this place here is Nirvana and has been
Nirvana in the whole time and that God is not
somewhere out there far away from the mundane world but
that God is the mundane world this is God right
here I can't reach God because God is everywhere already
that's total oneness so really in this work you're realizing
oneness at more deeper and deeper or higher and higher
levels however you want to look at it now another
thing that I've commonly accused of when I talk about
these kinds of ideas as well Leigha aren't you just
stealing ideas from Buddhism and then pretending like you're saying
something profound but really this Leo this is just Buddhism
the Buddha already said this you're just copying you have
to be careful here because not everything boils down to
Buddhism Buddhism is just one way to frame things and
Buddhism nor the Buddha had a monopoly on the truth
the Buddha was not the first awoken person in the
world nor the best nor the most get the silly
idea out of your mind before the Buddhists there were
Hindus and before the Hindus there were others so you
know the Hindus also like to say that all of
alio this is just all Hinduism you're just copying advisor
or something no I'm not copying anybody per se of
course I do read and take ideas from different places
sure and there's a lot to be gained from Buddhism
and from Hindus and so forth but don't get don't
get caught on these traditions long before there was Buddhists
and where Hinduism mankind has known about this stuff all
cultures have basically derived this independently in one fashion or
another for themselves in South America and North America in
Africa they knew about this stuff the aboriginals in Australia
they know about this stuff because they've been using psychedelics
for for tens of thousands of years and they've been
doing spiritual practices and they've been meditating and they've been
contemplating and they've been doing darkroom retreats and going into
caves and doing spiritual quests and vision quests and doing
this and starving themselves and going through all sorts of
ascetic practices doing this stuff this truth is not of
human origin see so it's not that one tradition is
copying another tradition it's that we're all really kind of
deriving it independently for ourselves I knew every generation derives
it anew and it has to be this way it
can't be a tradition truth can't be a tradition truth
must be derived right now from the present moment in
the same way when you're doing a mathematical proof for
example when you're you know you're doing the Pythagorean theorem
proof and you're like reasoning through it and you're trying
to see like well like a squared plus B squared
equals C squared why is that because there's like set
you can kind of draw a little squares and you
can add them all up and see that they're the
same when you're doing that every new generation of humans
who does that they have to reason through it for
themselves they can't just take Pythagoras as word you can't
just go into a book from 2,000 years ago you
know dig up some dusty Pythagorean book or read what
Pythagoras wrote and just say okay I agree with pythagoras
pythagoras invented this by the way Pythagoras did not admit
the Pythagorean theorem it existed long before him the ancient
Egyptians and so forth they knew about this stuff the
Babylonians and the Sumerians and so forth they knew about
all this stuff the Pythagorean theorem so you know it's
funny that even the Pythagorean theorem it's not really the
work of the original work of Pythagoras so so don't
get don't get too clingy and attach to various kinds
of traditions and so forth it's just you know the
whole point of truth is that it's totally democratic anybody
can access it at any time and in fact you
must you must access it for yourself as though for
the first time as though you're the first human who's
ever accessed it that's the only way that you can
access the deepest stuff that I talked about because it's
right here right now it's not found in the words
of humans it's not found in books right here right
now is where you find it that's how truth works
you're pulling from the same source right it's sort of
like if you go to Egypt and you ask them
does the Sun exist they'll say yes and if you
go to Japan and you ask them does this one
exist they'll say yes and if you go to Africa
they'll also say yes why is that is it because
the Egyptians invented the Sun no because the Sun is
universal to every creature living on this planet and so
they all recognize the Sun because it's so obvious so
that's exactly how impermanence works if you just observe reality
for a little bit even as a child you realize
oh yeah everything's changing all the time pretty obvious not
rocket science here so now let's talk about what you
can do about impermanence how do you apply this wisdom
it's not good enough for you just to know about
impermanence intellectually you must deeply observe impermanence and practice in
your own life otherwise nothing I say here will really
stick it will just go in one ear and out
the other and that's basically true of everything I say
and teacher train your mind that everything fades observe how
you cling and how this clinging to permanence try to
freeze reality how this causes suffering for you you need
to actually observe yourself doing this at a micro level
also observe how others cling and the kind of calamities
and suffering that this causes observe how people on the
television cling up preserve how politicians cling to their power
observe how wealthy millionaires and celebrities cling to their fame
into their wealth and how this ends up actually leading
to their downfall and gradually surrender more and more attachments
this is the process that will take you years to
do it's not something you accomplish in a week so
here are some of your action steps write some of
this down do not leave this as an abstraction you
must start to observe impermanence every single day you must
practice it like meditation so here's your homework assignment for
the next week you're gonna observe impermanence every single day
at a micro level at a micro level you're gonna
notice how everything is changing all the time your experiences
what you're feeling in your body right now maybe you
have an itch on your face and then in five
minutes it's gone right now maybe you feel comfortable sitting
here and then five minutes you start to feel uncomfortable
notice that maybe you're scared you're in fear right now
because of something someone said to you notice that and
notice that in an hour later your fear is gone
and now you have anger and then you have anger
for 15 minutes and the anger goes away now you
feel horny and then you feel horny for 15 minutes
you jerk off and now you're not horny anymore and
you're satisfied and you're meditating or doing something else notice
this at a very granular micro level and notice yourself
wanting to cling to a state like you're having some
pleasure you want to keep that pleasure for as long
as possible well let that go like when you're eating
some food notice the food it tastes really good but
then also let it go rather than trying to get
more and more of that food like you you take
a few bites of ice cream and then just let
it go rather than having to eat the entire [
__ ] carton try to enjoy the impermanence savor in
it bask in the impermanence notice that like yeah now
this ice cream tastes good but also it's good to
just let it go and to not have that ice
cream in my mouth that also is good and then
notice that difference between the two and how that actually
makes the ice cream what it is makes it better
see do this very mindfully with a lot of precision
and awareness and it would help for you to have
some sort of meditation practice in order to be able
to do this and as you do this notice how
you start to appreciate little things more little things that
come up for you you start to now appreciate whereas
normally your default tendency would be to try to like
structure your entire day in order to cling to some
sort of source of pleasure or stimulation or excitement or
something like that whereas here now you're not structuring your
day to get some sort of big juicy payoff like
a hit of heroin in your veins it's not that
now you structure your day more loosey-goosey and you're just
you're you're more spontaneous and you're just willing to go
and roll with the punches of the day the ups
and downs you're able to sort of enjoy the positives
and negatives you're able to enjoy the peaks and the
exciting moments and also the quiet moments you get a
wristband like this stick it on your wrist like this
and this will be your reminder for the next week
every time you notice this with your eye it catches
your eye remember to pause for a few seconds and
to remember that you're doing this exercise of trying to
notice the impermanence and you should start to notice that
it as you do this more every moment becomes more
precious and more special and this is the essence of
true happiness this is what true happiness is not the
kind of chasing of pleasure that you typically do and
this is the essence of spirituality notice the spirituality is
the opposite of wishful thinking the way that people commonly
misconceive spirituality is being you know there's this myth in
popular culture that all spiritual people are just the ones
who are brainwashed they're the ones who are like those
hippie New Agers who just want to be positive about
everything you know they want to engage in positive thinking
they want to fill their mind with fantasies about how
they're gonna you know live forever and all this but
it's exactly the opposite true spirituality is facing the brutal
nature confronting a soirée confronting impermanence and training yourself to
notice it and to let it go and to roll
with the flow that's true spirituality in fact it's the
scientifically minded people who are wishful thinkers who don't want
to face the truth for example somebody like Ray Kurzweil
who has this ridiculous idea this fantasy alien of this
technological singularity where in the next 50 years we will
build computers and Ray Kurzweil will just be able to
plug in his brain and upload himself into a computer
in live forever this is this is an absurd fantasy
that he has he will never attain immortality in this
way the irony is that immortality is right here right
now if only he would give up on that [
__ ] technological fantasy of his and start practicing spirituality
see so it's exactly the opposite of what many skeptics
and atheists and scientists think they are the ones who
are living in fantasy land you're never gonna achieve any
kind of technological immortality because technology is form all form
is impermanent this is fundamental to the very structure of
existence and the sooner you can realize that the better
not as a Dogma I'm not telling you to accept
this as an ideological tenet of your worldview I'm saying
got to become consciousness directly consciousness and then you'll really
be able to appreciate what life is all right that's
it I'm done for this one please click that like
button for me and come check out actualize that org
that is my website I do have a website that
has additional free exclusive content on it so do use
that resource some people you know they they only watch
me on YouTube and they never even bother to click
on the website you'll find my blog there where I
post exclusive content and insights you can find the book
lists there you can find my life purpose course there
you can find the actualized forum there where you can
ask questions and chat with people who are into this
work which is pretty rare most of your friends aren't
doing this work and the final thing I'll say here
to wrap it all up is this sometimes people fall
into this trap of thinking like well Leo isn't all
this philosophy you're just wasting a bunch of time talking
about philosophy how is this gonna help my life but
your very desire to skip over philosophy to manipulate your
life to get a little bit of pleasure and happiness
and money and whatever else you want sex and so
forth that very tendency is the very problem you see
of why your life is not as good as it
could be what your life is lacking is depth depth
you're living life at such a shallow level one of
the most important things I'm doing with my work is
I'm trying to introduce you to the depth of life
and that's something that you don't see in most places
on YouTube other websites even within the self-help industry rarely
do you see people teachers and so forth introducing you
to the full depth of what life is life is
a very very deep thing it's amazing it's infinitely deep
it's also infinitely wide so that's what we're trying to
show you with this work at times it will seem
like it's just philosophy it's just abstraction zand ideas and
it can't possibly change anything and it doesn't have any
real-world consequences well that's because you're not doing the work
and also because you're not patient enough it takes patience
depth and breadth takes patience it might take you a
few years of listening to this stuff just to start
to realize the significance of what's really being said and
you haven't even maybe convinced yourself yet to even start
to do the homework yet to do the practices you're
not even there yet it'll take you a few years
just to get there then you start maybe to in
the practices because you realize that all maybe there's something
here and then you do that and then you start
to see the payoff a few years later from that
and then you know it builds it all builds it
snowballs this is the sort of a slow burn process
is not a sprint this is a marathon that we're
running here together and I've told you this from the
very beginning if you've been following me for five years
or even more than I've been releasing this content you
know this was the intent from the very beginning I
knew from the very beginning of releasing my first video
that there was so much stuff that I wanted to
put out there so many profound topics and ideas but
it's taken years literally it's taken over five years to
build myself up to the point where I could share
this stuff at the the level and quality that I'm
satisfied with now and still there's there's much that I
haven't shared with you I'm only able to share maybe
five or 10% of everything that I want to share
with you because it's just too much it's too much
it's too much work to organize all this stuff it
it hurts my brain to talk about all this stuff
so much you know it's too much to explain and
it's it's too much for you to process and to
take in you're gonna have to literally work on this
content for years watch my videos for years in order
to get the full juice of what's here but this
is the best way to move not waste but use
of your time if you're concerned about wasting your time
what you should be concerned about is all the other
stuff you're doing in your life when you're not listening
to this depth of content compare the depth of content
and conversations that we have together through these videos with
everything else that's happening in your life I guarantee you
nothing else is gonna be as deep as this not
your time with your family or your friends or at
work or the books you read or the YouTube videos
you watch nothing is gonna be this deep see and
this is exactly what you need you need to be
questioning reality at deeper levels you need to be asking
deep questions about yourself your life your environment about society
about politics about religion about government about science nobody is
asking the deep questions it's amazing nobody's doing it why
not because it's not popular it's not marketable it usually
doesn't earn people lots of money doing this stuff I
could hurt a lot more money by doing shallow stuff
you know I I have had the idea of just
like quitting actualize that org and starting a video game
channel cuz you know I could earn a lot more
money and frankly my life would be a lot easier
my job would be a lot easier if I don't
have to research all this [ __ ] every single
week you know carefully organize all this stuff and instead
just like play [ __ ] minecraft 40 hours a
week put that [ __ ] on Twitter or whatever
or stream it on YouTube and earn millions of dollars
I could have done that from the very beginning but
of course again we're playing a much longer deeper game
here than just that we're interested in getting to the
very bottom of reality exploring its full depth and breadth
and who else is doing that but us is TV
mainstream news doing it is science doing it is religion
doing it no they're not doing it they're focused on
a very little narrow sliver of reality even all the
spiritual schools they're focused on this much of reality compared
to everything that there is see so don't worry about
wasting your time here this is one of the most
valuable uses of your time there can be but it'll
take time for this for this apple tree to start
to bear fruit you're just planting a seed you know
the tree needs to grow for a few years then
the fruits will start to grow and it'll start to
fall down they will shower upon you don't let your
friends and family and and other naysayers convince you that
somehow watching this content and spending time thinking about this
this is a waste of time it's exactly the opposite
of that they're the ones the ones who are accusing
you of wasting your time are the ones who are
wasting their time asking deep questions about life is the
best use of one's time in life what so are
you gonna do you got a better idea if you
have a better idea of what you can be doing
with your life instead of watching and thinking about this
material please post it in the comments down below I'd
love to hear your suggestions you
