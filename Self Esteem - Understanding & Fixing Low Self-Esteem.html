hey this is Leo for actualize org and in this
video I'm going to talk about self-esteem alrighty let's break
into this topic of self-esteem self-esteem is a very rich
and deep topic and it affects the quality and the
success that you have in your life and also the
happiness level that you achieve in your life and a
lot of the information I bring to you here is
coming from Nathaniel Brandon's amazing seminal work on self-esteem which
is called the six pillars of self-esteem we're going to
go into some definitions of what self-esteem is we're going
to define it we're going to talk about some of
the influences on self-esteem why you might have low self-esteem
and how you might start to go about correcting it
and we're actually going to go in and break down
and look at each of the six pillars that Nathaniel
Branden talks about it's a very rich topic so I
encourage you to buy the book if you want to
really know a lot more this is going to be
kind of an introductory segment where I really tell you
why self-esteem is important and what you should be doing
with it all right so what is self-esteem let's take
a technical definition and really it's a two parter definition
and I'm going to read this off this is how
Nathaniel Branden states it self-esteem is the disposition to experience
oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of
life and as being worthy of happiness let me read
that again it's the disposition to experience oneself as competent
to cope with the basic challenges of life and as
worthy of happiness I mean this is a really powerful
powerful definition and it's got two components to it as
you can see the first component is called self-efficacy self-efficacy
is basically your ability to think for yourself and to
direct your own life how confident do you feel that
you can create a good life for yourself how confident
do you feel that you can take care of yourself
and handle the things that need to be handled so
that's one big part of self-esteem where do you rank
yourself on that ask yourself on a scale of one
to ten would you say you have low self-efficacy that
would mean a one or do you have a very
high self-efficacy that would be a 10 high self-efficacy means
that you think you can go out there and create
the kind of life that you want you're not a
victim you can do whatever you want you feel like
you have the power you feel that yes there are
tough situations in life but no matter what happens ultimately
you can sort it out you know if you've got
a bad relationship you can sort that out or find
a new relationship if you've got a bad job you
can figure that part out in your life or you
can go find a new job if you've got trouble
with your health or with anything else with your education
anything you feel that ultimately you have control you are
the master of your own life when it comes down
to it if you're at that kind of level then
you're at a 10 and if you're at the opposite
end of that spectrum then you feel like you can't
do anything in life you feel like you're a victim
you feel like the world is is hemming you in
that basically your hands are tied behind your back you
feel like you're crippled you feel like that the world
is out to get you that it's against you and
that society is structured to hold you back that is
low low low self-efficacy so that's the first part the
second part of low self-esteem is self-respect how much do
you respect yourself do you believe that you have value
inherently as a human being as you are right now
do you believe that you have a right to be
happy do you believe that you deserve to be happy
do you believe that people in relationships deserve to you
know must treat you well and that you deserve to
be treated well and that you don't deserve to settle
for anything in life you don't need to suffer on
behalf of anyone you don't need to endure situations you
don't need to be miserable you don't need to be
a victim you deserve to be calm it you just
have to be happy to serve to be strong you
deserve everything that you want where do you rank yourself
on that let's put a scale on that as well
on a scale of one to ten if you're at
a 1 that means you have no self respect that
means basically you don't value your own happiness and you
are a doormat you let other people walk all over
you and because you do do that people gladly come
in there and they victimize you and they take advantage
of you because you're a doormat on the other hand
if you have very high self-respect then what do you
believe you believe that you are valuable you believe that
you are the most valuable thing in life because this
is your life and you are the center of it
so you're the most valuable thing you have an absolute
right to be happy and that you don't need to
go and change yourself for the people you can be
happy right now as you are and you deserve everything
that you want that would be a 10 so rank
yourself there so basically we've got these two components self
efficacy and self-respect ideally you want to be a TENS
on both of these there's no reason you should be
anything less than a 10 right you want full self
efficacy full control over your life or at least the
feeling of control and you want full self respect right
deserving happiness having inherent value self esteem is nothing external
this is an important point to make self esteem is
every is has everything to do with the internals your
mind sets who you think you are your beliefs your
self-image your subconscious mind that's where the SEL the self
esteem is coming from that's where its operating this is
not about people this is not about life this is
not about external circumstances it's not about your boss or
the wife that nags you or the husband that abuses
you it's not about that self esteem is here it's
inside this is all what I call inner game right
this is your psychology at play so you got to
really ask yourself where are you on these scales and
if you're watching a video about self-esteem then I can
probably assume that you're somewhere low on this right a
size of a sieve person is confident assertive life is
going relatively well for them even if there's trouble they
confident that they can go and fix it it's the
lowest self-esteem person that really runs into problems because if
you're ones if you're at a 1 and a 1
on both of these scales then it's going to be
very hard for you to live an extraordinary life in
fact your life is gonna be very very miserable because
you feel like your hands are tied behind your back
so you feel like you can't change anything and then
you also feel like you don't deserve to be happy
so this is the kind of situation that will lead
to abuse this is the kind of situation that will
lead to a very miserable type of life a very
dysfunctional type of life dysfunctional relationships perhaps drug abuse various
negative addictions that hold you back basically everything that draw
that robs you of your dreams and your potential so
it's very important to first of all recognize where are
you on these scales go ahead and write down your
numbers and after you figure out where you are on
these two scales if you're low and by low I
would say if you're at a 4 or below so
for a 3 a 2 or a 1 if you
rank yourself 4 or below then you got to tell
yourself that ok I got a self-esteem issue I got
low self esteem and therefore you know this is not
the end of the world I'm not to blame don't
blame yourself for it don't get discouraged don't get disheartened
this is just being honest this is being introspective write
this this is an honest evaluation of where you're at
right now now you recognize that you've got some work
to do you got to have a you gotta you
gotta want to fix this problem so first to fix
the problem you got to recognize you even have one
so this is good that we've quantified it now you
know where you're at if you're above a 4 let's
say you're at a a 5 6 or 7 you're
doing pretty good that's probably average and so there you
would you know if you want to you could work
on it or you could keep doing what you're doing
maybe you have other priorities other issues you want worry
about and if you're at a 8 a 9 or
a 10 well you're doing awesome then you've got no
problems at all and you probably maybe or maybe a
little a little bit I've got too much self-esteem maybe
that self-esteem is causing you some problems maybe a little
bit too arrogant a little bit too self sure of
yourself and that's getting you in from so it could
even play it out like that but generally high self-esteem
awesome if you don't go totally overboard and you don't
abuse it so now for the low self-esteem people the
first thing you got to realize is that what we're
talking about with these numbers this is a general level
of self-esteem right so this is not mmm this is
not one particular moment where you felt a crippled or
where you felt like you had no control this is
not one particular moment where you felt like you shouldn't
be happy I mean you're going to have ups and
downs throughout your days and throughout your weeks so that's
okay it's a it's an average what we're taking here
is maybe like a weekly or a monthly average of
your self-esteem don't expect it to always be perfect it's
never going to be always at a 10 even someone
who is at a 10 level of self-esteem on average
he or she is going to have days where they're
feeling like they can't do anything they're feeling like a
victim or they're gonna have parts of their life where
they feel like they don't have control or where they
don't feel like they can be satisfied and that's okay
what we're doing here is we're kind of taking an
average right we're getting just a general scope of where
you're at so let's talk a little bit about some
of the causes of low self-esteem so we know now
what self-esteem is it's got these two components what are
some of the causes well most self-esteem issues are self-image
issues right the self-image and I've got other videos that
talk specifically about self-image and subconscious mind and ego you
might want to check each one of those out but
self-image here just to quickly recap that's basically an internal
model of who you think you are this is who
you think you are this is who you think you
should be how you should behave what your values are
how you see other people as perceiving you what you
perceive your strengths and your weaknesses as all this is
these are all beliefs and a lot of this self-image
is completely unconscious its operating within you in your mind
deep down in there and you probably don't realize even
a little sliver of everything that's in that self image
and that self image could be negative that self image
can be limiting you in many many ways one of
the ways it could be limiting you is that it's
creating some sort of belief about who you inherently are
and this is where I think most self-esteem issues come
from is negative images and beliefs about who you think
you are so maybe you feel like you're not smart
like you're an inherently stupid unintelligent person maybe you feel
like you're not attractive physically or in other ways you
feel like you're not attractive to the opposite sex maybe
you feel like you're clumsy you're a clumsy person maybe
you feel like you're bad with money maybe you feel
like you're bad in relationships maybe you feel like you're
very shy maybe you feel like there's something else wrong
with you or just a general sense that there's something
wrong with you maybe you feel like you're unlovable maybe
you feel that you're not perfect the way that you
are right now maybe you feel like you don't deserve
happiness maybe you feel like you have to work really
hard to acquire love and to acquire happiness hey maybe
you feel like you're bad with money so all of
these could be potential limiting beliefs that you have somewhere
in your self-image and usually where these come from is
is childhood as a child growing up from about the
age of 3 to the age of 12 well you're
very impressionable and a lot of times if you grew
up in a family situation it's not very stable and
stuff happened you might have had just a you know
stray situations that came in there and bit left a
really big negative impression so maybe someone told you that
you were fat when you were a kid maybe someone
told you that you were ugly maybe someone told you
that your going to be a failure you're not going
to mount to anything maybe someone told you that they
don't love you and nobody ever will love you maybe
a parent told you this maybe someone at school told
you this may be a bully told you this a
sibling whoever and somehow you now have this programming running
in the back of your mind and it is causing
you to feel unconfident it's causing you to feel like
you don't have control in life it's causing you to
feel like you don't deserve what other people deserve and
you see other people out there and they're being happy
and they're being very confident and go out there taking
action but you feel like you're crippled because you've got
one of these kind of emotional scars operating deep down
inside of you so I mean this is a really
deep issue and I can't get into all of it
here you can get therapy for that kind of stuff
you can get coaching for that kind of stuff I
coach people around that you can also do your own
personal development to start to iron those things out and
I have many other videos that cover those those types
of techniques more in-depth so you'll want to search for
those in this video I'm just going to say that
a lot of your self-esteem issues are rooted in your
childhood or some other traumatic events so if you've never
sat down you might want to just sit down and
do little bit of journaling and kind of look back
at your life if you have low self-esteem look back
at your life and just see what are some of
the incidents that could have caused that it's important to
go back there and to start to dig around a
little bit because it's going to give you more awareness
more understanding about what is really going on it's going
to help separate you from it because right now if
you've got low self-esteem you're very attached to it you
feel like it's really you it couldn't be otherwise well
you know what that's self-image it's a it's very malleable
you can totally change it that's the nice thing about
all this is that with enough personal development work an
introspection and therapy and coaching or whatever other techniques you
use books seminars you know however you want to do
it you can work through all that stuff and you
can get yourself back into a high level self-esteem this
stuff is all changeable so we're not we're not pegging
you at any place we're saying this is where you
are now do a bit of work and you can
be at ten all right so I think the best
way to fix self-esteem personally that I found is through
deep inner work being very honest looking very deeply into
your past really cycle analyzing yourself and then action going
out there and starting to take action is starting to
correct this stuff because once you understand what the problems
are then you also start to get a sense of
what the solutions are and what the actions are the
a to take to start to correct that and there
are many books out there that will help you to
figure out exactly works as well all right so enough
of that that's how to fix it what I want
to cover before I leave is I want to cover
the six pillars of self-esteem themselves as Nathaniel Branden talks
about them in the book and he literally has mountains
of words to say about each one here I'm just
going to kind of gloss over them so what are
the six pillars of self-esteem and you can actually follow
these to start to build yourself up and you can
also rank yourself on each one of these pillars just
to see where exactly is your low self-esteem focused in
which of these pillars so number one is you've got
the first pillar the first pillar is the practice of
living consciously are you living your life consciously are you
aware are you mindful of the behaviors and the thoughts
that you're having if you're not then you're gonna have
low self-esteem if you are you're going to have high
self-esteem the second pillar is the practice of self-acceptance do
you or do you not accept yourself as you are
or do you always criticize and judge yourself and tell
yourself you have to be better and smarter and prettier
and all these other types of things or can you
just accept yourself and be happy with who you are
that greatly affects your self-esteem level the third pillar is
the practice of self responsibility do you actually take responsibility
for your life not just the good parts but the
bad parts too right this is a two-way street you
can't just take responsibility for the good stuff you got
to take the responsibility for the bad stuff to the
stuff that you think is hurting you the most the
place where you feel like you're a victim are you
willing to take responsibility for it because if you're not
you're going to stay stuck a victim and you're going
to have low self-esteem so self responsibility is so critical
the fourth pillar is the practice of self assertiveness how
assertive are you how assertive are you especially around other
people how assertive argue with your own values your own
principles your own your own philosophy your own goals do
you feel like this is something that's important that it's
worth fighting for that you have to go out there
and fight for even in the face of resistance from
others well it's really important to build up your assertiveness
that also built up your confidence and that it's going
to build up your self-esteem the next pillar pillar number
five is the pillar of living purposefully so do you
have a purpose in your life do you have something
that your life is about something that's important something that's
greater than just yourself do you have a life purpose
I have so many videos that talk about life purpose
I think this is one of the most important ideas
in all personal development to be happy to be confident
to be peaceful in your life and to be successful
to you need to have a sense of purpose that's
pillar number five and the final pillar pillar number six
is personal integrity do you have personal integrity what that
means is do you live up to your own expectations
of yourself or are you always faltering are you always
being lazy are you failing to execute on the things
you know you need to execute are you keeping your
own promises to yourself or are you living in line
with your own highest values if you're not your self-esteem
is going to be shot and if you are your
self-esteem is going to go through the roof alright so
those are the six pillars of self esteem you can
take a look at each one of those and see
where you're where you're lacking and then you can create
a program for yourself to focus on it and to
start to work your way out if you need help
