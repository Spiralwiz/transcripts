hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about what is karma you
harm yourself as dust thrown against the wind comes back
to the thrower that is one of my favorite quotes
from the Buddha and this quote gives us a really
good hint and a clue as to what karma actually
is karma is a concept that comes to us from
the east really it's popular in the Buddhist traditions it's
also popular than Indian yogi traditions so this dates back
thousands of thousands of years to really the dawn of
civilization in the east and Karm itself is a Sanskrit
word I'm going to tell you what it means here
in a second but before I do that what what
I notice is that I noticed that people here in
the West when they use this concept don't really understand
the subtlety of it and they use it in really
ham handed kind of way so what I want to
do here is I want to I want to put
the nuance and the subtlety back in the concept of
Karma in the West the way we use Karma and
the way we think about is kind of like this
we think of it as a universal law of justice
so that if somebody goes for example and robs a
bank which we consider an evil act so they go
rob a bank and then let's say the police don't
catch him and he gets away with it then what
we tend to think is that well karma is going
to get him in the end and by that what
we mean is that at some point later in his
life eventually the laws of justice will kind of even
themselves out just naturally because something bad will happen to
that person somehow he deserves it now that he's going
to get some other punishment for it so maybe five
years later somebody will steal a car from him or
maybe five years later something bad will happen some other
aspect of his life and we'll say haha karma got
ya because you did something evil in your past but
this is really not how karma works and this is
kind of like a cartoon character version of how karma
works so I want to give you the more accurate
nuanced way in which karma works and this is going
to apply directly to your life so it's not just
about bank robbers and murderers this is going to apply
to everything that's happening to you right now and it's
going to explain a lot of why you suffer in
your life and you're not getting the results that you
want in your life so this is worth understanding basically
as the Buddha was saying every action that you take
in life has a certain consequence to it and bad
actions have natural bad consequences and these bad consequences they
don't have to come from the outside the worst of
them come from the inside so the word Karma itself
it's a Sanskrit word it's an ancient word what does
it actually mean karma actually means action karma equals action
if you take away only one thing from this video
let it be this karma equals action now when you
think about this you might wonder well action what does
this have to do with justice and equality that we
take karma to mean well think about it like this
that your actions and everyone else's actions in life including
the actions of governments and societies and organizations the actions
of animals and also just the natural actions of life
universe flowing the actions of gravity and all the other
natural forces that we have these are all potentially actions
and every action has a consequence to it so it's
basically the law of cause and effect every effect has
a cause and life itself is just this giant interplay
of actions we can take the moment that you're born
and we could take and stretch it out to the
point that you're going to die and everything in between
and we consider we can consider that to be a
series of actions and these series of actions basically one
leads naturally to the next so the actions you took
earlier on will lead to certain consequences down the road
as just a natural consequence of the way that life
works so recognizing this and applying it specifically to your
life what this basically means is that if you take
good action you will get good consequences if you take
bad or evil action you'll get bad or evil consequences
now all this seems fairly straightforward but what most people
don't understand is what actually good and bad mean here
it's very different than you might think and I'm going
to get to that in a second the other thing
that people tend to think about the law of karma
is they tend to think that this is some sort
of supernatural law like there's some sort of old man
with a beard sitting up in the clouds keeping tabs
on everybody keeping an account of who did how much
good or bad stuff and then trying to even everything
out for everybody but that's a really not the way
I think this law is supposed to work this law
is a natural law this law is a psychological law
where really gets interesting is the psychology of it it's
so profound and then the way that explains how human
psychology works and it's also a spiritual law and the
spiritual part of it is understood when you really start
to understand what the Eastern sages mean by good and
bad by good and evil and here's what it means
and it's not at all what we tend to think
here in the West good means selfless these are actions
that come not from your ego but from your spiritual
nature bad means selfish you can also say that these
are evil evil is not an objective thing out there
there's no devil sitting somewhere who's going to turn you
into into someone evil what evil is is something actually
very mundane and very simple and this is where it
applies directly to your life all this applies directly to
your life evil is doing things from your ego doing
things from your identity or from yourself and now this
this one concept right here goes so deep that I
want to shoot a lot more videos on it because
it's going to be necessary especially if you're interested in
enlightenment work which I'll be shooting a video on soon
spiritual alignment that is but what this means selfish acts
what do we mean by selfish acts this is this
is such an interesting concept to unravel so of course
we mean the most obvious selfish acts I mean when
we think selfish the common example that comes to mind
for example is going to Thanksgiving dinner and you if
you're sitting there you eat all the food yourself you
take on the best food for yourself you don't give
it to anybody else you don't share any of the
food and the other people are left hungry at the
table clearly that's very dickish and selfish we also going
to think a selfish act might be taking some candy
from a baby like that would be clearly selfish and
clearly evil and wrong and that leads to bad consequences
now what are the bad consequences here it's interesting because
we didn't to think that the worst consequences come from
punishment from the outside so for example if you steal
candy from a baby the baby is going to cry
or if you steal candy from a baby other people
will think bad of you or if you take all
the food at the Thanksgiving Day table some people might
get mad at you and start a fight with you
so those would be bad external consequences and if you
take some action like robbing a bank then clearly going
to jail would be you know really bad consequence but
actually the law of karma isn't concerned with that what
the law of karma is more concerned about is what's
going on in here in your mind and this is
the really most damaging part of the whole thing you
might think that robbing a bank the worst part of
it is that you get potentially sent to jail but
no what's happening here is the Buddha was saying is
that the dust comes back after you throw the dust
it comes back in your face and so what's going
on here is that immediately as soon as you take
the bad selfish action what happens is that you already
suffer the consequence even if you don't get caught even
if nobody sees you even if the baby doesn't start
crying right it already damages you on the inside and
why does this happen and more importantly you have to
recognize how damaging this damage is on the inside you
tend to think and say oh well you know a
little white lie here or a little bit of getting
angry at someone here or doing a little bit of
you know something here isn't going to cause too much
damage to me on the inside as long as I
can avoid external consequences but actually no see what we're
talking about here and what the Easterners we're talking about
is that the the caring through the cycle of selfishness
that your entire life basically is right when your actions
come from yourself promoting yourself defending yourself fighting on behalf
of yourself these are all selfish actions and what we
mean by this is you right when I'm pointing my
finger right now at you that's what I mean by
selfish I don't just mean when you take candy from
a baby but I mean any actions which defend promote
or a grand eyes you the self your identity not
just some part of you but all of you so
whatever your name is you could say your name in
your mind right now that's what I mean by you
now any action which promotes or defends that that's a
selfish action and that's an evil action and now this
is a difficult pill for many of us to swallow
especially if you carry the ramifications of this through your
entire life because if you do what you discover is
that oh my god my entire life has been about
me it's been very selfish and self-absorbed and there's a
lot of examples that I want to give you here
because it's not just black and white like oh well
below I never robbed a bank I never murdered somebody
I never took candy from a baby and I never
did anything bad at the Thanksgiving Day table but see
those are really easy black and white examples and it's
easy to point at those and say hi that person
is bad because he did something clearly wrong but see
there's a much more subtle element to evil that lurks
in your life and you're doing it every single day
what you have to realize is that today just today
you already committed many many evil acts and karma is
getting you because of this the way karma gets you
is something like this so let's say that this bank
robber he robs a bank and he gets away with
it and let's say he goes to some tropical island
and now he's chilling on the island he's just live
in there now you might say well he got away
with it maybe karma will get him five years later
by something going wrong with him but no karma already
got him see because in his mind this is a
selfish person the act originated from selfishness it's not like
the person just did something evil and that was an
isolated example know what's happening here is that actually his
selfish nature is causing this person to do evil acts
now why isn't it his a nature selfish well because
he's unconscious he doesn't really understand what he's doing with
his actions in life so as you get more conscious
you realize that you unwittingly commit evil and evil is
promotion and defending of yourself so in this case because
this person was imagining how great of his life could
become if he robbed a bank and had millions of
dollars so he wouldn't pee he did this evil act
to promote himself right to secure himself at the cost
of others that's an evil action that's a very clearly
evil action just from a societal standpoint because we have
laws against that stuff but then there's a lot of
evil actions that we take that we don't have laws
against but nevertheless it gets you in the way it
gets you like for example with this person you might
say well he got away with it now he's sitting
on the beach sipping pina coladas his life is great
but actually that's not the case at all see the
kind of person that went out and robbed a bank
that that's not like an isolated example this person is
coming up with these actions because he screwed up on
the inside because he's unconscious on the inside and so
you have a chain of this and so what we
mean by karma is this perpetuating chain of selfishness and
the punishment is not jail or someone yelling at you
or a fine that you get the punishment is suffering
the emotional suffering and distress that this person experiences in
life because even though he got away from from this
bank in the back of his mind this person he's
always going to be afraid now he's only going to
be looking over his shoulder are they gonna catch me
tomorrow maybe they won't but see he's going to suffer
for that he's also probably gonna feel some sort of
remorse or guilt he's also probably going to feel out
of integrity with himself because he's not following his own
principles he knows that robbing a bank is not right
but he did it anyways because he knew that it
would make him feel good but see he didn't calculate
the suffering that would come after the fact and of
course you might say well Leo he can suppress that
stuff and what he's not going to feel guilty about
it and that's true you can suppress that stuff but
still it seeps out right you can't suppress it forever
and you can't suppress it in all them in all
the ways that it's going to come back and get
you and the way in which it gets you is
the fact that well just by the fact that he
did something selfish here something so obviously selfish this is
going to create a habit of selfish behavior so now
even though let's say he says I'm never going to
rob a bank again and he never does okay that's
fine but the selfishness is still going to be within
him and the point the problem here is that he's
not recognizing that he's doing selfish stuff he's not admitting
it to himself and so this is where a lot
of the harm comes from so now he's got all
this money and he might go do something else selfish
he might be selfish in his relationships with his girlfriend
and that relationship might go sour because of that and
so he might have a string of bad relationships throughout
his whole life because he's being selfish there he's not
recognizing it and then maybe he goes and he does
something else maybe he goes party with his friends and
then there they have a fight because they're not able
to agree on something and so he has a fight
with his friends and his whole life is very turbulent
and there's a lot of suffering because he's not able
to get along with his friends or his girlfriend or
his potential life or other aspects of his life he
feels now that he needs pleasure from this money that
he's got what if the money runs out how's it
going to feel then so the selfishness just keeps from
Pech waiting itself in the end if you want to
stop this cycle what you have to do is you
have to apply conscious awareness to see that what you're
doing is selfish and this is not easy to do
it's easier to do in very black-and-white cases but it's
hard to do in more subtle cases which brings us
to the point of view because we've been talking about
this extreme example but what about you right now see
the fact is is that you commit evil selfish actions
all the time and an example of this might be
for example the way that you get jealous towards people
maybe it's not even something that you verbalize maybe it's
something that is just in your mind a thought that
you have the thought itself can be an evil action
you actually need to go do something evil so maybe
at work you're a little resentful and jealous because one
of your co-workers is better than you at some of
the tasks there and he's likely to receive the next
promotion or maybe you find out that one of your
coworkers earn a little bit more than you and so
you get you get mad you get jealous about that
maybe on your drive to work you get upset at
somebody and cutting you off on your way there or
maybe you get mad at your girlfriend or your wife
or your husband or maybe you criticize people all the
time just in your head maybe you don't even say
it but you just criticize people you see someone who
looks funny and you judge them criticize them you see
someone doing something stupid you judge them and criticize them
or maybe what you do is you manipulate people in
subtle ways maybe in your relationship with your friends you
try to manipulate them and you play a little power
games and you try to be the one that's the
best in your fruits circle of friends or maybe with
your girlfriend or with your boyfriend you try to manipulate
them in very subtle ways that you don't even admit
to yourself as manipulation but you do you do this
manipulation and why are you doing this you're doing this
because in the end at the very core of it
is that you're afraid and you need to protect yourself
right remember we're talking about you that identity you the
ego well the you feels like it needs to live
life protecting itself all the time this has been the
case for you from the moment that you were born
up to right now and it will likely be the
case until you die is that you'll be living this
self survival mode all the time where it's always about
self protection and self aggrandizement so it's how do I
make myself a little bit more money so I can
feel a bit more comfortable more secure how do I
find myself that husband or wife that can make me
feel a bit more secure how do I get that
house or that card it's going to make me feel
a little bit more secure how do I get that
better career promotion would that improvement in my business so
I can feel a little bit more better and secure
about myself how can I improve the way I look
the way I dress the way my teeth look the
way my hair looks how can I improve all that
so that I'm a little bit more secure see it's
always about making yourself a little bit more you're and
that's why whenever anything comes into your life that threatens
this security then you get afraid you get angry you
get manipulative you get critical all these negative things start
to come out and you suffer because of that this
is a very deep truth but it's something I'm going
to cover in my spiritual alignment video but the problem
at the very centre of all this this karma stuff
is that there's this identity that thinks that it needs
to be protected the you the you and fundamentally this
identity is false it's really an illusion it's a it's
created out of thought and concepts it's not part of
actual physical reality and so because of this your entire
life is basically a this giant drama of trying to
protect an illusion which always feels insecure because at the
center of it it's Hollow there's nothing solid there it's
completely Hollow and so because of this you have your
perpetual cycle of a suffering in life and that one
thing that we tend to think about life is that
well life is pretty hard life is challenging life is
difficult life is full of negative emotions and life is
full of drama and it's full of pain and this
is just how life is well what's interesting is that
that's not actually true life is that way for 99.9%
of people because they're behaving selfishly all the time and
karma is always nipping at their heels that's why that
is the punishment for karma is suffering on the inside
it's not external punishments although you know those can be
bad too but it's the inner punishments that you get
so for example when you get a little bit jealous
at that co-worker of yours what's the internal punishment the
coworker might not even ever find out that you got
jealous at them but the internal punishment is that your
mood is soured now you feel passive-aggressive towards him maybe
on your drive to work because you're thinking about how
angry you are at him you cut somebody off or
you come home and you snap at your wife or
your husband or you snap at your kids or maybe
you perform at work because instead of focusing on your
work what you're doing is you're thinking about this these
colleague of yours who's doing better than you and getting
paid better than you and you're jealous of it see
it undermines you and because you're behaving in the selfish
way see what's happening there's it you're trying to protect
yourself is like Oh meaning II mean why is it
why isn't it me who's in the position that that
employee has why isn't it me why is it him
and so because of this you're so focused on yourself
that your whole life becomes the cycle of being focused
on yourself when you're focused on yourself all the time
then what happens you might think that well Leo what's
wrong with focusing on myself this is how I survive
life is kind of a dog-eat-dog world I got to
survive don't I well the problem is that you don't
need to actually put so much attendance into your survival
when you put so much attention and effort into your
survival you become blinded unconscious to the way that this
survival cycle is actually damaged in your life and it
damages your life it makes you unable to have a
peaceful calm happy life you're not able to be happy
because you're always looking over your shoulder you're always afraid
of what's going to happen to you you're always afraid
that this hollow illusion that you're defending is somehow going
to be found out by somebody else and so you're
afraid of it and you're protecting yourself and you're putting
more and more layers over this illusion so it feels
a little bit more real but that's a battle that
you can never win and in fact not only are
the bad actions that you're doing and bad thoughts that
you're having contributing to this cycle but even some of
the stuff that you would think is good so it's
pretty obvious to you probably that when you get angry
at somebody that's probably hurting you psychologically on the inside
and when you try to manipulate people or when you
criticize people but even good stuff so for example have
you ever contributed to charity or have you ever given
a couple of dollars to a bum on the street
but the reason that you did that is not because
you were doing an honestly selfless act but instead what
you're doing is you were masking this selfishness in a
veneer of selflessness so what does that actually mean well
you go do some charity because it makes you feel
good or because it gives you a good reputation or
you give that bum some money on the side of
the street because if you didn't give it to him
you would feel awkward on the inside and so because
you don't want to feel awkward again you're protecting that
that self that you you don't want to feel awkward
or you don't want to be a person who doesn't
give to charity because you don't like those associations what
you do is you give to charity but you give
it kind of reluctantly you don't really give it selflessly
you actually give it selfishly and in your mind you
tell yourself on doing good I'm doing good I'm doing
good and see when you say that oh I'm doing
good look at me look at how good I am
even if you don't tell anyone you just give someone
a dollar on the street you don't tell anyone about
it on the inside you tell yours of all I'm
a good human being well what you're doing there is
you're building up this this ego of yours you're building
it up and make no mistake about it that when
you do that you're going to suffer for it because
of this ego now you have to carry that around
with you wherever you go every interaction you're in when
you go into your into your marriage that ego is
going to be there and guess what it's going to
be that inflated ego that you got from giving that
that person on the street a dollar and feeling good
about yourself for it patting yourself on the back and
then that creates problems more and more problems and just
creates this cycle of karma and so there you have
it the real punishment for all is is basically hell
in the West we have a Christian notion of Hell
which is Hell somewhere out there another life but actually
that notion is not what hell literally means that notion
of Hell where did it come from it came from
the actual hill which is here for you right now
you have the hell you're living in hell right now
hell on earth that's what your life is it's a
life where you're unable to actually have true happiness and
peace of mind you don't have true peace of mind
because you're always stressed and anxious all the time you're
always secretly angry at someone bitter at someone trying to
manipulate some circumstance wherever it is in your life you're
always trying to do that in whole life is that
this concept goes very very deep and it's very very
subtle because you don't like hearing this stuff you don't
like admitting this stuff because the only way that it
actually is effective is when it's not admitted so it
takes a lot of mindfulness work a lot of what
I call enlightenment or stuff like meditation to start to
see how you suddenly manipulate everything around you in order
to promote and protect yourself and this is what we
call evil selfless selfish action selfless action on the other
hand if you want to know what that is that
is just action without thought that's what true spirituality is
it's action without thought why is it action without thought
because thought contrary to what we think in the West
here thought is a problem because your thoughts create the
notion of you they create the identity the false identity
that's constructed out of thoughts so the only way to
get rid of that is to get rid of the
thoughts when you silence the thoughts you can still have
practical everyday thoughts so if you need to go buy
some gas or you need to figure out how to
get to the grocery store those are okay but we're
talking about here thoughts about you right the self-absorbed thoughts
that permeate and predominate your entire existence so how many
times for example just today just during the span of
today how many times did you think negatively about yourself
or about what someone's going to do to you or
how something is going to threaten you or harm you
how many times has that thought into your mind just
today if you're self honest it's probably a dozen times
at least if not more like 50 or a hundred
times so you have to become more and more mindful
of this because your punishment is hell and make no
mistake about it right now you're living in a hell
and what's bad about is that you don't even recognize
many of you don't even recognize that this hell is
here for you right now that you're living in it
you're always afraid that hell is going to be out
there somewhere for you know hell for use right now
you're not able to be happy and the other punishment
that you get is kind of the opposite side of
that coin is that because you're in hell all the
time you're not able to experience paradise paradise heaven what
is paradise in heaven again that's not something up in
the clouds somewhere after you die it can be here
for you right now heaven is the state of being
spiritual the state of having no thoughts and the state
of selflessness when you get rid of the sense of
self that you have when you unravel that whole thing
which is basically what all in light network is leading
towards then what you discover is that you can actually
have true happiness right here right now regardless of external
circumstances and you can also have paradise for yourself right
here true peace of mind because you're not caught up
in this karmic cycle and so that's what the Buddha
is really talking about and that's what the eastern Yogi's
talk about with karma is that you perpetuate your own
suffering in your own hell here on earth 99.999% of
people do this and if you want to turn this
around then you have to start to just become aware
simply aware of what's really going on here how this
karma is working because it can always hold work in
your favor if you start to dissolve the self and
you start to behave from a selfless place then you
get this positive karma building up and then you can
experience paradise so it's really that simple but you have
to see how nuances you have to see how deep
this rabbit hole goes we could talk about this for
hours hours and hours and hours and all the subtle
ways in which you manipulate yourself to perpetuate your Nega
negative karma cycle but that's it for now for here
I'll cover it more in other videos all right this
is Leo I'm signing off go ahead post me your
comments down below I'd love to hear what you think

to master yourself your own psychology how to understand yourself
at extremely deep levels if you want a really fulfilling
life you have to do this work this is not
just going to happen spontaneously for you and what I've
also discovered is that it's difficult to do this work
it's not just enough to hear it once or twice
what you really have to do is you have to
keep on track with it and part of the mission
of actualize that org is not only to introduce these
concepts to you which I'm doing in these videos but
also to how these videos kind of guide you and
keep you on track when you get off track because
what happens a lot of times you you get unconscious
for a couple weeks a couple days a couple months
maybe a couple of years right and then something clicks
and you're like all I need to get back on
track and you get back on track but see if
you have nothing holding you on track then a lot
of times you can wander off those at a time
