hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm gonna tell you how to become rich okay
welcome back let's crack into this topic of how to
become rich there's so many ideas that I can share
with you here but I'm gonna stick to something focused
I want to focus on something and I'm gonna give
you some wisdom here not a gimmick not a get-rich-quick
gimmick I'm gonna give you some wisdom all right so
if you really want to get rich do you really
want to get rich okay if you do here's what
you got to do you have to become a creator
I want you to be a creator in your life
you have to be creating something of value in order
to become rich unless you plan to rob a bank
then you're not gonna become a rich any other way
so what does it mean to be a creator and
are you a creator right now this is important question
and of course the question goes even deeper into how
much of a creator are you and what the hell
are you creating with your time and your energy and
your money people who are poor are really not creators
what they do is they sell themselves out to an
employer who then uses their services and you do work
for the employer and you get paid X amount of
dollars per hour per month per year whatever the term
is and therefore sure you could be creating stuff at
your work I'm not saying there's a there's there's anything
wrong with that but you're not creating that much you
should be creating more to become rich you really need
to create a lot and you need to control the
creation this is critical you need to control the creation
because right now for your boss you probably are creating
stuff maybe you're creating reports if you're writing things maybe
you're doing graphic design maybe you're creating engineering schematics or
you're providing some sort of organization work as a secretary
whatever you're creating right you're creating those reports and organization
and maybe you're managing people but you're not owning it
the company owns it the boss owns it you're working
for somebody it's really really hard to become very wealthy
rich working for somebody else why because they control the
creation and they control the value and they put a
glass ceiling basically on how much you can be earning
and how much value even you can be generating for
them because you might right now be stuck in a
position where you are actually wanting to create more you
want to create more value for the company you want
to do more for it for that project you want
to do more for your boss and this is very
frustrating because that boss or that company might actually not
want you to be doing more they might not be
listening to your ideas they might not be hearing you
out maybe you have a brilliant idea right now that
will earn millions of dollars for your company but you're
just in a position where you can't really exercise any
any creative control you have no power authority to get
that idea pass through and realize so that that value
will never be generated it will never be realized and
you will then never see the payoff from that so
just a general formula for how to earn money I
talked about this other videos I think this is an
idea I got from Jim Rohn but somewhere I got
this idea I think other people talked about it -
it's basically wealth is value so the more value you
can generate for the world and other people the more
wealth you will generate for yourself it comes back to
you this is a very tried-and-true principle so what you
got to do is got to position yourself to create
more value in the world what does that mean I
mean for you it might mean put out more put
out more novels put out more writing put out more
blog posts put out more you know more engineering schematics
if you're engineer put out more computer code if you're
if you're a computer programmer but you have to be
smart about this that doesn't mean work harder in your
job in fact I think that that can be a
dangerous trap to fall into is to think that if
only I just work harder at my current job that
I will become rich actually probably not I mean you
might get promotions and sir jobs offer so much room
for growth that you actually could become very rich just
working in your company and kind of working your way
up the corporate ladder but that doesn t pretty rare
I actually find that the best way to come rich
is to start owning the start owning the creation to
do that you generally have to either become partner shareholder
stakeholder in some way or you have to start your
own business I really recommend the last option starting your
own business but don't let that discourage you from generating
wealth for yourself even in your current job so I'm
not saying quit your job today or you're never gonna
be wealthy I'm just saying think down the road I
mean be smart about this if you recognize that right
now you're not able to have the kind of creative
output that you want you're not able to create massive
value then start to think what can you do to
change that and one of the things might be to
start looking for either a new job where you can
really express yourself share your gifts more or create your
own job create your own business right start fleshing out
those ideas so this idea of being a creator you
have to be creating something create something what does this
really mean well for most of you there are two
things here one is put yourself in a position where
you actually can be fully expressive the next point is
that for many of you you probably are not creating
anything in your life right now at all like many
of you could be going to just a nine-to-five job
where you're doing some piddly type work for an organization
whose values you don't really believe in whose mission you
don't believe in whose products you don't believe in you
don't really care about you're not putting any passion into
it and if you're in that position then I do
not consider you a creator even if you're creating stuff
for the company you're not really a creator a creator
of someone who has vision someone who puts their blood
and sweat into their work they take their work very
personally and they care not about the paycheck and they
care about not company loyalty or making sure they don't
upset their boss or something silly like that what they
care about is creating something beautiful and excellent for Humanity
for the world they want to put stuff out that's
all the creative cares about a creator this is not
some magical unicorn type of person right this is not
some mystical fairytale creature a creator is just someone who
has really put a lot of value on this some
people have this come about more or less naturally through
the way they're raised other people maybe like you right
now do not see themselves a creator but you can
refashion yourself into a creator and when you do Wow
you're gonna have some amazing things happen first thing that's
going to happen is that you're gonna actually enjoy what
you're doing at work the next thing that's gonna happen
is that you're just going to get like excited waking
up in the morning you're gonna have so much more
Drive and passion and people are gonna see that off
you the next thing is going to do is that
it's actually gonna position you to be extremely rich you
can't get rich by doing ordinary work not really I
mean if you're extremely lucky maybe you can but you
can't really get rich in this world by doing the
mediocre work you have to do extraordinary work you have
to be exceptional as Seth Godin puts it you have
to be creating purple cows you have to be creating
things projects or services that are like wow that's remarkable
it has to be remarkable so what are you doing
what are you creating that's remarkable if you're not creating
anything remarkable then you're never gonna be rich so that
is the bottom line okay a couple of other points
I kind of beat this creator one to death next
point I'm going to say is that a lot of
you probably right now are saying yes I want to
be a creator leo like I this is actually something
that I've been really passionate about I've wanted to be
creator my whole life I've been thinking about it but
I'm just stuck I'm stuck things are not letting me
be a creator my parents they're holding me back my
friends they're holding me back my boss he's holding me
back my company is holding me back people don't see
my potential people don't see what I can do for
them my money situation is holding me back I don't
have enough capital I don't have enough capital to start
a business I don't have enough money to take some
time off to define my life purpose or to to
look for a new job I don't have that luxury
all right here's the deal this is the biggest thing
actually even bigger than being a creator that is holding
you back from being rich you're not rich because you're
blaming other people you're not taking responsibility for your life
and the circumstances that you're in you're not doing it
and what's even worse is that you're gonna deny that
you're a victim that you're making yourself a victim you're
gonna deny this you're gonna blame me for telling you
and accusing you of being a victim and you're gonna
say to yourself but no these are real problems that
I have in my life this is tangible I don't
have money my mom is really holding me back my
dad is really holding me back my spouse is really
holding me back my boss he's a total jerk total
has no vision doesn't see the my potential you're gonna
say that all that is true for you that's true
for you and that I am wrong I'm not wrong
I am right and you are wrong right now you
are putting yourself in such a victim position that you
are not even realizing what you're doing and here's what's
gonna happen is that you can either be a victim
and stay a victim in your life and keep getting
the kind of results that you've been getting or you
can open your mind up and accept these new ideas
and let your ego get bruised by the fact that
you are sabotaging your own life and start to make
the hard change that you've got to take to start
to get a transformation in this case becoming rich your
boss he's not really holding you back what's holding you
back is your thought that your boss is holding you
back your parents they're not really holding you back what's
holding you back is your thought that your parents are
holding you back it's the assumptions that you have it's
the assumptions that you have about what you need to
move forward I don't have enough money how can I
move forward my parents they're so negative and controlling and
dominating in the way they raised me how can I
possibly move forward my health my health is bad I
don't feel good maybe I have some illness how can
I possibly now move forward from that I mean these
are these are real physical tangible things my boss he
really won't let me get promoted he doesn't want to
hear my ideas how can I get past that I
hear what you're saying and I know exactly how it
feels because I feel this way at times and I've
definitely been there but this is the biggest thing that
is holding you back from creating wealth from being rich
and really getting success in any area of your life
it's holding you back so much because what you're doing
is you're giving your power away to all these external
circumstances you're being mesmerized by your external circumstances check out
another video I have where I talk about internal versus
versus external circumstances and inner and outerworld where I really
hammer at this distinction and how important it is what's
happening right now is that you're limiting your options because
you think that you're stuck and you've got these assumptions
but really what you're doing is you're thinking inside a
very small confined little box the little box is keeping
you where you're at just keeping you kind of comfortable
but also very frustrated what you've got to do is
you've got to expand that idea you got to expand
it and the way to do that is to say
okay from now on no more bitching no more complaining
no more negative thinking no more finger-pointing I am responsible
100% for my whole life for everything I mean everything
that happens to you I don't just mean when you
cut somebody off on your way to work because you're
so rushed and then that person flicks you off you're
not just responsible for that you're obviously responsible for that
I mean you're responsible everything you are responsible for your
boss being an and not listening to you you are
responsible for your parents having a negative impact on your
life and holding you back you are responsible for where
you're living you're responsible for how much you're earning you're
responsible for your health you're responsible for everything everything you
don't want to hear this I know you don't it's
very threatening to your ego you know what's also awesome
though what's awesome is that when you accept this what
this means is that you have complete power to change
everything in your life and that my friends is true
that is very true and that is what you were
denying yourself because when you create this victim mentality when
you cast yourself as a victim what that means is
that you can stay a victim and there's a psychological
payoff that you get from being a victim which is
whoa on to me I'm a victim I can't do
anything I don't have to go out there and work
my ass off to change when you accept responsibility for
everything all the sudden the whole world opens up to
you everything is possible everything is possible and now you
see opportunities and you see things that you can do
and you see also the really scary thing and this
is why you do not want to take responsibility for
your life you see the scary thing which is so
scary that the reason that you're not more successful is
because of you it's because of you it's because you're
afraid of your own potential that is the real truth
of why you won't take responsibility for your life is
you are afraid of what it will take of you
to work to live into your full potential so we've
got a little deep there but this is basically what
you need to do to get rich this is some
wisdom all right some of these concepts are a little
bit abstract you might have been were looking for a
way to earn some quick cash that's not what I'm
giving it here and that's not going to really be
helpful to you this is much more helpful but you
need to have the long term vision to see how
this connects and how this can really transform your life
if you start applying this stuff you start applying it
all right really think about this start by taking full
responsibility right now don't pass the buck on to anyone
else the buck stops with you all right this is
