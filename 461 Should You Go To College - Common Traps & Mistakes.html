            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yVU2kOlXJ0E' target='_blank'>Should You Go To College - Common Traps & Mistakes</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the importance of the college decision</b>: The decision to attend college is a significant one, affecting individuals' life trajectories. College is beneficial for those planning a conventional career track requiring formal education; however, for those seeking non-traditional career paths, alternatives exist. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's personal journey and qualifications</b>: Leo Gura shares his academic journey, having completed a four-year degree in philosophy, studied aerospace engineering, and completed five career changes. His experiences in game design, online marketing, and self-help fields uniquely equip him to guide others in their career choices.
</li><li><b>College for conventional careers</b>: If a student's future career aligns with traditional educational paths (e.g., academic, scientist, doctor, engineer), college education is necessary. However, for those uncertain of their future career, time should be spent gaining clarity about life goals before committing to college.
</li><li><b>Importance of clarity and reflection</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for introspection, goal clarity, and active decision-making. Proactive planning can prevent wasting precious years following non-fulfilling paths. If students know their life goals, they should tailor their educational choices to prepare for their desired careers. 
</li><li><b>Addressing misconceptions about college</b>: Society often programs individuals to believe that attending college is the inevitable next step after high school. Leo advocates for critical thinking about whether college aligns with one's life goals, opposing the casual following of societal norms without adequate consideration.
</li><li><b>The value of independent thinking and self-actualization</b>: Focusing on developing self-awareness at a young age (between 18 and 20) can lead to significant advantages. The importance of self-actualization and personal development during this critical period is emphasized as foundation for future life success. The need for independent thinking in choosing life paths is highlighted.
</li><li><b>Recommendations for those unsure about their career paths</b>: Leo suggests that those who are unsure about what they want to do use their time for introspection and contemplation instead of blindly following the herd. Choosing one's life path should be a proactive process, involving trial and error and personal reflection. Wasting precious years following paths that end in dead ends should be avoided. 
</li><li><b>Significance of the college deciding years</b>: This period between 15 and 25 is foundational, determining the trajectory of one's life. It is crucial to utilize this time in the most productive way possible, rather than squandering it on fleeting pleasures and activities. 
</li><li><b>Clarity as the key to decision-making</b>: If one has clarity about their life goals, decisions about college and course selection become easy. Clear life goals should guide an individual's academic and career choices, avoiding time wasted on incompatible paths. 
</li><li><b>The value of experience for decision-making</b>: Gaining experience is key to gaining clarity about one's wants and needs. However, this requires proactivity and personal responsibility, as it is easy to follow the path of least resistance and be guided by external influences. 
</li><li><b>The case against unconscious decision-making</b>: Making decisions unconsciously or out of habit is unproductive and can waste precious time. It is essential to be proactive and conscious in decision-making, investing time and energy in building a solid foundation for one's life.
</li><li><b>Clarity in life's purpose</b>: An important factor in one's life decisions is having clear goals. Being unsure about your life goals can lead to unproductive actions and decisions. This is a process that takes time, contemplation, and experience.
</li><li><b>Understanding oneself deeply</b>: It is essential to know your unique strengths, weaknesses, passions, and talent. Knowing yourself allows you to align your life and career with who you are as an individual.
</li><li><b>Importance of passion in career</b>: Choosing a career merely because it's profitable but not aligned with your passion can lead to unfulfillment over time. A deeply passionate career not only provides personal satisfaction but also has the potential to yield higher financial returns in the long run.
</li><li><b>Practical career choices and university studies</b>: If you know what you want in life, university is a good fit, especially for careers like law or engineering, where specific training is essential. However, if considering less tangible majors like English or philosophy, you must have a clear long-term plan for income post-graduation. 
</li><li><b>Financial Independence</b>: A solid plan to make a living after graduation is vital to breaking away from reliance on parents and becoming financially independent, which is key to personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of wage slavery</b>: Without a clear career plan, there's a risk of ending up in low-paying, unfulfilling jobs. This likely won't utilize your unique talents and potential. Therefore, a clear, well-thought-out plan for your career is advisable to avoid wage slavery. 
</li><li><b>The power of early and practical life decisions</b>: Taking this critical phase of life seriously and early on sets a significant foundation for the rest of your life. Tailoring a career and life according to unique passions and strengths marks the beginning of lifelong learning and proactive pursuit of success.
</li><li><b>Importance of Financial Independence</b>: Leo emphasizes that earning money serves the purpose of securing one's freedom to pursue one's passions and live according to personal strengths and values. He warns about the trap of wage slavery and advises being proactive in planning one's career or business strategy to avoid this. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Personal Experience with Wage Slavery</b>: Leo recounts his unpleasant experience as a wage slave for a year, leading him to quit his promising career to become his own boss. His experience underlines how difficult it is to break free from wage slavery once entrapped, highlighting the importance of planning early to avoid it altogether. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Business for Survival</b>: Underlining the significance of business, Leo defines it as an activity critical for human survival within the global social matrix. He stresses that business is not merely about making money, but a means of procuring essential commodities, like food and electricity, necessary for survival and comfortable living. By mastering business, one can gain financial independence and survive on their terms. 
</li><li><b>Choice of Majors in University</b>: Leo discusses the spectrum of majors in university, particularly 'hard majors' like engineering or physics that have a clear career path, and 'soft majors' that traditionally have less direct career opportunities post graduation. He advises viewers to have a tangible plan irrespective of what they major in. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Personal Experience with Majors</b>: Leo recounts his own journey of how he switched from aerospace engineering, which he initially chose due to his interest in space travel, to game design, which wasn't a traditional career path. Upon realizing an engineering job primarily involves desk work, he decided to cut his losses, admitting his mistake, and switching to game design because he found it more in alignment with his interests and passion. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Decision Making and Planning</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of making informed decisions early on and formulating a solid career plan to avoid falling into wage slavery. He uses his own journey as an example to encourage young viewers to consider their major choices in university carefully and to adapt their plan if they realize it's not right for them.
</li><li><b>Initial College Experience</b>: Leo Gura switched from studying engineering to a lighter course load in philosophy, which he was more passionate about. Concurrently, he worked on teaching himself game design skills and building a portfolio to secure employment after graduation.
</li><li><b>Working in the Game Design Industry</b>: After graduating early, Leo got hired by a top game design studio and worked on Bioshock Infinite. Despite finding success in this industry, he was dissatisfied being a wage slave and decided to leave his job.
</li><li><b>Transitioning into Business and Self Help</b>: Leo chose to explore new pathways for financial independence. He taught himself web development and online marketing over several years, which allowed him to start his online platform actualized.org. He also got certified as a life coach and coached clients during this period.
</li><li><b>Wandering to Find One's Path</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of persistence in figuring out life's direction. He spent about ten years trying different things to discover his passion and advocates this approach to others. In his view, defaulting to an ill-fitting job out of inertia robs people of their potential and prevents them from providing valuable services that generate financial rewards.
</li><li><b>Evaluating the Reality Versus Fantasy of Job Roles</b>: Leo stresses the need to differentiate between the imagined and actual aspects of job roles. Engaging in activities related to aspirational jobs facilitates a more realistic understanding of whether the job aligns with one's passion.
</li><li><b>Financial Cost and Debt Associated with College Education</b>: The primary problem Leo identifies with going to college is the financial cost and resulting debt. Such a financial burden drives graduates into wage slavery, hindering their freedom. Countries that offer free education or even stipends to students have a distinct advantage.
</li><li><b>Opportunity Cost of College Education</b>: Leo's second problem with college is the significant opportunity cost involved. He criticizes the impractical knowledge gained through many courses that do not necessarily equip students with the skills needed for their future careers. Leo believes that most universities fall short in providing high-quality education and primarily offers indoctrination instead.
</li><li><b>Universities' effectiveness in teaching valuable life skills</b>: Universities often focus on teaching theory rather than practical life skills. Even subjects such as English that seem universally useful can be taught in a way that doesn't readily apply to business or other practical areas. The possible opportunity costs for spending four years learning a major that won't be used in real life can be financially significant. Universities are geared towards creating academics, but most students will not become academics or scholars.
</li><li><b>Effects of lack of education</b>: Lack of education can lead to the rise of dangerous social and political atmospheres, such as nationalism, fascism, authoritarianism, and the propagation of conspiracy theories. Going to university instills intellectual honesty, integrity, and helps individuals differentiate high-quality sources from low-quality ones. The majority of people who subscribe to extremist ideologies often do not possess a university education.
</li><li><b>Insufficiency of university education system</b>: University education systems often do not offer enough of the right kind of education, leaving out practical skills like psychology, deep existential understanding of reality, and practical life skills. Universities teach within a standardized curriculum, preventing them from effectively equipping individuals with the skills to succeed outside academia.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-education</b>: The presenter suggests that the topics and skills he teaches through his platform, actualize.org, are the sort of elements that should be included in a well-rounded university education. The shortfall in effectively teaching the right kind of practical and existential skills in universities underscores the need for self-education and personal growth beyond formal education.
</li><li><b>Academic limitations of universities</b>: Despite selecting a major that interests you, universities may prevent students from studying deeply specialized or personal-interest topics due to proven curriculums and strict schedules.
</li><li><b>Student autonomy and self-discipline</b>: Success in self-education and learning depends on a student's ambition, self-driven attitude, and capacity for self-discipline. If one is independent and highly motivated, university education might not be necessary.
</li><li><b>Value of degrees and grades</b>: Degrees, majors, and grades are often irrelevant in real life. What matters is the ability to offer value to the world through skills and knowledge that truly help people.
</li><li><b>Workability of a university degree</b>: Education obtained in a university can offer a well-rounded understanding and may be beneficial for individuals who do not know how to educate themselves but its usefulness largely depends on the student's investment in personal growth.
</li><li><b>Socialization and personal development at university</b>: University education provides an environment for socializing, developing relationship-building skills, and experiencing different aspects of life. However, an excessive focus on either academic progression or socialization could lead to lost opportunities in other areas.
</li><li><b>Individual ambition and ability</b>: The effectiveness and value of university education largely depend on individual ambition, self-motivation, self-discipline, and the ability of an individual to navigate and learn from life.
</li><li><b>Acquiring practical skills</b>: Valuable practical skills can often be acquired more effectively outside universities and depend on individual efforts and self-propelled projects. The system's bureaucratic nature limits the depth of understanding across subjects and curbs individual creativity.
</li><li><b>Potential for deep personal and career development outside university</b>: There exists a large scope for personal evolution and thorough understanding of subjects outside formal education with enough individual will and motivation. Self-education can lead to a more in-depth understanding than formal academic learning in universities. It requires individuals to be motivated, disciplined, and ambitious.
</li><li><b>Overemphasis on academic accomplishments</b>: Universities can create an illusion that academic recognition through degrees or grades matter when, in reality, their value is insignificant. What is valuable is the degree to which an individual can apply their knowledge and skills to offer real value to the world around them.
</li><li><b>University education being a 'meat grinder' system</b>: It systematically processes students and can confine individuals to a standardized mode of understanding a field, limiting deeper or different understanding. This could restrict highly ambitious and independent thinkers, but may be apt for those who lack self-discipline and need a structured educational plan. 
</li><li><b>Interplay of ambition, motivation, and discipline</b>: An individual's ambition, motivation, and ability to discipline themselves play a crucial role in deciding whether a university education fits their unique learning and career paths.
</li><li><b>Questions of Value vs. Individual interest and ambition</b>: The value added by universities is significantly dependent on the degree of students' interests and personal ambitions. It may deliver greater benefits to those whose ambition levels, spatial thinking, and degree of interest align with the standard pedagogical methods deployed in colleges. 
</li><li><b>Benefits of university education are not exhaustive</b>: While universities do offer a well-rounded education and social skills, they not necessarily equip one with comprehensive life skills or deep understanding across subjects. The benefits depend on the degree of investment students are willing to make in their personal growth concurrently with their formal education.
</li><li><b>Balancing Social life and career focus</b>: It is beneficial to balance socialization with career focus during university years. However, leaning too much towards either can result in lost opportunities in the neglected field. Hence, a happy medium between professional development and social skills needs to be maintained for a fulfilling university education.
</li><li><b>Alternative Pathways</b>: The self-reliant, inquiry-led routes offer the potential of a deeper, more effective, and personally tailored education, especially suited for highly motivated, independent, and creative thinkers. However, this route places a strong emphasis on self-discipline and motivation. 
</li><li><b>Skills acquisition beyond structured learning</b>: Real skills are mostly learned outside universities, either at a personal level or through professional experiences, driven by your projects and direct field interactions.
</li><li><b>The illusion of Degree relevance</b>: University degrees are a means to an end and not an end in themselves. They do not guarantee skills or values but are seen as an enabler to obtain real-world experiences. The relevance of a degree is directly proportionate to its ability to enable the acquisition of practical skills through real-life applications.
</li><li><b>Benefits of College</b>: Attending college can be beneficial for socialization and if individuals have a clear career path like engineering or medicine. 
</li><li><b>Alternative to College</b>: The alternative to college is a serious commitment to self-education, creating one's own curriculum based on passion and interest. Self-education can be more efficient and practical, especially when it involves project-based learning.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Education</b>: Developing marketable skills through personal projects or freelancing jobs is more valuable in landing a job than having a degree. Leo Gura credits his financial independence and success to the skills he learned through his own projects.
</li><li><b>Project-based Learning</b>: Working on personal projects and facing real-world challenges in developing these projects are the best ways to learn. These projects should be small but polished and can be used as a portfolio to impress potential employers.
</li><li><b>Internet as a Self-Education Resource</b>: Nowadays, there are many resources available on the internet for self-education, such as online courses, tutorials, videos, workshops, seminars, training programs, and conferences. These resources are often more affordable and provide better value than traditional university education.
</li><li><b>Attending Conferences</b>: Attending professional conferences provides opportunities to network and potentially land job opportunities. When Leo was trying to become a game designer, he attended the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco where he made valuable connections. 
</li><li><b>Financial Investment in Self-Education</b>: Investing in one's own education through buying books, or enrolling in online courses, workshops, or seminars, is a worthwhile long-term investment that can pay for itself many times over throughout one's life. Even if the cost initially seems high, the acquired knowledge and skills will yield returns.
</li><li><b>Making important connections at professional conferences</b>: Leo accentuates the value of attending professional conferences for networking, acquiring industry insights, and even job opportunities. He shares his personal experience of attending the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where he made significant connections that almost led him to land a job in game design. He underlines the worth of these conferences, despite their potentially high costs.
</li><li><b>Modeling successful individuals</b>: Leo introduces the concept of modeling, whereby one seeks out individuals successful in their desired field, interviews them, and breaks down their routines and habits in an attempt to replicate their success. This involves questioning their daily activities, work habits, how they allocate time, what books they read, and more. 
</li><li><b>Importance of self-discipline in self-education</b>: Leo warns of the challenges of self-education, chiefly requiring strong discipline and passion. Self-education provides no structure or schedule, and it's easy to procrastinate or become apathetic, which can lead to wasted time and little progress. If self-regulation is not a strength, he suggests attending a university for its provided structure.
</li><li><b>Key skills to develop for success</b>: Leo compiles a list of important skills people should focus on developing for a fulfilling life, most of which are not typically taught in universities. These include business, sales, marketing, self-help, personal development, psychology, emotional mastery, dating, relationships, sexuality, language, writing, speaking, history, spirituality, philosophy, epistemology, existential comprehension, awareness, consciousness, and mindfulness. Acquiring these skills requires diligent self-education.
</li><li><b>Convincing parents about the merit of self-education</b>: For those considering the path of self-education, Leo suggests convincing parents by demonstrating seriousness and dedication, regularly working towards goals, and showing a tangible plan for financial survival and skill development outside the university system. He notes that self-education may actually require more effort than attending university but can yield greater payoffs. 
</li><li><b>Importance of taking personal responsibility</b>: Leo asserts the importance of making individual decisions regarding life choices, not relying on the advice of others, and having a clear vision of future goals. He emphasizes that life-essential decisions about career paths, skills to learn, and whether to go to university or not should solely rely on the individual's assessment of their life trajectory.
</li><li><b>Addressing parental concerns</b>: Leo Gura suggests that a practical way to alleviate parental concerns about choices regarding unconventional majors or paths is to develop a tangible survival plan. Parents are typically concerned about survival and financial stability, which leads them to guide their children towards career paths that guarantee safety, such as medicine or law. By presenting a plan that highlights the development of essential skills for survival, apart from university education, one can ease these concerns.
</li><li><b>Value of self-education alongside university education</b>: Gura stresses that even for those attending university, self-education is still required for success. Universities often do not teach crucial skills like self-help, meditation, spirituality, and business and marketing, which pay lifelong dividends. As such, he advises attention to developing these skills independently, emphasizing the importance of practical skills that will directly aid in job acquisition.
</li><li><b>Showing seriousness and dedication</b>: Distinctly demonstrating dedication to self-development is necessary in achieving coherent adult decision-making. This involves pursuing personal growth and taking the process of maturing seriously. Showcasing practical daily efforts made towards self-improvement and career goals, can provide reassurance to parents and others alike.
</li><li><b>Key ingredients for success</b>: Clarity, tailoring life to personal strengths and passions, commitment to lifelong learning, and proactive engagement are some of the main components to a successful and fulfilling life as per Leo Gura's teaching. Highlighting the need to continually clarify what one desires from life, striving for a unique and personalized life, being committed to self-education, and constant proactive action are laid out as essential steps to success.
</li><li><b>The Actualized.org platform</b>: Leo promotes his platform, actualized.org as a lifelong learning resource containing practical and transformative insights. Other resources available on the platform include his list of over 200 recommended books, a blog, a forum for connecting with like-minded individuals, and teachings from various experts and perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Adopting a multi-perspectival approach to self-education</b>: Gura reinforces the significance of a multi-perspectival approach to self-education for maximum growth and development. He emphasizes exploration across a broad spectrum of disciplines and teachings East and West, scientific and spiritual, and others, advocating for harvesting the best from all ideologies rather than loyalty to just one school of thought.
