            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/F4HV6oKJgiE' target='_blank'>What Is Actuality - Distinguish Direct Experience vs Concept</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding actuality versus concepts</b>: The video focuses on learning how to distinguish between actual experience and concepts or imagination. Using interactive exercises, Leo emphasizes the importance of focusing awareness on immediate, tactile experiences - using the example of holding and focusing on one's hand - to understand what is actual and real. He cautions against confusing this with concepts or beliefs, warning against the epistemic trouble caused by failing to differentiate between real experiences and socially or culturally influenced concepts.
</li><li><b>Contrasting experience and imagination</b>: Leo draws a clear distinction between actual, lived experiences, and conceptual understanding or imagination. Using the exercise of looking at, then hiding your hand, he illustrates the difference between the concrete reality of one's hand and conceptual thinking about its existence.
</li><li><b>Importance of grounding in present moment reality</b>: Leo highlights the necessity of recognizing and differentiating reality from belief in daily life. This constant acknowledgment of the presence of the actual, immediate experience is critical for personal development and spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Spirituality and direct experience</b>: Leo contradicts the stereotype that spirituality is about beliefs by stating that spirituality is about grounding oneself in actuality - being present in the actual moment rather than in concepts or imagination.
</li><li><b>Blurring of reality and concept as hindrance</b>: He addresses how people's lived experiences are often interpreted through concepts derived from cultural or early upbringing, which blurs the distinction between what is real and what is imagined. This can hinder understanding of reality and personal and spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Redefining and practicing spirituality</b>: He urges viewers to distance themselves from overly theoretical approaches to spirituality. Instead, he defines true spirituality as recognizing the reality of the present moment without overlaying it with context or labeling, and suggests regularly observing and experiencing small, simple objects, such as one's hand.
</li><li><b>Link between actual experience and beliefs</b>: He challenges the view that we perceive is the embodiment of what is real and present, asserting that our beliefs and concept of direct experience being all that exists is a product of our thoughts. He advises finding truth in actual experiences like looking at one's hand, rather than in philosophical concepts.
</li><li><b>The role of fear and concepts in reality perception</b>: He highlights the role of fear as a driver in our resistance to accept reality. He argues that fear, being imaginary, distorts our perception of reality, and encourages viewers to ground themselves in actual reality, free from fear. On the other hand, he draws attention to the danger of accumulating "conceptual baggage", emphasising the importance of grounding oneself in direct experience rather than relying on concepts or imagination.
</li><li><b>Alignment of imagination and reality through direct experiences</b>: He stresses the need for constant practice and extensive effort to develop the ability to distinguish between ideas and reality, and urges viewers to objectively assess the actual benefits they have received from teachings or practices like meditation, yoga, psychedelics, and reading books. He warns against overestimating the benefits gained through imagination and concepts and realizing the gap between perceived and actual benefits.
</li><li><b>Encouraging active engagement with direct experience</b>: He emphasizes the importance of engaging with reality to gain a deeper understanding, beyond merely agreeing or disagreeing with concepts. He encourages listeners to scrutinize and analyze their own direct experiences to recognize the truth of these concepts.
</li><li><b>Role of concepts in human identity</b>: He briefly discusses the concept of 'self' and 'ego', suggesting that they are imaginations and also mentions the controversial idea of individuals being God, necessitating an elevated level of consciousness to recognize that everything is good.
</li><li><b>Encouraging critical thinking and personal investigation</b>: He challenges traditional education systems, critiquing their focus on memorizing concepts and beliefs, while urging viewers to engage in active participation and direct investigation to understand his teachings. He asserts that such active engagement sets his teachings apart from religious, New Age, and scientific beliefs, and encourages the audience to take his work seriously for comprehensive understanding of advanced concepts. He also highlights the resources available on his website, Actualized.org, for further exploration and learning.
</li><li><b>Concept vs Actuality in Understanding Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura explains the need to realize that our ideas about significant concepts such as birth, parents, enlightenment, evolution, the universe etc. are merely products of our imagination. By using the exercise of focusing on one's hand, he directs the viewers towards experiencing actuality outside the realm of these imaginings. He pushes the viewers to question and challenge their reality in order to recontextualize their understanding and approach to abstract notions such as spirituality and enlightenment. He stresses that the key to accessing enlightenment lies in recognizing the profound actuality or 'realness' found in the simple act of observing one's hand, a direct experience devoid of theoretical concepts, imagery or preconceived beliefs.
</li><li><b>Repeating the Exercise for Profound Changes</b>: Gura encourages viewers to spend hundreds and thousands of hours just observing their hand, asserting that this exercise could lead to a transformative shift in perception, giving a new context and meaning to the object of focus aka the hand, bringing them closer to understanding the underlying essence. He stresses that understanding and experiencing this change requires dedicated immersion, and any attempt to analyze or conceptualize it using terms or verbal descriptions defeats the purpose of the exercise.
</li><li><b>Consciousness, Context, and Imagination</b>: Leo discusses the concept of automatic contextualization that our minds perform, where we exist within an assumed frame of reality. He encourages viewers to strip away this automated contextual layer ingrained within their reality perception and acknowledges the challenge and discomfort associated with this practice. This realization that much of what we perceive as reality is actually imagination can be unnerving, almost making one feel insane, which is a necessary step towards enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Body and Consciousness as Concepts</b>: Addressing the scientific explanation of consciousness, Gura suggests that the notion of consciousness stemming from the neurons in our brain is again a concept and invites the viewers to juxtapose this concept with the 'actuality' of their hand. He adds further by stating that our understanding or image of our body is also conceptual and imaginary, separate from the 'realness' of the hand.
</li><li><b>Significance of Physical Sensations</b>: Leo explains that what we traditionally perceive as our body is not actually the body, but a collection of amorphous sensations that we experience. These sensations are real, but the concept of the body is an imaginary construct.
</li><li><b>Concepts and Imagination in Teachings</b>: Leo emphasizes that everything a person learns, whether from him or any other teacher, is derived from concepts and beliefs. He holds that the tangible reality, like the existence of one's hand, is concrete and actual. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Relating Teachings to Lived Experiences</b>: Leo criticizes that many misconstrue his teachings as they don't connect his conceptual pointers to their lived experiences. He advocates that it's essential to understand these pointers and transcend them to actuality for a clearer comprehension of the teachings.
</li><li><b>Understanding God through Actuality</b>: According to Leo, to truly understand God, one has to look at physical things like their hand, which is a representation of actual existence, contrasting it with the concepts and imagined beliefs associated with God.
</li><li><b>Reality of Death as a Concept</b>: Leo suggests that death, which is essentially nonexistence, is a concept and exists as an idea. He points out that fearing one's death is based on the concepts and imagination around it, and not actuality.
</li><li><b>Notion of Truth</b>: Leo argues that what is considered as truth lies in seeing and experiencing actual constructs like one's hand, rather than in lofty philosophical concepts. 
</li><li><b>Political Preferences are Imaginative Constructs</b>: Leo opines that political preferences, ideals, or principles are imaginative constructs and not based on actuality. He warns against letting fear manipulate and distort reality.
</li><li><b>Fear as an Imaginary construct</b>: Leo asserts that fear, and the objections that fear postulates, are imaginary. He encourages the viewer to focus on actual reality, free from the bondage of fear and imaginary constructs.
</li><li><b>Historical events and scientific concepts as imagination</b>: Leo Gura suggests that all historical events, like World War II and the assassination of JFK, along with scientific concepts such as atoms and molecules, exist more as concepts and imagination than as actual reality. They cannot necessarily be experienced directly like one's hand and are therefore not as real as the sensation of one's hand in comparison.
</li><li><b>Close examination of small objects</b>: Gura proposes an exercise of choosing a small object, like a pen, and reviewing it as if for the first time. Through touch and sight, one should study the object in detail by observing its existence, substance, and feel. It's important to notice that concepts such as its being made of metal or plastic are conceptual responses drawn from the mind.
</li><li><b>Direct experience as essence of spirituality</b>: Leo emphasizes that conducting such conscious exercises through direct experience paves the way to spirituality. He urges viewers to repeatedly practice distinguishing the difference between concepts, imagination, and the actual experience, which requires hundreds of hours of dedicated work. He argues that the benefits of this practice are actual, not conceptual, and are understood only when performed.
</li><li><b>Checks on actual benefits of spiritual practices</b>: Leo suggests that one must introspect honestly about the real benefits that they have received from their spiritual practices. He warns that there might be a gap between the benefits imagined and those that are real, creating an unsettling moment of realization. This reflection can encourage one to invest more in practices, thus reaping the actual benefits.
</li><li><b>Relating insights to direct experience</b>: Each lesson or insight provided by these videos must be tied to one's direct experience, Leo advises. He illustrates this through examples such as 'direct experience is all that exists' and 'evil is a concept'. These insights aren't to be agreed or disagreed with, but specifically to be observed in one's reality or actuality.
</li><li><b>Self and Ego as concepts</b>: Gura reinforces that the self is a concept, an idea derived from imagination. To comprehend this, he recommends interrogating the 'me-ness' of various body parts, like the hand. This exercise challenges the viewer to discover the essence of identity and to comprehend its nature as conceptual rather than physical.
</li><li><b>Imagining the Self</b>: Leo proposes that the self or the ego is a concept created by an individual's imagination. He emphasizes that we imagine ourselves into existence.
</li><li><b>Controversy of Being God</b>: When suggesting that individuals are God, Leo faces criticism. However, he insists that this isn't arrogance or ego; rather, it is a realization of actuality. 
</li><li><b>Taking God's Place</b>: Leo believes humans have conceptually taken God's place by relating everything to themselves and their bodies, declaring it as theirs. He compares humans to cuckoo birds that lay eggs in other birds' nests, tricking them into raising cuckoos' offspring. Similarly, humans have done this with God. 
</li><li><b>Role of the Devil</b>: Leo claims that by usurping God's place, one essentially becomes the devil  an entity trying to take the place of God. He adds that understanding the devil and God as identical could be a new realization, as God creates through illusion.
</li><li><b>Understanding Happiness</b>: Leo redefines happiness as accepting the present moment, regardless of its circumstances. To achieve happiness, he suggests embracing the present situation fully and avoiding resistance. 
</li><li><b>Conceiving Death</b>: Leo argues that death only exists as a concept within our imaginations; it cannot exist in reality. He encourages individuals to ground themselves in actuality, not their perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Embrace Radical Truths</b>: To recognize the truth, Leo urges listeners to be open to new, potentially shocking or radical ideas. He warns against reverting to beliefs when confronted with uncomfortable truths. 
</li><li><b>Grounding in Actuality</b>: Leo recommends continually grounding oneself in actuality, like focusing on one's hand, to break free from the mind's limitations. He assigns exercises to actively engage with these ideas, such as contemplating the concepts of belief, imagination, and actuality and spending time every day silently observing their hands.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Importance of Observing Objects</b>: Leo stresses the significance of observing everyday objects like a pen or a post-it note as a form of spiritual exercise. He argues this practice is more direct and integral to spirituality than traditional practices like prayer or yoga.
</li><li><b>Understanding Direct Experience and Object/Concept Dichotomy</b>: He emphasizes the understanding of direct experience and differentiating between a concept and the reality of the object. Recognizing that both a pen and one's hand are forms of consciousness pushes towards this comprehension.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as the Foundation of Existence</b>: Despite the mind's activity during these practices, Leo advises users to continually remind themselves that these physical objects and the observing self, both are consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Experimenting with Consciousness</b>: Leo compares these consciousness-observing practices to a science experiment that requires faith in the process and not immediate outcomes. It requires dedication and willingness to explore the unknown, similar to scientists who run experiments, the results of which they are unsure of.
</li><li><b>Resources for Further Understanding and Practice</b>: Leo talks about resources available on Actualized.org, including book lists, life purpose course, forum, and exclusive content on his blog. The resources provide a deeper understanding of his advanced teachings that require the seeker's active participation, personal investigation, and dedication.
</li><li><b>Flaws of Traditional Education</b>: Leo criticizes traditional education systems for focusing on memorization of concepts and beliefs over personal investigation into actuality. He reiterates that to truly understand the reality of existence and consciousness, it is not enough to passively consume content, even his own.
</li><li><b>Deep Personal Investigations</b>: He encourages personal investigation of significant aspects of life and existence such as consciousness, mind, emotions, fear, happiness, sadness etc. This process includes investigation through both subjective experiences and more traditionally objective ventures such as career, relationships, and comparing results.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org's Unique Approach</b>: Leo positions Actualized.org as distinct from religious, New Age, and scientific teachings. It encourages direct investigation of actuality, pushing its audience towards self-conducted explorations to genuinely comprehend these advanced lessons, which in turn breeds mature understanding and realizations.
