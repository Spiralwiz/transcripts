hey this is Leo for actualised org and let's talk
about negative thoughts all right in this quick self-help segment
I am going to cover negative thoughts what they are
set your expectations for how they work and give you
some techniques that you can use to cope with them
deal with them eliminate them all right so negative thoughts
or as many of us call it automatic negative thoughts
because that's what it is we don't realize is how
many of these thoughts you're actually having and how unconsciously
and spontaneous interests automatically you're having them throughout that your
day so whether it's a negative thought about your girlfriend
or boyfriend negative thought about what somebody did to you
while you were driving to work or negative thought about
having to go to the gym or negative thought about
what's going to be happening to you next month when
you can't pay the bills you know your mind is
really really good at taking your greatest fears and projecting
them and catastrophizing them and just creating the worst possible
case scenarios and then putting them right before your eyes
and just like BAM flashing them right for before you
so whatever your greatest fears are in life chances are
that you're having a lot of negative thoughts around that
fear and I do usually tend to find that it's
one or two main fears and this is probably something
like an issue that crept up and kind of stuck
with you from childhood or early adulthood and these things
tend to be centered around for example the fear of
failure maybe you have a fear of whining a poor
and homeless maybe you have a fear of not winding
up in a good relationship and being lonely and dying
miserable and unloved maybe you have a fear of really
getting rejected by somebody if you put yourself out there
whether in a relationship or maybe in a business context
maybe you have a fear of like failure in going
and trying some sort of goal and then not succeeding
at it and then having everybody point point fingers at
you and say well we told you so we you
couldn't do that and so we have a failure of
of that kind of embarrassment or humiliation so there's many
different types of core fundamental fears but whatever it is
it's going to be like a filter that you look
and filter your whole day through and this will have
tend to happen again and again and again so one
first step to starting to eliminate negative thoughts is to
become very conscious become very aware of when you are
having negative thoughts and what is the topic that is
revolving around I guarantee you that you will be shocked
if you have not done this exercise spend the next
few days spend the next three days just be very
aware about what it is that you're thinking and what
you might want to do practically is for five minutes
every day for five minutes randomly three times within your
day just stop for five minutes and ask yourself what
am I feeling right now and what am i thinking
and what you'll notice is that if you're feeling negatively
if you're feeling anxious or stressed or worried or overwhelmed
you're going to notice that there's an Associated thought with
that and that thought is going to be some sort
of negative automatic thought that you might not even realize
that you're having it might be something like well I'm
feeling overwhelmed right now and the reason I'm feeling that
way is because I'm thinking that oh I've got a
hundred things that I need to do before the end
of the week or if I don't do that then
something bad will happen right and that's usually where your
brain fills in your subconscious mind will fill in that
blank with your worst imaginable fear you might think that
well if I don't get all this stuff done this
week then I might get fired and I might not
be able to pay my mortgage and then though the
bank will repossess my house and then I'll wind up
on the street and I'll never be able to recover
from that and I'll be homeless and poor for the
rest of my life so maybe that's what your brain
is projecting in into your into your mind or maybe
it's something like well if I don't get all this
stuff done then my spouse or my boyfriend or my
girlfriend will think less of me and they won't love
me anymore and maybe they'll leave me and then I'll
not ever be able to replace them and get into
a good relationship so I'll wind up alone and miserable
and nobody will ever want me because I'm unlovable and
I'm not successful in their eyes so maybe it's something
like that right become aware of that do a little
bit of analysis and spend the next three days really
tracking your negative thoughts and maybe recording them and in
fact I'll tell you make a list make a list
of all the negative thoughts you're having throughout the next
three days and just see what are the categories are
they based around money are they based around relationships and
people are they based around humiliation fear of failure something
else maybe your diet maybe your how you look maybe
your level of confidence in your life maybe the things
that you think you can can't achieve start to notice
that because awareness is the first step and honestly you're
not going to be able to eliminate your negative thinking
in a week that's not going to happen all of
us have negative thoughts it's totally natural it's the human
condition our mind is geared this way our mind really
has a lower self and higher self the lower self
is literally physically in your brain you have a reptilian
brain that part of your brain that evolved when there
were no humans on earth that part of the brain
that evolved when we were still mammals and even before
mammals when we're really at the reptilian phase this was
millions of years ago because then there was no higher
consciousness thinking there were no such things as ideals like
beauty and excellence and truth and there were no goals
what there was was just fight-or-flight response survival of the
fittest and in that kind of ecosystem your brain or
your reptilian brain the brainstem the lower part of your
brain really evolved to ensure that your survival is taken
care of so when your survival is threatened everything else
in your life shuts off nothing else can take priority
you can't honor values like beauty and honesty and love
and truth and excellence you can't honor these types of
values and you can't honor those types of goals and
towards them in your life if you're worried about your
physical survival for example or if you're worried that you're
going to be humiliated and ostracized or if you're worried
that you're not going to be loved so these fundamental
fears are grounded in your reptilian brain and your reptilian
brain is more powerful than your prefrontal cortex and your
your more mammalian and your more human brain so the
prefrontal cortex is where you get your conscious thought from
and there we have these bigger ideals we have these
goals we have these visions for ourselves we have this
amazing life that we want to live we have the
contribution that we want to make to the world but
to make that to actually honor that in your life
what you need to do is you need to kind
of quiet your reptilian brain and make sure that your
reptilian brain is kind of a is mellowed out it's
calm and it's not too overstressed and that means taking
a look at the negative thoughts that you're having and
it's not going to be that easy to recondition your
reptilian brain to stop having these negative thoughts because you've
got like a lifetime of history of of having these
negative thoughts so you have these negative thought habits that
you really need to start to reshape and then of
course even then your reptilian brain is still always going
to be very sensitive to any kind of dangers in
your environment or perceived dangers so the way to start
is through awareness but then of course you can build
in habits that will help you to reshape your negative
your negative thought patterns one way to do this is
to do affirmations and I have other videos that talk
about how to do affirmations effectively there are some important
tips about how to do affirmations but doing just five
or ten minutes of affirmations in the morning is a
really effective way to eliminate negative thoughts another way to
eliminate negative thoughts is with meditation meditation is all about
quieting the mind and shutting off shutting off all that
chitter chatter that's going on especially the negative chitter chatter
and just quieting your mind and being happy in the
moment and I got other videos to talk about how
to really do with meditation effectively as well but setting
up a meditation habit can be a really powerful strategy
for eliminating negative thoughts other ways to eliminate negative thoughts
is to have something creative that you're doing in your
life have your life be not focused on yourself but
be focused on other people and not in the sense
that you're a mother Teresa type person but in the
sense that there's something you want to contribute something that
you're doing that's outside of yourself so maybe you are
really interested in some sort of cause like you have
a charity that you really like to contribute to and
that's important to you or maybe your family is your
cause or maybe your work is your cause maybe your
church is your cause or some other organization or maybe
your cause is maybe you're like a scientist and your
causes to discover something new to add something to humanity
to do something to do something positive right maybe you're
an inventor and you want to create something that's going
to help people out maybe you're a business maker you're
an entrepreneur and you want to make some sort of
business that's going to have a positive impact on the
world right so focus on that rather than just sitting
alone in your room dwelling on yourself and your own
thoughts because that tends to be just like a negative
spiral of pit and despair that you go down whereas
if you start focusing your attention outward and you start
giving and you start focusing on what you can be
doing then all of a sudden you reverse that trend
and you start moving upward alright so those are my
thoughts on negative thoughts negative thoughts are really a pernicious
thing and you want to start to get a handle
on them and it's really it is a deep topic
and there's a lot of more advanced techniques that I
cannot share with you in this quick self-help segment so

but I'm going to wrap up here so go ahead
