hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to stop
comparing yourself to others and I'm going to give you
seven key reframes or mindset shifts that you're going to
need in order to accomplish this we human beings are
really human chimps and what this means just like our
chimp cousins is that we're really addicted and wired our
brains are wired to care about status our relative position
in the social hierarchy and what's quote unquote and normal
this is something that chimps obsess about and this is
something that human beings obsess about even more and so
this is a really like a biological drive in your
mind and if you want to unwire this it's pretty
challenging not impossible but challenging and what you're going to
need to do is you need to start to look
at the world and if you're set to look at
your social situations in different new perspectives that you may
have not considered before these are what I call reframes
or mindset shifts and I'll give you seven of those
here that will help you to do this but before
we get into those let's talk about why we compare
at all and the different ways in which we do
comparisons so probably the most important reason why we compare
ourselves to other humans is because it gives us a
sense of value or worth it gives our life a
sense of meaning and purpose when I can know that
well you know at least I'm better than that guy
or at least I don't have the same problems that
she has or you know well how am i doing
relative to my siblings to my brother to my sister
how am i doing relative to my parents you know
or my grandparents maybe my parents went to college or
they didn't go to college and now I go to
college how does that make me as a human being
this entity that I am my ego how does that
make me special or different or valuable or maybe not
valuable so this is the issue of self-worth and this
is really tied in with other human beings because the
the only way we can really get a sense of
our value so to speak is by being in mesh
in the social matrix with our friends with our family
letter coworkers and with the media and just mainstream culture
and what we do is we we kind of put
these hidden labels or values almost like numbers it's like
we assign numbers to different people like well that guy
is really rich so his numbers really high and you
know I'm not as rich as him so my numbers
a little bit lower and then this whole status game
starts to be played and this is uh this can
be a real bog in your life can really bog
you down as you're going forward and trying to self
actualize and really live your life purpose and have just
a fulfilling life because that's what you want you want
a fulfilling life you don't really care about value scanning
and comparing yourself to all the friends that's not what
you want so that's one reason why and it gives
us a it gives us an escape from facing a
really deep existential truth which we don't want to face
and I'll talk about that as we go on another
reason why we compare ourselves to others is because we're
always afraid in the back of our mind of being
labeled weird not normal somehow deviant somehow outside the mainstream
and that is rooted in our deep fear of being
outcast from the tribe it's almost like a fear of
death it's a very visceral fear this is why in
middle school in high school you spend so much time
worrying about whether you're weird or not and perhaps the
most terrifying thing that could have happened to you is
if your friends thought you were weird because of your
haircut or the way you dressed and this continues on
even beyond high school goes on in college and it
goes on in the workplace and really for most people
it just keeps going on until the end of their
lives because it's just like a really deep seeded pattern
that we have another reason we can pay ourselves to
others is some people do it for motivation they feel
like well Leo you know competition is a good thing
competition fuels me I like to compete with people in
the office I like to compete with people in business
gives me a sense of thrill and it kind of
puts me on my edge and that's how I know
that I'm doing good you know when I'm beating competitors
so there's that kind of reasoning behind it another reason
that we compare ourselves to others is flat-out Envy which
is really like a feeling of lack this deep feeling
of lack it's like you see that someone has something
that you want whether it's their physical appearance or their
intelligence or their business or their their their girlfriend or
their boyfriends they have something you feel like you really
need and without that thing you feel like your life
can't be fulfilling or satisfying and so because of this
you're comparing yourself to others and you're always you know
playing this game in your mind like oh if only
I had that thing that that guy has or if
only I had you know the sense of humor that
she has or if only I had the kind of
career that that my boss has then I would be
all set in life then I could relax and be
happy so this is the envy issue uh for other
people comparing themselves with others comes from this real kind
of narcissistic egotistical desire to be the best that kind
of pride that you get by knowing that you're number
one a lot of athletes are fueled by this a
lot of successful and competitive business people like CEOs or
politicians are kind of fueled by this kind of like
thirst for power like it's kind of like there's just
like your your ego is tied when in with this
idea that you know well you know if I'm the
best mathematician or if I'm the best Olympic weightlifter or
if I'm the best you know CEO in the world
then you know that means something for me that gives
me Worth and value and then my life has this
this nice juicy meaning to it this significance that otherwise
it wouldn't have had so that's the ego issue and
then um I think the last one point that I'll
make is is this feeling of sick curity so we
compare ourselves to others in the social hierarchy because we
want to be secure in our own top position so
as you're climbing the ladder at work or at school
or wherever you're climbing this ladder and you want to
get to the top you want to become like the
alpha wolf you're tired of being the beta and the
gamma wolf you're moving your way up to alpha so
let's say you do become alpha then what you do
is you look around you to make sure you know
what are all the betas and gammas up to so
they don't knock me down off my pedestal because once
your alpha on the one hand is kind of nice
because you have a lot of power and prestige and
people look up to you but also it's kind of
a downer because the only place to go from number
one is down to number two and below so you're
always kind of like looking over your shoulder and you're
always insecure in the back of your mind and you're
trying to maintain that top position and therefore you tell
yourself well I have to compare I mean if I
don't compare myself then one of these betas one day
they'll rise up and they'll overthrow me so those are
just some of the reasons right some of the reasons
and these probably all evolved from our ancestral history where
we came from from an evolutionary perspective because we're very
tribal people and we lived in tribes of fifty or
a hundred people as they as they as they say
so you have to play that game and it's almost
like it's not even a game it's kind of like
a life and death it feels like life and death
it doesn't feel like it's just a status game right
it feels like status actually has something much deeper behind
it but the reality is is that most comparing is
actually neurotic and it robs you of joy and satisfaction
in your life and it wastes a lot of your
time and energy dispersing it rather than focusing it on
the things you really need to be doing in your
life to self-actualize so most comparing comes from low self-esteem
most comparing comes from not owning your own life from
not owning your own uniqueness from just giving in to
blind mass conformity from giving in to this lack this
lie of lack I call it the lie of lack
which basically means that you really feel like if you
lack something that somebody else has that that that permanently
obstructs you from being satisfied ever in your life yourself
until you get that thing or you get that position
that that person has that's the lie of lack and
then just in general this scarcity mentality that a lot
of us are born and kind of indoctrinated into through
early childhood is that we just feel like for some
reason there's not enough resources to go around we look
at life and we say well the people who are
at the top you know they have to fight to
get their way there and there's so many so many
stop spots there's only so many resources and in the
world everything is finite there's no such thing as infinite
resources and so therefore we have to fight and claw
our way it's a dog-eat-dog world and it's a kind
of zero-sum game if I win somebody else has to
lose kind of thing and all of these things these
are not really healthy tendencies these are neurotic dysfunctional tendencies
so they can be developed out of so just because
the human mind is kind of wired for status and
power and sensitivity to what other people's values are does
not mean that this can't be outgrown and in fact
the mature psyche and the mature ego out grows this
and that's what I want to help you to do
here by sharing seven key reframes or mindset shifts that
will help you to make this happen so here we
go number one and this one is very deep this
one I call self-worth does not exist so which you'll
notice with each of these reframes is going to be
kind of taking a belief that you have a very
core assumption that you have about life or reality or
human relationships and it's going to flip it on its
head that's what a reframe is it's kind of the
exact opposite so usually what we assume is we assume
that we have self-worth and that some people are worth
more than other people but actually the truth is this
is a very deep going into spiritual territory consciousness work
territory insight is that no amount of accomplishments ever gives
you worth in life sit down one time and actually
question what is worth and where does worth come from
who is determining what's worth what if you sit down
actually look at it you'll realize wait a minute this
this whole worth thing it's just a label it's just
a label that the mind projects that attaches onto things
things don't have worth yet we treat them like they
do you might think that your car has a certain
dollar amount value to it in your house and you
might even put a dollar amount on your children or
on your your wife or on your boyfriend or on
your career or on your health insurance policy or something
right but you can understand what that really is that's
a projection of the ego that number is just something
the mind comes up with that helps it to assess
whether it serves your selfish interests that's what it is
really right but in reality if you look under the
veil you see that every human being actually has zero
worth there's no such thing as worth every physical object
actually has zero earth worth is something that we create
as like a social matrix and it's like a consensus
reality it's real because we give in to the consensus
but that's not something you have to do if you're
gonna think critically and independently for yourself this is not
just something that you can just kind of like cast
off and say oh yeah it's just a social game
I don't just mean that I mean like if you
actually take a look at existentially what Southworth is you
see that no human being actually has self-worth and the
attempt to acquire more self-worth is a losing battle because
no matter how many external objects you acquire you're never
going to feel worthy on the inside only for a
short period of time but then it always erodes it
never sticks for any length of time why is that
because deep down your mind understands that it's a fiction
and deep down you know that no externals actually make
you a better human being what that means is that
no matter cars or houses or relationships or friends or
careers or you know people you hobnob with that are
celebrities none of that stuff matters in making you a
better human being it doesn't help at all zero offer
zero help in that regard so what you have to
start to recognize that you don't actually need externals to
be happy Society brainwashes us into thinking we need the
externals to be happy but actually you don't and the
sooner you can come around to this it's a big
reframe it's really a paradigm shift when you start to
realize this and not just intellectually but you actually start
to get it like and feel it in your bones
you start to realize oh wait I don't need any
of this crap oh yeah that really frees me up
now to live my life without any strings attached because
as long as you believe you really need all this
stuff and you really believe some of this stuff is
more valuable than other parts of this stuff then you're
going to be chasing after it and you're going to
feel deficient in some way because you don't have it
and that's not a powerful place to be in life
you're basically a slave to other people's value assignments you
have to recognize that no human being is better than
any other human being this is something that the media
really brainwashes us with is this idea that well you
know he's the president the United States so he has
a lot of Worth and value and he's more important
and this person is this you know famous celebrity so
everyone should talk about them and you know when he
dies he'll have a big funeral and people will praise
him in the newspapers as though he did something great
and you know it you know but what about Martin
Luther King and Gandhi you know these were great people
that have you know helped humanity sure whatever they did
is fine but you got to understand that it doesn't
matter what you do it doesn't give you any worth
and it doesn't make you any better than the other
human being that's just a game that we play that's
a social matrix that we play in and you have
to come to the point where you just see through
the Sham of it and just let it go detach
from it and just completely stopped caring about value and
you stopped thinking of one human being as somehow superior
or inferior to another human being and just put everyone
absolutely everyone on the same playing field the best of
saints and the worst of dictators put them all in
the same playing field there are people who did different
things and some of them might have done uh you
know wonderful things socially some of them might might have
been terrible atrocious things morally and socially but still put
them all in same playing field because in the end
they're just human beings just like you just like me
and the actions that a human being takes in no
way contributes to his self-worth because every beat human being
self worth is actually zero this is a deep topic
that I'm going to cover in other episode so I'm
just kind of glossing over it here and giving it
to in a nutshell let's go on a refrain number
two which is that human beings are too complex to
compare it's not like you're just comparing cars or you're
just comparing business plans or you're just comparing apples when
you're comparing two human beings you're comparing extremely complex and
unique organisms and because of this you're really making an
apples and oranges comparison every time you take two human
beings and you put them side-by-side this is the case
because each one of us has a different life history
different genetics different personality different family that we grew up
with different resources that we had when we grew up
different environment we grew up in different countries different parts
of the world different governments in different parts of the
neighborhood and in different family environments and all this stuff
has shaped us has shaped who we are what we're
capable of and not all human beings are capable of
exactly the same things because we come from very complex
origins and also we allocate our time and our energy
differently so some people would like to spend all their
time and energy focusing on their career and their finances
great but then they neglect their health and their relationships
and somebody else might do the exact opposite they put
all their time energy into relationships but then they neglect
their career or somebody else might put all their time
energy into education but then neglect their emotions and they're
kind of emotionally underdeveloped somebody else might put all their
time energy into spirituality but then have no money so
where you put your attention and your energy and your
focus and all your resources determines what kind of results
you get in life a lot of times what happens
that we start to compare two people and we say
well you know I wish I was more like that
person over there you know how come his health is
so good my health is so terrible well probably because
he's put a lot of focus into herself and what
we do is we put these two people side by
side and then we feel like we're deficient because like
well I wish I had his health you know it's
unfair that my health isn't as good as his health
but really you have to look at the full picture
of this human being that you're comparing yourself to this
person you have to look at all the different facets
of his life how's he doing in all the other
facets of his life it might be that his health
is great but then he's really screwed up in some
other facet of his life where you're not screwed up
but see the problem is is that you can't really
take a human being and you don't get a good
look at all the fast of his life because you
can't see them they're all hidden they're all beneath the
surface so rarely do we compare ourselves totally fairly and
objectively with the people we usually just cherry-pick our just
cherry-pick stuff and it'll just focus on one individual little
facet of life but this is a totally unfair comparison
totally unfair so we have to take this into account
you got to see this happening the unfairness of it
happening as you're actually doing it right and you just
gotta allow allow for the fact that people are very
different and that there's no reason that you should be
getting the same result as anybody else because not only
can you not see the current facets of this person's
life that you're comparing yourself to but you can't even
see also his history like where did he come from
what was his family situation like what kind of resources
that he have growing up what kind of environment he
grew up in what kind of genetics does he have
all these things are relevant factors all of them so
really when you think about all this and you kind
of sit down you piece it together you you get
this aha realization of like wait a minute it's really
unfair to be comparing two human beings at all in
the first place they're just too complex to compare and
when you realize that then you can kind of drop
away this this neurotic need to compare yourself to others
and this this happens this one especially happens with celebrities
right because we see a celebrity on the news and
we see them on a talk show let's say and
then they're talking for five or ten minutes doing a
little interview and it sounds like from that five or
ten minute interview like you get a little peek into
that person's life but it looks like you know the
person you start to feel like oh yeah I know
that person and that person you know he's got such
a great relationship and it seems like he's got his
finances together and he's got celebrity status like he's on
top of the world but really what you don't realize
is that you're looking at a little tiny sliver of
his life in a very artificial environment on a tabloid
or in a magazine article or on this ten minute
talk show situation and so uh you do not get
anywhere near a complete each picture of their life you
get like a 1% picture of their life so once
you start making comparisons based on that you're really going
off-track the third reframe I'm talking about is the following
competition is stupid a lot of us get suckered into
this game of competing in life with other people and
it can start really young can start when you're just
a kid in school or in sports and then that
competition just kind of keeps going going you and you
believe that life is about competition but this is a
losing game because there's always going to be someone better
than you at whatever you're doing given how large the
world is we got 7 billion people on it there's
always going to be somebody better than you and what's
even worse is that even if you become number one
let's say you become the best in your field of
business or sports or whatever you want to be the
best in you become recognized as nothing as number one
it's not actually going to be fulfilling for you and
if you've ever achieved number one status you recognize it
there's no fulfillment in it it's exciting and it's fun
for a couple of weeks maybe a couple of days
maybe a couple of months at the most but then
it loses it loses it loses all its spark that
exciting feeling doesn't stay with you for the rest of
your life it's very short and fleeting it's not really
worth that much and what's crazy is that you can
be number one and you're actually going to be in
fear and you're not even going to be able to
enjoy your number one status because the whole time you're
afraid of how you're going to get knocked off your
pedestal by somebody who's better than you so you're always
a little intende neurotically looking over your shoulder instead of
being a competitor and being stuck in that mind frame
I want you to change that and just realize that
competition is stupid it's really stupid it's a stupid way
to live life the much better way is to be
a creator to just focus on what you want to
create in life artistically in sports and business or whatever
else and just focus on that because there you're taking
your eye off of everybody else and just focusing on
what you got to do your own work your own
purpose ground yourself in your own purpose and life your
own values this is a hundred times more satisfying than
being a competitor competition is really for juveniles and for
children for immature adults a lot of adults are actually
juveniles or children in their mind the mature adult is
a creator to such a degree that competition doesn't even
enter into their mind anymore and that's where you want
to get to so make a commitment choose to become
from now on a creator in your life and don't
put yourself into situations where you have to compete for
prizes or for money or for validation from other people
this is a terrible place to put yourself in it's
like painting yourself into a corner the 4:3 frame is
that yes I have handicaps yes I have handicaps just
like everybody else every human being has things that they're
good at and things that they're bad at not equally
some of us have real serious crippling physical handicaps some
of us are blind some of us are deaf some
of us are born without legs some of us have
a deficient brain or some other genetic condition and if
that's your lot in life you have to accept it
because otherwise you're just going to drive yourself insane but
most of us don't have these kind of very debilitating
handicaps what we have is we just have weaknesses and
we have natural strength than natural weaknesses but then what
we do is we we don't accept these natural weaknesses
we wish that we were like strong all across the
board in all the different areas of life and all
the different personality characteristic that we could have like we
want to be intelligent and funny and smart and hard-working
and this isn't usually just one at all the full
package we want to have good looks but you know
you're really gonna be miserable in life if you come
at it from that perspective you just have to accept
whatever your handicaps are go through a process of just
accepting over and over and over and over again whatever
weaknesses you perceive yourself to be and reframe them as
strengths and the way that I do that is I
just I recognize that my life is short and I
only have so much time and so much energy very
limited time and energy so I don't need to be
great across the board let me just focus on my
strengths and those things that I'm not particularly good at
or that I wasn't particularly gifted for genetically or whatever
then those I'll just accept and that's fine because I'm
going to pour all my energy and attention onto my
strengths and I'm going to be fully satisfied living from
that place this is a little easier said than done
in practice it can take you months and years to
really accept your handicaps and that just requires like loving
yourself over and over and over again for those handicaps
or weaknesses that you perceive 5th reframe is this being
normal is overrated highly overrated the truth is that the
herd the human herd that we're part of is actually
stupid the average person is mediocre they don't behave in
an intelligent manner they don't have a quality satisfying life
so you have no business being average or normal the
most satisfying thing in life is to be yourself and
to really live into that and accept it fully and
when we're young we spend a lot of our energy
in school and college trying to fit in that's the
game we play trying to be normal because it's almost
like death it feels like death if we're not at
that stage in our life but then as you mature
and you get older you start to see that actually
your eccentricities those things that you would hide you used
to hide in school and college and when you were
younger used to hide all those that actually living into
the hose and being able to just be fully open
and just wear your eccentricities on your sleeve and to
really love yourself for them that that's where life becomes
really interesting that's where life becomes joyful is when you
accept all those and then actually you kind of play
into them and you make them a part of your
authentic personality your ex institution your eccentricities shine through so
you're not just just this like a generic mask but
you're someone unique and people see you that way and
actually counter intuitively this makes you more attractive and more
magnetic than you would otherwise be if you just wore
a plain vanila mask nobody likes to be friends with
just a vanilla robot who just does the right things
the things that are normal and you know inside the
parameters of the herd and doesn't really act like his
authentic self in each one of us there's this authentic
self that takes a lot of time to to unearth
it's almost like your honor our unearthing a dinosaur fossil
you know you got to sit there and painstakingly brush
away all the debris so the fossil finally gets revealed
that's kind of the process of life this will take
you decades to go through this whole process in fact
self-actualization is in one way could be defined as the
gradual revealing of your authentic self of your authentic personality
but this takes a lot of work in a lot
of different different ways and in different aspects of your
life I want to make a point about fake uniqueness
versus authentic uniqueness sometimes we try to be unique or
different and kind of like iconoclastic and not fit into
the herd and we pride ourselves on that but I'll
often oftentimes that ends up being a fake uniqueness we're
trying to be unique but in a conformist sort of
way like we go get a piercing or a tattoo
or we give it a weird haircut or something like
that that's not really uniqueness what authentic uniqueness is is
just recognizing within yourself who you really are deep down
inside your strengths your weaknesses your eccentricities your true values
your passions in life the things you don't like in
life yeah you really learn all those through lots of
experience and trial and error and then what shines through
is your authentic personality and what that is is just
you relaxing and being fully loving and accepting of all
those characteristics about yourself you're no longer acting you're not
playing with some kind of schtick or you're trying to
be somebody else it's just like you're fully relaxed and
however you behave however you happen to behave when you're
fully relaxed that's who you authentically are and so just
gradually living into that more and more and more and
more will make you very unique we have this tendency
to think well if I was just myself and I
wasn't trying to be special then I would be ordinary
but see everybody else is doing that too because most
people are afraid of being authentically unique so paradoxically the
way they become the most unique and authentic is just
by letting yourself be your ordinary way sixth reframe is
the following I'm too busy loving myself to compare myself
with others so this means fully loving yourself and falling
in love with you and with your life you have
to take ownership of your life in a way that
people who compare themselves with others don't do in a
way that the herd doesn't do right the herd is
always looking around and trying to assess its position relative
to everyone else on the herd but you as an
individual what you need to do is you need to
shift your focus totally inward on yourself so that you're
treating your own life and your own mind as a
do-it-yourself project you're always working on yourself you're working on
your personal development you're working on your career you're working
on your finances you're working on improving your health you're
working on improving your relationships you love the growth comes
from that so much that you're so busy doing that
stuff from morning to midnight that you don't have time
to think and distract yourself with all the comparisons that
you would otherwise be doing right see the average person
doesn't really have a sense of purpose they don't really
love their life they're not owning their life they haven't
taken full responsibility for it yet they're not growing they're
not self actualizing so of course what do they do
they just sit there and then they and moan and
complain and they criticize others and they compare themselves and
they wish all you know I wish I won the
lottery and I wish I was like that celebrity they
keep wishing and wishing and wishing and wishing but they're
not actually working on themselves so of course they'll sit
there and wish they have nothing else to do this
is a form of procrastination and distraction but you because
you've taken ownership of your life you throw all that
aside and you just focus on what you got to
do to build an even better life one that you
love even more than you currently love your own the
seventh reframe is that I love to see people succeed
and this reframe goes to the heart of the scarcity
mindset that we have because a lot of times we
feel like well if that person is succeeding and they're
doing good in their life then I can't be happy
for them because it somehow means that I can't do
is good or now it's harder for me or they
have something I really want now I'm jealous or envious
of that but see you got to flip that on
its head when you see people that have stuff that
you want rather than being envious of it what I
want you to do is I want you to see
that that's like a menu from which you can order
and create a vision for your life so what you
need to fall in love with your life is you
need a vision for your life right like what are
you working towards in your life what are you trying
to accomplish what's the impact you're trying to have what
kind of purpose have you given it most people haven't
done any of this they don't have a vision for
their future so of course they hate their life and
they go on comparing see what you got to do
is you got to see that person over there you
know they have a lot of money okay great add
that item to your list to your vision and a
person over there he or she has a great marriage
okay add that to your list that's an example of
what you could have if that person could have it
you can have it and then you just go around
and every time you see someone who has something great
that you would normally feel envious of what you do
is you just assimilate it and you add it to
your own vision for yourself and then the thing you
construct this this vision you construct is going to be
unique to you it's going to be different from all
these different elements these things just aren't like sources of
inspiration for you they show you what's possible but you're
going to combine all the ingredients into your own custom
thing so you should reframe this as being actually really
happy that that person has something wonderful that you're excited
about because that's something you can add to your own
vision right and then when you do that what you
do is you bless that person you say you know
bless you for having that poor love into whatever that
person has rather than hatred or Envy with the anticipation
that when you acquire what you want then you'll love
yourself for that and other people will love you for
that - it'll be reciprocated to you because if you
go on criticizing everybody all the time for all the
stuff they have that you actually secretly want then you're
never really going to be able to get that stuff
because deep down your mind can't tell the difference between
criticism of others and criticism of yourself very sneaky very
very sneaky a lot of people keep themselves stuck just
because they criticize others so much for the things they
really want also divorce the quality from the person so
let's say you see someone who's humorous or intelligent or
hard-working and you want those qualities for yourself recognize that
those are all things you can acquire for yourself with
hard work and discipline and if you edged add it
to your vision and you work on it then a
few years or a decade you can acquire all those
things right so it's not that that person is humorous
and you're not humorous no it's that that person is
humorous great for him that's so cool I can develop
that humor in myself that's the reframe every time you
see someone who has something awesome I want you to
look at that and I want you to tell yourself
oh my god that means it's possible for me it's
possible for me to have that too I can develop
that do I want that yes I want that ok
let me add it to my vision now I'm even
more excited about my life now I love my life
even more and in this way you're basically converting your
envy into love and into passion and the last issue
I want to tackle is the scarcity mindset idea this
idea that there are limited resources in life and limited
top positions in life this is something you have to
just throw away and the way you throw it away
is by questioning it constantly and by also seeing that
by focusing on being a creator you open yourself to
an infinite number of possibilities the reality is that even
though people talk about how limited resources are on the
planet and how the plan is running out of resources
the reality is that there are more resources on the
planet Earth then a hundred billion human beings could use
up in a million years the earth is packed full
of all the chemical material resources that we would ever
need it's all in there and what's interesting is that
now we've kind of evolved to the stage in humanity
that it's not even physical resources that we need you
know it's not like iron and wood and other stuff
that we need what we mostly are doing and growing
as a humanity towards is just this kind of economy
of ideas of knowledge and most of us now are
working in creative jobs where we're using our mind on
our physical labor and this will just be a trend
that continues more and more to the future and what
this means is this means that there's an infinite number
of ideas that human beings can come up with and
ideas are not really competing with each other there's always
more and more and more creative stuff you can come
up with there's millions of new novels you could write
there's millions of movies you could create right there's million
millions of new ways to do art there's millions of
new ways to combine technology and interesting and useful ways
there's millions of valuable pieces of knowledge that you could
come up with so there's no real scarcity there if
you want to go and you just want to focus
on being a creator you can do that without having
to look over your shoulder the whole time so keep
that mind now what I want to do is I
want to end on some of the most common areas
that people do comparisons in and I want to give
you some just quick suggestions for how to deal with
these specific issues so firstly physical appearance is something that
we do a lot of comparisons on is my nose
too big compared to that person what about my hair
what about my dress style what about my body type
all this stuff also performance we compare ourselves on performance
like am i as hard-working am i as good at
that activity as this person is here also we compare
very commonly financial and material possessions so how's my dating
account doing relative that person how's my stock portfolio doing
am i getting as much as that person is getting
do I have the same kind of car the same
kind of house the same kind of gadgets that person
has position in life is another one so you know
who does that person notice he knows some celebrity that
I don't know how high up in the corporate ladder
is he you know what kind of a political standing
is you have how high is either we compare ourselves
on that front we also compare our business rankings if
you're a business person you're an entrepreneur or you're self-employed
then you might look at statistics a lot and compare
how you're doing relative to your competitors and then of
course we compare our abilities very common to compare intelligence
confidence humor and other talents like artistic talents or work
talent you know like work work abilities I may be
musical talent this kind of stuff so here let me
give you some real quick solutions for each one of
these first of all physical appearance as far as physical
appearance go you just have to accept whatever your physical
appearance is just flat-out accept whatever you are however you
look because you're not really going to change it just
bite that bullet accept it and just forget about this
stop comparing your worst features with somebody else's best features
physically as far as performance goes this one is real
easy because whatever performance someone else is exhibiting you can
exhibit that to if you just want it so anytime
you see someone who's performing at a you know a
great level just decide for yourself do I want that
same level of performance is that important for me to
have if it is added to your vision of life
work towards it and you'll have that same level of
performance all it takes is just time and work that's
it so it's a really a positive thing as far
as finances and material possessions go really the same thing
if you see someone with financial position or material possessions
that you really like and envy just remember that you
can acquire all of those yourself there's no reason why
you can't there's billions and trillions of dollars exchanging hands
in the global economy every single year you can siphon
off as as much as you need for that whatever
you need to fill you up to your heart's content
all you need is you need to have the desire
for it you really want it and then are you
willing to to go to work for it so get
excited get excited by someone having something you like because
that means you can get it to add it to
your vision as far as position in life and celebrity
status and political status and stuff like that goes that's
also something you can acquire so if someone has a
position or status or celebrity that you want and you
really feel like you want it and you need it
and you can't let it go then go pursue it
there's no reason why you can't develop it yourself it'll
just take time and hard work and chances are you
can develop as far as business rankings go this one's
a real dead end comparing yourself constantly to your competitors
doesn't actually produce new meaningful work it doesn't really do
anything creative it's really a distraction a waste of time
I've wasted many hours of my life comparing my rankings
and all my statistics and nowadays statistics are so easy
to access with the internet and all that you can
waste hundreds of hours doing this just distracting yourself from
what you really need to be doing which is focusing
on what is your business going to create how is
it going to impact more and more people and help
them in more meaningful ways that's what your sole concern
should be with business not your business rankings and paradoxically
what will happen is that your business rankings will skyrocket
if you actually focus on what I just told you
and lastly is abilities so intelligence confidence humor these kinds
of things musical talent artistic talent this stuff largely can
be developed you can develop your intelligence to extraordinary Heights
no matter where you are right now in your intelligence
same thing with confidence you see someone who's really confident
you can develop that in yourself too confidence is a
really grown trait few people are just born with rock-solid
confidence it's usually something that's developed and even those people
that are very very confident they've developed it they just
developed it earlier in their lives and you haven't seen
that process but they went through a process it might
have been an unconscious process but nevertheless they went through
it same thing with humor humor is something that's highly
developable in my own personal life I've developed my humor
a lot I've really grown it a lot so there's
there's techniques actually a video called how to be funny
which gives you a step-by-step process for how to increase
your humor and stuff like artistic talents musical talents all
this stuff mostly is just skill is skill based you
put in the time you put in the effort go
through the mastery process and you get really really good
and then people will see you as talented so if
you see someone who has the intelligence or confidence or
humor that you want add it to your vision get
excited because within the next 5 or 10 years you
can develop to that kind of level and even higher
if you really want so those are the quick solutions
to those most common um comparisons that people make I
just want to end on one last point which is
in thinking about this topic I found really only one
useful reason to do comparisons and that is to expand
your imagination of what's possible in this sense comparison is
good and it's useful and it's empowering if you're just
living in a bubble and all your friends and your
families aren't very ambitious they haven't accomplished very much then
you live in this little bubble and you just don't
see what's possible with life you don't see how much
you can develop yourself how much you can grow yourself
how you can change all these things about your life
from your material possessions to your performance levels to your
level of status to all these uh personal characteristics like
humor and confidence and intelligence all of this stuff can
be changed and that's what's so exciting about this when
I look at other human beings I get inspired by
what I can become and in fact I like to
study amazing remarkable human beings throughout history and modern ones
from artists to politicians to to business leaders to entrepreneurs
and and humanitarians study all these people take from them
ideas for what's possible for you in your life how
far you can develop yourself because there's a huge gap
between where the average person is and where a remarkable
extraordinary person is it's like multiple levels or orders of
magnitude difference it's not just like a 50% difference or
1% it's like a ten thousand a hundred thousand percent
difference right and that's why I'm so excited about self-actualization
work is that it's possible this is all the process
of how do you actualize or realize and close this
gap and get to that extraordinary status or level that
a human being is is capable of human beings have
almost infinite potential in what we can do with our
minds and our bodies and our lives so that's why
I'm ultimately very very positive and optimistic about my future
and your future and humanity's future is because there's so
much we can do about this there's so much we
can change about this and improve about this whole thing
so keep that in mind and hopefully all these reframes
will remove the neurotic comparison and then the only thing
that's going to be left is just you using other
people to inspire you to then love and live your
life and design it however you want all right I'm

check out actualize that org this is my website I
have a free newsletter that keeps you updated week to

you on track see right now you might be inspired
by some of the stuff I told you and that's
great but that inspiration is going to be temporary is
going to run out what's important is that you make
a commitment to stick through this make a commitment to
to really master your life and go for everything you
can be as a human being not just to earn

moments in your life where you're just like you're just
so grateful and thankful and you're just like in love
with yourself and your life not a narcissist narcissistic sort
of way but in a very healthy sort of way
like you just have this ah profound love for life
to me it seems like this should be standard for
human beings but you know the more I interact with
people the more I see that this is actually an
exception to the rule it's actually quite rare to meet
people like this blows my mind personally I don't know
why people are born into this life and they don't
shoot for the best that they can be and they
don't shoot for this profound love that they can have
for their own life kind of blows my mind but
I think mostly it's just because they're not aware that's
possible and they grow up in you know bad environments
where none of this stuff is taught to them and
some of these ideas are very counterintuitive you know there's
a lot of advanced concepts that I need to show
you and teach you over the next few years so
stick around a weekly basis you'll learn all those week
by week by week just takes about a commitment of
it like an hour a week and within a few
years your life is going to start to transform and
you can start to feel that love for your life
and to see the possibilities open up for you so
many possibilities will open up for you and you'll be
able to see that kind of profundity as possible in
life and I'm really excited to guide you towards that

my own life and sharing the best techniques and strategies
