[Music] this is a long overdue foundational episode that's going
to help you to make a distinction between relative and
absolute truth to understand what these two types of truth
are which turns out to be very very important because
failure to make this distinction leads to all sorts of
traps and conflations which we'll get into into the second
half of this episode uh this episode is very much
geared towards opening your mind to the possibility of the
existence and your personal access to absolute truth that such
thing is even possible so this episode connects with previous
episodes that i've recorded one called understanding relativism part one
there's also going to be a part two which i
haven't released yet so stay tuned for that that will
also be relevant but this is not part two this
is its own thing uh this episode another episode i
recorded called what is truth that's a very powerful one
make sure you go watch that and another one i
recorded called how to discover what's true that's also an
extremely powerful one oftentimes i get people asking on the
forum in the comments section but leo how do i
know what's really true how do i discover the truth
for myself if i'm not just going to be adopting
beliefs and dogmas well that's why i recorded that episode
go watch it it's a very powerful episode that episode
will change your whole life it'll change your entire epistemology
if you do what's in that episode but i won't
repeat myself here there's another episode i recorded called what
is actuality it's kind of weirdly titled um that that
also helps to point you to truth but anyways before
see before we can even point you to truth we
first have to open your mind to the possibility of
the existence of absolute truth and as simple as that
is you would think the reality is that most people
are simply not open to the possibility of absolute truth
or to their ability to access it so here's my
question to you very honestly right now don't repeat what
you've heard others say but just honestly how do you
feel what is your belief do you believe there exists
an absolute truth and if it does do you believe
you can access it be honest for the majority of
people the answer is no and the reason is is
because a lot of the narratives we've been growing up
with in our culture in the 21st century have been
permeated by notions of relativism and also by materialism uh
which cast doubt on the existence and the possibility of
accessing absolute truth so there's sort of two levels to
it the first level is that you might say well
okay maybe there is an absolute truth but how can
we really know who's to really say and even if
it exists out there somewhere um how could a human
a mere human access it because after all humans we
have this veil of perception we're living in our own
little bubbles of you know whatever our minds are constructing
and you know our mind is just uh you know
spinning a kind of reality for us that we need
to survive as a sort of a biological survival machine
you know that's what evolution tells us that's what evolutionary
biology and psychology might tell us and so forth so
how can we really trust the human senses and after
all there's so much outside of the human senses there's
ultraviolet light there's infrared light there's microwave radiation there's all
sorts of x-rays and gamma rays and dark matter and
this and that and stuff that only our telescopes and
instruments can see science shows us clearly that we only
see this much of the visible you know of the
light spectrum of electromagnetic magnetic spectrum we only see this
little sliver of it there's all this stuff outside of
it and because of this the absolute truth must even
if it exists must be out there somewhere for somebody
else to discover but not for humans right see this
is the kind of narrative that you've been fed or
you might be so deep into relativity and relativism and
maybe even because of the things you've heard me say
in the past because i talk about relativity very deeply
it's a very profound concept that most people don't appreciate
but you know uh thanks to post-modernism and so forth
relativism has creeped into all aspects of our culture to
a certain degree and so you might actually your worldview
might actually hold that there is no absolute truth all
that there are are sort of interpretations versions perspectives subjectivity
and nothing else and that's the nature of existence and
in fact in a recent episode i released on how
your mind interprets reality um i started with a quote
i started that episode with a quote from nietzsche uh
i love this quote the quote is um what is
it it's uh there are no facts there are only
interpretations all right see you might have you might have
seen that quote heard that quote and then you might
have taken that to mean that well then there is
no absolute truth it's all just interpretations leo isn't that
what that episode was all about why did you use
that quote well you see as i warned you at
the end of that episode i warned you that you
have to be very careful about how you interpret everything
i say and that that quote in that episode wasn't
meant to be taken literally it was presenting you with
a perspective a partial perspective in that episode we were
focused on interpretation that does not mean that interpretation is
all that there is you see you might have interpreted
it that way but again that's just an interpretation that
doesn't make it absolutely true so anyways your worldview might
simply not have any room for absolute truth after all
you haven't experienced it yourself let's assume you haven't otherwise
what's the point of watching this so if you haven't
then from your point of view when i talk about
absolute truth i could be lying i could be deluded
i could be hallucinating i could be fantasizing i could
have a financial motive i could be building a cult
whatever you don't know what my situation is i could
simply be mistaken as far as you know so you
would need some way to access the absolute truth for
yourself to verify it if such a thing exists or
maybe it doesn't again from your point of view it
could be either or but the problem i want to
address now is i'm not trying to get you to
believe in the absolute truth here i'm merely trying to
open your mind just even to the possibility that you
might one day be able to access it that's all
i'm trying to do here see we're we're belaboring this
point but that's because most people's minds are not really
open to the possibility of absolute truth and it's a
very radical possibility so what do i mean when i'm
asking you to open your mind to the possibility of
absolute truth i mean you can absolutely know what reality
is as a whole absolutely absolutely what it is that
means there's no doubt there's no possibility for error you
cannot be mistaken about absolute truth because it's absolute by
definition it's absolutely true it's true under all circumstances as
opposed to relative truth so here we're going to start
to make a distinction between absolute and relative so what
do we mean by relative well most of the truths
that human beings speak of when we say oh that's
true this is true you know we use the word
true and the concept true a lot throughout every daily
life i might ask you like did you have lunch
today and you might say yes i did and then
we might say you're lying that's false or we might
say he was telling the truth so these are relative
truths these sort of human kinds of truths but it's
not merely about you having lunch or not i mean
this extends into pretty much every human endeavor um so
for example when you say the sky is blue you
might say well is that a relative truth or is
that an absolute truth it's a relative truth why is
it a relative truth because and this is not so
hard to understand you see the sky is blue is
true if we assume certain contexts and other things that
qualify that statement and make it very limited so for
example the sky is blue to a human being we
might say to a different animal that doesn't see color
the sky is not blue the sky is blue on
earth but that does not mean the sky is blue
on mars because sky itself is a relative term which
sky are you talking about usually when we just say
sky we're sort of implicitly referring to the earth's sky
but sky is a more broad term than just the
earth and then you know the sky is blue when
at certain times in the day the sky is not
blue at night the sky is not blue when there's
a sunset or a sunrise it's more orange the sky
is not blue when there's a lot of cloud cover
it's gray and then if you have some sort of
neurological defects you know there's all sorts of people out
there there's colorblind people there's um people with weird mental
conditions and genetics and stuff to them the sky might
not be blue it might be a different color right
so this simplistic notion the sky is blue ordinarily we
take it as an objective fact but really it's not
an objective fact it's only a fact when you really
qualify it in many many ways and even then it
can break down in so many different ways you see
um another way to illustrate relativity and i've gone by
the way through many of these examples in my understanding
relativity part one episode go watch that for more examples
but just uh a few more here just to get
us grounded and to draw this distinction between relative and
absolute is like velocity right so right now you are
supposedly sitting there listening to me watching this and uh
you're sitting there what's your velocity you're sitting there still
pretty still right you're probably not running around as you're
listening to me maybe you're out for a jog in
which case you have a certain velocity but it's still
it's a pretty slow velocity i mean what are you
jogging 10 miles an hour at most five miles an
hour something like that maybe you're in your car in
which case your velocity is faster you're going 60 miles
an hour 80 miles an hour something like that but
this is this is almost zero compared to the cosmic
scale of what velocities are and of course as we
know from physics and as we know from einstein and
so forth velocity is relative so if you're sitting there
stationary listening to me let's assume you're just sitting at
home in a chair you're not in your car you
might say your velocity is zero and you might say
leo's velocity is also zero he's just sitting here right
now at home recording this okay [Music] but that's not
an absolute velocity that's a relative velocity relative to what
relative to the earth because relative to the sun the
velocity of you just sitting there is not zero the
velocity of you relative to the sun is like hundreds
of miles per second as the earth is flying through
space and then we can expand beyond that and we
can say your velocity relative to like the center of
the milky way galaxy is even orders of magnitude faster
than that because the sun itself is hurling through space
even faster than the earth is hurling around the sun
around the center of the of the milky way galaxy
and then the milky way galaxy itself is hurtling through
space around the center of something else and so it
is sort of this nested hierarchy and so what's your
true velocity you might say what is what is our
absolute velocity well the answer is of course that there
is no such thing because velocity itself is a relativistic
notion ordinarily because the relativity to us isn't very useful
in everyday life we talk about velocities as though they're
absolute but really we're talking about them within a very
narrow limited frame it's just it happens that our frame
here usually is just on this planet since our frame
is confined to this planet we can talk about a
car going 60 miles an hour or whatever and sort
of agree upon it and it kind of works but
it's very limited and it's not true in any absolute
sense it's purely relative this is of course what einstein's
special and general relativity started to point towards is that
there's no such thing as an absolute velocity that concept
itself doesn't make sense velocity itself is a relative concept
now you might wonder why is that why is velocity
relative well velocity is relative because here's the the deep
intuition behind relative truths is that a relative truth what
it's really doing is it's comparing two aspects of reality
if we assume for a moment just that reality is
one giant singular thing what you can do with that
thing is you can take two parts of that thing
and compare them against each other and then come up
with some kind of truth about the relationship between those
two parts so for example to say that something is
large or small what do you have to do you
can't really say that reality as a whole taken as
a whole is small or large because to say something
is small or large those concepts themselves are relativistic concepts
they require a second or an other against which you
can compare and contrast that and either notice a difference
or a similarity and a degree of difference so you
can't do that with a single object a single object
isolated by itself you can't actually tell how big it
is so scale is actually a relativistic notion so believe
it or not if you if you take the entire
universe and you ask the question is it big or
is it small you can't actually say which it is
most people think the universe is big but the reason
you think that is merely because you are comparing it
to yourself from your point of view as someone inside
of it and therefore to you it seems big but
that's relative because again your point of view is just
as little like this little ant inside of this giant
snow globe but if you were sitting outside of the
universe so to speak if you could imagine such a
thing which really isn't possible but let's say it could
be then um you actually couldn't say whether the universe
was big or small because there would be nothing else
with which to compare it against now you might say
well there could be a second universe well uh this
is sort of a flimsy notion of universe when i
say universe i'm talking about universe with a capital u
that means the universe that includes all possible multiverses too
so if you want to go with the multiverse theory
yes you could compare our little our little let's say
local universe with some other multiverse some other universe from
a multiverse you could do those comparisons and you can
compare sizes but then we can take the entire multiverse
and ask the question is it big or small and
again the answer is going to be you can't say
unless you have another multiverse with which to compare it
against you see how this works so literally what relative
truth is is that we have to take a unified
whole we have to divide it at least in two
parts or more usually more but at least two and
then we can compare these two parts so we can
say that an elephant is large and a mouse is
small relative to what relative to our position in the
hierarchy of different animals relative to humans an elephant is
large it's bigger than us and relative to humans a
mouse is small again relative to us but if you
just take a mouse or an elephant isolated by itself
without anything else as context you actually can't say whether
an elephant is large or small likewise for a mouse
and in fact something even weirder is going to happen
is you'll realize that the mouse and the elephant are
actually exactly the same scale if you take them isolated
if you put them next to each other now you've
got scale literally scale doesn't exist is what i'm telling
you other than as a relative notion so anyways um
that's a bit of a mind to realize when you
realize that um uh one of those little little sort
of facets of awakening that that you can that you
can grab uh as you're doing this work but anyways
uh back to the notion of velocity you see the
reason velocity is relativistic is because what is velocity velocity
as you've learned in physics class is distance over time
but what is distance and what is time well distance
is the thing that a yardstick measures and how does
a yardstick measure distance it has little notches on it
little marks each one of those marks whether it's an
inch or a millimeter whatever yardstick meter stick doesn't matter
whatever units you're using you see a unit is a
division within the universe so literally inches on a yardstick
are divisions that the human mind constructed thanks to these
divisions now we can say that all so and so
is two yards tall or such and such as 100
yards long or i'm traveling at a certain velocity because
the velocity is yards per minute or yards per second
or whatever meters miles and that's only possible because see
to compare how tall i am to how tall you
are we have to use a a yardstick to measure
by dividing me into little parts and dividing you little
parts then counting up those parts stacking them next to
each other and in so doing see we're we're doing
a relative activity and then if we do all that
we come up with a relative answer and the relative
answer assuming we all agree upon the yardsticks and the
methodology and all these other metaphysical and epistemic axioms that
come along with with doing this various linguistic conceptual ideas
as long as we agree on these frameworks and such
we can then come to some sort of consensus relative
truth and we can say well so and so is
two yards tall and so and so is one and
a half yards tall or whatever do you see how
that's relative it's relative to a lot of stuff it's
relative to the units we're using the kind of measurements
we're doing our methodology for collecting measurements and doing the
measurements our methodology for interpreting the measurements comparing the measurements
that's relative if you change any of those things the
truth will actually break in this case it will cease
to be true it's only true under all those conditions
and assumptions and then what is time because we're talking
about velocity that's just distance what about time what is
time anyways well that's an episode for another uh for
another day um there's some profound things to say about
time but how do scientists define time you know how
einstein defined time actually i i loved his definition because
it was so it was so brutally honest about the
nature of what science is doing when it's measuring things
is see einstein was very sneaky he was very clever
and scientists in general are very clever to avoid metaphysics
because they have to uh metaphysics is in the domain
of the absolute and what science is doing is always
in the domain of the relative because it's always measuring
comparing things uh dividing reality so um einstein said that
time is just the thing that a clock measures that's
literally his definition of time the thing that the hand
moving on the face of a clock is measuring it's
a it's an ingeniously sneaky uh way to define what
time is because you're defining time at the same time
you're not saying anything about what the nature of time
is this allows you to do calculations with time without
getting to the metaphysics of what time is this is
what all of science is predicated upon is doing this
at the very basic level so any fundamental unit of
science whether it's going to be a meter or a
gram or a calorie or a a second of time
or a hertz or a whatever of the most elemental
unit of science it might be an atom it might
be a jewel of energy and and so forth uh
if you ask a scientist what actually is that thing
the scientists will not be able to tell you what
that thing is because the scientist simply doesn't know and
in fact they're going to have a very sneaky way
of excusing their not knowing of it by telling you
that it's actually not even possible to know nor is
it important to know all we really care about is
just comparing the differences between these units but we don't
actually ever know what a unit is so for example
no scientist knows what a meter is they just know
how to measure a meter and how to compare meters
likewise no scientist actually knows what a joule of energy
is but they know how to compare them and measure
them so they can tell you that there's 10 joules
of energy in that object over there and there's 20
over here and the difference between them is 10 because
what they can measure is the difference but they can't
tell you what a joule of energy actually is and
so on for every other physical unit it's it's pretty
scandalous when you actually discover this about the nature of
science but anyways we're getting off track so back to
the uh to the clock and to time so what
is time einstein said it's just the movement of the
the hand across the face of the clock but again
what is that what is the movement of the the
hand the clock face is also divided into units so
again the velocity at which you see there time is
also in a sense being defined as a velocity because
it's how many subdivisions of a of a circle is
being swept across over what a certain period of time
in a certain sense see so it becomes very strange
loopy and kind of twisted and paradoxical here but um
this is this is not it's not a bug this
is a feature of how things work uh because it's
all entangled but anyways the the bottom line the point
i'm trying to make here is that time itself is
a relative notion why is time relative notion because literally
you have to subdivide one reality into parts and then
start counting and measuring those parts those parts are measured
in relation to each other and then you can combine
those different parts in different ways creating different kinds of
relationships which gives you things like velocity acceleration and so
forth you can have first order second order third order
comparisons and this gives us various kinds of scientific truths
all these truths are relative they're not absolute so we
have that on the one hand also as we're talking
about relative truths we're talking about all human cultural truths
all truths of human cultures religions norms moral systems uh
you know what kind of food is best whether murder
is wrong or not whether slavery is wrong or all
this this is all relative truth any truth your mind
comes up with is going to be a relative truth
anytime you subdivide reality into two or more parts and
then compare those parts and derive a truth based upon
that comparison that's going to be a relative truth uh
just that right there i'm pausing because that right there
for for many of you will be difficult to swallow
a lot of you will object to that and say
no leo that you're wrong uh i don't really have
time to go into into that i go into into
that more in my series about understanding relativism this this
episode is not really about explaining relativity um we have
other bigger fish to fry we just needed to present
that as a backdrop now again something to compare and
contrast with absolute truth so then what is absolute truth
well um you see the absolute truth is something that's
uh fundamentally different in nature than relative truth it's so
different that our minds to think about it because our
minds are used to operating within the domain of relative
truth everything pretty much that you've called truth in your
life has been in the relative domain i want you
to understand that it's all been based on comparisons and
subdivisions of reality into parts whereas and so what what
and the point there is that that has trained your
mind from birth into a sort of dualistic relative base
of experience for how truth works you think that all
truth must work this way because that's the kind of
truth you've been dealing with your whole life but what
i'm trying to show you is that there's a open
your mind to the possibility of a different domain of
truth which does not work in that way and the
and the mechanics of truth that operate in the relative
domain do not apply and do not work at the
absolute domain the fundamental difference here is that whereas in
the relative domain because you're subdividing reality with your mind
you can then make comparisons of one thing to another
thing because one thing always has some opposite you're operating
dualistically see my series three part series called understanding duality
part one part two part three to really get a
deep handle on duality and then absolute truth is operating
in the non-dual domain what does that mean that means
absolute truth is that which reality is before your mind
subdivides it in any way it's singular it has no
opposite that means you can't compare it against anything else
so you can't let's say just for a second just
assume that absolute truth exists and it's just like a
question mark or the variable x let's call it x
for now whatever this x is you don't know what
it is but let's just assume that there is this
x this x you might ask well leo so tell
me about this x i want to know is this
x big or small is it skinny or is it
fat is it colorful or is it got no color
is it beautiful or is it ugly is it good
or is it bad is it going to help my
life or is going to hurt my life am i
going to like it or am i going to hate
it can i use it to earn money can i
use it to get sex uh how many meters wide
is it how many joules of energy does it have
in it how many seconds of time does it exist
for see you might want to bring all of these
questions to this variable x but what you have to
realize is that these are questions and features that are
coming from the relative domain of comparisons and divisions and
as soon as you bring those ideas and assumptions to
the non-dual domain of absolute truth you immediately break the
absolute truth because you subdivide it with your mind by
asking those questions and then it it falls into and
is brought into the relative domain by your mind you
see so that's the trick that you have to be
very careful of here because if you do that without
being aware that you're doing it like for example if
you insist on asking me leo uh is the absolute
truth big or small and you just keep asking and
asking asking that you're not getting what i'm saying and
what you're what you're doing is you're converting from the
absolute domain into the relative domain your mind is doing
this outside of your awareness and in so doing you're
never going to be able to access absolute truth if
it exists because you're always converting it into the relative
you see so you have to be very careful at
how you're using your mind here what kind of questions
you're asking what kind of assumptions you're making i'm asking
you to open your mind to the possibility of a
absolute domain this absolute domain absolute truth what it really
means and i want to speak like from from direct
experience here because i can actually tune my consciousness right
now on absolute truth because the absolute truth is right
here see i i'm speaking about absolute truth as though
you might if you're hearing this for the first time
it might almost sound like i'm speaking about some sort
of mysterious thing that exists somewhere in the heavens somewhere
no no no absolute truth exists right here you're immersed
in absolute truth the only question is are you realizing
it or not and the problem is that you're probably
not so speaking from direct experience what absolute truth is
is it's that which is true under all circumstances and
conditions based on no context it's independent of context and
it has no other and it can't be compared to
anything else it's a direct access to what is the
case truth just means that which is the case it's
a direct access to that which is the case directly
that means there's no veil of perception between absolute truth
and yourself and your consciousness of it so that's what
i'm really asking you to open your mind to are
you willing your to open your mind to the possibility
that there is nothing separating you from absolute truth and
that you can access it directly in order to open
your mind to this you need to throw away that
scientific materialist paradigm idea that you've been taught that there's
a veil of perception between you and truth that there's
some sort of external maybe absolute truth out there somewhere
behind the scenes but us humans can never know what
it is because we're in this bubble of uh of
perceptions and that we can never break through this bubble
now open your mind to this possibility consider that there
never was a veil of perception consider that what you
have been experiencing your entire life wasn't some sort of
foreground behind which there was a actual true background but
that what you were experiencing the foreground is the only
thing there is and that is the absolute truth in
other words what i'm telling you is that open your
mind to the possibility that appearance is reality that appearance
is absolutely true if if that is the case then
notice that there is no medium between you and what's
true and you have access to absolute truth at all
times there's nothing stopping you perceptions are not in the
way experience is not in the way the mind is
not in the way colors and sensations and feelings are
not in the way because these things are absolutely true
is your mind open to such a possibility if it's
not actually open it right now i'm not asking you
to believe me i'm merely asking you to open your
mind you can either do it or not and at
this point we have to take this from mere intellectualization
to actually doing it so there's a distinction there's a
difference between merely thinking about these ideas and actually opening
your mind to the possibility of direct access to absolute
truth do that right now if you need to pause
this recording sit there let your mind actually gain traction
with the things i've been talking about and actually consider
this alternative way of looking at reality until your mind
opens to the possibility of you one day accessing absolute
truth even if it's not going to happen today do
that there's a difference between thinking about it and doing
it i'm not asking you to think about it i'm
asking you to do it do it until your mind
is open then something will shift in you that does
not mean that you've all the sudden discovered absolute truth
it only means you've opened your mind that's all it
means do it don't think about it do it this
is where the results come this is what makes this
work different from mental masturbation and from regular old speculative
armchair philosophy you have to actually do it then it
changes you if you don't do it it won't change
you and then you're stuck so continuing on about this
point one of the most common objections i get when
i talk about absolute truth or share certain aspects or
facets of it with with people through my videos is
uh is this objection but leo how do you know
the absolute truth isn't just an experience or a self-deception
or a hallucination or just a trip or just some
fantasy you made up how do you know it's not
just neurons in the brain generating experiences and stuff and
fooling you a lot of scientifically minded and rationally minded
people ask this question people who ask this question haven't
actually opened their mind to the possibility of absolute truth
so again i'm i'm lingering on this point because it's
one thing to just talk about opening your mind it's
another thing to actually open your mind so again if
you have this objection right now and you're wondering well
leo how could i ever know that what i accessed
was absolute truth how could i ever know that what
you're telling me is is is correct what if i'm
fooling myself what i mean when i say consider the
possibility of absolute truth is i mean it's absolutely true
because it's singular there's nothing outside of it it knows
itself simply by being itself so i want you to
consider the possibility that there can exist some something in
reality that is so true and knows itself to be
completely true that it cannot be mistaken it cannot be
deceived it cannot be hallucinating it cannot be fantasizing it
cannot be deluded it cannot be mistaken it cannot be
false literally it is impossible for absolute truth to be
false is your mind open to such a thing existing
think carefully about this don't just say yes get traction
with it and actually genuinely ask yourself whether you're open
to this this is a radical idea that i'm suggesting
your mind may not be open to it in which
case that's fine that's where you're at but at least
be honest about it see are you open to the
idea that you can become conscious of something that is
so absolutely true that you can never be wrong about
it a lot of people here would say no in
which case what i'm telling you is that then you're
not open to the existence of absolute truth that's the
problem the problem is not that i'm deluded or whatever
the problem is that your mind is not open to
this possibility again i am not using this to prove
to you absolute truth i'm merely asking to ope is
your mind open to that because if it's not that's
where this journey ends you can't go any further that's
where you're stuck and you'll be stuck there for the
rest of your life until you decide to change your
mind and if you have some sort of logic in
your mind that says well but it's dangerous to open
my mind so much to this absolute truth because leo
what if what if i open my mind to this
and then i start to believe in something then i
think it's the absolute truth but then it turns out
later that it's not and then i'm mistaken and i'm
wrong and i and and it ruins my life what
if that happens sure maybe that could happen but that
is not absolute truth that is something else that is
beliefs that's not what i'm talking about when i'm talking
about absolute truth with absolute truth i'm talking about something
that cannot be wrong it's absolutely true it cannot be
wrong again you may simply not be open to this
possibility at all many scientists would chime in here and
say leo that's not possible and even if it was
possible how would you know it was possible which puts
us into a very strange loopy catch-22 epistemological uh conundrum
here sort of a paradox because when you ask the
question how would you know that something is absolutely true
again i'm asking you to consider something very radical if
something is absolutely true it knows itself to be absolutely
true because it is absolutely true the tautology here is
not a bug it's a feature absolute truth must be
absolutely true by definition by pure tautology this is not
circular logic this is not begging the question this is
just the possibility of absolute truth now you might say
that that's not possible then your mind is closed to
that possibility and maybe you're right maybe it's not possible
but what if you're wrong what if it is possible
i want you to notice this if your mind is
closed and you think it's not possible how can you
know it's not possible have you explored the entire universe
have you explored every truth there is to explore in
the universe such that you can now feel confident that
absolute truth is impossible and impossible to access obviously notice
that you haven't you haven't even explored one percent of
the universe science hasn't even explored one percent of the
universe and yet you feel so adamant in keeping your
mind closed against the possibility of absolute truth can you
see the problem in that can you see that if
you're wrong in that you have fallen into a deep
epistemic blunder if your mind actually carefully contemplates these things
that i'm saying it should open your mind to the
possibility of absolute truth but then again i can't force
you to do it you'll only do it if you
want to do it if you care about doing it
so see the paradox and strangeness of absolute truth is
that since it's undivided by anyone's mind it's one and
it's singular therefore you can't even speak about it in
terms of validation because usually the skeptics what they're looking
for is they're looking for some sort of external or
other validation of the truth this is a lot of
what the game of science is it's all about validation
so if for example if i discover something as a
scientist i might discover some fact the speed of light
let's say i said i discovered it's this it's x
and then someone and then and then as a scientist
thought you know i'm trained to doubt that and say
well maybe i made some mistakes in my methodology maybe
my experiment wasn't too good so i need to get
some other scientists who will independently verify run the experiment
himself and then and then they will get some result
why and only if x and y match can we
then agree that this is the true speed of light
and then you know the more scientists we bring into
this the more these independent experiments we do eventually we
can build a consensus of independent sort of cross-referencing experiments
and ultimately reach some sort of truth this is how
science protects itself but remember this is all operating within
the relativistic domain and then we carry over these expectations
remember i warned you about this we carry these over
into the non-dual domain and now we tend to want
to do the same thing with absolute truth and we
tend to want to say well if there is this
absolute truth in leo you've discovered it or somebody has
discovered it okay great but then let's validate it and
what do i tell you i tell you it can't
be validated and you say well if it can't be
validated it must be false that's how it works in
a relative domain that's not how it works in the
non-dual domain because in the non-dual domain you can't validate
the non-dual because validation itself requires two different observers a
division within reality and two different experiments and two different
results and then combining those together into some sort of
synthesis this all involves duality and relativity in the non-dual
domain there is no possibility of validation you can't ask
your neighbor to validate non-duality for you then of course
you say well but leo if it can't be validated
in the classical sense then how can you ever know
that it's true and you think that that's a bug
of this system it's not this is the core feature
of non-duality is that precisely because there's no other against
which to validate it whatever it is automatically makes it
absolutely true it's absolutely true by virtue of being completely
one singular and sovereign it's literally absolutely sovereign that means
it defines what it is this is very strange loopy
and foreign to those of us who are operating under
the sort of dualistic relativistic materialistic way of looking at
truth to really bring this home point to you and
to show you how this works i actually have an
episode where i go into this in a lot of
detail called how authority works it's one of my underrated
episodes go watch it it's actually very profound and it's
very relevant to this issue here so see here's my
question to you how do you know that you exist
right now don't just give me a a parroted answer
i want you to actually become conscious right now of
how it is you know that you exist you may
not know what you are you may be unsure about
that you might be doubtful but you certainly right now
are conscious that you exist this is true in fact
it's absolutely true your existence is absolute truth right now
become conscious of your own existence right now to me
it helps to like look at my hand as i
do that so take out your hand and look at
your hand and just become conscious that what you're conscious
of right here right now it absolutely exists there's no
possibility of it not existing when it is existing you
might say oh leo but i what if i'm a
computer simulation no no you don't get it it doesn't
matter if your computer simulation even if you think all
this is a computer simulation it exists right here right
now you're conscious of it that's absolutely true become conscious
of this don't think about it become conscious of it
see i'm going to tell you something very radical here
that you're probably going to doubt but i'll say it
anyways the only one in the universe who can tell
you that you exist is yourself think about it you
might initially think like no leah that can't be true
because i can ask my neighbor i can ask my
pack and call my mom and ask her mom do
i exist and she will say yes of course you
exist and in this way i can validate that i
exist and that i'm not crazy well if you think
that you don't understand the depth of this problem of
sovereignty and authority when you call your mother and your
mother tells you that you exist see the only reason
you accept that answer as validation of anything as your
of your existence for example is because you already accept
that you exist if you didn't already accept that you
existed and that she existed then she couldn't use her
existence to validate your existence you see for her existence
to exist it has to exist within your existence so
when you call her in a sense you're begging the
question because you're already admitting to yourself that you exist
just by calling her and asking her to validate your
existence because you're assuming that she exists you're doing all
this implicitly unconsciously without being conscious of what you're doing
therefore to you it might seem like this is an
actual proof of something it's not an actual proof of
anything what's really going on in this case is that
you exist that's the bottom line you exist and then
everything else that you use to validate your existence is
already layered upon your existence is a second order effect
of your own existence right because your mother can't exist
without you first existing your mother if you think about
it has only ever existed in your existence her existence
has never been separate from your existence in fact the
idea of your existence your mother's existence is already one
of those divisions that you've made in reality there really
is no such thing as your existence my existence my
mother's existence there's only existence in fact existence is absolute
truth here it is look existence existence absolutely exists it
sort of seems obvious when he put it that way
but what i'm saying is is so radically profound do
not assume that you understand what i'm saying you don't
you're not conscious of what i'm saying even though it
might seem like these are just word games these are
not just word games it's not just word salad something
very substantial is being said here but you don't understand
what is being said because you're not conscious of it
yet if you did it would completely blow your mind
so you see my point is that you already are
relying upon a notion of absolute truth but you're not
honest with yourself about it and how you're relying upon
it is that you you believe you exist and you've
believed that your entire existence and you're not wrong about
that and when i say you i don't mean the
human self i mean existence itself i mean consciousness itself
consciousness itself exists consciousness is existence that's what we're talking
about so see you take that for granted and then
you use that in order to bootstrap your entire relative
framework of relative truths and then you want to use
that framework and reflect it back and try to use
it to then apply it to the non-dual absolute truth
and then when that fails to work you take that
as evidence of the fact that there is no absolute
truth and that whole spiel is your self-deception so the
self-deception you have to be worried about here is not
that you are hallucinating the absolute truth it's actually that
you are hallucinating its non-existence that's the self-deception so we
have a self-deception wrapped within a self-deception so when you
think that you are deceiving yourself by believing in absolute
truth as a possibility and you're doubting absolute truth that
doubt of the absolute truth is the self-deception that needs
to be cured in order to be able to access
absolute truth in fact this problem goes so deep that
even when people deconstruct much of their mind like i
teach and then they actually do get a brief glimpse
of absolute truth they get a brief glimpse of it
maybe for five minutes then they fall back down into
relativity into duality and then they start to second-guess themselves
and they start to say oh well but what if
that was just a hallucination what if that was just
some stuff happening in my brain in my mind neurons
and things and what if i was just imagining that
and i was constructing something that leo was talking about
the only reason i experienced this absolute truth was because
leo fed that idea to my mind for years through
these videos what i'm telling you is that when you
do that when you doubt the absolute truth that is
the delusion and you're not recognizing that you think by
doubting everything including the absolute truth that you're actually getting
yourself closer to truth and that turns out to be
the ultimate deception because doubt itself is something that's part
of the relative truth framework it's not part of nonduality
when you are conscious of absolute truth what i'm asking
you to open your mind to i'm asking you to
open your mind to this following radical thing is that
when you are conscious of the absolute truth there literally
is no more room left for doubt error or mistake
or delusion or the brains and neurons or a veil
of perceptions or human misunderstanding or human misperception or illusion
none of that can exist within absolute truth absolute truth
means you've pierced through every single veil so here's what
i'm asking you to really open your mind to is
your mind open to the possibility that you not anybody
else but you personally can pierce through absolutely every veil
of deception and reach the rock bottom of what reality
is is that possible and if your answer is no
then my question to you is how can you know
that what if you're wrong can you see that if
you're mistaken on this point and such a thing actually
is possible but you're wrong about it that you will
never be able to validate it for yourself because you
see unlike other things which can be validated to you
by others absolute truth is of such a kind that
it cannot be valid by any other literally that means
when you finally if let's say if you finally reach
absolute truth no human being will be able to validate
it for you not your mom not a scientist not
a doctor not a professor not your guru not even
leo it will only be you just like with your
own existence nobody and i mean nobody think about this
is radical there is not a single being in the
entire universe no matter how intelligent or advanced technologically whether
they're aliens or angels or whatever that can validate your
own existence to you no scientist can do it no
professor can do it no doctor can do it no
theologian no priest your parents can't do it nobody can
do it but you that means the only way you
can know that you exist is through your own existence
and there is no other way it's 100 direct there
is no veil there is no medium there is no
process by which you validate your own existence existence exists
it's too direct for there to be a process any
process you use to validate existence can you see that
that process is already too many steps removed from existence
itself because every step in the process itself has to
exist in order for it to lead to some sort
of conclusion so any proof for existence is absurd and
stupid literally stupid is what it is because if you
think you can prove existence through some mathematical formula or
through some scientific procedure or through some kind of experiment
or through calling your mom or by talking to an
alien through some sort of radio communication device if you
think you can prove your own existence that way you
you're being so stupid because that chain itself has to
exist for it to prove anything you see so literally
what i'm saying is that the only way you know
you exist is by existing and while that might seem
sort of obvious and sort of a hollow statement it's
actually not it's a deeply profound statement what i'm literally
telling you is that the only way that reality knows
it exists is through its own sovereign self-recognition of its
existence so see ordinarily we think that oh reality just
exists it just exists without us it just exists somehow
in some way we don't know how it just it's
just like this but no what i'm telling you is
that reality only exists if it recognizes its own existence
and if it doesn't then it can't exist this makes
reality itself absolute truth because that's what oneness is see
oneness infinity that which has no ends or bounds that
which has no other to it cannot have something outside
of it which it can reference relativistically to make a
proof to lean upon it can't be used as a
left there's no archimedean point is what i'm telling you
that you can leverage to actually challenge existence itself because
existence is all there is that's the nature of the
absolute there's nothing else you can compare or contrast it
with there's nothing else you can use to define it
the reason you can't put your finger on what existence
is is because anytime you use your words or your
mind to say oh existence is x existence is y
existence is z it has these property has these characteristics
anytime you're doing that you're you're dragging existence into from
the non-dual domain into the relative domain and in so
doing you are creating an opposite to existence which is
non-existence which doesn't actually exist so when you're doing that
you're not actually conscious of what existence is when you're
fully conscious of what existence is you actually can't say
what it is it's because it's literally undefinable you can't
define it because to define anything a definition of anything
requires at least two things the thing you're trying to
define and then the thing defining it but both those
things have to exist first you see everything boils down
to existence so existence itself is the absolute and what
do i mean by existence i mean everything so here
we get the ultimate strange loop and paradox which is
that when you actually become conscious of absolute truth you
will realize that there was always only the absolute truth
there never was a relative truth because the absolute has
no opposite see if you're living in a reality where
there is absolute truth on the one hand and then
there's relative truth on the other hand that already is
part of the relative domain because it's in the relative
domain that you have different kinds of truth in the
absolute domain there aren't different kinds of truth there's only
absolute truth so the deep profound paradox of absolute truth
is that while it seems like absolute truth is this
airy fairy notion that exists somewhere in the heavens that
can never be accessed the truth is exactly the opposite
is that the only thing that exists really is absolute
truth because it's absolutely everything and all the relative stuff
that you've been attached to your whole life has just
been stories spun by your mind which of course is
a part of the absolute truth but it's a lack
of consciousness of it it's a misconstrual of it it's
a misinterpretation now of course some of you who are
dense will say well leo but what if all yeah
this all sounds good it sounds like nice philosophy but
what if all of this is just a self-deception to
which i say what i'm pointing at is something beyond
what my words are able to communicate so when you
take the absolute truth and you turn it into stories
and words that i'm telling you and explanations even explanations
like this one they always become relativistic all my explanations
absolute truth are all relativistic they're all finite so yeah
this here in the in the relative domain you can
have self-deceptions but when you are directly conscious of the
absolute truth which you are not right now then it
can't be a self-deception and then the only question is
um are you gonna be wise enough to recognize that
this is a possibility that you can actualize and that
you haven't actualized it yet but that you could because
see it's hard to actualize something when you don't believe
you can even do it or that it's possible to
even do now you say billio but all of that
could just be experiences generated by neurons in the brain
no it can't if you think that you're operating the
relative domain you're not in the absolute you have to
enter the absolute see there's no way for you to
understand the absolute while sitting in the comfort of the
relative domain because the relative domain is illusion you have
to leave the relative domain and go and inhabit the
absolute non-dual domain you have to do that and then
that is how you validate it you say aha leo
but you said it couldn't be validated well it can't
be validated through anyone but yourself which is why i
talk about direct experience so much the only way reality
can know that it exists is through you it can't
exist in any other way but through you the mistake
that materialists and scientists have made is they've made the
mistake of assuming that reality can exist independently of your
existence this is an unscientific unprovable claim and it also
happens to be false and you will discover that it's
false if you ever enter into the absolute domain and
leave behind the relative domain so you see the relative
domain has extremely powerful hooks and anchors that it has
sunk into your mind deep deep deep into your psyche
that is keeping you anchored in the relative domain and
so the struggle here is is sort of snipping off
all those anchors and hooks that keep you attached but
of course as you're doing that you're literally detaching yourself
from what you consider reality because what you consider reality
is consensus reality it's the reality you generated with your
fellow human chimps uh through culture and through even science
science is part of culture by the way and through
external validation see you are so insecure about taking back
your full authority your absolute sovereignty as the the reality
that you are the universe that you are you're so
afraid of taking back your sovereignty of thinking for yourself
of validating your own truth that you want somebody else
some other human to validate for you want some guru
you want some professor you want some scientist you want
somebody with a big name with a lots of charisma
lots of passion you want someone like me to validate
it for you and in so doing you will never
reach absolute truth and you will forever be deluded that
is the chief delusion and that is what i explained
in my episode called how authority works see you are
unwittingly giving away your authority to imaginary others out there
that you created by dividing reality into multiple consciousnesses and
you think that by dividing reality into multiple consciousnesses and
giving your authority to those other conscious whether it's your
parents your government officials or your you know your tv
pundits or whoever you watch on youtube or some guru
you like or whatever priest you listen to or some
textbook you read or some scientist you you enjoy listening
to whoever the authority is you rely on those people
to tell you who you are and that you exist
and what's true because the truth is is that if
you didn't rely on any of you if you cut
all those umbilical cords all that would be left is
you and your own mind which then literally means that
whatever your mind imagines becomes the absolute truth and that
is what you're terrified of because then you literally have
the sovereignty of god your imagination becomes absolute then when
you dream your dream becomes absolute reality and by that
i don't mean that you dream of money and then
you wake up and there's a bunch of money in
your bank account no no i mean when you are
dreaming about money at night when you're sleeping that dream
is absolutely true as true as what's happening here right
now that does not mean you're gonna get a bunch
of money in your bank account so don't get your
hopes up that's what you're really terrified of what you're
ultimately your mind is protecting you from realizing this why
because in a sense this is what you perceive madness
to be what you perceive madness to be is being
so lost inside your own mind that you can't tell
the difference anymore between what's real and what's unreal humans
have classified this as insanity or as something that's a
problem and it can be a problem if it's done
in a dysfunctional way but if it's done in a
functional way where you're fully conscious of what you're doing
and you're not abusing it then what actually happens is
that you discover the ultimate truth and the ultimate truth
is that the entire universe is your imagination at work
and your imagination is completely sovereign which is why your
reality feels real no matter how crazy your beliefs and
ideas are have you ever wondered why you know religious
fanatics do crazy things why people believe crazy things and
behave in crazy ways the maga people the anti-vaxx people
the provacs people the uh the corporate people you know
the muslims the jews the the atheists you know all
these people they're all crazy they're all living in their
own bubble realities and they're acting as though their reality
is the truth why is that well because the ultimate
truth is that their imaginations and their above they're spinning
their bubbles they're spitting their realities that's god constructing reality
and whatever reality you're dreaming up is the reality you're
inhabiting and that's what feels real to you and if
you're imagining that you can't walk through a wall that's
what your reality becomes and you're terrified of learning that
because then you're all alone see you can't even ask
somebody else to validate this for you when you realize
what i'm telling you you might think like oh i'm
gonna i'm gonna email leo and i'm gonna just double
check let me double check with leo if i got
if i got this right now if you're emailing leo
to validate this then you haven't got it it's completely
you you're completely sovereign you're completely absolute but you don't
want to accept that because it's too much responsibility to
bear and it leaves you feeling all alone [Music] and
then you can't tell what's up what's down what's good
what's bad what's left what's right what's true what's false
what's real what's unreal because all those distinctions melt away
and then what you're left with is you're left with
absolute consciousness absolute truth which is precisely what all this
is right now right now you exist as absolute truth
that's all there is the problem is that your mind
has misconstrued for your entire life what this life this
experience we call life what it is it isn't a
veil of perception there aren't atoms behind the scenes there
aren't mathematical calculations happening in the universe behind the scenes
there aren't physical laws behind the scene somewhere running this
show this is it reality is precisely what it appears
to be consider that radical possibility open your mind to
the possibility that what is real what is true is
exactly what is before you right now stop imagining any
more layers to reality than what you see consider for
a moment this radical possibility that this is it absolute
truth does not look like numbers or computer simulations or
angels or bearded men in the clouds or atoms or
quarks or strings or multiverses or universes it doesn't look
like that it looks exactly like this right now this
is it this this you this is absolute truth and
everything else is you're imagining which is still part of
the absolute truth but it is imaginary when you think
of quarks and brains and neurons and experiences and veils
of perception and different spectra of electromagnetic radiation to which
you're not privy to when you think about different conscious
entities when you think about rattlesnakes and bats and dolphins
and whales and all their ways of perceiving the world
when you think about angels and devils and you think
about aliens perceiving the world in different ways all of
that is this right now you're imagining it right now
isn't that true don't believe me take a look take
a look anything i'm saying that's true is only true
because it's present for you right now if it's not
present for you it's not true something else is true
for you because you're imagining that something else whatever that
is see like if you imagine like some new age
people do some new age people imagine that they're aliens
from other planets star seeds and arcturians and whatever else
see if you imagine deeply enough that you're an alien
from other planet that becomes your reality and nobody and
i mean nobody can change that if you want to
believe you're an alien and you really want to go
go with it all the way you can believe it
and no matter what anybody tells you you'll keep believing
it and believing it and believing it and it'll just
become your reality after all that's exactly what you did
to become human see the only difference is that it
was a little bit easier for you to become a
human because when you started to believe that you're a
human people weren't naysaying you and saying oh you're bad
for believing you're a human how dare you you're insane
which they would do if you tell them that you're
an alien but see when you became a human the
way you did it is you just started to believe
you're human and you started imagining more and more that
you're human you're human you're human and then others around
you because they were doing the same thing because you're
playing the same game they kept reinforcing in you yeah
you're a human you're a good human you're a good
human good human bad human bad human bad human don't
do that don't believe this that's bad this is good
believe this don't believe you're an alien that's bad believe
you're a human that's good don't believe you're a cat
or a dog that's bad believe you're a human that's
good right and they kept doing they kept reinforcing that
in you more and more and more and then you
grew up that way and then now you think you're
a human and you think you're actually a human and
you think you were born a human and you think
that there's no other way you could be and you
think that this is a scientific truth but you see
if we took a human and we just did that
and we just replaced human with alien we could raise
a human that believed he's an alien just using the
exact same process just through just through social pressure and
reinforcement and that person would legit believe that he's an
alien yeah it's it's twisted it's heavy stuff heavy stuff
not not very easy to to swallow all this so
see um what's really crucial the whole point of all
this is that i want to preempt a trap for
you the trap i want to preempt is this is
that some of you doing this work will actually maybe
within a year or two stumble upon absolutely you'll get
a glimpse of it you'll get a 5 10 20
minute glimpse maybe a 60 minute glimpse of it maybe
during a psychedelic experience maybe through some meditation through some
yoga through some shamanic breathing maybe through a you know
through a solo retreat you'll get a glimpse of it
but then what will happen is that you'll come crashing
back down and then your mind will try to protect
you from that by telling you oh well that was
just a trip oh that's just hallucination oh it's just
neurons in the bra it's just an experience it was
just a mystical experience and there's no way to validate
it and then you'll forget about it and drop back
down into your human life and in this way you
will never fully actualize absolute truth and you'll never fully
get a a real a real deep deep experience of
it because a little glimpse of it is not the
same as a deep experience of it to get the
deep experience of it you have to really really embrace
the oneness the sovereignty take full responsibility take back all
of your authority really understand that nobody will validate it
for you and that that is not a bug that's
a feature and this is actually what you want you
want to become absolute what does it mean to be
absolute you can't be absolute unless you're sovereign about the
construction of your reality to be absolute means that you
recognize that this reality is your responsibility and no one
else's nobody else is doing it you are doing it
nobody else is to blame nobody else can validate your
existence nobody else can tell you whether you're sane or
insane nobody can tell you whether you're being a good
person or a bad person a moral person or not
a moral person a spiritual person or not a spiritual
nobody can tell you whether you're doing your spirituality right
or wrong only you can figure that out and know
that and it's from that that comes the ultimate confidence
the ultimate strength and unshakeable unwavering imperturbability a groundedness you're
grounded in the absolute at that point now some people
here will object and they'll say but leo what if
somebody follows this advice they do that and then they
delude themselves because they they do it in the wrong
way and then they they start to believe that they're
an alien or something and then they you know they're
100 confident about it that they're this alien or that
they they're 100 confidence that that that the world is
coming to an end so they have to go out
there and murder people or they're 100 confident that that
that because everything is love that they're allowed to go
around raping people to which my answer is yes that
is certainly possible there are a million ways to this
up er and for for every one person that succeeds
in actualizing what i'm talking about there will be a
thousand who become murderers and rapists and cult leaders and
exploiters and manipulators and criminals and in wind up in
a saint asylums but you know what that's already the
case that's already the case in the relative paradigm in
which we're living the material is paradigm which we're living
we already got plenty of terrorists and murderers and rapists
and thieves and criminals and corporate raiders and uh white-collar
criminals and and you know swindlers and grifters and corrupt
politicians and dictators and child abusers and animal abusers we
already got millions of those people we got millions of
mentally ill people we got millions of depressed people we've
got millions of bipolar people we've got millions of psychotic
people so that that why don't you count those against
the materialist paradigm against the relative duelist paradigm so you
you seem to to take every little every little hiccup
that happens along the non-dual path you take it as
against the non-dual path but then all the the war
the slavery the genocide the corporate exploitation the wage slavery
the actual slavery the uh religious indoctrination the scientific blunders
and disasters and uh you know wars and technological death
that is caused by pharmaceuticals and by nuclear weapons by
radiation by heavy metals you take all that and you
completely ignore all that and then as soon as there's
a little hiccup on the non-dual path you say oh
that that means the non-dual path is so dangerous well
how much more dangerous is it than what you're doing
already what you've been doing your whole life what you've
been seeing on the news that's the dual path what
you've been seeing on the news the nature of the
absolute is that anything you think or imagine about the
absolute is not the absolute that's the paradox but there's
a further paradox which makes it even more of a
mind which is this is that at the same time
everything that you think and imagine about the absolute is
the absolute but not at the level at which you
think it is try interpreting that correctly if this sounds
like word salad if it sounds like zen it's because
there's a reason why zen sounds like zen because you
can't bring the absolute into the relative and speech is
the relative language is relative logic is relative you cannot
do logic on the absolute at least not the kind
of logic you're used to there's a sort of different
kind of higher order we might call it sort of
an infinite logic an undue logic but it's it's a
it's a very paradoxical logic the absolute cannot ever be
spoken or thought of without paradox or contradiction this is
not a bug this is a feature because the absolute
is total it's all-encompassing and it's one so make a
distinction please between two types of absolute to make this
more confusing there's absolute with a lowercase a and absolute
with an uppercase a absolute with an uppercase a is
what i'm pointing at when i'm talking about the absolute
so anytime i say the word absolute i'm actually just
using a word a relative word absolute as separate from
relative these are two words concepts thoughts when i say
the word absolute that is not the actual thing the
actual thing is what the word is pointing at but
can never be spoken that's the uppercase a absolute so
the lowercase absolute is just a concept it's an idea
you have an idea of absolute you have an idea
of god you have an idea of infinity of an
idea of love you have an idea of everythingness you
have an idea of nothingness these are all ideas these
are not the same thing as the actual things those
words point at but also they are because language and
words are part of the absolute but they're not the
the entirety of it and it's not what we're concerned
with in this conversation then i want you to make
a further distinction i want you to make a distinction
between absolute truth as the actual thing being pointed at
versus as dogma and as ideology see so there's a
pre-trans fallacy that happens here see one of the problems
with teaching about the absolute from a higher level perspective
from a sort of spiral dynamics tier two perspective is
that those at tier one when they hear about absolute
truth they will misconstrue it as pre-rational falling into the
pre-trans fallacy and they will construe it as like oh
well leo is talking about the absolute truth that means
he must be some sort of crackpot a religious fanatic
cult leader because he actually believes that his beliefs are
true absolutely true but that is not what leo is
saying leo is saying something much much much more nuanced
and more radical and complex than this i'm saying something
trans not pre by trans what i mean is that
so see there's sort of three levels that humans go
through the first level is that humans get mired in
absolute truth as ideology and dogma this is what you
see in the middle east a lot this is what
you see in evangelical christian circles orthodox religious traditions fall
into the sort of spider dynamic stage red and blue
absolute truth they actually believe that jesus was this was
the son of god this sort of stuff like they
take the bible literally as absolute truth this is a
very low level of cognitive development this is the pre
stage then you grow out of that and you reach
the stages orange and green where now you realize that
that stuff wasn't literally true the you know the stories
in the bible aren't literally true uh they're mostly just
myths and exaggerations and so forth um you realize that
at stage orange and green and then to you people
who claim absolute truth those seem like lunatics you want
nothing to do with those people they seem unscientific they
seem religious they seem uh small-minded they seem myopic they
seem bigoted because usually people who latch onto absolute truth
you know they are bigoted literally they're bigoted because their
mind is so closed off to that little perspective but
you have to understand that that is not really absolutely
true that is just beliefs and dogma and then so
people who are at stage orange and greens is perhaps
one of the most dangerous stages because here you actually
are going to university you're reading books you're studying science
mathematics logic and all this post-modernism maybe even a little
bit you're studying this stuff you're understanding this stuff and
now it seems to you that you have the scientific
worldview that now you understand that relative truth i mean
that absolute truth is just all you know human constructions
and such and dogmas and now finally you're free of
such a such a silly notion and you think you've
made it well you haven't made it you're stuck in
the middle now there's the trans level the really complex
advanced stuff which is what i'm talking about the position
i'm talking about is the place that okay so you've
discovered that those were all myths and stuff in the
bible and so forth but then what about the actual
that the bible was pointing to you say oh well
that stuff it didn't exist the bible was pointing to
nothing and that's where you're wrong the bible was pointing
to something it was horribly corrupted and misconstrued but the
bible was pointing to something what was the bible pointing
to what was jesus pointing to what was the buddha
pointing to what was moses pointing to what was muhammad
pointing to they were pointing to absolute truth with capital
a but you can't speak it you can't logic it
you can't science it you can't run experimental you can't
validate it and so the problem is that whenever i
speak from that level people assume that i'm speaking from
just a religious dogmatic level and and that's really a
shame that's the pre-trans fallacy so watch out for that
and it'll happen to you too if you're gonna be
teaching others about this stuff it'll happen to you people
will you know even even just using the word god
see sometimes i hesitate to use the word god because
i know that in any episode where i use the
word god immediately half the audience will think that i'm
a stage blue religious fanatic or a christian or an
evangelical or something just for saying the word god that
just just for saying that word and then sometimes people
say well leo why use that word it's such a
religiously loaded word it's it's not a good word use
a word like nothingness or something it's better use a
word like the universe it's better um but uh but
actually when you realize that you're god you'll you'll understand
why that word is used it's the perfect word the
problem is it's corrupted but uh it's always going to
be corrupted any word you use for god will end
up corrupted so you can't avoid that problem it's just
nature of the beast because you can't translate the absolute
into any words notice you know you might wonder leo
how do i know if a truth is conceptual or
i mean sorry if a truth is relative or if
a truth is absolute well an easy way to know
if a truth is relative is that notice that all
relative truths are conceptual that means is your truth at
the level of language or logic or thought or mind
or concepts then it's a relative truth absolute truth is
at the level of being being so a great analogy
that i like to use here is the lego analogy
the lego analogy is look we have lego blocks we
can build any shape we want with them we can
build a pirate ship we can build a castle whatever
let's assume we're going to build a one of those
medieval castles so um in this analogy the lego blocks
themselves are the absolute truth and the shape that the
blocks create that's the relative truth so the castle is
relative the legos themselves are not their absolute do you
see the difference can you see that the shape of
the lego castle is a second order effect of the
blocks there's a hierarchical dependency in that the legos can
exist without the castle but the castle can't exist without
the legos likewise for example you can have existence with
no proof but you can't have proof without existence you
see because truth is prior to proof likewise you can
exist without other people but other people can't exist without
you because all other people exist within you so you
are the lego block and the other people in your
life are the castle that is built with those blocks
this is why you can't use them to validate truth
for you because you are prior to other people you
exist prior to all humans including your own human self
therefore you cannot use a human to validate that which
is prior to humans i mean this is this is
very basic common sense stuff it's just that people don't
like to think about it very much so the absolute
just to be clear the absolute is the actual building
blocks of which everything is composed in other words if
we want to use a term from velocity of science
the absolute is qualia colors sounds feelings emotions tastes smells
thoughts these sort of sense perceptions we might say this
is the substratum of which reality is composed and everything
else is secondary is not composed of atoms atoms are
composed of colors and thoughts and feelings and sensations science
has that relationship inside out and that's why it's so
confused and that's why it's stuck with the hard problem
of consciousness here's another helpful analogy to distinguish between relative
and absolute truth if you think of the sherlock holmesian
universe the fictional universe of sherlock holmes and you know
victorian england or wherever and whenever you know his universe
takes place um there are truths within the fictional universe
of sherlock holmes you know facts facts that we could
cite i haven't actually read the sherlock holmes books but
if you read the books you can make factual claims
like for example sherlock holmes lives in a house on
such and such a street with such and such a
house number is that true or is that false it's
one or the other or you could say sherlock holmes
is either married or unmarried one of them is true
one of them is false he has children or he
doesn't true or false his parents are still alive or
they're dead true or false um he has a a
detective partner named watson true or false and so and
so on you know we can generate a list of
factual statements about the sherlock holmes's you know fictional universe
do the cars drive on the right or on the
left in the sherlock holmes and universe supposedly that's like
a fact i don't know it depends on how the
author set that up those would all be relative truths
what are they relative to they're relative to how the
author chose to write the story see the author could
have written the story otherwise author could have given sherlock
holmes a different street address different house number uh a
wife or children or his parents could have died or
they could still be alive or you know any number
of things cars can drive on whatever side of the
road of the city that the author wants because it's
a fictional universe it's a dream it's imaginary but we
can still make factual statements about how the author chose
to write that particular story and that is what science
is doing in our dream world here that we call
life so when science is making its objective factual statements
it's doing exactly the same thing as we would do
with the fictional universe of sherlock holmes so there's no
surprise that it works yes it works in a relative
sense it's true in a relative sense it's true that
sherlock holmes has a partner named watson does that make
watson real does that make sherlock holmes any more real
no they're still fictional characters the relative truth doesn't care
about the actual reality of what it's talking about because
all it is is just a comparison likewise with what
science is doing here like do science ask the question
whether atoms are real or not no science doesn't care
whether atoms are real or not all it cares about
is just measuring what's there and manipulating it does science
care if the moo the moon is real or not
no landing a land landing a man on the moon
has nothing to do with the reality of the moon
you can land a man on an imaginary moon as
long as the man is imaginary too that's the mind
of all this so even though that whole sherlock holmesian
universe is a fiction it is imaginary it is a
dream and it is all relative and it could have
been imagined otherwise the way it's being imagined itself is
absolutely true do you get that the substance we might
say the actual physical book on which the sherlock holmesian
story is written that would be analogous to absolute truth
in this metaphor see the actual substrate of the book
is existence the book exists it's consciousness it exists in
your consciousness and that is absolutely true so you see
contrary to what many people think about the absolute and
the relative you know people fall into one side of
the other is that we have people who become dogmatic
absolutists like religious fanatics that becomes a huge toxic problem
they give absolutism a bad name and then we have
people who become the opposite of that the polar opposite
is like total relativists and they believe everything is just
everything is just open to interpretation everything is just purely
subjective there is no absolute truth the truth is just
whatever we want it to be and then they they
create all sorts of disasters as well this becomes a
problematic world view as well um the truth is somewhere
actually in between it's kind of intertwined it's that the
absolute and the relative these are not polar opposites but
rather these are deeply intertwined like a double strand of
dna helix aspects of one unified whole reality relativity is
not a contradiction of the absolute and the absolute truth's
existence is not a contradiction of relativity it's actually the
two perfectly seamlessly cohesively add up together like the yin
yang symbol so technically absolute truth cannot be spoken but
it can be spoken about which is what all spiritual
teachings are whether it's the bible or buddhism or what
i teach it's speech about the absolute and this speech
you have to be very careful because it it comes
with inherent limitations all speech has these inherent limitations spiritual
speech is not immune to these limitations and they all
must always be kept in mind so spiritual speech is
not the absolute itself but it can point to the
absolute as hopefully this speech is doing but also at
the same time of course speech itself is not separate
from the absolute and the absolute is not separate from
the relative if you think the relative is here and
the absolute is somewhere out there you got it wrong
the relative and the absolute are exactly standing in the
same place overlapping each other which is why they're so
difficult to distinguish and to see one or the other
because usually you're only seeing one or the other but
not both at the same time because they're so overlapping
they're so close to each other there's no distance between
them you have to be very clear about which you're
speaking about the absolute or the relative this leads to
a uh a set of traps uh which i call
conflating of the relative and the absolute and vice versa
and this is common you see this made a lot
of times by newbies who get into this work and
even by advanced teachers who have already reached the absolute
then they make a conflation in the opposite direction so
i want to give you some examples of this conflation
because i see it happening all the time on my
forum in the comments sections and hey i'm guilty of
committing it myself i'll give you some examples of that
too so what happens with this conflation is that you
become conscious either of the relativity of nature or the
absoluteness of nature and then you get stuck on that
one way of looking at the world or at nature
and then you you try to carry over the lessons
from the absolute into the relative and from the relative
to the absolute and it becomes a a mess because
you're not carefully distinguishing the two so here are some
examples of relative speech about the absolute um that that
easily gets misunderstood and taken as the absolute so for
example we are all one is that true yeah is
that absolute truth actually no it's a relative truth because
all speech is relative truth it's a relative truth about
the absolute it's pointing to something how about the statement
the brain does not exist is that true yes relatively
true is it absolutely true uh it's pointing to some
absolute truth that you could access and the sentence itself
when it's uttered is absolute truth um but at a
sort of a first order level not a second order
level that you usually think of it as reality is
hallucination is that true it's relatively true it's relative speech
about the absolute everything is consciousness again that's a relative
speech about the absolute you are god that's also relative
speech about the absolute the purpose of life is waking
up that's also relative speech about the absolute nothing is
good or bad that's also relative speech about the absolute
life is meaningless that's relatively true science is a human
invention and science is relative that's relatively true other people
do not exist that's relatively true there is no one
to become enlightened that's relatively true you have no control
over reality that's relatively true enlightenment happens by itself that's
relatively true you are immortal that's relatively true death is
impossible that's relatively true but none of those statements themselves
are what they are pointing to here are some examples
of conflations that happen for example nothing is good or
bad so it's okay if i steal see nothing in
good or is good or bad that's sort of a
that's a that's a relative statement that you get from
accessing the absolute when you access the absolute you'll realize
nothing is good or bad okay but then you can
bring that back into the relative domain and say well
if nothing is good or bad that means i guess
i can steal that's a mistake now of course don't
get me wrong you can steal and stealing is not
wrong per se in the absolute sense but in the
relative sense stealing is a problem and that's where stealing
occurs stealing doesn't occur in the absolute sense stealing occurs
in the relative domain and when you get punished for
stealing and when people criticize you and judge you for
stealing they're going to be doing that from the relative
domain of survival and the reason you're probably stealing is
also from relative reasons like you want food or you
want luxury or you want money or you want freedom
whatever that's why you steal so so you have to
be very careful about how you bring back and distort
lessons from the absolute into the relative domain because the
ego loves to do that oh yes it does because
see you get a glimpse of the absolute but the
ego is still not fully dead and the ego will
come back and it'll co-opt that truth and use it
for its own egoic purposes for survival to enhance the
survival how about statement like life is meaningless that is
a truth you will realize if you access the absolute
but then you can bring it back down to the
relative and you can say well if life is meaningless
then i'm going to sit on my couch and watch
television that's what i should do because life is meaningless
but no that's not what life is meaningless actually means
that's a distortion that's a conflation how about the statement
reality is a hallucination that's something you'll realize if you
access the absolute but then you bring it try to
bring it back down into the relative you say well
if reality is hallucination that means i can walk through
walls right no wrong because the walls of your house
being unwalked through-able is your hallucination therefore of course you
can't walk through them because you're hallucinating that you can't
just like in a dream you see like um in
your dreams at night when you sleep what keeps you
from falling through the floor of your house because after
all the floor of your house in your dream isn't
made out of anything solid it's not have atoms so
the question is why don't you fall through the floor
so the answer is exactly the same reason as why
you don't fall through the floor wherever you're standing or
sitting right now there's no difference because you're hallucinating the
floor in both cases um another absolute sort of truth
is that there is no one to become enlightened that's
true in a sense um but then you can sort
of misconstrue that in the relative domain like a newbie
might hear that it might say oh well if there's
no one to become enlightened that means it's impossible to
become enlightened and that would be false it is possible
another example like this is enlightenment happens all by itself
it's a spontaneous occurrence an act of grace you've heard
certain spiritual teachers preach this some newbie who is stuck
in the relative domain might hear that and misconstrue that
and then conflate it and say oh well that means
i should stop meditating if enlightenment happens by itself then
why meditate of course that's a gross misconstrual of that
teaching how about the teaching that the ego has no
control over your life that's something you'll realize when you
awaken to the absolute but then you can misconstrue that
and then someone who let's say is struggling to lose
weight in the relative domain they might say oh well
you know i can't lose weight because the ego has
no control so i just can't control myself i just
eat everything oh yeah well then how come i can
lose weight i also don't have an ego just like
you but for some reason i'm able to lose weight
but you're not maybe that's just an egoic excuse maybe
you actually do have that ego and it's sneaking in
with all these excuses about why you can't lose weight
see whether you have an ego or you don't you
can lose weight you can gain weight the ego has
really no say on whether you can gain or lose
weight here's another common funny one that i get sometimes
sometimes we say we are all one right you say
that as a spirit teacher and then some some snarky
um you know troll in the comments section says i'm
like oh well leo if we're all one why don't
you send me all your money again a conflation of
the absolute and the relative see if we're all one
why would i need to send you all my money
if we're all equally one why don't you send me
your money that's equally plausible why do you have this
bias of me sending you money as soon as you
send me some money maybe i'll send you some money
see what goes around comes around um here's another one
um leo you say that you're immortal okay yeah from
the from the from the absolute perspective you are immortal
but then but then someone might say oh leo so
then you don't mind if i if i shoot you
no actually i do mind if you shoot me because
i still also live in the relative domain of survival
and shooting me is about survival and i do care
about my survival and you might say well you're a
hypocrite because you're not supposed to care about your survival
but nothing about being immortal says i'm not supposed to
care about my survival as a human because the human
self is relative and it's mortal and it's finite and
if you have certain relative objectives like if you want
to teach people then you got to maintain your body
you got to eat well you got to you know
shower you got to go to the bathroom you got
to take care of your sexual needs in a healthy
way you gotta earn money and so forth so there's
no contradiction between this these things um sometimes people say
oh well if you're enlightened why do you charge money
for teachings well i would happily not charge any money
for teachings if the world didn't expect money from me
for survival see i charge money for teachings because i
gotta eat and i can't go to the grocery store
and pay them with enlightenment i got to pay them
with cold hard cash that's what people want um and
you know if i want a house to live in
i can't just go to the real estate agent and
and you know look at them with a sort of
eckhart tolle eyes and get a free house they're gonna
want a you know a cart hard cold check which
requires money and i can't teach unless i live in
a house and i eat food because that's what survival
entails and if you can't understand that then you've got
more study to do more contemplating to do here's another
conflation that might happen is that someone hears me talking
about the absolute or about god like a christian hears
me say that or uh you know a muslim hears
me talking about allah or something and then they say
oh well that means that my religion is true no
it doesn't mean that there's actually a lot of within
your religion and the way you're misinterpreting your religion is
deeply false and the god and the absolute that i'm
talking about is further away from your religion than probably
atheism is but you know you just hear the word
absolute you hear the word god and then in your
mind to your ego it sounds good to validate whatever
you existing your existing beliefs are how about this one
uh you know maybe your girlfriend asks you did you
cheat on me and you because you're this absolutely awakened
non-dual master you say well cheating is just a social
construct baby get over it see when you do that
you're conflating the absolute with the relative and see the
ego is extremely crafty and it will do this when
you do reach high levels of awakening if you ever
do uh watch out because there's your mind is still
going to be sneaky it's still going to be around
and it's going to be using the absolute in all
sorts of ways like this you might actually go cheat
on somebody and then justify it to yourself as like
well you know i have too much love in my
heart to just commit myself to one person so i'm
going gonna sleep around with everybody and it's okay because
i'm just so loving you might do that easily even
if you're enlightened uh here's how about another one you
know i say that the brain is imaginary from the
absolute perspective that's correct there's no brain you're imagining it
but but see in the relative domain of survival and
that's where the that's where the word brain really comes
from brain is a relative word uh in that domain
for example if you drink dirty heavy metal polluted water
like your tap water filled with mercury and lead and
stuff if you drink that tap water every day for
years that might destroy your brain's health you might become
depressed you might even become suicidal and psychotic after enough
of that poisonous water and then you might say oh
leo but but you said there's no brain so supposedly
i should be able to drink a glass of mercury
with no problem no that's not what it means to
say there's no brain brain is a relative notion and
drinking a glass of mercury is also a relative notion
and if you do you're going to encounter another relative
notion called heavy metal toxicity that's also a relative notion
and then you might discover another relative notion which is
called illness and suffering and then you might discover the
ultimate relative notion which is called death and then you
know if you're okay with that then you'll die but
if you're not which you probably aren't then it's probably
not a good idea to drink a glass of mercury
how about this everything is love and since everything is
love that means junk food is love leo why demonize
junk food junk food is good because everything is good
god created everything including junk food so that means i
can eat all the junk food in the world right
well you see the problem there pretty obvious sometimes it's
said that there is no path to awakening and then
some newbie will hear that and interpret it as well
if there's no path that means i can awaken just
by continuing my ordinary life i don't need to meditate
i don't need to study i don't need to practice
i don't need to self-inquire and then of course he'll
never awaken how about this in the absolute sense you
might discover one day that everything is perfect and good
and then you might take that and then you might
misconstrue it in the relative domain like this where you
might you might say well if everything is perfect and
good then what's the problem with suffering why should we
care about reducing people's suffering in the world well of
course suffering is a relative problem and reducing people's suffering
is a relative concern at the absolute level it doesn't
matter whether people suffer or not but at the relative
level it does matter mostly because the suffering comes back
around to you see you might not care about the
suffering of your neighbors but then if your neighbors suffer
enough they'll come and inflict some suffering on you and
on your children on your family and then you'll probably
care even if you are awakened you'll probably still care
it's not hard to make you care about the relative
pretty easy all you have to do is stick your
nuts in a vice or stick a needle in your
eye and you'll you'll very quickly start to care about
the relative neo advice left to say that you're already
awake and that there's no need for enlightenment because you're
already enlightened everyone's already enlightened yeah that's sort of true
from the absolute perspective but see they commit the sort
of opposite mistake is that they go so deep into
the absolute that they then can't teach properly meeting students
where they're at see the student coming to a neo-inviting
for awakening advice is not coming from the absolute perspective
they're coming from the relative perspective so the student needs
relativistic teachings the rel the proper relativistic teaching to a
student is enlightenment is is very difficult to do it
takes years of work sometimes decades of work uh you
need gonna meditate your ass off you gotta read books
you gotta study you gotta do self-inquiry you gotta practice
yoga take psychedelics do all this and maybe you'll have
a chance in hell of becoming enlightened that's really the
practical advice at the relative level at the absolute level
you're already enlightened but that doesn't help a newbie how
about this sometimes i say death is imaginary at the
absolute level yes it is and then some newbie hears
that and says well leah then why don't you just
kill yourself but what's the connection if death is imaginary
why would i want to kill myself how about this
you are god you've heard me say that before and
then i might say i have an illness or i'm
sick and then you might wonder a newbie at the
relative stage might wonder well how is it possible that
god could be sick or could have an illness why
don't you just magically wave a magic god wand and
fix yourself heal yourself magically since you're god but that's
not how god works god includes sickness god includes cancer
god includes genetic disorders god includes toxicity um god includes
uh losing your your hand in a wood chipper god
is all those things so it's very very possible for
you to be enlightened and deeply awakened and still have
some sort of illness from genetics or from toxicity from
your environment or from improper diets or from the past
the way you used your body in the past or
abused it in the past through physical injury the way
you exercise or lack thereof there's there's or just old
age i mean everybody ages differently um when you realize
your god it's not that now you get to control
and manipulate everything the way you want it's actually the
opposite of that you surrender to the way everything is
so when you realize your god is not that you
you cure your cancer actually it's that you accept your
cancer and um you let it kill you if it
will if there's no other solution then you let the
cancer kill you but if there is a solution you
can you can work to try to you know fix
it get chemo or something you see people assume that
the way that god heals cancer is by waving a
magic wand no i mean it could be that but
it also could be god heals cancer by going to
a doctor and getting it surgically removed or getting some
chemo that's also a legitimate way to heal cancer and
sometimes god can't heal cancer and god dies from cancer
ramana maharshi died from cancer he is considered to be
one of the most enlightened people in the last century
uh how about this like leo you talk about birth
being imaginary yes it is from the absolute perspective and
then you might wonder leo but you also talk about
your past you talk about being a child you talk
about your past experiences that you've had how can you
reconcile those two things you talk about your parents i
thought your parents were imaginary yes when i'm talking about
my past or my parents i'm speaking relativistically i'm speaking
from i'm sort of speaking towards the consensus reality that
us humans have co-imagined together us humans culturally we have
a notion that we all have parents and we have
a past and so forth and we speak in this
way and it's a it's a convenient practical way to
speak that's why we created it because it's practical if
i had to explain to everybody that i'm talking to
about how birth is imaginary we i couldn't have a
conversation with people so i just ignore that part usually
you know if i'm speaking to uh to my accountant
about you know oh i asked the count oh how
are your kids and he asks me like oh what
were you up to last weekend and what am i
going to tell i'm going to say well last weekend
didn't really happen because i'm gone i'm just imagining it's
all just a hallucination am i going to tell them
that or am i going to say oh yeah last
weekend you know i went to a to a barbecue
i'll just tell them that because i'm speaking relativistically and
if someone asks me like leo what were you like
as a child i can still answer that it's going
to be relative to how i imagined myself i was
as a child i'm imagining myself as a child and
then i'm reporting it to you and that's that's what
my childhood is that's what yours is too but i
mean you can be conscious of it or not up
to you so you see there's all sorts of these
kinds of conflations that can happen these conflations can happen
in both directions most of these conflations i would say
would actually happen when a newbie at the relativistic stage
first starts to learn about the absolute but hasn't accessed
it himself yet a lot of conflation happens a lot
of gross distortions and ignorance but it can also happen
the other way where a teacher becomes so awake so
enlightened that then they they too easily dismiss the relativistic
perspective the survival perspective or they sort of talk down
and don't meet the student where he's at um for
example i caught myself doing this recently um with with
different with with a model like somebody on the forum
shared ken wilbur's uh four quadrants model and my initial
gut reaction reply to it was something like um like
oh it's just it's just a dualistic model sort of
a actually a quadratic not dualistic but more of a
quadratic model i sort of poked fun at it um
but then i realized to myself you know i'm being
too flippant and too conflating from the top sort of
down because what i noticed is that you know i
still use models i talk about spiral dynamics i talk
about the susan cagroiner model there's lots of models i
talk about so it's not per se that all models
are evil or bad it's just that like you have
to be you have to be fair if you're going
to criticize a model for being a model then you
got to criticize all your own models too so it's
not fair for me to criticize ken wilbur's model four
quadrant model for being a model when i'm also using
models so you have to be very kind of even-handed
in how you do criticisms and dismissals of stuff because
you can very easily dismiss a lot of stuff from
the absolute perspective i think that's sort of one of
the phases you'll go through is as you reach the
absolute and then you're communicating with sort of normies the
normies might say i'm like oh you know yesterday my
girlfriend broke up with me and now i'm suffering and
you'll just sort of brush it off and say oh
that suffering is just a it's just a dream or
you know um you know your friend loses a bunch
of money and you say oh money's just imaginary you
know just like who cares and then and then something
happens in the political system you say oh well politics
is all just and imagination and it's all just devilry
and it's not true it's all relative but you see
um very quickly you'll realize that this sort of cavalier
attitude isn't very healthy and it's not the most mature
form of of realization um because the reality is that
the relative domain is pretty damn important for most people
because most people are never going to reach your level
of consciousness and even you yourself might struggle to reach
your your own highest peaks of consciousness which you're sort
of taking your highest lessons from so what you have
to be very careful with here is be careful using
absolute truth to justify any kind of survival activities or
desires or needs of your own because the ego will
want to do that the ego will want to apply
absolute truth selectively for its own purposes ego loves to
play loose with the truth ego will relativize well sorry
will weaponize both relativity and the absolute in order to
fulfill its agenda and manipulate reality in whatever way it
can this is what lawyers do this is what criminals
love to do they're experts at doing this religious people
do this political commentators do this it's a very very
sticky trap and that's what's key to understand is that
you can the ego can exploit both absolutism and relativism
towards its own devilish purposes it's also important to understand
that relative truth even though it's not absolutely true by
definition uh it's still crucial to survival because all of
survival happens in the relative domain pretty much and survival
is pretty much what 99 of your life is preoccupied
with and pretty much all that you care about in
a sense to most ordinary people relative truth may as
well be absolute truth from their point of view because
they know nothing else that's the tragedy of their predicament
is that uh relative truth is completely untrue but they
treat it as though it's the only thing there is
and therefore it does in a sort of sense become
a sort of pseudo-absolute from their point of view again
which is why it's so powerful to then break free
because when you break free it is like flipping your
entire reality upside down and it creates a lot of
a lot of new possibilities in your life see murder
for example is a relative problem but it would be
a big problem for you if you got murdered because
all you basically know and care about is a relative
domain so even though murder is not a problem in
the absolute sense in a relative sense it's a very
big problem it's the biggest problem you can have in
the relative domain pretty much so be careful dismissing the
relative too quickly as long as you want to stay
alive for longer than a day you have to be
concerned about the relative domain no matter how enlightened you
are how awake you are how god realized you are
if you want to stay in the human form that's
a relative form it's finite and it requires certain survival
activities of you you got to feed the body water
the body uh you know clean the body take care
of the body and so on to make sure it
continues to function the ultimate problem with absolute truth is
that it's simply too big for it to be useful
precisely because it's everything is sort of like too much
to be able to manipulate or to handle for the
purposes of survival we can't use all of reality as
one we need to break reality down into pieces to
construct little minor relative truths that we can use those
to manipulate reality how we want and this is ultimately
why most people don't really focus on absolute truth and
they never find it is because how's it going to
help me because my whole life is concerned about this
little local corner of the universe that i live in
my little local troops that's all i care about that's
all i need to know in order to survive in
my little small way but what if the small narrow
way in which you've been living life becomes unsatisfying to
you what if you want to live a bigger life
well in that case you got to expand your perspective
more towards the absolute see from the absolute point of
view you can become enlightened right now for example but
from the relative point of view you need to do
lots of practice from the absolute point of view maslow's
hierarchy of needs doesn't matter at all sex doesn't really
matter money doesn't really matter self-esteem doesn't really matter creativity
doesn't really matter business success doesn't matter your social status
doesn't matter none of that matters from the absolute point
of view but from the relative point of view that
most of you are at that stuff matters a lot
and it's holding you back from awakening and in practice
for most humans to awaken they need to move very
high up maslow's hierarchy of needs see my episode called
using maslow's hierarchy of needs to self-actualize uh it's an
oldie but a goodie where i talk about that that's
one of the most practical and effective relative ways of
of awakening is just satisfy those basic needs that you
have fill the holes in your in your pyramid which
looks like a piece of swiss cheese you know fulfill
your sexual needs get your financial needs met get your
self-esteem in order get your social life in order once
you got all those things in order then awakening will
become much easier because you're not going to be desperate
and needy for all those other lower things you will
have experienced them you will have noticed the dissatisfaction with
all those things the insufficiency of all of them and
then you will be ready to move on and transcend
but if you're uh struggling your whole life for sex
and money and food what transcendence can there really be
now this is not an absolute rule you can always
awaken even if you are poor and sexually starved and
uh and hungry you can still awaken and there are
plenty of yogis and so forth and ascetics in india
who do so every year but that's not a path
that most normies will be able to follow and succeed
in and lastly let me conclude with why the absolute
is important you might be wondering like leo why spend
so much time talking about it um what's it gonna
do for me well that's already the wrong frame but
i know where you're coming from so here's some of
the stuff it'll kind of do for you first of
all it will be the most important experience of your
life there cannot be a more important life experience than
coming in contact with absolute truth because it's the highest
it's absolutely true secondly it recontextualizes your whole life see
my episode understanding recontextualization it radically re-contextualizes your whole life
in many areas of life including relationships business money uh
your own self-image how you relate to yourself um your
own shadow your health your career uh children love like
it's going to recontextualize so much stuff science what you
think science is society and culture all this will be
radically recontextualized uh and it'll have significant practical consequences it
won't just be theory there will be practical consequences it
eliminates fear hatred and suffering coming into contact with the
absolute defangs relative problems by putting them into proper perspective
and virtually all of human problems are simply a lack
of perspective it also cuts through human there's so much
human in our culture and it's very difficult to break
free of it until you access and ground yourself in
something that's outside of human invention which is the absolute
it's really good for that you don't even understand how
much this human bogs you down until you've escaped it
at least for a little while and basked in the
pureness and honesty of the absolute also the absolute is
the only ultimate source of true happiness true happiness is
the result of uh spiritual connection to the absolute so
the more connected you are to the absolute the happier
you're going to be and the less connected you are
the more miserable and depressed you're going to be no
matter what other external material conditions you set up for
yourself in life whether sexually financially recreationally or whatever so
if you feel like you're succeeding a lot in life
materially and you're you know you have a big house
and a big nice family and you got you got
plenty of sex and you got good fast cars and
you got good food and you travel all over the
world and you're doing great in business and then you
but you feel like still something is missing in your
life and it feels like no matter how hard you
work you're just spinning your wheels and being happier seems
to get harder and harder not easier and easier well
now it's time for you to turn your eyes towards
the absolute that's what you're missing also the absolute just
happens to be the answer to all of life's questions
at least all the most important ones do you really
want to understand what life is and why it is
and how it is then you need the absolute for
that it also answers a majority of the the profound
scientific questions you really want to do quality science you
really understand want to understand what science is you need
access to the absolute for that it's also just profoundly
beautiful there's nothing more beautiful than the absolute so if
you're a person who appreciates beauty within art within music
within film within games within life within nature within people
all that beauty where do you think it came from
it's the absolute manifesting as those things life really only
starts to make sense after discovering the absolute and that's
perhaps one of the most fulfilling things that the absolute
will give you is it just it gives you a
sort of a calm because you're no longer like this
pinball bouncing around in the pinball machine of life being
pushed hither and tethered by others reacting to others being
confused by what's going on and what's happening to you
and whether this is right or that is wrong and
and you're just bouncing around constantly this is what how
most people's lives are are like um discovering the absolute
just it grounds you it mellows you out it helps
you become non-reactive it gives you a nice very healthy
foundation upon which then you can build a healthy life
and there's more benefits but we'll keep it we'll keep
it short that should be enough to entice you all
right that's it i hope now you understand the difference
i hope now between relative and absolute i hope now
that you're not going to make these conflations both as
a newbie and also as an advanced practitioner once you
get there and i hope your mind is now open
to the possibility of the absolute and then the next
step after that is actually doing it actualizing it all
right that's it i'm done here please click that like
button for me don't forget and come check out actualize.org
that's my website on my website you will find resources
that will help you with this whole process it'll make
things clear you could find my book review list over
200 of some of the best books that i've read
unique books that you won't find elsewhere on the internet
and these books are really required reading material if you're
going to get serious into this work even though my
work is deep and broad it's not enough just to
listen to my content you also have to read the
books and that will give you a list at least
at the beginning a sense of validation because see in
practice as a newbie you need some validation of these
ideas you can't just hear them from me you should
hear them from other masters and teachers who will sort
of triangulate with what i'm saying and then it'll corroborate
it and then this gives you more confidence in it
until you can go out and actually practice it and
actualize some of the stuff and then when you do
then you won't need the books you won't need the
validation of me or anybody else you'll be on your
own but before you get on your own you need
a little bit of training wheels and that's what the
book list offers you um you can also find the
life purpose course over 25 hours of fresh exclusive content
that's different from the free content that i release specifically
about uh motivating yourself for the rest of your life
finding your life purpose and passion very powerful course i
get a lot of very good testimonials on a almost
on a weekly basis from people who've finished that course
you can also find uh other resources like my blog
where i'm posting new stuff and sharing links and videos
you can come to the forum and ask questions where
i answer questions other smart people on the forum answer
questions come get help there if you have some place
that you're stuck with your journey at um what else
you can support me if you'd like at patreon.com actualized
i appreciate any donations that you offer to me helps
me stay financially independent so that i'm not corrupted by
advertisers and uh you can check out my second channel
called actualizedclips for shorter snippets of my main videos that
are done by a good editor of mine so that
is that make sure you make use of those resources
and more resources will come in the future i plan
to release new courses and other things that i'm working
on it's just taken me longer than anticipated because of
certain health issues i've been struggling with recently and working
on and the last thing i want to say is
this is that what actualize.org really is from a high
level is it is religion if religion was modernized with
the 21st century brought up to speed with the 21st
century and if it was free of of most corruption
then you would have actualized.org and if it was sort
of taught at a very sophisticated complex level but most
religion most religion is thousands of years old very very
out of date they use the wrong metaphors you can't
relate to them very well um it's cognitively not complex
enough uh for really learning this material and it's also
full of of deep corruption and devilry and and that's
the problem with most modern religion um and because of
this religion has gotten a bad rap and a negative
stigma so i even almost hesitate to say that actualize.org
is is like a religion because people get the wrong
idea about it but really um the word religion is
also a relative word religion can happen at different levels
of spiritual moral and cognitive development so religion what happens
that spiral damage stage blues not a very good thing
religion when it happens at stage yellow or turquoise is
a very very different beast [Music] now even though i
say you know free of corruption it doesn't mean actualizaria
is completely free of corruption i can still be corrupt
i still am corrupt in certain ways um uh as
long as you're a human as long as you're finite
you're always going to be corrupt in some way or
another so that's basically inescapable so it's really not a
question of whether you're free of corruption or not it's
a question of uh what degree of corruption do you
have and i consider modern orthodox religions to be quite
corrupt whereas compared to what i'm teaching there are still
corruptions in what i teach just because i'm human as
well as something more but it i'm also in a
very fortunate position that i'm financially independent uh and pretty
well off at least for now and so because of
this even though there are sort of financial pressures upon
me here and there you know i could always want
to earn more money and stuff and water down my
teachings but actually what i'm noticing is that as i'm
developing myself and becoming more conscious that's becoming less of
a less of an influence on me and so i
actually feel my teachers are getting more pure more authentic
less corrupt but you know um there can still be
corruptions here or there so don't hold me to some
sort of perfect standard and the way that you overcome
that problem of any corruptions in my teachings is by
validating these things for yourself in your direct experience and
then my own personal limitations and corruptions won't so much
affect you and be a problem because hey i got
news for you no matter who you're learning this stuff
from they're always going to have their spin on it
their own biases they're always going to have some financial
pressure placed upon them there's always going to be some
opportunity for corruption and sometimes it can be severe severe
so do be mindful of that and because of this
you shouldn't just blindly trust any spiritual teacher and the
best spiritual teachers will tell you don't believe me go
out and test this stuff for yourself and only if
it's true for you should you follow it and pursue
it if it's not then go follow something else and
that's what keeps you safe you
