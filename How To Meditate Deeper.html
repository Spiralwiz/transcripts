hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to meditate deeper
I really consider this episode here like a part to
to my original episode called how to meditate which is
really popular a lot of people have gotten a lot
of value from from that one there because it's a
no-bullshit guide to meditation what we're going to do here
though is I want to go a little bit deeper
into some of the various techniques that you can do
with your meditations and I'm going to give you three
phases or stages of meditation that I've personally been working
on myself to take you basically from the very beginning
newbie phases of meditation the first stage where you're just
like clueless about what to do or how meditation works
so we're going to have you smoothly transition from that
into deeper and deeper and deeper and more advanced stages
of meditation until ultimately you can get to some really
cool advanced places so I want to kind of guide
you through that also I want to cover some of
the common problems that people have when they're meditating so
what are the greatest pitfalls for meditators and I'm going
to give you a little quick schedule that you can
use for how to meditate all right so here we
go stage number one and I'm kind of assuming that
you watch my first video here right so I'm not
going to be talking about all the basics of meditation
I understand that you understand how the basics work so
if you do understand that then here's stage one this
is where you would begin meditation if you've never meditated
before or even if you have meditated before but you
haven't been doing it very strictly and you feel like
you're not getting good results with it you can just
start here at stage one right it never hurts to
relearn the basics and this one is the easy version
and it's called simple observation so here's how it works
you sit down you can have your eyes either open
or closed but you sit down in a meditative like
posture and then what you do is you just allow
everything to happen and all you do is you just
watch it you simply observe it so whatever's going on
becomes okay and you're not trying to control any of
it so what will happen well when you sit down
and let's say you close your eyes and you're sitting
there what will happen is thoughts will come up and
various feelings and sensations will come up emotions will come
up generally a lot of times what we do is
we try to control that and we try to either
focus our mind on not thinking anything or we try
to focus on our mind on some specific objective or
goal within meditation and that's one form of meditation which
is cool remember there's many many many valid forms of
meditation so I'm not telling you that this is the
only way or that these three ways are going to
be the only ways these meditate no what I recommend
is that you try a slew of different meditation techniques
which is what I'm hoping you'll do here so what
you're doing is you're letting your mind do whatever it
wants to do without controlling it and all your job
is is just to watch your mind will wander let
it wander let it think about tomorrow night and let
us think about the email you just got and let
us think about what your wife thinks about you or
the fight that you just got in with your husband
let it think about all that stuff let it wander
to scary places dirty places silly places whatever kind of
places it wants to go to let it go there
but as it goes there your job is to watch
it go there and just be mindful of the fact
that oh it's going somewhere it was here and now
it's there and now it's here and now it's there
and now it's here and it's walking around in circles
you just watch it as simple as those in struction
sound it's still going to be very difficult and you're
still going to be likely to get frustrated and want
to fight or control your mind and your mind will
say stuff to you like oh I shouldn't be thinking
about this during meditation and all I shouldn't be feeling
that during meditation and I shouldn't be feeling anxious during
meditation and what happens there is that your mind starts
a fight with itself your only job is to observe
not to fight with yourself so don't fight and the
way you do this is you just realize that when
you're sitting down to meditate for this brief 10 20
30 minutes of your day that you don't want to
take your thoughts within that meditation session seriously at all
not just thoughts but also feelings emotions might come up
you might feel angry or agitated or jealous or whatever
frustrated and you can do one of two things you
can either buy into those and take them seriously or
you can just watch them so your objective here is
just simply watch them and what's going to happen is
that inevitably you will fail at this you will fail
dozens if not hundreds of times just within a 20-minute
window of your meditation and what you got to do
is you got to not get caught into the trap
of beating yourself up for having failed you just watch
yourself getting failed you see that instead of berating yourself
down yourself oh I screwed up this meditation session you
just again you let your mind go there but you
watch your mind go there don't try to control anything
in this first stage pretty basic about as basic as
it gets as simple as this is you're still going
to screw this up you're not going to be able
to follow these instructions to the letter why is that
well because your mind is untrained and meditation is a
discipline it's a practice it's something that needs to be
done every day by the way just so we get
the logistics straight here when I talk about meditation to
me what that means is you're sitting down in a
quiet place eyes open or closed you have a timer
on and you do I would say a minimum of
20 minutes try to shoot for 20 minutes if you
want to do more you can do more and you
have to do this on a daily basis every single
day you have to do this all right so that's
stage one after you've practiced sage one for a while
and you've gotten pretty good at it or maybe you're
still crappy at it after a while then what you
do is you move on to stage 2 stage 2
is like the intermediate stage and this one I call
active detachment so here what you do is again you
sit down in your typical meditation pose and you now
actively try to release every thought that comes into your
mind so it's just like the first stage except now
you're actually doing a little bit of manipulation something comes
up like oh shoot I got that project that's due
tomorrow at school like let's say you get that that
thought and what you do is you say oh that's
a thought let me just let it go and you
let it go and once you get after you let
it go successfully for a few seconds is you get
a little window of peace and then what happens is
that usually another thought comes up sometimes immediately I'll thought
will come up like oh did I lose my car
keys where did I put my car keys I can't
remember I put my car keys what if I lost
them again so that thought might come up and again
you realize oh that's just a thought let me let
it go and you detach and release it and then
immediately that thought can come up again so again you
might say but my car keys I really need my
car keys I can't just let this one go again
you have to realize that oh it's just another thought
let me let it go and this is the Active
Release approach so a couple of points about this as
simple as these instructions are you're going screw this one
up a lot because what's going to happen is you're
going to try left thoughts go but thoughts can be
sticky and they can creep back up on you so
the instruction here is very important you try to drop
the thought release it and if you can't for whatever
reason don't worry about it try it again a few
seconds later and if you still can't release it don't
worry about it try again a few seconds later the
key is that you don't lose your composure and start
to panic and that you're able to stay calm throughout
this process because notice as soon as you're frustrated or
you're panicked that tells you what that tells you that
you're taking these thoughts too seriously even the thought I
have to be meditating properly you're taking that too seriously
- so this whole idea of not taking your thoughts
too seriously this is the entire theme and point of
meditation is to make you aware of this now if
you become this anal person who tries to meditate perfectly
all the time well counter intuitively what that does that
that backfires on you because you're not taking yourself less
seriously like you should with meditation you're too serious about
meditating so it's a little paradoxical there so you're going
to try to release the thought often what I find
happens is that you release the thought and the thought
comes back up five seconds later and what you do
then is you get a little bit off your Center
and you're like oh damn but I release this thought
if I released it why is it coming back I
must have screwed up and then you got to recognize
all what am i doing I'm just creating more thoughts
let me release these thoughts - and you release those
but then they come back two minutes later they come
back you're like oh I should have released these but
I didn't and so you're playing these mind games with
yourself you always have to go Metta see what's happening
and then release alright and if it fails don't worry
about it try it again you'll fail many many times
also a trick is don't resist thoughts arising because thoughts
will arise sometimes what I tend to do is I
sit down to meditate and I tell myself something like
okay got a nothing got a nothing no thoughts no
thoughts stop thinking no thoughts and you just like you're
trying to you know suppress them from coming up it's
kinda like you have a burp that's about to come
up and then you hold it back or you got
a sneeze and you hold that one in that's kinda
what you're trying to do with your thoughts but that
doesn't work so well usually what that does is that
makes you kind of more panicked and again there's this
whole problem trying to manipulate your way all the time
so even though in this stage to technique you are
actively detaching and that can be viewed as a form
of subtle manipulation it's not nearly as manipulative as you
sitting there trying to prevent thoughts from arising in the
first place that's gonna leave you very frustrated and it's
going to be counterproductive all right so you got that
okay so that's basically stage number two again I recommend
you do it for 20 minutes every single day with
the timer as was discussed with the other technique now
let's move on to stage number three this one I
would call them advanced technique and this one I call
awareness focus so what you do here is you sit
in your typical meditative posture and you put your awareness
on awareness itself put your awareness on awareness itself this
is a little tricky because unless you've meditated for years
then actually you don't know what awareness is when I
use that word awareness you kind of know what I'm
talking about but not really you don't have a phenomenological
experiential understanding of awareness and awareness is a very weird
phenomenon unless you've observed it for years it's very hard
to put your finger on it what the [ __
] is awareness hard to be sure so here what
you're doing is you're kind of working on this problem
of understanding what awareness is and the way that you
do that is that you notice that everything that comes
up at any time in your life but especially when
you're sitting down meditating is just content that feels this
you might call it a space of awareness the field
of awareness is filled with content an emotion is a
piece of content a thought is a piece of content
and itch on your ass is a piece of content
your mom or your dad yelling at you while you're
meditating that's a piece of content your cat coming up
and sniffing you or licking you while you're sitting there
that's a piece of content everything is a piece of
content now usually what we do is we get sucked
into this content and we get sucked into our thoughts
stories and into our emotions your job here is just
to become aware that all this stuff actually is content
and it's happening within this field of awareness and that
awareness itself is not the content this is a very
freaky thing so one way you can do this is
you can sit there and you can notice that things
enter awareness and then they disappear from awareness so they
arise and they die and then they rise again and
they die again and this is happening constantly but what
you need to do is you need to focus your
awareness not on the content but kind of like you
zoom out and it's almost like you're looking at yourself
from a third person although recognize that when you sit
in meditation you look at your cell from a third-person
in your mind's eye that actually that's just more content
right you can't escape content content is always there so
what you try to do in this advanced stage here
is you just focus your awareness on the fact that
content is arising and you try not to get sucked
into the content and you keep your awareness on the
fact that you're aware and you try to maintain that
as consistently as possible without having your mind wander off
course and of course inevitably it will wander off course
if you first start doing this you'll probably only be
able to do it for 5 or 10 seconds before
your mind wanders of course so what do you do
your mind wanders of course you bring it back it
wanders off course again you bring it back it wanders
off again you bring it back sometimes it'll wander off
and you'll be wandering off in fairytale land lost in
content for five whole minutes until you realize oh [
__ ] I forgot about focusing on my awareness I've
been focusing on the content it's like ah man those
five minutes were wasted more content oh [ __ ]
that's more content more content damn it I'm not meditating
properly more content right so you can be playing these
mind games with yourself just bring yourself back as best
you can sometimes you'll have sessions where it's going to
be really hard and you'll be wandering all over the
place and that's the whole point of meditating is to
again build in this discipline and over the weeks and
months as you practice this you'll get better and better
and better the other thing I recommend that you do
is I recommend that you open yourself up to the
question of what is awareness anyways it's a very profound
question perhaps the most profound question you can actually answer
in this lifetime so when you're sitting there and you're
practicing this stage 3 start wondering kind of like what
is awareness I think I know what awareness is but
it's so hard to put your finger on it I
have no clue what awareness is how could that be
my whole life is constructed out of awareness and yet
I don't know what awareness is so just kind of
open yourself up to wondering but one warning here is
that don't try to logically think your way into a
logical answer when you're meditating there's no introspection going on
here there's no thinking stuff through this is not therapy
you're sitting and you're just observing you're not allowed to
think about stuff and try to figure stuff out that's
something different all right so that's stage 3 now let
me would do is let me talk a little bit
about some of the common mistakes that I see people
making with meditation and I make all these mistakes myself
so that's why I'm so familiar with them so let's
just run down this list real quick first one is
panic and frustration when you realize that you can't control
your thoughts so when you first start meditating you think
like wow I got to sit there and just kind
of control my thoughts and then you're in for a
rude awakening when you discover that actually you have no
control over your thoughts so don't fall into that trap
could it be that you actually don't have control at
all over your thoughts would that be acceptable to you
if you discovered that about yourself well leave that possibility
open and see what you think about that question a
couple of years after you've meditated consistently for day after
day after day for years on end then take a
look at that answer another pitfall is assuming that meditation
should be calm and peaceful no no no no no
if you start meditating and the first few years that
you meditate it's going to be the exact opposite of
that meditation is going to be frustrating and annoying you're
not just going to be sitting down and listening out
like a yogi that happens after decades of meditation and
perhaps enlightenment another mistake is not using a timer I
recommend you get a digital timer I recommend that you
set it for 20 minutes you don't look at it
while you're meditating but you turn it away from you
I also recommend that you don't use a smartphone for
meditation as a timer you can in a pinch but
I recommend that you don't because your smartphone has all
these distractions on it notifications and messages and emails and
texts so that doesn't make your job harder yet and
you know a separate digital timer they're real cheap these
days another common pitfall is trying to stop thoughts completely
which I already kind of addressed don't try to do
that again in fact we're going to discover through lots
of meditation is that you have no power to stop
your thoughts and that this is not something that's really
even necessary to do for proper meditation the common pitfall
is resisting thoughts that arise so you're sitting there a
thought comes up and like [ __ ] I should
have had that thought you're resisting it stop resisting it
okay another common pitfall is daydreaming meditation is not daydreaming
now when you do that stage one that I told
you about it might feel a bit like you're daydreaming
because you're just letting your mind wander anywhere the difference
though is that in this stage one yes you're kind
of daydreaming your thoughts can go literally anywhere don't control
them at all but you're watching them you're being aware
of them which is not what a typical daydream is
typical daydream is you're caught in the daydream in the
fantasy of the daydream here you're always aware that you're
daydreaming or at least you're trying to be next pitfall
is trying to meditate when you're tired a lot of
times what I find myself is that you know I
have a bit pretty busy schedule I run a business
in fact I run multiple businesses so um uh you
know there's a lot of other stuff that I could
be doing in my life besides meditating that's frankly cooler
than meditation so what I often do is I try
to you know slot my meditation time somewhere in the
day where I'm kind of tired I'm not at my
peak of mental clarity maybe I've just had a big
meal or I just woke up and I'm still kind
of groggy or I'm about to go to bed and
I'm kind of sleepy or it's middle of the day
and I'm kind of feeling it taking a nap but
I decide to meditate and those usually end up being
the worst meditation sessions because you're just not able to
focus you're not at the peak of your comen ttle
clarity so best time in the day to meditate is
whenever you have the highest mental clarity if that's morning
for you great that's a common one for me personally
in the morning I'm a kind of groggy so I'm
actually likely to fall asleep in the morning so for
me the ideal time to meditate would be sometime in
the maybe late morning or early noontime but I often
fail at that because it's just that like that's my
prime time that I usually want to allocate to working
on my business or shooting a video or something like
that so it is important when you meditate here's another
pitfall not accepting whatever happens in meditation a really good
trick you can try is just when you sit down
right before you start meditating remind yourself just to accept
everything that's happening right now in the present moment literally
accept it all like if you have a toothache accept
that if you're asked is eaching except that if you've
got some problem at work except that if you don't
want to meditate except that if you're failing to meditate
properly except that if it's a bad time in the
day that you chose to meditate accept that accept everything
negative that normally you would resist and that's very counterintuitive
because we feel like oh well I don't accept all
the bad stuff let me just accept the good stuff
except when you do that you don't realize that you
can't accept the good without having the bad come back
and bite you in the ass you have to accept
it all as a totality that's something you'll learn as
you continue meditating deeper and perhaps the last pitfall is
trying to get somewhere with meditation it's like you're sitting
down you're meditating right in this moment but then you
have like this goal it's like well today I want
to release all my thoughts today I want to be
perfect or I'm working towards enlightenment or this or that
or I want to achieve some super peaceful state right
you set a certain like agenda for your meditation stop
doing that stop trying to get anywhere with your one
session now in the big picture over the long time
horizon I think you should have some goals for your
meditation you should be aiming for enlightenment and you should
be aiming for more peace of mind and you should
be aiming for all this cool stuff that you can
get with meditation but not when you're actually sitting down
to meditate drop all those goals because what those goals
are going to be are just going to be more
thoughts that are going to prevent you from being able
to actually achieve those goals so those goals undermine themselves
all right and also a point I want to make
is that you will have bad days when you're meditating
some days you're just going to feel shitty some days
you can be real tired some days you're gonna have
a really unruly mind that's going in ten different directions
and that's okay except that to allow that and be
ready for that sometimes it will happen is you'll have
like ten straight days of really consistent high-quality meditation you're
very calm and focused and everything's going great and then
on the eleventh day your mind is just going nuts
all over the place you can hardly sit still for
20 minutes let alone keep your thoughts from wandering in
a thousand different directions and then you start to doubt
yourself and start saying oh [ __ ] I'm not
progressing fast enough man I thought I was better than
this you just gotta allow it because your mind every
single morning you know your mind is in a different
place and different stuff is happening in your life so
you're going to feel differently depending on where you're at
alright so those are the pitfalls make sure that you
be mindful those notice them in yourself if you're making
them now let me end by just giving you your
meditation schedule here's what I recommend you do with all
the stuff that I told you I recommend that basically
you follow my instructions to the letter and what that
means is that you actually rewatch this video for every
stage that you're practicing so if you want to practice
stage one rewatch that part if you want to practice
stage to rewatch that part if you want to practice
stage three rewatch that part and right before you sit
down and meditate maybe you even want to take some
notes on what I said so that you know exactly
what you should be doing like you have a little
instruction sheet I found that very very helpful very helpful
because otherwise if you don't kind of recenter yourself with
the instructions then you're going to forget them and you're
going to wander all over the place here's what I
recommend as far as the schedule goes if you're starting
at the newbie level stage one go do stage one
for a whole month thirty days straight at twenty minutes
a day without missing a single day if you miss
a single day you have to restart that whole cycle
from scratch until you get thirty consecutive days after you've
gotten 30 consecutive days of stage one then go on
to stage two make sure you reread the instructions for
Sage 2 and then you follow that for 30 days
consecutively without missing a single day if you miss a
single day you have to restart that cycle so then
you complete stage two then you move on to stage
three and you do that one for 30 days consecutively
otherwise you restart the cycle and that's it and then
after those you know 30 days times three that's 90
days after those 90 days are over which you can
do is you can return to whatever stage you want
or perhaps just continue with the most advanced stage stage
three also that point I think you're going to be
in a nice position to start doing maybe some enlightenment
work which I talked about in other videos I'm not
going to talk about that here and you can also
start experimenting with various other meditation techniques what I found
helpful personally for myself is that I have to try
out a bunch of different techniques just to see what
fits me it's almost like wearing them you know shoes
you go to the store to buy some new shoes
you got to test out 5 10 different pairs before
you find some comfortable ones and sometimes you actually got
to take them home and wear them for a week
before you realize that they're not really that comfortable so
when you're spending a whole month on each one of
these techniques I think that's the best way to go
and that's what I recommend for you and also what's
nice about setting up this way in stages is that
you it's almost like you kind of set little you
know goals for yourself not day to day but month
to month and I find that that's important because otherwise
your meditation habit just gets very stale you're always doing
the same thing it's not exciting when you set it
up in this kind of stage like fashion then you
know you got one month to go then thus you're
looking forward to the second month and you're looking forward
to the third month and so on and so forth
so you want to be kind of switching it up
and also what it does is it gets you awareness
of how your mind works and how these techniques work
from multiple perspectives which I find in the end is
a very helpful to understanding yourself because that's what you're
trying to do here all right I want to give
a quick credit to Peter Ralston who I got this
idea of stages from stages of meditation I think it's
very a powerful idea but I'm signing off I'm done
here go ahead post your comments down below click the
like button please share this video with a friend and
finally come sign up to my newsletter right here at
actualized org it's a free newsletter I release new videos
and new content every single week I've cool new projects
planned for my subscribers which I'll be releasing the next
6 to 12 months so I'm going to be working
actively on that but the reason you want to sign
up is because I want to help you to self
actualize and I think that meditation here is a really
powerful topic I'm going to be shooting more videos in
the future about how to meditate more effectively and other
techniques you can try because this is just the tip
of the iceberg as far as meditation goes and what
you could achieve with meditate to me this is the
most powerful habit but besides this habit there's a lot
of other stuff we need to talk about to help
move you towards the kind of powerful exciting life that
you want to create for yourself and it all starts
with self mastery if you can master yourself specifically this
thing up here the mind if you could master your
psychology then the world will be your oyster sign up
and I'll see you soon you
