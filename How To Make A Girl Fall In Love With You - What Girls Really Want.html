hey this is Leo for actualised org and this is
another quick self-help segment we're in about ten minutes I'm
going to tell you how to make a girl fall
in love with you all right this is actually very
personal topic that I've been studying very hardcore for the
last two years because I'm involved in the pickup community
and I came from a place where I had horrible
skills with dating no experience didn't know how to flirt
didn't know how to attract women didn't know how to
land a girlfriend didn't know how to keep a girlfriend
these were all new experiences that I had to go
through and learn the hard way much harder than most
people did and through my journey I actually went through
two years of a brutal training studying hours and hours
of theory literally over hundreds of hours of theory of
how to attract women what women want female psychology and
then actually going out and practicing in the field in
clubs and in bars to actually test the theories and
the techniques and teach myself how to attract women now
this is slightly different topic than how to get a
girl to fall in love with you so we need
to clarify there's the attraction phase and then there's the
love phase so before you can get someone to fall
in love with you and this is the same thing
I said in the video there's a similar video that
I shot four girls before someone could fall in love
with you that you need to first meet them and
you need to get some attraction chemistry going and then
you'll build up to the glove in some ways the
love comes naturally so you don't need to worry about
that too much well in fact you need to focus
on is more of the attraction phase because once you
can attract somebody then the love just kind of kicks
in naturally and things just start to happen all you
got to do is take the biggest obstacles out of
the path and then that that process will be smooth
if you have obstacles in the way you'll have some
problems and you'll be falling down here even though you're
attracting women and I know some guys that are really
good at tracking women but then they're not able to
keep them around because of several problems that they have
so we'll cover some of those we'll get into a
little bit of traction as well so what do women
really want in guys this goes to to the point
of attraction and even though love people separate love from
attraction there is that a there's a deep connection there
and the fact is that to get love you need
attraction that attraction basically carries off into love so what
attracts girls to guys well girls are attracted to personality
not looks this is a very big misconception among guys
out there especially guys who have trouble attracting women is
that they think that their looks are a detriment and
that because they are a little overweight or they've got
they've got some crooked teeth or they've got some pimples
or they've got this or they've got that they don't
have the perfect body they don't have the perfect face
that they can't attract a girl and nothing could be
further from the truth what women are really attracted to
our emotions so if you can make her feel the
right emotions that she likes to feel then that's it
she's yours it's done it's so easy as long as
you can make her feel the right emotions so it's
all about the emotions women are very very sensitive to
emotions guys were very logical and we're very visual so
we're going to analyze everything logically about a woman and
we're going to be instantly attracted to her within 5
seconds because of how she looks that's not the same
for girls for girls they need to be romanced they
need to be warmed up and it's not like a
light switch it's more like a dial that dial needs
to be cranked up before she's really into you to
do that what you do with what actually cranks that
dial up is the emotions that she's feeling off of
you and the emotions she wants to feel it's not
even a particular emotions it's more about the range of
emotions that you're giving her because her feminine energy what
she wants is she wants to feel kind of the
ups and downs and she wants to be able to
rely on you to give her a variety of emotions
hopefully mostly positive but even negative ones sometimes women like
because that's what they like they like to experience ranges
of emotions as guys we generally like to experience like
two emotions we'd like to be we're worth you're happy
or we're sad or like excited and that's about all
we experiences guys for girls there's a much wider range
of emotions because they're more emotional creatures and so getting
them to feel that that's why they love guys that
are that's why they love guys I can make them
laugh that's why they love guys that are carefree and
laid-back that's why they love guys who will take them
on adventures that's why they like guys who are independent
and a very strong will that have a sense of
direction in their life and know what they want because
a guy like that takes the girl along with him
on the journey and she loves that one metaphor that
they use in the pickup community is that the girl
is like a passenger and the guy is like a
ship and what she's doing because she's feminine she is
gonna look around she's gonna see what kind of ships
are out there and let's say we're in the worst
that we're in like in the Caribbean there's a bunch
of little islands right and this the ship pulls by
and now this girl she has the option to get
on one ship or another ship or a third ship
which one does she want she wants the ship that's
gonna steer her around to like the most exciting and
coolest islands it's going to show her all these great
things gonna take her on this like tour of the
Caribbean that's what she wants she doesn't want the ship
that's gonna take her from the dock to a little
cave and then that's it she doesn't want that so
if you think that you're gonna attract a girl by
by going out there and you go into a bar
or a club or meeting her or meeting her through
your friends and then like shacking up with her and
dragging her back to your to your man cave that's
not going to happen girls like guys that are social
they like guys that are outgoing they like guys that
have a little bit of edge they like guys that
are a little bit dangerous a little bit risky that
push them out of their comfort zone and make them
do like slightly crazy things that they wouldn't have naturally
done before because that's giving them emotions that's emotional stimulation
and this is happening both on the micro and macro
level so on the micro level the way that happens
is just the initial interaction right how do you even
meet that girl how do you introduce yourself are you
coming up there all stilted and just saying hi I'm
Bob and I work at JPMorgan and I Drive a
Mercedes and that that's all logical talk the fact is
that girls are listening to the sub communication the emotional
layer of the conversation so if you go in there
with a conversation like that what's the emotional conversation there
on the logical level you're presenting yourself as this this
valuable man you've got you've got your life together you
went you went to school you have some money you
have a nice car you can provide for her and
that seems like something that you would want but really
she's a girl she just want that she does on
a logical level it's like a woman but deep down
she's a girl and she wants like fun she wants
stimulation she wants adventure and she's looking at the emotional
level and the emotional level of that conversation was just
like a flatline mmm flatline right boring she doesn't want
that what she wants us to get stimulated so the
guy that will go in there and give her some
crazy line or tell her something tell her something about
herself that makes her a little self-conscious or like pushes
her boundaries or tell her something crazy that will get
her interest piqued because it's like oh he's a little
different he's kind of edgy he's not like this boring
dude I want to go and see what like what
more is there she's curious now I was like a
movie it's like this interesting movie with like a suspense
plotline it's like a thriller and she wants to get
on that rollercoaster ride she wants to get on that
ship and she wants to see what you can offer
her so that's on the micro level and then on
the macro level of course and this is where we
get into the whole love thing how do you get
her to fall in love with you is you try
to do that on the macro level too once the
relationship gets a little more serious gets past the sex
phase and you're like seriously dating it's getting more heavy
into relationship territory there it's still about keeping it up
you have to work on your relationship you can't just
sit at home and watch movies together all the time
like that's going to be boring she's gonna be bored
with that which you got to be doing is you
got to be offering her new things you got to
be like going on exciting dates once in a while
at least you got to be you gotta have cool
friends that she can see and that she could hang
out with you got to be like challenging her in
different ways getting her to learn stuff taking her to
places she's never been to giving her new experiences like
girls love that stuff if you can do that she's
gonna think you're the best boyfriend amazing right the other
thing of course women love sex all women love sex
they're highly sexual creatures they in fact maybe like sex
more than guys do is just that they're they've got
a lot more social conditioning put upon them so they
can never admit that they like sex that much but
you know how much women like sex if you've been
with women so to really keep a woman around learn
to have amazing sex and don't be selfish during sex
I see that a lot of guys out there especially
pickup community guys that I've hung around with they'll be
selfish about sex and it's not going to be about
like pleasing the girl and it's not going to be
about like making this amazing experience out of sex it's
going to be like getting your your load off real
quick and that's not going to that's not going to
do it like me personally I love to like experiment
I love to do crazy things I love to make
it I like to make it special I so you
like go all out for it I love it myself
I love the reaction I get from it from from
the girl it's it's awesome so learn sex learn how
to be better in bed learn how to last longer
learn how to have like multiple orgasms learn how to
give her multiple orgasms learn how to do different sexual
positions learn how to have sex in in a public
bathroom I don't care figure it out try experiment be
adventurous about this stuff and you know what if you're
not giving your girl like 5 to 10 orgasms every
night then something is wrong you suck and I see
this all the time like I asked I asked some
of my friends like how many orgasms are you giving
to one of your girls and he'll just say like
ohm like one one maybe like maybe one I don't
even know like I don't even ask them where I
don't even like register it from them that's that's preposterous
as a man you should be giving your girl more
than five orgasms every single time otherwise I don't know
what the hell you're thinking what you're doing and if
you can do that then she will love you easy
easy easy you will not have a problem with with
love the other thing of course is women hate it
when you get very needy with them and when you
make your life about the woman your life has to
be your life you have to have a sense of
direction so when you get a girl and you shouldn't
get a little more serious with her be very cognizant
of the fact that you don't want to be overbearing
on her and you don't want to make her the
center of your life girls hate that even though it
seems like they would want that because it's like well
I'm lavishing with all this attention in love the fact
is that they want a man who's a man and
a man who's a man is is grounded in something
is grounded in his purpose in life so actually having
a strong sense of purpose in life having a strong
career having a business that you're running having something that's
important something that you believe in something you're willing to
fight for besides your girl is important because she'll sense
that she'll since that you're grounded and she'll be able
to trust you and rely on you and she'll be
able to be girly around you and express herself and
that's what she really wants if she wants to kind
of like just let go and have you take care
of [ __ ] for her so that she doesn't
have to be the man in the relationship do not
make her the man if you make her the man
in the relationship for example if you make her decide
where you guys want to go all the time if
you make her plan your trips if you are wishy-washy
and uncertain if you have no sense of direction if
you're always telling her to come over and to to
like be or cherish and and that you're going to
just like bunk up with her all the time that
is a surefire way to lose her she's gonna fall
out of love with you if you do that and
she's going to find another guy who is more [
__ ] a man than you are because you're being
a [ __ ] what you need is a strong
sense of direction and do not be dissuaded by her
moods do not be dissuaded by her pleading you to
put all your attention on her that's not what she
really wants she's gonna test you in subtle ways and
she's going to be emotional around you and what she
wants you to do is she wants you to stay
the course she wants you to be strong so that
she can do that that's what she likes she doesn't
want you to become the girl so do not become
the girl that is a surefire way to lose her
and make her fall out of love with you but
if you do all the other things then you will
attract her and it will grow into love and it
will be awesome of course if you want to really
keep that going then you need to work on yourself
and you make yourself a better man it's a long-term
process it's a very deep topic to get into I'm
going to cover a lot more of that on actualize
that organ my other videos so if you feel like
you want to get this really dialed in and you
want to get this dialed in a very deep level
come check out actualized org where I'm going to cover
more of these topics and I cover other self-development topics
which are all pertinent to getting the girl because of
course the girl also wants you to be a successful
man she wants you to have some money even though
money is not strictly important you know she wants you
to be well-off it's going to be a factor in
your favor and she wants you to be she wants
you to be grounded she wants you to be emotionally
unreactive to her moods and to do that you need
a sense of self control and self mastery emotional self
mastery which is a lot of the topics that I
cover in in the videos that I shoot on actualize
that work so go ahead and check it out leave
