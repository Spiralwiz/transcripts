            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Wyct_8OL1Zg' target='_blank'>Why Women Fall For Assholes</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Attraction to "Bad Boys"</b>: Women are known to fall for "bad boys" possessing traits of confidence, assertiveness, status, edginess, and indifference. This attraction is universal, regardless of whether women admit it or not. These are traits associated with high value and masculinity. However, these qualities can also be indicative of individuals who might end up being challenging in relationships due to their character defects.
</li><li><b>"Bad Boys" and Relationship Challenges</b>: "Bad boys," who are attractive for their maxed-out qualities such as assertiveness, dominance, edginess, indifference, and social proof, also possess the biggest character flaws, leading to difficulties in relationships with women. Their attractiveness can make them seem irresistible to women, but these character traits can later become the source of conflict and resentment in relationships.
</li><li><b>Transition from "Nice Guy" to "Bad Boy"</b>: Understanding the kind of man to whom women are usually attracted can bring profound changes in one's behavior. Moving from being a 'nice guy,' an individual eager to please women and possessing low self-worth, to embodying the traits of confidence, dominance, edginess, and indifference, can exponentially increase one's attractiveness.
</li><li><b>Sexual Experience vs. Indifference</b>: Although women don't desire men with extensive sexual experiences at a conscious level, they are indeed attracted to men who show indifference towards outcomes when pursuing them. This indifference is a trait mostly exhibited by men with a lot of sexual experience, thus adding to their attractiveness. 
</li><li><b>Problem with Assertiveness and Dominance</b>: While women are attracted to men who are dominant and assertive, these traits, when maxed out, can also lead to potential power abuse in a relationship. Therefore, understanding the balance is critical to successful relationships.
</li><li><b>Drawing on characteristics of attractive men</b>: Women are naturally drawn to men who possess strong male characteristics such as confidence, assertiveness, and dominance. These attributes can make a man appear more attractive and desirable, contributing to the initial spark of attraction.
</li><li><b>Fast-pace initiation</b>: Men who are assertive and confident are more likely to initiate sexual relationship quickly, tapping into the emotional draw that women feel towards them.
</li><li><b>Women's oxytocin response</b>: After having sex, women are known to have an emotional response due to the release of the hormone oxytocin, which creates strong emotional attachment, often making women feel deeply in love, even after a short period of time.
</li><li><b>Double-edged sword of attractiveness</b>: The attractive qualities carried by assertive, confident men can also be their downfall in the long run. These traits in excess can cause imbalance and lead to conflicts in relationships. They may struggle to communicate effectively and be responsive in intimate conversations, which are crucial for healthy, long-term commitments.
</li><li><b>Relationship challenges</b>: Women, while trying to find a balance in the relationship, often face challenges with the man's lack of receptiveness or cooperation. This could be due to the man's excessive assertiveness and independence coupled with a nonchalant attitude.
</li><li><b>Enduring toxic relationships</b>: Some women tend to endure unhealthy behaviors and toxic patterns in their relationships due to the emotional attachment they have, which often feels like a 'drug addiction', making it harder for them to detach even with logical reasoning.
</li><li><b>Difficulty in maintaining long-term relationships</b>: A long-term relationship requires continuous effort, understanding, and good communication between partners. Forging a successful relationship can be particularly tough with men who are edgy, brash, assertive and have many other options with women.
</li><li><b>Importance of being a high-caliber partner</b>: To latch onto a man who has many options, a woman needs to have strong value propositions. Both partners in the relationship need to work on their flaws, communicate effectively, grow together, and not let external factors influence their bond.  
</li><li><b>Problem of power abuse</b>: Men with highly assertive and dominant personalities often tend to misuse their place of power in the relationship, leading to abusive tendencies. They become less receptive to discussing issues and their indifference becomes a hindrance to building intimacy.
</li><li><b>Sexual Abundance and Relationship Choices</b>: Men who can easily attract many women face a decision between maintaining their options or investing in an exclusive relationship with one woman. This choice is influenced by what the individual woman brings to the relationship, and both men and women evaluate potential partners based on their respective values.
</li><li><b>Assertiveness and Dominance in Relationships</b>: Assertive and dominant individuals often struggle to maintain a healthy balance in relationships. These characteristics can lead to an abuse of power in the relationship, a phenomenon substantiated by psychological studies on power dynamics in situations such as prisons.
</li><li><b>Attraction Dynamics between "Bad Boys" and "Nice Guys"</b>: While women may rationally desire a nicer, less assertive guy for sustainable relationships, they are often more emotionally attracted to the confident, assertive "bad boy". This leads to a conflict between logic and emotions, contributing to the formation of toxic and potentially abusive relationships.
</li><li><b>Emotional Attachment and the Difficulty to Leave a Toxic Relationship</b>: In a toxic relationship, the emotional attachment can be so strong that it overpowers the growing pain caused by the relationshipÂ’s destructive nature. This makes it incredibly difficult to leave until the pain becomes unbearable, a process which could take significant time, even years. 
</li><li><b>Awareness of Power Dynamics in Relationships</b>: The negative impact of power dynamics in relationships emphasizes the importance of being aware of these dynamics and trying to maintain healthy relationships. Even "nice guys" can become abusive given the right circumstances, indicating the profound influence of power dynamics in relationships.
</li><li><b>Consistency Between Character and Relationship Stability</b>: A better-suited partner for a sustainable relationship is often the "nice guy" who may seem unattractive in comparison to more dominant men, but is more likely to maintain a respectful and compassionate stance in the relationship. 
</li><li><b>The Peril of Emotional Attachment in Abusive Relationship</b>: Physical and verbal abuse can escalate in a toxic relationship where emotional attachment is high. The rising pain from such a relationship can significantly degrade the quality of life for the less dominant partner over time. While logically understanding these dangers, the emotional attachment can make it hard to leave the relationship, indicating the need for an emotional trigger for change. 
</li><li><b>The Need for Emotional Leverage in Ending an Unhealthy Relationship</b>: Leo emphasizes that logic alone, while important, cannot evoke enough motivation for a woman to end an unhealthy relationship. Instead, he suggests the necessity of gaining emotional leverage over oneself. This emotional understanding and awakening could act as the catalyst to not only end a toxic relationship but also to switch focus towards seeking healthier relationships.
</li><li><b>The Pitfalls of Backward Rationalization in Love</b>: Leo points out the dangers of backward rationalization, where women, because of powerful chemical emotions associated with love, ignore the red flags about a man and imagine him to be perfect. Women need to be more aware of this blinding effect that love can have.
</li><li><b>Ineffectiveness of Lengthy Pre-Sexual Engagement</b>: Leo critiques the notion of delaying sex with a potential partner to gauge their true personality. He argues that this much-used strategy can be easily circumvented by attractive men and does not necessarily reveal the man's true character. The real character traits of a man become apparent over months, and often after multiple sexual encounters.
</li><li><b>The Evolution of Romantic Priorities in Women</b>: Women's dating preferences change as they grow older. Leo notes that younger women are more likely to pursue 'alpha males' but find it challenging to establish long-term, stable relationships with them. As women approach their 30s and consider having a family, their priorities shift to more stable and compatible partners over merely physically attractive ones. They become more tolerant of 'nice guys', realizing the importance of stability for long-term relationships.

He promises to share insights on holistic self-development, including career growth, financial mastery, health optimization, relationship advice, and inner psychology mastery.
