ey this is Leo for actualised org and today I
want to tell you the story of how I lost
65 pounds in five months and have cut been able
to keep it off for eight years so this sounds
like something pretty big right and it was for me
because actually where I came from where I started from
was that I was a overweight kid my whole life
kind of hard to see it on me now but
that's because I lost 65 pounds I used to weigh
230 something pounds so I'm about 234 pounds if I
recall correctly and then from there I dropped to about
175 so how did I do that it was a
pretty interesting feat and I want to trace the story
of that and I think there will be some interesting
implications for in our game and also how to just
get big accomplishments in your life the kind of stuff
that you've always wanted to do but have had difficulty
getting done so for me ever since about third grade
I was overweight and right after third grade I was
pretty heavily overweight as a kid so I went to
elementary school middle school high school and the beginning a
couple of years of college I was weighed throughout that
whole time and it was really a challenge for me
because it created a lot of limiting beliefs within myself
about who I was what I was able to do
and how I looked because this is not something I
never had that sense that I was that skinny kid
and then I just got overweight and then that I
had a chance of turning things around what I always
thought was that hey I grew up fat and I
was fat most of my life that's how I remember
myself and so I thought that that was that was
natural at least for me so some of the limiting
kind of beliefs that I had was that you know
it's all genetic at least in my case and I
don't really have any control over it because you know
what I've tried I tried I tried going on diets
I had some brief stints where I tried going to
the gym and none of that stuff was working for
me out of it sticked it would always be like
okay I'm gonna get on a diet and I get
on it for a week and then a week later
if not even sooner it all falls apart and nothing
happens no changes and fatter than ever so the real
challenge there was to figure to start to understand that
I could even do it and to get them the
motivation in place to do it and one of the
one of the big challenges for me as a result
of being overweight so for so long was that it
really created a lot of confidence issues for me because
I I've always cared about my own looks but literally
what was happening was that my mind was was almost
deceiving me as to how I looked so I would
like look in the mirror and I would think that
I look better than I actually that I'll actually was
it's like my mind was literally projecting a false appearance
and reality myself it's pretty pretty crazy how that worked
and I needed to do that in order to to
have some sort of positive self-image but even then I
was miserable the whole time because of course I knew
I was fat didn't like how I looked didn't like
the clothes that I wear and all that stuff you
know didn't feel comfortable expressing myself around people because I
didn't feel like I looked good and so that that
really crippled a lot of development of my confidence really
didn't feel comfortable around girls and women throughout high school
or college because of that and that led to some
some lasting issues so it was a real challenge for
me and the way that it all started to turn
around was actually very interesting this was actually really powerful
a powerful experience for me so what happened was that
I think it was like a sophomore sophomore chemistry class
I was in in college and definitely I was overweight
and I just started to chat up with with the
girl that was sitting next to me and one of
her friends we just kind of started talking and at
that point I just really I felt like and she
wasn't like a hot girl or anything but I felt
like she was someone that I could that I could
potentially date have a relationship with and and so from
that little brief interaction there was nothing there was nothing
even flirty going on there I thought that this was
something that that would be cooled if I like could
ask her out and we could make something happen and
so from that what happened was that night I went
to bed and I remember this very vividly as that
I started so I started kind of imagining being with
her as I was going to bed and I was
still it wasn't a dream I was still very conscious
about it and but but still like the emotion started
bubbling up about that situation and I started kind of
fantasizing about it and then I'm and then I remember
telling myself well but this is just a fantasy like
this is it's all great but it's in my mind
like it's not very real it's not going to happen
and I felt like I would never ask her out
because I didn't have the confidence for it and also
because I didn't feel I deserved it because of the
way I looked I just didn't feel I didn't feel
like it was fair to be in a relationship with
someone where I was where I was overweight and they
were normal weight I felt like that was that just
wasn't the way that I wanted it to be so
I I didn't even it wasn't even an issue of
asking her out or not it was the case was
that I would not ask her out unless I was
I felt good about myself so what happened then is
that I was fantasizing this and I'm telling myself that
it's just all a fantasy and then something triggered in
me something snapped and I thought this what F question
and I just thought about it and I suddenly saw
you know but what if what if this was not
fantasy what if I actually made it happen like what
if I just put all my effort forward spent six
months got in shape and then I was as fit
as I want it to be and I was happy
with how I looked and then I asked her out
wouldn't that be freaking awesome and so something brought that
kind of a that kind of spark of imagination within
me and and then I'm that night when I went
to sleep I kind of dreamed about that whole scenario
and how I would play out and what ended up
happening was that accidentally I didn't have I wasn't into
self development at that time I knew nothing about it
I don't know anything about visualizations but what happened was
that just unconsciously and kind of a just by happenstance
I happened to have done a lot of visualizing what
I would call now visualization now I do this type
of stuff very deliberately ashlee as an exercise because it
really does work but then it was it just happened
spontaneously and it became especially powerful because as I slept
it kind of just like soaked into my subconscious it
gone through the conscious filters went to the subconscious and
I woke up with an amazing sense of motivation and
drive because when I woke up the next morning I
was totally dead set I was a hundred and ten
percent confidence I had 100% confidence that I would be
fit because I saw myself as fit I totally imagined
that I totally believed that I could do it and
I totally bought into this idea that if I get
fit that I'm gonna get be able to ask this
girl out and have a good relationship with her and
it's all going to work out great but I was
only going to do it after I got fit so
that was the beginning of my motivation it was actually
very a very profound experience because I've never had one
like that quite since there's never been a case where
I just wasn't very motivated to do something and then
all of a sudden just this surge of motivation came
on so that this is this is an example that
I like going back to and studying for myself because
if I can dissect an understand what it is within
me that made that happen and I can replicate that
just the ramifications for my own personal development would be
enormous the amount of success I can get because with
that kind of Drive when you have a hundred 110%
commitment to that thing and like you literally don't care
what it takes you don't care what the pain is
that it's going to take to succeed you care about
nothing you just care about the result and you know
that you're gonna have it if you have so much
confidence that it's not that you are purchasing the result
you're so confident about it it's as though you already
have it you feel like you have it even though
you don't it's kind of like well I could I
could get hit by a bus tomorrow but I was
so dead set on my course that I know without
a shadow of a doubt that those six months would
have passed and I would have been fit that's how
I felt and so immediately when I woke up that
morning I made some resolutions as to you know what
kind of actions I need to start taking because it's
one thing to have that drive that's the beginning of
it that's the foundation but then you need to actually
start putting it into action so I made a couple
of resolutions first thing I did was I said that
I would be go to the gym five days a
week no matter what for the rest of my life
and this is critical is that didn't just say that
I would be doing this for six months or for
a week or for any amount of period of time
like that I literally said for the rest of my
life I think that was very critical because all the
other times that I kind of started doing diets and
losing weight I found that one of my biggest challenges
with that I really had this limiting belief that going
to the gym was painful go to the gym was
was was challenging and that ultimately was impractical for me
because what I thought was that oh you know going
to the gym sure I could maintain it for a
week or two I could maybe maintain it for a
month but eventually you know I just don't have enough
time to cut out from my day and put it
into gym you know I don't have an hour I
don't have 20 minutes to go to the gym I
have to pay money to go to the gym I
have to drive to the gym so all this hassle
and I just thought that that was totally impractical and
therefore I never really considered it as a viable means
of getting getting controlled my way so I focused a
lot on diet here what I said though is that
I'm so committed because I am a hundred cent I'm
110% committed I'm going to do everything and I'm gonna
use all the tools in my power so I said
I would tackle this problem from diet and gym and
I really had this epiphany because I was so driven
I had this epiphany to come to the realization that
the cost of me being fit was being at the
gym for the rest of my life and I didn't
even it wasn't so important to me whether that was
true or not whether I could cut corners I didn't
want to cut corners I said that I would just
make a resolution if I want to be fit the
cost and the payment that I have to pay to
the gods as it were is being at the gym
five times a week so I made that resolution the
other thing I said I would do is I would
start cutting out stuff really junk food so at that
point I was drinking a few sodas a day on
average cokes those were my favorites so I I said
that I would cut out all soda and to be
smart about it I said that I wouldn't just go
cold turkey from soda to water that's a little tough
so I did is I went to iced tea and
I transitioned to iced tea with with sugar substitutes so
equal Splenda nutrasweet any of those splendid was my favorite
so I said that I would be cutting out all
sodas because those are a bunch of empty calories and
I also said that I would be cutting back on
portion size really my goal was to to stop overeating
to the point where I just felt very full I
had a full stomach I wanted to eat to the
point where I wasn't hungry anymore but I wasn't filled
either so that was another one and I really decided
to cut out all sweets and desserts besides the soda
you know I would eat candy by OD ice cream
I would eat all sorts of little sweets and I
decided to cut that out and the other thing I
decided to do was really to throw out all food
from my pantries all the food from my fridge so
literally I had no food in the house so snacking
would be impossible so those are some of the things
that I did and the other thing I did is
I realized that you know at that point my my
understanding of fitness advice and health advice and nutrition and
workout procedures was very limited I really hadn't studied it
they were just you know just basic things that I
knew kind of from from popular culture from mainstream media
was that I had to work out I had to
exercise I had to cut my diet I had to
cut out some of this junk food and that you
know the difference between gaining weight losing weight was essentially
calories that's how I saw it I wasn't too too
technical about I just said that if I was eating
less calories then then I was consuming then that would
be enough to start losing weight and at that point
I didn't even make any restrictions as to the kind
of food I could eat I could I could eat
anything as long as I wasn't just overeating and stuffing
myself which was something that I tended to do a
lot and I did though say that I would cut
out sweets so that's kind of how I started and
I also realized that because I had kind of limited
diet and fitness specially fitness advice and understanding at that
time what I did is I started googling and I
found one specific article that I still remember this was
like eight years ago found one specific article about food
cravings that really helped me and kind of set the
tone for how to approach weight loss and it really
what was brilliant about it was the inner gain that
was there it wasn't about some quick fix magic pill
solution but it really set my my my my mental
attitudes right it set them on track and actually what
I did is I went back and I googled and
I was able to find this article this is an
old article from a website called intense - workout calm
and I think this was a brilliant article on the
inner game of tackling food cravings and I think it
even applies to more things than just food cravings and
so what I wanted to do here is I'm looking
at this article that I have and I wanted to
to read some excerpts from it it's pretty long article
and I'm going to read quite a few of the
excerpts from it because I think it's it's brilliant and
it shows you the kind of approach you want to
take towards getting success in any area of your life
if you're really serious if you're not looking for a
stupid little band-aid solution that's gonna work for a week
and then and then fall off and not really lead
to lasting results what I'm talking about here is making
a change that will last for years I've been able
to keep this weight off for eight years and at
this point when it even though I started very disciplined
about it at this point it's very easy for me
to keep that weight off so there were mental shifts
that happen in my brain in my mind in my
belief systems in my my attitudes about weight loss about
nutrition and about fitness that are the result that got
me those results it wasn't just pure behavior change so
I want to read some of this some of this
stuff so this this article was called food cravings how
to stop eating too much junk from intense workout calm
and here's how it starts so it's kind of like
a dialogue so like the the members of the site
would ask this question and then the the author would
answer it so I'm going to read you the question
the question was it's so hard I'm around this type
of food all the time the cravings just won't go
away I have a sweet tooth I just have to
give in to my cravings so this was what the
guys asking and here's the response that the author gives
the author is like a workout guy here's his response
it was a really good one up who the hell
are you to whine a meet shut up already stop
boring me with your story don't give me little stories
like how you're around this type of food all the
time do you think you're the only one buddy everyone
I know and everyone that's around me that's related to
me eats junk food all day long this crappy food
is everywhere I look I'm no different than you except
I don't give in do I have superhuman powers no
do I not give in because my muscles and arms
are bigger than yours no do I not give in
because I can benchpress more than you no do I
not give in because my body fat is lower than
yours no do I not give in because I'm physically
better or physically stronger than you no I don't give
in because I'm mentally stronger than you that's all it
really is is it's mental and for you to give
in and for me not to give in we can
only assume that I am mentally stronger than you how
does that make you feel I don't know damn thing
about you but I know that mentally I can do
something that you can't do it sure makes me feel
good though in fact it motivates me even more so
thanks for being so mentally weak it will make me
work that much harder during my next workout so thanks
a lot and he goes on next time you love
food craving starts to come out think about this look
at that food and think what do I want more
the five seconds of pleasure enjoyment that I'm going to
get from chewing this food or the enjoyment of the
fact that 24 hours every day seven days a week
I will have the body that I want to have
that's what it really comes down to and let me
tell you no food tastes as good as that feeling
feels your reward for sticking with your diet are all
the results that you're going to get so stop giving
your cravings and your cravings will go away it's really
as simple as that now I probably know what you're
thinking you're thinking right now Who am I Who am
I to be telling you this like I never cheat
or like I never give into cravings or have little
cravings no I don't not at all not a little
not in moderation not anything the thought of eating some
type of junk food doesn't even enter my mind I
don't need those five seconds I'm stronger than that call
it willpower call it mental strength my goal is my
result my road to getting that result doesn't have the
five seconds of chewing pleasure on it I eat for
purpose not for pleasure food is not a hobby who
does something you need to survive your body needs it
and in this case in the case of working out
and getting results food is something that your body needs
to get you the results that you want it's fuel
food is nothing more than that so I give my
body only what it needs to make these results happen
because my body need five seconds of chewing chocolate no
does my my need it no my mind is way
too strong to need it and that feels much better
than any piece of chocolate would ever taste and I
love knowing that so it's exactly as hard as it
is for you as it is for everybody else you're
not some special little flower the amount of willpower takes
for you to achieve the result that you need is
this exact same that it takes for anybody else what's
the difference I have what it mentally takes and you
don't so that's the that's those are some long excerpts
from from the intense workout calm article and what I
really loved about that is that it set my inner
game it set the kind of attitude that I need
to have that kind of hardcore attitude and something about
the way that article was written the way the challenging
way and it was written where it was it coddling
you and it wasn't it wasn't sympathizing with you but
it was really provoking you and telling you that you're
a mental weakling basically when you don't have the willpower
to do what you want to do that somehow sparked
something in me combined with that kind of confidence that
I was that I had coming out of those visualizations
in that dream that really that really sent a very
strong foundation for how I wanted to approach it in
fact what happened was that those first few days I
remember very vividly there was a there was a time
late at night usually I have developed a habit of
snacking on stuff like ice cream or chips or candy
bars or whatever chocolate and that was something that I
had to cut out so now after I was on
my diet and after I was go into the gym
one of the I remember very vividly it was late
at night and there was a Klondike bar I remember
there was a pack of Klondike parks in the in
the freezer and I really I was watching TV and
then I got really this this craving for for that
Klondike bar because I was kind of hooked on them
at the time and remember just instinctively almost walking over
there to try to grab it and then what happened
was that I remembered what this article was talking about
and I used this technique specifically the one where he
really talks about you know this little mental game that
you play it on yourself you ask this result this
question you know what do I want more do I
want the five seconds of enjoyment that I'm going to
get from from chewing on that Klondike bar or do
I want that higher level of enjoyment that you get
that pride that you get from from really using your
willpower to create the kind of life that you want
and then the kind of body that you want now
at that point I didn't have any kind of body
I was just getting started so all I could really
rely on was the fact that I was going to
be proud that I was that I was falling through
and I was using my willpower and so at that
point there was something very very decisive that I was
that I very astutely if I may say realized about
myself in that moment which was that that was the
defining moment for me I just saw it that if
in this moment I can't resist that Klondike bar then
everything that I've been talking about that I've been dreaming
about all of that is and all of it is
useless if I could not resist one Klondike bar in
that moment that's it everything else was just empty air
that's where it really came down that's where the rubber
met the road and so I really really struggled with
it to the point where it was almost like like
battling an addiction I've never really taken drugs or anything
but it almost felt like I was that heroin addict
that just needed a hit that's really what it felt
like because I felt like I was very addicted to
sweets and I literally had to resist resist myself and
just just tell myself that this is the defining moment
and what end up happening was that I kind of
went back and forth back and forth and finally I
resisted it and so from that point on everything got
much much easier because that was the moment that defining
moment that showed whether I was really committed or whether
I was deceiving myself and so from that point on
my journey continued I started going to the gym I
hit the gym really hard my schedule for the gym
was that I was going five times a week Mondays
Wednesdays Fridays I would do I would do weightlifting and
and then all five days Monday through Friday I would
do 20 minutes of treadmill so some jogging and then
I would do 30 minutes of weightlifting on those days
that I did weightlifting and then I would do 15
minutes on the on the on the bicycle in the
gym and so it was about an hour and fifteen
minutes of total workout time on Monday Tuesday Friday and
then no I mean I'm one day Wednesday Friday and
then Tuesday and Thursday those were like 30 minute workouts
so I stuck with that I was going to the
gym at first it was very difficult because my body
was totally unused to it what I did smartly is
that I started off very very low so I started
off very slow on the on the jogging very slow
on the treadmill very slow on the kind of weights
that I was lifting so I put the lowest weights
possible started very slow on myself gave myself the opportunity
to do that really told myself that I didn't matter
what I looked like at the gym at that point
I wasn't even going to a full Fletch Jim it
was just a gym in my apartment but even there
when I saw people you know one of the challenges
I think when you first start working out is that
you are you are insecure about how you look when
you work out and the fact that you're not happy
with how you look in you're there and you're sweating
and you're not able to run on the treadmill you're
like running out of pace of three on the treadmill
and you're breaking a sweat and you're you're lifting like
20 pounds on the bench press or something but you
know what I said that it doesn't matter because the
results will prove themselves in six months the other smart
thing that I did was that I made this a
long-term commitment and I said that this was not going
to be a week thing it's not going to be
a month a month thing literally I literally said that
this would take six to twelve months and then after
that constant maintenance by going to the gym and eating
healthy so for me this was a total shift in
how I live my life this was not a little
diet that I was that was undertaking even though my
diet changed quite a bit so those were the details
of how I started go to the gym about what
I started doing with with my eating habits I really
started to I decided for myself that calorie counting was
not going to work part of the thing I think
that's really stupid about calorie counting and you know maybe
it works for you but I think it's it's ultimately
practical is that there's too much work in in in
counting all the little calories that's not something that I
saw in myself that I would be able to maintain
consistently and what I was concerned about there is that
I wasn't gonna do anything that wasn't consistent I wanted
to maintain a consistent schedule - Jim wanted to maintain
a consistent eating something that I could eat consistently so
nothing nothing that would only work for a week or
two so what I did was I decided that I'm
not going to be counting calories what's going to be
important is that I just want to use my own
feelings of hunger and fullness in my body and use
that as a gauge to lose weight instead of pulling
out calculators and all the other stuff part of the
reason is that I didn't really even know at that
point I was eating out a lot I wouldn't cook
at home I would go out eat and I didn't
know how many calories were in what were in all
the stuff that was being served to me and finding
all that out and counting it up felt like a
real chore so what I thought would work well better
for me is just using that feeling of hunger and
and so that's exactly what I did is I started
to to really look at fullness and hunger and within
myself and when I was eating I always I always
first thing I did was I said that the first
thing I'm going to do is start leaving a little
bit of food on the plate each time and so
if I was eating a burger I could eat the
whole burger and then I would eat most the fries
but I would leave like one fry just one fry
and I started very slow because I knew I wanted
to ramp up into it and you'd be surprised how
hard it is just to leave one fry on the
plate because on the one hand it seems like well
one fry that's nothing I mean you can eat the
whole burger and a and a whole handful of fries
and then to leave one it's it's like insignificant calorie
wise and you know what what's the point and so
but you what you'd be surprised when you start to
do that especially if you don't have a habit of
that and you have a habit of overeating or just
eating everything on the plate is that it starts to
to to actually become hard and your your mind starts
playing tricks on you like one of the tricks your
mind plays is this this idea of wasting food like
I shouldn't lead and leave any food on the plate
that's gonna that's gonna be wasted like what why waste
a fry why don't I just eat it you know
it's not very significant just there's like five calories maybe
ten calories in that fry why don't I just eat
it just to finish it up for sake of completeness
right and I would always finish my plate that was
just a habit that I have and so here I
started to break that habit that was part of the
the challenge of it part of the importance of doing
that and then also what I did was I started
ramping it up so at first it was one fry
then it was two fries then it was half the
prize and and then it was not even that half
the fries but it was also like a quarter of
the burger was left uneaten and this was challenging for
me because I really had this limiting belief around wasting
food I thought that leaving food on the plate was
bad it was wasteful that was like money and resources
that were not being consumed and that I would the
other oh the other the other belief that I had
is that oh if I don't finish this then I'm
gonna get hungry I'm gonna get hungry really soon and
I'm not gonna be able to focus on my schoolwork
I'm not going to be able to to do this
and that because I'm just going to be hungry and
so that's another way that your mind is playing tricks
on you when you're trying to do that so you
know I went I worked through that and I really
resisted and I kept leaving a little bit more a
little bit more on the plate eventually what started happening
was that usually the portions that you get served we
go out to restaurants or fast food or anything they're
usually way too big they're more than you need so
part of the challenge was that when I was eating
the whole plate I was overeating and then I was
stuffing myself hole I was feeding feeling bad about it
and just getting a massive excess of calories and so
when I started leaving stuff on the plate I started
to feel a little less full every time I left
the dinner table and it was good because I what
I really wanted was I wanted to reach this point
where I would eat to become moderately full but not
stuffed and just enough to the point where my hunger
was I was still a little bit hungry at the
end of the meal but I knew that when I
if I if I left the meal and I walked
out and waited 10 15 minutes all that food would
get to my stomach and finally I would feel just
kind of that perfect level of the point where I
just satisfied my hunger but I didn't over over stuff
myself and so I really worked towards that kind of
just working with the feelings of my body and doing
some of these behavior changes like leaving food on the
plate and eventually I got to the point where where
I was doing that and I also got more comfortable
with hunger the feeling of hunger because before before I
started this whole diet and fitness thing what happened was
that I was very hunger was like a was like
a very big no-no like in my mind I would
build it up as something like that's a horrible thing
to have a horrible feeling to have you can't have
hunger you can't you can't cope with hunger you're not
supposed to be hungry that kind of stuff and all
that nonsense was really preventing me is those limiting me
because it meant that I was over over stuffing myself
all the time so what I started doing was I
started to purposefully keep myself hungry and it was true
that after you know after you leave a meal and
you're not overly stuffed then you'll get hungry faster and
what I just learned to do was I learned to
we just accept that hunger that I would have it
so literally I started to kind of to kind of
start myself and that was the second side of my
approach the first approach side of the approach was to
to do a lot of fitness fitness work so working
at the gym and the second part of the approach
was to really get a calorie deficit to shed the
pounds and I started there were some times where I
was really like I was skipping meals I or I
was substituting meals for something very lightweight like a yogurt
or like a chocolate pudding type of thing so that
I got a bigger calorie deficit and I was weighing
myself every day so I could see the results I
said that the first two weeks I wouldn't really be
judging myself by any results and and so I didn't
because I knew that it takes some time to start
to trigger the weight loss but then after those two
weeks I started to see very consistent very consistent drop
in weight on the scale sometimes a pound every couple
of days ultimately I lost 65 pounds in five months
so if you do the math on that then that
comes out to about two pounds a week two maybe
three pounds a week I was losing so that was
done through a combination of five days a day to
gym and and that kind of a under eating and
feeling a little bit hungry all the time and just
learning to cope with it and to deal with it
and at that point I was so committed that it's
very surprising how fast those five months flew by and
the way just just dropped off to the point where
is really crazy people were we're telling me like how
how big of a change I was able to make
because people around me saw it friends saw people at
college saw it my parents my parents and my family
saw it and it was a really really big drastic
change in fact one interesting point that totally threw me
off guard that I wasn't expecting at all was how
people around me would react to the weight to the
weight loss biggest challenge was that at that point I
was living away from my parents my parents were living
in another state I was in California they were in
Texas and so they didn't really see me for a
long time and then what happened was that the I
lost all this weight and they knew me their whole
life as this overweight as as a silver weight kid
and overweight adult in college and then what happened was
when they saw me when I was thin they were
they were literally shocked like so shocked that they couldn't
believe it in fact they they really I thought that
they would congratulate me for the achievements that I made
in fact it was the opposite like they started telling
me that I need to put the weight back on
that I was too thin and I was too skinny
when in fact I was at that point I was
still not at my ideal body weight right now I'm
about 175 and so in there I was going to
be like 180 or something like that so it was
perfectly healthy weight but they really started fearing that I
was anorexic or that I was I was dropping the
way too fast or really that I'm just too skinny
like they would tell me all you're all skin and
bones are all skin and bones you need to put
some fat on the body well one thing that I
really realized was that a big factor that contributed to
my overall weight gain was the environment that I was
in fact is that I grew up in in household
where food was always was always was always eaten in
massive quantities and there was no there's no sense of
holding yourself back there was no real value placed on
Fitness there was no value placed on eating healthy foods
there's no value placed on moderation of food so we
would always have huge portions always seconds always desserts always
this always that and and always this attitude that that
was totally normal totally fine so part of the challenge
when you're making big changes in your life and this
relates to to weight loss or really any other aspect
maybe if you're starting a business or if you're you
know you're planning to change your relationship up or any
any kind of improvement that you're making in yourself is
that if it's dry if it's drastic enough improvement very
counter-intuitively and almost almost scary that the friends and people
that you hang out with your family a lot of
times will start to hold you back from making those
changes and there are various theories on this one of
the theories that has been said a lot is that
literally they do it because they lose the ability to
manipulate and control you and that's kind of that's kind
of a you know kind of dark and Machiavellian to
say that the people are out there controlling you but
people the fact is that people do fall into a
into habits they have certain habits of how they see
you they put a certain projection of an image on
you there's certain ways that you act around your friends
different than how you react around your family different than
how you act around your coal your co-workers or your
boss and so all these people have certain expectations of
you that you've set up and when you try to
set yourself on a different path you start challenging a
lot of those expectations and all the sudden several things
happen one is that you might make those those other
people in your life insecure about what they're doing so
if you lost a lot of weight and you have
friends that are fat overweight or fat then what's going
to happen is that they're going to start to be
either jealous of you or resentful of you because you've
been able to make that change and they haven't and
it reflects very poorly on them that they haven't been
able to make that change because when you're in that
kind of state and you see someone that has become
thin then it's kind of like oh I should be
stepping up why am I not doing that but the
fact is that for those people because they're not motivated
intrinsically to do it it really rubs their ego the
wrong way so their ego gets in the way their
ego says to them that this guy is the enemy
that this change is too weird we don't like this
new change we don't like this new you we don't
like that you're thin anymore we don't like that you're
smarter now we don't like that you're in this new
relationship we don't like that you started a business for
XYZ reasons and a lot of that is because those
people are are used to a certain expectation from you
and maybe you start acting differently in front of them
maybe now you're not as keen on going out and
drinking with them you're not as keen on going out
and splitting a dessert or getting fast food and obviously
that starts to change the dynamics of the relationship and
that's not something that they might be very comfortable with
not to mention that you're really telling they're you're telling
their ego to step up and a lot of times
your ego wants to protect itself and do do nothing
basically is to stay in that steady state and it's
hard to deceive yourself when you're trying to do that
it's literally like an ostrich sticking its head in the
ground so a lot of times P around you will
would be ostriches with their head in the sand and
when they see you making changes that that's like taking
their head out of the sand and making them look
around and seeing what's really out there and what's really
possible for themselves and if they're so caught up in
their own then they're gonna want to put their head
back in the sand and they'll resent you for pulling
their head out so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's
a lot of times why sometimes really to make the
biggest changes that you make the best way to do
it is to do something very drastic like actually start
changing your friends start changing the relationship in the dynamics
you have with your family because a lot of times
that can really hold you back from making progress figuring
out new ways to interact with friends and family sometimes
your friends you literally need to outgrow your friends and
get totally new friends or your friends just keep dragging
you back in it's that analogy of those crabs where
you stick a bunch of crabs in a bucket and
if the crabs worked together or if one of the
crabs tries to crawl out he can actually do it
he can actually scurry up the side and crawl out
but what happens is just as he's trying to do
that one of the other crabs in the bucket grabs
him by the by the leg and pulls him back
down just because instinctively that's what they're doing and so
that crabs in the bucket analogy is it's crazy how
and kind of freaky that that actually would happen with
humans and with your friends and the people that you
think care for you the most but when you start
making these big changes you find that that's very very
true it's a very it's a very real phenomenon so
that is my story of how I lost 65 pounds
in five months and have been able to keep it
off for eight years I think there's a lot more
that I could say about this they'll probably do another
video blogs one thing I want to conclude with is
that when I started really it was very very much
about willpower and what I really learned from this whole
experience was that first of all you need to connect
with your motivation if you're not connected with your motivation
nothing else would happen but even then the importance of
willpower and to be able to power through challenges and
to be very persistent very disciplined is so important to
being able to make big changes but the other thing
that I learned is that like at this point the
kind of willpower I have to exert to lose that
weight is not the kind of willpower no I now
need to maintain it so at this point so many
of my beliefs and mindsets have permanently shifted that now
if I see for example stop going to the gym
I'm not perfect about going to the gym I still
go about five times a week on average lately I've
been skipping a few days here and there and that's
something I want to I want to correct again in
myself but what I really what I'm really doing now
is that if for example I don't I don't go
to the gym for a whole week if I even
miss um two weeks of gym my body starts to
naturally feel this urge to go and exercise which is
not to say that I can't totally fall out of
the habit I have to be vigilant all the time
I'm still staying true to that promise to myself that
I would be going to the gym for the rest
of my life that's exactly how I see it so
there's no there's no there's no one thing that I
just do here and then I have it for the
rest of my life it's not like I've gone to
the gym for a few years and then that's good
now I'm going to the gym forever and same thing
with diet my diet my tastes for for what I
put in my body have drastically evolved since then I've
done paleo really cut out a lot of carbs cut
out a lot of sugars there's still more work that
I'm trying to do on that front but it certainly
improved a lot I've really cut out cut out even
sugar substitutes I used to rely a lot on Splenda
and iced tea at this point I do mostly drink
water sometimes fruit juice no soft drinks um desserts I
try to really stay away from any sort of desserts
I try to stay away from any sort of breads
I haven't eaten bread in in months so I've done
months where I haven't eaten any bread any grains and
that has been really good for my energy just besides
looking good there's also energy and also my long-term health
so what has happened is that once I started looking
good that was my prime motivation I just got got
thin and fit once I got that then I started
to to get into building muscle I got I did
a lot of study on how to do proper weight
lifting techniques that kind of stuff like squats and deadlifts
really got into that for a while um also got
involved with you so started looking at paleo started looking
at healthy ways to eat and I really started to
to think about not just getting fit for looks but
getting fit for energy and getting fit for for performance
so that I'm able to perform better at work I'm
able to perform better in bed all this kind of
stuff so I'm able to live longer I'm less likely
to develop cancer and diabetes and all these other nasty
diseases that that will potentially develop if you don't if
you don't really take care of your body you
