Hey, this is Leo, for Actualized.org. And in this episode,
I'm gonna speak about the 27 qualities of all successful
people. ♪ (Intro music) ♪ So, the other day, I
started thinking: What are the common patterns and characteristics of
people who are very successful in life? One of my
personal hobbies is to study success, and I've studied a
lot of psychology material, but also biographies and histories where
I just sit down and I dissect people from the
last several thousand years of human history, and I take
a look at what ticked in their life, what went
on behind the scenes? How did they actually work? How
did they get to some of these amazing positions that
they were able to get to? Whether it's an artist,
or a performer, or an actor or a political leader,
or a bussiness person, or an entrepreneur or whoever. And
so I came up with the following list of 27
characteristics; which I think is quite accurate because, basically what
I did, is I kinda crossed reference of a lot
of stuff that I`ve read over the last many years.
And I wanna present that to you here. And if
you're someone who's been struggling with success or who wants
to really make it big in life, then these are
the points that you wanna be really mindful of going
forward, making sure that you plug any holes that you
have in this list. So here we go, these are
in no particular order; I'm not saying that the first
ones are the most important, basically I think that they're
all important. So, the first is passion. Successful people are
passionate people. Not only are they just passionate about what
they do, which is kind of a cliché, you probably
knew that already; but here's something that you might have
not thought about before: I think that what's going on
deep on someone's psychology, if they're successful, is that they're
inspired on some level by life. Somewhere. Are you inspired
by life? Maybe you're inspired by art, or by nature,
or by music, or by writing, or by speaking, or
by other... examples of amazing people, or you're inspired by
technology, and science and human knowledge... Something about life has
to inspire you! This is kind of a deeper point.
For example, I think about like, an amazing mathematician. If
you think about an amazing mathematician, the reason he is
amazing is not just because he is good at math!
That's a mediocre mathematician. Anyone can just be good at
math; an amazing mathematician LOVES math! He doesn't just love
math, he's not just passionate about... Something in math inspires
him on a almost spiritual level. And I think that
this is true across the board with successful people. Another
characteristic is that they're hardworking. Very, very hardworking. Abnormally hardworking!
Mediocre people, which is the opposite of a successful person,
is a mediocre person; these people are not hardworking! They're
lazy, and they work 40 hours a week and that's
about it. They put in the bare minimum. To get
by. That's no the case with successful people. Successful people
are obsessive about how they work. They're almost workaholics. And
this can become a negative trait. Not all the characteristics
I'm gonna be listing here are all positive traits, some
of these can backfire on you and you can take
them to one extreme where they become actually quite toxic.
A lot of very successful people can't stop doing work!
They can't stop. So this is kinda, like, of one
of their weaknesses. But it's also a very important STREGHT,
because you're not gonna get successful without massive amounts of
hard work. Strong work ethic! Is absolutely necessary. Also, successful
people are extremely persistent! Now, this is probably another cliché
you've heard a lot, you know, "be persistent, persistence is
important", but you don't really fathom the importance of persistence
until you've actually tried to accomplish something big in your
life. Something that had low odds of success. Like, you
try to become an actor, or you try to start
a business; you try to do these things and then
you see how easily and how often you fail. And
how hard it is to keep working in the face
of failure, over and over again, you just fail again,
and again and again, and you just have to keep
going! If you wanna be successful. See, successful people have
a high tolerance for failure, they don't take it personally,
they don't get depressed about it, they just keep going
forward. Plowing forward every single time. Until they get to
their goal. This is a very rare characteristic in people.
Which is why success is quite uncommon. Also, successful people
are iconoclastic, which means that they're rule breakers! These people
do not follow the rules! Of society, of the organization,
of the family unit, or of the religious structure or
whatever. This doesn't mean that they do illegal stuff, necessarily.
It just means that they are kinda flexible with the
rules, They're able to skirt around the rules, they're able
to bend the rules, they're able to think outside the
box! And this is important! Because, to get stuff past
through the system, requires thinking outside the box a lot.
If you're thinking inside the box, then you just get
the results of the mass, of the herd. And the
herd doesn't really get extraordinary results. You wouldn't wanna call
them sucessful; you'd call them mediocre. More accurate. Also, this
is kind of a secondary point, but i put as
a whole independent characteristic here on the list; is cleverness.
I think succesful people are abnormally clever than the bunch.
And they're manipulative! They're good at manipulating situations and people
to get what they want past through. So maybe this
person is good at manipulating a bureaucracy, manipulating a government
system, manipulating their family, manipulating their friends, manipulating people in
their company, you know? Manipulating giant masses of crowds, the
way that politicians sometimes do. And manipulation could of course
be bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be used towards
evil, it could also be used towards good. So manipulation
is kinda like a tool or tactic that can be
used. It's an ability that people have, you know. Some
people are good manipulators, other people are bad manipulators. If
you're a bad manipulator, it's gonna be hard for you
to become successful! And if you're not very clever about
how you do your manipulations, and if you're not very
clever at thinking around obstacles and problems, then you'll just
gonna hit an obstacle, and it's gonna look to you
like just a giant brick wall. And you're not gonna
be clever enough to realize: "Oh! I can walk around
it! Or I can dig my way under it! Or
I can bash my way through with a sledgehammer!" See?
That requires some cleverness. Very important, because you're gonna have
a lot of obstacles on your journey towards success. Another
characteristic is creativity. Successful people are highly creative people! And
I don't just mean here a creativity on the artsy
sense, of like "He's very imaginative and poetic". I don't
mean creative in that sense. Although that's a great atribute
to have. I mean more in the more fundamental definition
of creativity; meaning like, you can create stuff. That's what
it basically means. The ability to create. Not just in
the arts, but anywhere! In business or anywhere else. Successful
people are creative people, they create lots of stuff! And
speaking of which, another point that goes along this, is
that creative people generate massive value. What this means is,
they don't just impact tens of people, or hundreds of
people; they impact thousands, or milions, or even bilions of
people! With their work, or with their ideas, with their
speeches or with whatever. You need to generate massive quantities
of value in today's world in order to become successful.
Also, successful people have a training in technical skills. STRONG
training in technical skills. They're willing to train hard to
develop their technnical skills. In whatever field they are trying
to master and become successful at. This is a big
obstacle for many people, 'cause many people just assume that
"If I just put in my time, if just go
to work and punch the clock then that's gonna be
enough to make me successful!". And the truth is that
it won't. What you need to do is something called
"deliberate practice", where you deliberately, methodically practice certain set of
skills over and over and over again, until you master
it finally. And this takes a lot of hard work.
Which most people are not willing to do. But successful
people are, and they invest thousands of hours mastering the
technical skills. What do I mean by "technical skills"? Well,
if you're a computer programmer it's the programming skills, if
you're a speaker, it's speaking skills, if you're an actor
it's acting skills, if you're a secretarious, typing skills; you
know, whatever. Every single carrier or field that you're gonna
be successful in has a certain set of technical skills
that needs to be mastered to perfection! And that takes
a lot of deliberate practice to do, which most people
are not willing to do. Most people are mediocre because
they have mediocre technical skills. Also, successful people value excellence
above the mediocre people. They really want to do excellent
work. They take pride in their work. They have this
sense of being the best at what they do, or
doing something really exceptionally well. That gives them a certain
joy and a certain satisfaction that the mediocre person, I
don't see having! To the mediocre person, doing a average,
piss-poor job is good enough. And that just doesn't cut
if you wanna be successful. Also, successful people have vision!
They are visionaries! This means that they can see a
big, bright picture of what the future should look like.
For them, for their life, for their followers, for their
businness partners, for their customers. They see into the future.
That's a very powerful skill to develop. Also, they're leaders!
Because they have this vision, now they lead people. And
they don't necessarily need to be leading milions of people;
there are successful people who lead very few people. But
nevertheless, they are leaders! Because what they're doing, fundamentally, is
they're carving their own path through life. And they are
on the cutting-edge of their field. And they're not content
to just be followers. They don't just pick someone to
follow and follow that person to success. No, they do
a bit of that, but ultimately they have to break
off from anyone they followed in their life, and they
have to break off on their own, and do it
themselves! Their own way! And that usually means some new
unique way that hasn't been done before! That where the
iconoclasm comes in, that's where the clever thinking comes in.
See, all these points, they all synergise together. One requires
the other in many cases. Also, I found that successful
people are intuitive, more so than the average person. They
know how to use their intuition. They are guided by
their heart and by their gut, more than just by
their logical mind. They're right brain thinkers, they're holistic thinkers;
they can take in and assess multiple variables, in a
kind of a complex, holistic way. And then they can
get this big picture view of what needs to be
done. And sometimes it just comes as a gut feeling!
They don't even know where it comes from, but you
know, a good entrepreneur just get this gut feeling, like:
"We need to enter this new market place". Or, "We
need to change our marketing this way", or "We need
to launch this new product that nobody says people would
want, but I just feel like the market wants this
product!". And then they end up being right, because they're
using that intuition there. Also, successful people are decisive! This
is a huge point! Most mediocre people are highly indecisive!
They don't know how to choose between this career, or
that career. This major or that major. "I have 10
different majors, which major should I choose?" Or, "I can
go into 5 different lines of business, which one should
I choose?" Or, "I can go do this carrer or
that carrer, which one should I choose?" Most people really
hesitate there, they don't make a firm decision, and they're
not clear about what they really want in life! And
so, they get just that! They get a muddled result!
A mediocre result! If you want a excellent result, you
need to be very, very, crystal-clear about what you want.
And that's what successful people manage to do. Also, they
don't do what they do because of the money. If
you think that you're gonna become successful because you're putting
money first, and money is you top priority and your
top goal, and that this will motivate you to become
successful, you're really putting the cart before the horse. And
you've got this whole equation backwards. And you're actually selling
yourself short, and you will be far less sucessful than
you could have otherwise been. For successful people it's not
about the money! Sure; money can come as a byproduct,
in fact lots of money can come as a byproduct,
but that's not why they do what they do. Successful
people are motivated because... They wanna impact the world. They
wanna have a positive contribution to society. Maybe because they
got a big ego and a lot of pride. And
they wanna grow and expand, and aggrandize that ego. Which
is not necessarily a very healthy drive, but still, that's
superior to being driven by money alone. And of course,
most successful people just love the actual work that they
do! They're passionate about it! So it comes more or
less naturally to them. Not because of the money. Also,
successful people are focused! Highly focused. They are able to
select one field or domain and invest years of time
and build up a lot of experience in that one
field. Whereas mediocre people bounce around and dabble a lot,
and they never master any one field because they lack
focus. Think of successful people like a laser beam, and
mediocre people like a diffuse light bulb. Shining in all
directions. Also, successful people are ambitious! They have a desire
to be the best. This point might sound very similar
to the point I made earlier about valuing excellence. But
I think there's something unique and different here, about this
point of ambitiousness. What I see is that to be
successful you have to have a sense of ambition. It's
like you wanna rise to the top. It's almost an
ego thing. And I'm not saying that this is necessarily
the healthiest drive; but there's this kind of desire to
be the best, to be the top of your field.
To be the one who accomplishes something really great and
extraordinary. That's what we call ambition. You need that, in
order to actually rise to the top! 'Cause how can
you compete with other ambitious people if you yourself are
not ambitious? It's not gonna work. Also, successful people have
a rapid speed of implementation. Which means that as soon
as they hear an idea, or they have a great
idea, they go off and they immediately start to implement
that idea. They don't just sit around and philosophize, and
theorize, and do armchair philosophy with their social circle. They
don't just talk about it; they actually go out and
do it! They implement it! They have a bias towards
action. Rather than sitting and thinking. 'Cause when you sit
and think a lot, you get into paralysis by analysis.
Right? And if you get into that situation, then you're
not actually out there doing stuff, which means you're not
actually creating success. So they avoid that trap. And a
lot of mediocre people do the whole paralysis by analysis
thing, and they also sit around and mull over ideas
for years, without actually doing anything. Also, I find successful
people are opinionated! They have firm and strong opinions. Because
they have firm and strong values and beliefs. Because, of
course, they are decisive! And the other point that goes
along with this, is that they have a spine! Successful
people have a spine. Which means that they stand up
for themselves, and their values, and their beliefs, and their
ideas. They don't just meekly sit in a corner, while
everybody else is out there talking and implementing and you
know, taking charge. They're the ones who stand up and
take charge. It's the mediocre people that sit in a
corner, and quietly think about their own values and ideas
and never have the courage to stand up and fight
for what they really believe in! It's quite important. Because,
if you don't have spine, then what will happen is,
other people will just overpower you! Institutions... popular culture... your
friends, the media, all this kind of stuff will just
come in and then overpower you! And you will never
have a chance; it will be like a tidal wave
hitting you and knocking you down, to the ground. You
need to have a very firm spine. Also, successful people
are optmistic and hopeful. Fundamentally, they believe in themselves. They
believe that they can! And they believe that... people around
them can! And they believe that society can. Now this
is a subtle point which is different from depression. So
when I say "optimistic" and "hopeful", I don't mean that
this is to the exclusion of depression, a lot of
successful people are actually quite depressed! A lot of successful
people kill themselves from depression! But I still think that
fundamentally they're hopeful. Because they still belive, at least in
some capacity, that either they can do it, or somebody
else can do it, or they have some kind of
positive outlook in the sense that like, they believe in
science, or they believe in technology, or they believe in
arts, or they believe in the power of writing, or
they believe in the power of humanity to reform itself.
Something hopeful like that. Because, if you can't believe in
any of these things and you can't believe in yourself,
then how are you gonna accomplish anything? You're not gonna
become successful if you don't honestly believe that you can
become successful! You have to have at least that much
hope! Even if you're depressed! Depression is kind of a
separate issue. Also, successful people are courageous. Which means that
they are willing to act in the face of fear.
It doesn't mean that they don't have fear; they have
plenty of fear. But the difference is that they're gonna
ACT even though they're afraid. They don't let the fear
paralyse, or stop them, or scare them away. Also, successful
people value knowledge and learning. In some capacity. It doesn't
necessarily need to be book smarts, it could be street
smarts. It could be learning from your coworkers. Or learning
in a social environment. Or learning from brute trial and
error experience! But they have to value learning and knowlege,
because without learning and knowledge you're not gonna get very
far, you're not gonna master anything, you're not gonna be
able to develop technical skills! And you're not gonna be
good at anything! So you have to value knowledge and
learning, at least in some capacity, at least within your
field. If not across the board. Successful people are willing
to endure the cost. And they're willing to make sacrifices
to get success. Success comes with certain sacrifices in many
cases. Not always, don't make it a limiting belief; but
there generally are sacrifices! People who work hard and long
usually don't have as much fun, they don't socialize as
much, they don't have as much sex, they don't party
as much, they don't drink as much, they don't do
a lot of entertaining stuff as much, they don't spend
as much time with family! Their relationships could suffer. Are
of these things are sacrifices that successful people are willing
to make. And when it comes down to a choice
between all of these things and success, they will select
success. Whereas to mediocre people, usually this trade-off goes the
other way. They would rather have the socializing, the partying,
the fun, the entertainment, and the relationships than success. And
that's exactly usually what they get. Also, successful people are
highly self motivated! Intrinsically motivated versus extrinsically motivated. Intrinsic motivation
means that you're fueled from the inside. Nobody has to
kick you in the ass to tell you what to
do. You do it yourself, you kick yourself in the
ass! And this is where successful people can actually turn
this into a neurosis, is that they actually beat themselves
up too much! They guilt themselves too much, they push
themselves too hard! Then they have a heart attack, or
something like this. Or they burn out. But they have
this very strong self motivation streak. Also, successful people are
long-term thinkers. They think ten years down the road. Not
just one year down the road, they way most people
do. You have to be a long term thinker in
order be successful, because to be successful you need to
spend at least five or ten years developing some sort
of proficiency or excellence in some kind of field! How
are you gonna do that, if you don't plan five,
ten years down the road? It's almost impossible! Which is
why mediocre people struggle so much with this, is because
they only think 1 year down the road! If even
that far. And so, they're no able to master, basically,
anything of value. And so, they have nothing of value
to offer to the world, and so the world offers
them no success, back in return. I also find that
successful people are pragmatic. What does this mean? This means
they're practical! They're more practical than they are ideological or
idealistic. They don't just sit and espouse grand theories of
politics, or religion, and business, and all this kind of
stuff. All the theories, those are nice. But when you
actually go out into the real world and you try
to create real success and real results, you realize very
quickly that if you're not willing to be pragmatic and
align yourself to the realities of the market place, the
realities of the political climate, the realities of the time
you're living in, the realities of the organization you're trying
to create change in, then nothing happens! All your wishful
thinking and all your philosophies and theories, they mean very
little, if you're not willing to be pragmatic! If you're
not willing to compromise certain elements of your ideology to
get stuff push through! Sometimes, this means compromising your integrity
a little bit, in favour of pushing something through. Not
always will you get it YOUR way! Not always will
the perfect scenario just materialize for you, and this is
exactly how it's gonna be, and it's gonna be the
perfect movie, the perfect project, the perfect business situation, the
perfect loan, the perfect financing, rarely do you get the
perfect! When you're trying to achieve something big. Usually, you
have to cut corners and make sacrifices there. And this
requires a willingness to be practica! Versus ideological. And lastly,
successful people work for themselves. This point is interesting, because
certainly there are a lot of successful people who are
not just self-employed. So, I don't mean that all successful
people are self-employed, even though many are. What I mean
is, even if they're working for a organization, or they're
working in the government, if they're successful, they're not working
FOR the government or FOR the organization, they're really working
for themselves! WITHIN the government or WITHIN the organization. They're
fundamentally advancing their own agenda! Not the organization's agenda! People
who are loyal to the organization's agenda usually are like
cogs in the machine. And they don't make it very
far. They don't make the best leaders! The best leaders
are a little bit egotistical, and they're a little bit
narcissistic, and they're a little bit selfish! And these qualities
turn out to be effective when you're trying to rise
to the top. Those are the 27 points. How did
you compare? Take a look, write them down. Make a
list of notes. And then maybe you can even make
an assessment and see, rank yourself in a scale of
1 to 10, how good are you on each one
of these 27 points? And I guarantee that if you're
good across the board, and you only miss a couple
of them, then you're in line for a big success
in your life. And if you're missing many of these,
then you're gonna struggle with success a lot! A lot,
a lot. The good news is that all this stuff
is changeable! You can work on all this stuff. Through
self actualization work. Which is what this channel is about.
My videos are about all of this. So if any
of these points, you find like you're really deficient in,
and you need to work on your self motivation, or
your pragmatism, or you need to work on your courage,
or your need to work on your passion, all of
these things I have videos that talk about how to
do this kind of stuff. So search around, find them.
And if you don't find them, there's books about this,
all this stuff is well known and well studied! So
don't fret. Don't feel like just because you don't have
one of these characteristics then you're stuck and screwed and
that's it. It's not it! There's much, much, that you
can do. Here I just wanted to give you a
