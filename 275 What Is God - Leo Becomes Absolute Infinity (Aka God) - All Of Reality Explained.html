            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4VNoe5tn3tg' target='_blank'>What Is God - Leo Becomes Absolute Infinity (Aka God) - All Of Reality Explained</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Initial introduction of the lecture</b>: This section of the video begins with Leo promising to share the deepest insight that he has ever had in his life which revolves around his experience of absolute infinity and becoming conscious of the entire structure of reality. He notes this can be achieved quickly and will discuss it further in next week's episode. 
</li><li><b>Leos experimentation with psychedelics</b>: Leo mentions his recent experimentation with psychedelics and his discovery of a rare, little-known substance that induces 100% ego death within five to ten minutes. He emphasizes that this substance is distinctive to other common psychedelics as it strips away your ego but maintains your clarity of thought.
</li><li><b>Leos perspective on the ego</b>: Highlighting his years spent pursuing enlightenment, Leo talks about the significance of experiencing a reality without the ego, which he mentions could cause a radical shift in perspective and raises contemplative questions about existence.
</li><li><b>Leos stance on the concept of God</b>: Leo shares his skeptical view on the concept of God, noting his intellectual and rational approach to understanding life and reality. He mentions his atheistic stance most of his life due to the lack of explanatory power behind the concept of God. However, he assures viewers to keep an open mind about his insights achieved through the use of psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Leo's profound experience with the psychedelic substance</b>: Leo describes his experience with the ego-stripping psychedelic substance. He mentions how the substance intensifies consciousness rapidly, leading to a shift in the perception of reality that seems impossible and defies laws of physics and logic.
</li><li><b>Leo's realization of absolute infinity</b>: Leo details the profound realization that reality is absolutely infinite, a revelation so shocking that it felt as if his life had completely changed. He notes that this insight led him to experience a state of existence where he became absolute infinity, invoking continuous exclamations of 'Oh my God', signifying shock and disbelief.
</li><li><b>Leo's Reaction to Becoming God</b>: Expressed utter amazement upon realizing he is God, which he describes as absolute infinity. He acknowledges his initial discomfort using the term "God" given its cultural baggage.
</li><li><b>Understanding Absolute Infinity</b>: Proposes that the concept of absolute infinity goes beyond common interpretations of mathematically or geometrically infinite sequences. Referring to it as infinity raised to infinity's power, an infinite number of times, encompassing everything in all dimensions. 
</li><li><b>Perception of Reality</b>: Explains that reality is beyond physical constraints or dimensions, like an infinite field of possibilities, including things that don't exist or are impossible. It has no limits and is perpetually expanding. 
</li><li><b>Example of Alternate Universes</b>: Describes an example involving moving a grain of sand creating a different universe. Extrapolates the idea to every particle in the universe being shifted, leading to infinite possible universes.
</li><li><b>Absolute Infinity Realization</b>: Clarifies that the concept of absolute infinity entails all possible and non-existing realities across all time. It is devoid of sensory properties and one can only be aware of it by existing as it, i.e., becoming God. This insight also dispels the reality of life, leading to an awakening from life.
</li><li><b>Absolute Infinity Contains Time</b>: Pinpoints that time is contained within absolute infinity as one dimension among countless others. Elaborates that absolute infinity is a dimensionless point containing everything possible, equatable to God. 
</li><li><b>Awakening from Life</b>: Shares the impact of becoming aware of his state as absolute infinity which caused him to awaken from lifea profound and shocking experience beyond comprehension.
</li><li><b>Leo's Awakening as Absolute Infinity</b>: In this portion of the video, Leo Gura recounts his intense experience of awakening into absolute infinity, likening it to unzipping a costume and shedding one's ego. He describes this state of existence as being nothing yet encompassing everything that's ever possible without any limits or bounds. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Ego and Awakening</b>: Leo emphasizes that experiencing this awakening allows one to truly comprehend what the ego means - that it is not just about being egotistical or selfish, but it is your entire life as you know it. He mentions that the difference between 'reality' and 'awakening from reality' is greater than the difference between waking from a dream into everyday life.
</li><li><b>Contextualizing 'God' and 'Awakening'</b>: He provides context to the term 'God', stating it became the most natural explanation during his experience of becoming absolute infinity. Leo stresses that the term 'God' is only appropriate when it is experienced, not as an idea. Similarly, he conveys that the true meaning of 'awakening' can only be understood through direct experience.
</li><li><b>Chemical-induced Experience and shift in understanding Reality</b>: Discussing his experience with a psychedelic, Leo shares how this chemical experience defied conventional understanding of human experience, making him realize that everything he knew about reality was wrong. He described his previous comprehension of reality as an 'infinite delusion'.
</li><li><b>Experience of God and Beauty</b>: Leo portrays his encounter with 'God' or 'absolute infinity' as an experience of pure, raw beauty, filled with awe, shock, and a tinge of terror. It involved an emotional and physical response, that changed him profoundly and released a lot of energy from his body.
</li><li><b>Reconciling the Limited Ego and Absolute Infinity</b>: After returning to his usual ego-bound state, Leo grappled with reconciling his limited existence with the concept of absolute infinity. His current hypothesis is that reality is an infinite matrix in infinite dimensions where everything possible is happening simultaneously. His existence in his limited form allows absolute infinity to be truly infinite.
</li><li><b>Leo's Background and Philosophical Journey</b>: Leo Gura describes himself as a previously rational, atheist philosopher, who for years struggled with existential questions. He didn't find philosophical explanations for the existence of evil, for instance, satisfying.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Absolute Infinity</b>: Emphasizing his understanding of absolute infinity, Leo suggests that absolute infinity includes everything, challenging rational understanding. He suggests his previous existential questions are now explained, and he attained 'satisfaction' when he regarded reality as absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Impact of an Eye-Opening Experience</b>: Leo describes a transformative experience that he suggests is more impactful than years of meditation, retreats, and self-inquiry. He underlines that after this awakening, he became aware of the insignificance of society's common life goals (like money, relationships, business success) as these were distractions from experiencing 'infinite reality.'
</li><li><b>Fear Preventing Awakening</b>: Leo points out that fear and attachment to the limited reality that we perceive to be crucial holds us back from awakening to the depth of infinite existence. He uses an analogy of a poor man unwilling to let go of his only possession (a paper cup) to illustrate our fear that prevents us from gaining the 'entire universe.'
</li><li><b>Experience of Becoming God</b>: Describing his recurring experiences induced by a specific chemical substance, Leo expresses how it led him to feel like he transformed into God during his sleep. Even after the substance's effects wore away, he could recall becoming 'absolute infinity' while asleepa memory so powerful and petrifying that it would wake him up and bring him to tears.
</li><li><b>The Overwhelming Nature of the Experience</b>: Highlighting the overwhelming nature of the supernatural experience, Leo discourages daily use of the substance, sharing that he himself has not used it for a month after his initial experience. He mentions the dramatic effect of the first encounter and his ongoing endeavour to comprehend what he saw.
</li><li><b>Concluding Thoughts</b>: Leo suggests that breaking through to the profundity of the experience of absolute infinity could take several decades of daily practice. He distinguishes it from experiences of 'no self' or samadhi, indicating it is significantly more profound. He also teases his next episode, promising to disclose the name of the substance for viewers to potentially experience similar awakening, while emphasising essential safety precautions needed before its use.
