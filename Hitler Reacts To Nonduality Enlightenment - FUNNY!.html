Nonduality means that reality is an illusion. There are no
boundaries. All distinctions collapse into unity. There is no self,
no other, no world, no purpose … Reality is an
Infinite Void. God is Nothingness. Hitler: According to science those
are all just New Age ideas happening in the brain.
My Leader… The brain… The brain is just a concept.
Science takes place within the illusion. Hitler: Removes glasses and
orders everyone out Hitler: If you haven’t grasped this truth
directly, leave now. Hitler: (Yelling) What Buddhist BULLSHIT! How can
the physical world not exist? What about the last 2000
years of Western intellectual tradition? Descartes must be rolling in
his grave. Rationalism my ass! No wonder the mind-body problem
refused to go away! But HOW can all this be
an illusion when it feels so REAL? My Leader, real
vs unreal is a duality… Hitler: I KNOW! But it’s
WARPING my mind!!! My Leader, you don’t exist. Hitler: Then
how the FUC am I experiencing all of this? It’s
too twisted! Why do I craft all these machinations if
the universe is running itself? Why fight anyone if this
is just a dream? Why demonize anyone when everyone is
identical to myself? This makes our entire way of being
a delusion of epic proportions!!! I just wanted it to
be real! Why struggle so hard when this ‘world’ is
infinitely PERFECT! All our problems were conceptual. But without imaginary
problems, what is left? The sweetness of struggle is gone.
Such a mind fuck! My entire worldview was just a
mental circle jerk! Why did I waste so much time
defending my beliefs? I could have spent more time admiring
those beautiful birds outside my compound. So many beautiful birds!
Woman crying: Don’t worry … No self, no problem. Hitler:
So this is the Gateless Gate. How can you argue
with Infinite Nothingness? Checkmate. This, cannot be unseen. I want
to spend more time hand-feeding those squirrels in my garden.
And satsangs on Thursdays. The circle is complete.
