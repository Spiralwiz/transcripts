[Music] how to be decisive or alternatively we could call
this how to stop being indecisive creating the good life
requires a long series of clear high quality decisions so
indecision in is one of your greatest dangers and enemies
in this work the quality of your decisions will determine
the quality of your life your decisions will make or
break you many people waste and ruin their lives simply
through indecision and stalling out and the bottom line is
that you cannot afford indecisiveness if you are going to
be self-actualizing that's not a luxury you have here are
some examples of decisions within personal development that you'll commonly
run across in this work for example should you work
on your life purpose first or on your dating should
you work on your career first or get into spirituality
how long should you delay getting into spirituality how good
should your finances be before you feel comfortable taking meditation
retreats should you get more education or should you jump
straight into working what are the pros and cons of
doing that how hard should you work how much time
should you allocate between work family life and relaxation or
enjoying yourself enjoying life should you change careers if you
find yourself in a career that doesn't suit you should
you leave a relationship should you take psychedelics now or
should you wait till you're more mature until you're older
and maybe till you're done with setting up your business
or your career how should you store or invest your
savings that you're making from your business and your career
should you sleep with this person who you know isn't
right for you which business idea should you start with
which passion should you follow if you have like two
things in life that you're passionate about let's say you're
passionate about music and you're passionate about filmmaking which one
or should you do both of them at the same
time which meditation technique should you commit to or should
you use multiple techniques should you get married should you
have children and win and to whom of course very
critical question critical decision should you distance yourself from your
family if they're not the healthiest people and they're not
into personal development or their values online with your values
should you take three months off of work to meditate
where should you live where should you settle down this
is just a brief list of the kinds of decisions
that you'll have to be making throughout your life to
create the good life of course there's these are sort
of like very basic decisions uh your decisions can become
much more specifically tailored to whatever life purpose you're following
and whatever specific objectives you have in your life and
your spiritual work and your relationships in your dating life
in your business career and so forth here's the trick
though is that many decisions you make are made by
default through inaction and stalling or not deciding for example
you might find yourself in a job that you don't
like that doesn't align with your values and that you're
not passionate about that you don't find meaningful and you
could make a decision to say i'm not going to
put up with that and i'm going to do the
work to transition into a different career into a better
job in starting my own business or whatever that might
be but what most people will do because making that
decision is difficult and scary and uncomfortable what they'll do
is they'll just stall they'll just wait it's like well
you know i can still i can tolerate this it's
not my job isn't isn't so bad i mean it's
not like slave labor it's all right you know my
boss is pretty nice and i get decent salary and
it's all right and then you just kind of stall
for a year and another year and another year and
before you know it a whole decade goes by and
you're just stalling and uh and really what you're being
here is you're being indecisive by default your life is
going to go down a certain trajectory like a freight
train on rails this default trajectory is what will happen
when you don't make bold clear decisions it's when you
just kind of settle for the path of least resistance
you don't think creatively outside the box you don't push
yourself you don't have any ambitions and you just kind
of like go through the motions of life but this
is not going to create a great life to create
a great life you must take some bold decisions and
switch tracks of this freight train your life has a
lot of momentum behind it this momentum has been set
by the first 20 years of your upbringing your culture
your family situation whatever career or job you happen to
fall into however you're surviving all your survival patterns those
are established in the first 20 years of your life
those are cemented into your brain and your mind and
your psyche and then but what what gets cemented there
is not something great or extraordinary or anything even close
to your full potential as a human being this is
just kind of like default basic stuff right like when
you're born society programs you with a very basic operating
system that just allows you to survive socially culturally economically
a little bit usually and that's about it that's like
all you get you don't get something amazing you get
something mediocre and just kind of like passable maybe comfortable
if you're lucky so to create the great life you're
going to have to make a series of bold decisions
a series of track changes to this freight train these
bold decisions will be scary and uncomfortable you will tend
to stall on them justifying to yourself that what you've
already got is good enough you know after all why
why risk it but what you have to remind yourself
is that the default not making these bold decisions will
never lead you to your highest potential actualizing your highest
potential requires pushing your comfort zone without bold decisions you
will tend to just get stuck in a rut of
complacency and what's called the derp state owen cook from
rsd calls it the derp state i like that particular
framing you're just uh sleepwalking through life is another way
to state it i've talked about that in the past
sleep walking through life wasting years of your life just
kind of going through the motions treading water and missing
out on massive new growth opportunities and experiences these bold
decisions expose you to new experiences to new challenges which
force your body and mind to adapt and to grow
here are some of the biggest decisions i've made in
my life just to give you an idea of what
i mean by these bold decisions early on in my
life i chose the passionate life to work hard in
my life to be ambitious that's the decision i made
when i was young i knew i didn't want a
mediocre life and that was one of the most important
decisions i've ever made what that meant for me in
my life is that i worked extra hard i've had
to work more more than most people work but that's
compensated by all the fruits that i got from that
over time by investing through hard work since my teenage
years you know doing it for a couple of decades
that snowballed into something that now is a pretty amazing
and rare kind of life that most people don't don't
have and couldn't really even dream of getting another big
decision i made is focusing seriously on my education when
i was young i didn't waste my time socializing and
doing stupid [ __ ] going to parties drinking and
smoking weed and whatever else like i really focused on
academics this built a very good foundation for me that
has served me well all the way until today i'm
coasting on that hard work that i did with my
academic pursuits and that was a conscious decision i made
because what happened was that up until about ninth grade
i was kind of going through the motions of school
i wasn't that serious about school i mean i got
decent grades and so forth but like i wasn't really
serious about like education i was just kind of doing
what everybody was doing and uh and that was that
and then in ninth grade there was a shift where
i realized like why am i sitting around in these
classes with these fools around me who are not taking
their education seriously um and then it kind of dawned
on me like i gotta get serious about education and
so like i upgraded the classes that i enrolled in
into like a bunch of very challenging ap classes honors
classes um science and math and all this history and
all this sorts of stuff and like i really challenged
myself academically and also i started learning philosophy on my
own i started reading books on my own um thinking
about deep existential topics on my own uh and really
educating myself basically and uh that was like that was
a very deliberate decision and if i didn't make that
decision back then man like my life would be so
much worse today than it is i'm so glad i
made that decision another decision i made is to focus
on my life purpose early on in my life versus
socializing so i deliberately made a decision to not socialize
to not have a bunch of friends to not have
girlfriends to delay having sex all these things i deliberately
put all that off because i knew that i wanted
to focus on my life purpose for the first five
to ten years of my young adult life and that
served me very well because i was able to get
my career on track i was able to get my
first business going i was able to make myself financially
independent the way i wanted to i was able to
gain my creative autonomy as a creator that was so
much more important to me than having sex or having
fun with friends or having a bunch of friends now
that was a trade-off i sacrificed for that and in
certain ways i would even regret doing that but also
on the other hand i don't regret it because of
what i gained right you there's stuff you gain and
stuff you lose so this is the challenge of making
these decisions is that a decision is not always all
upside there's usually trade-offs and there's usually downsides to choices
you make but you have to find those choices that
align with your deepest values even though there's certain trade-offs
we'll we'll get to that in a moment let me
give you some more examples of other decisions that i
made another bold decision i made is when i entered
university i was planning to become an aerospace engineer so
i went into aerospace engineering as my major i finished
two years of the foundations of sort of engineering training
a lot of science a lot of physics a lot
of math and and then two years into it i
decided that this is not like i i looked into
the future i saw that being an engineer was not
appropriate to me it didn't fit my values um and
that i i needed to cut my losses even though
i invested so much time into it already i needed
to cut my losses and transition into a different life
purpose and a different career and so i did that
and that was also a very deliberate decision i can
still remember to this day the very day where i
made up that decision that i told my family about
it and um we talked we discussed it then i
switched majors and uh into philosophy from engineering i went
into philosophy and then i went into game design so
that was so important because if i stayed with engineering
and if i became an engineer i would have been
so miserable so miserable that would have been completely the
wrong career for me and the wrong major so that
was a good decision another bold decision i made is
to about the same time as i switched to engineer
from engineering to philosophy i was like 21 years old
i made the decision to really get my weight under
control i was overweight for most of my life up
until that point and then i became very serious about
working out i became serious about controlling what i put
in my body what i eat i didn't immediately shift
to a very clean diet i still ate a bunch
of junk food and stuff like that but um but
it was i made a significant very very dramatic change
within five months i lost 65 pounds got to my
current weight that i'm basically at right now and um
and i've kept that off ever since and and that
really became my my journey towards cleaning up my diet
significantly then over the next 10 years i cleaned up
my diet so significantly again i don't know where i
would be i might even be dead at this point
if i kept eating the kind of food i was
eating back then and treating my diet and my health
so recklessly the way that i was back then so
that was a great decision also that had a huge
impact on my on my dating life a huge impact
on my self-esteem and confidence my self-image a lot of
those issues were resolved through that change the next big
bold decision i made was i went to game design
i became a professional game designer for for a few
years and then as i was doing that i had
another sort of epiphany where i realized that working for
anybody having a boss of any kind was completely unsuitable
to what i wanted out of my life it contradicts
my deepest values my creative autonomy and ambitions and so
i knew at that point that i had to figure
out how to be my own boss so i made
a very bold decision to quit my game design job
i was working in a great studio one of the
best in the world on you know a triple a
project and i i i quit in the middle of
that which was very difficult to do because i spent
i spent years developing my skills as a game designer
and landing that position was very challenging i just broke
into the game industry design industry as a designer entry-level
designer that's that's very difficult to do at the studio
that i did it at like uh almost unheard of
and then i i said no to that and i
can still remember to this very day the very day
that i decided to quit in my own mind and
and just how significant that that changed the whole trajectory
of my life and it it put me into a
situation where i had to fend for myself i couldn't
rely on a paycheck from anybody i wasn't getting a
salary from anybody like i had to make my own
way in the world financially and that began my journey
of learning about business about marketing about sales that was
a challenge like that really pushed me that was especially
difficult for me because i wasn't like i i despised
marketing sales and business what i'm truly like i'm very
creative at heart right to me what's most important is
the creativity i don't care about the money i don't
care about the business all that [ __ ] i
don't care about that only to the extent that i
need it in order to be creative so in that
sense i had to care about it but uh anyways
i had to go and like teach myself all that
very quickly to become financially independent and then to to
fund my own creative efforts in the future that was
so crucial to where i am today and my ability
to start actualize.org and all that kind of stuff so
starting my first business was a huge bold decision uh
the next one is after i succeeded in that i
did internet marketing for a while built websites and did
web development type stuff i did that for like three
or four years became fairly successful at that started earning
six figures from that and became financially well-off learned about
business learning about marketing all that kind of stuff and
then i realized that this internet marketing stuff like it's
um it's really the work of the devil i have
to get out of this industry even though it earns
good money it's uh it's leading me down the wrong
path and it's conflicting with my deepest values and so
i again i made a very clear decision that i'm
going to move out of that and then i was
looking for that what that next thing was going to
be and eventually that led me to starting actualize.org and
that was also one of the best decisions that i've
made in my life because if i stayed in internet
marketing uh i would have compromised my own values so
much and i would have become depressed and miserable and
i would have lost my passion and then i wouldn't
have really been able to do the kind of work
that i'm doing today the next big decision i made
is moving to las vegas at that point i was
living in dallas texas and i wanted to work on
my dating skills i couldn't really do that to the
degree that i wanted to in dallas so i moved
to las vegas that was a difficult decision i remember
i had a life coach at that point that i
was working with who was helping me and i remember
like i was so stressed out over that decision i
didn't know should i move what if i move and
it's gonna i'm gonna hate it what if it's the
wrong decision blah blah all this kind of stuff we
talked about it for days and then eventually i just
said you know what um if i don't move i'm
just gonna stay here and i've already been here for
like five years living in dallas so like it's just
going to be the same old thing again it's like
i'm going to stagnate or i can move to this
new city new possibilities new adventures new experiences new friends
new people living off on my own away from family
from everybody and i saw the potential for growth there
and i just said you know what even if it's
going to be a decision that i'm regret i'm still
going to do it because it's going to grow me
so much so i chose the growth decision and that
worked out well for me the next big decision i
made is after i launched actualize.org and i was having
early success over the first few years with doing sort
of self-help videos and getting traction with that then i
had to make a decision of like do i focus
on the marketing and sales aspects of my business or
do i focus on creating deeper content to create deeper
content meant that i have to spend a lot more
time researching developing myself studying and really going into like
you know depth of unders like deepening my own understanding
of these psychological and spiritual topics that i talk about
i could go that direction but then i won't have
time to do all the marketing and salesy stuff or
i could do all the marketing salesy stuff and then
the videos are going to be kind of shallow and
just kind of like you know mainstream self-help type stuff
because i won't have enough depth from which to speak
and teach and the videos will also be much shorter
and they're not gonna they're not gonna contain as much
depth to them so i made a decision to focus
to forget the marketing stuff and salesy stuff and to
focus on the depth of the videos and i did
that for like three or four years and basically i'm
still sticking with that decision to this day now in
a certain sense like that was difficult decision because i
literally gave up millions of dollars i could be making
millions of dollars more i could be millions richer right
now if i if i went with the marketing and
sales decision but to me what what that doesn't align
with my values my values require me to go for
depth and profundity of understanding that's one of my top
values is understanding and depth so i'm very glad i
made that decision i didn't kind of sell out or
just make shallow content and really focused like on my
craft and my depth of understanding myself and reality and
consciousness and all that spirituality um so even though i
lost a lot of views and i lost a lot
of potential subscribers and a lot of you know money
and you know success and fame all that was lost
i mean also i had to make the decision to
give up a lot of sex because see like at
that point i was living in las vegas i could
be going out i could have been going out like
every day every night every weekend to clubs you know
hooking up with girls i could have been doing that
i could have had sex with hundreds of girls over
like five or six years that i was you know
really going to depth on on deepening my content i
could have been doing that in addition to doing all
the salesy marketing stuff i gave all that up for
the depth of the videos right that was also a
conscious decision um which sometimes i regret honestly but on
the other hand you know i um i would never
give up the depth of what i know now and
the levels of conscious that i've accessed for any amount
of sex um but uh but that that was a
difficult decision as well the next big decision i made
is buying my house um i'm very frugal and conservative
with my money and so that was the biggest item
that i've ever purchased in my life um and that
turned out to be a great decision too and then
one other decision that i made bold decision is i
decided some i don't remember exactly where this happened in
my life but i decided somewhere in my life probably
pretty early that i want to be a prolific creator
i want to like just be creative all the time
put out a ton like i want my body of
work to be massive i made a clear decision about
that that's what i wanted and that i wanted to
be a massive value provider i want to just shower
people with value that was also a very deliberate decision
that i've stuck to so these are just some examples
of bold big challenging decisions that i've made this is
not to brag or anything this is just to show
you like how it actually works so i'm not saying
you have to make these decisions yourself i'm just giving
you an example um and then the question is going
to be like what are going to be these big
bold decisions for you they might end up looking very
different than my decisions but this gives you an idea
and really my whole life where i am today has
been defined and shaped by these what this was like
10 about 10 to 12 major decisions that i made
in my life now of course i've made a lot
of minor decisions but these like 10 or 12 really
high quality decisions have made my whole life like it's
actually quite amazing when i think about it like that
i haven't thought about it like that until i started
thinking about talking about this topic here with you um
so i want you to start to think like you
know these major bold decisions you don't need hundreds of
them to transform your life a good dozen if they're
the right decisions at the right time aligning with your
values and their big significant decisions that expose you to
a lot of experience and really push you beyond your
comfort zone this will make or break your life there's
other decisions that i'm still you know contemplating for the
future like you know i've thought about quitting actualize.org organ
going to meditate for just like six months straight not
even talk to a single human for six months just
like go balls to the wall with my spiritual i
haven't made that decision yet but that would be a
bold one i could make in the future another decision
i've been thinking about is like renting an rv or
buying an rv actually rather than renting it buying an
rv and then traveling around the country like literally every
city in the u.s visit all of it see all
of it interact with people meet people that would be
like a very different lifestyle than the one i've been
leading for the last 10 years um another bold decision
might be moving to a different country and experiencing that
experiencing what it's like to live in a third world
country for example that would be a huge growth opportunity
potentially another one is starting or joining a spiritual community
maybe for you that might mean joining one for me
that might mean starting one i don't know i'm still
toying with that that's a very dangerous idea starting or
joining a spiritual community those can be notoriously bad so
i've held off on that but lately i've been thinking
about like you know how do i take my work
and my stuff to the next level how do i
challenge myself and the way that i would challenge myself
is of course i still got like inner spiritual work
to do on myself uh but really the challenge for
me would come next like a lot of growth would
come for me if if i was pushed to lead
an actual spiritual community in a conscious way that that
would really you know test all the theory and all
the stuff that i've been learning kind of independently and
kind of just embodying on my own trying to embody
it in a community setting that's a whole next level
so just some ideas bold decisions will thrust you into
new situations and expose you to massive experience and they
will force you to become stronger basically you're not going
to grow very much in your life unless something is
pushing you to grow something has to be forcing you
now that could be some external pressure like you know
someone in your family dies and now you have to
work extra hard to pay the bills it could be
something like that but really that's not ideal what's ideal
is for your own ambition to push you for your
own ambition to have you make bold decisions that put
you into challenging situations that then force you to become
tougher and to grow and if you don't do that
if all you're doing is just sitting at home and
reading books and watching spiritual videos that's not going to
be enough to actualize your full potential you need some
kind of medium that's going to push you forward that
you're working in you need some kind of challenge um
some sort of sort of like larger objective remember we
talked about the hero's journey i have an episode called
the highest hero's journey we also talked about the hero's
journey a lot in my life purpose course if you've
checked that out so if you remember with the hero's
journey the hero's journey begins with a bold decision the
hero has to accept the call to adventure he has
to accept the journey and usually the hero in a
good proper hero's journey story refuses the call multiple times
until he's forced into it forced into accepting the call
so i want you to think about where in your
life have you been stalling and refusing the call of
your hero's journey because he it seems as though like
well yeah the hero's journey sounds so exciting and adventurous
why would the hero refuse the call but see that's
kind of a cartoon version of the hero's journey the
reality of the hero's journey is that to accept the
call this is usually you're accepting something uncomfortable scary difficult
and your mind doesn't want to accept that because your
mind is lazy and it's comfortable where it is so
what i'd like you to do is to contemplate the
following question what is the default trajectory of your life
right now if you don't make any more bold decisions
going forward if all you do is you just keep
doing and following the trajectory or track that you're on
what is that where's that track gonna lead you contemplate
that and ask yourself is that going to be the
actualization of your highest potential is that going to be
something that you're truly satisfied with and then contemplate the
next question what are some bold decisions you could make
to shift this default trajectory into something higher i want
you to become very mindful of how you stall out
your life by being indecisive now when you're making decisions
what's really going on is that each decision you make
is based on honoring certain values every decision is saying
yes to one value and no to some other value
now the problem is that most people are making decisions
unconsciously you need to start making conscious decisions you've got
to be become very conscious of what values your decisions
are honoring because usually when you make a decision it's
not explicit in your mind that oh this decision here
like my decision to go to a party is honoring
the value of blank whatever that is usually it's like
usually or like my decision to order a pizza and
sit on the couch and veg out for 10 hours
watching netflix reruns of some show and and eating a
whole pizza that's honoring a certain value and that's disordering
some other value and then the quality of your life
is really just a direct reflection of the decisions you
make and whether they're honoring your top let's say 10
values and as long as you're making decisions that are
dishonoring your top 10 values then you're going to have
a miserable life and you're going to hate yourself and
you're going to hate your life and eventually it's going
to lead you to depression and even suicidal thoughts so
the idea here is very simple make decisions that align
with the principles of self-actualization what we call the good
life truth love consciousness and self selflessness this and also
with health this would be the recipe for creating the
good life now why is making decisions so important is
because you need to focus your energy as much as
possible at one point this is a core principle of
strategic thinking it's called the concentration of force or focus
remember i have an old episode called how to be
a strategic [ __ ] very aptly named uh it's
all about strategic thinking there i outlined the principles of
strategic thinking it's a very important episode go watch that
um and one of the first principles of strategic thinking
is the concentration of force it's also about how you're
allocating your finite resources see creating greatness requires focus and
you have finite resources at your disposal your resources are
basically time energy money and your health these are your
resources how are you going to allocate them what are
you gonna transmute those resources into if anything at all
how are you gonna invest them what are you gonna
get for them for your time your money your energy
your health what are you gonna get in return over
the next 10 or 20 years now i've talked about
this topic of investing in the past and i have
a few more episodes i want to shoot about that
because it's such an important topic because people are generally
such poor investors in their own lives so making good
decisions is really about making good investments and what are
the best investments you can make in your life it's
honoring your top values which of course means you have
to know what your top values are which is something
that i go into a lot of depth on in
the life purpose course so check that out if you're
unclear about what these values are and how to find
them the course takes you through a step-by-step process for
how to find your top values so i have a
previous episode called why valuable things require development over time
that's an episode about investing uh go watch that and
connect it with this episode because really your decisions are
decisions to invest your finite resources into the things that
should matter most to you in your life the things
you find most meaningful the things that are most aligned
with the things you love in your life and since
you have finite time you have to understand that there's
a there's a thing concept called here opportunity cost whatever
you're doing in your life you know if you're going
to a party if you're getting a girlfriend if you're
getting married if you're starting this business rather than that
business if you're doing meditation versus yoga versus psychedelics versus
something else all those things present opportunity costs because when
you're doing one of those things you're not doing something
else that you could be doing when you're meditating for
an hour every day that's one hour a day you're
losing are you investing it well are you meditating well
or are you going to spend the next 10 years
meditating in a half-assed manner half asleep not really gaining
any spiritual benefit from that but you're going to invest
you know 365 hours a year times 10 years that's
three and a half thousand hours we'll get get invested
in this meditation practice what else could you have done
with three and a half thousand hours that's a lot
it's a lot of hours see um likewise with everything
else you're doing in your life so you have to
do a sort of an audit or an inventory of
your life how you're investing your time and are you
making good decisions and good investments and is there something
better you could be doing with that time how else
could you be investing it notice that high paying jobs
require being good at making important decisions quickly sometimes people
say like you know under the capitalist system these ceos
and corporate bigwigs they they make so much more money
than their you know low-level employees and in a certain
sense it's it's obscene how much the differential in salary
and income is between you know the top executives versus
the grunt level workers it is obscene it is gross
and it is unfair and unconscious but what is being
missed there by a lot of socialist type and progressive
type of people is that actually you know one of
the most valuable things in life is not hard manual
labor it's actually the quality of the decisions you're making
so some of these ceos and corporate bigwigs actually they're
able to generate genuine value a lot of genuine value
by being really good strategic thinkers big picture thinkers visionaries
and being able to make very important decisions quickly on
these decisions can hinge thousands of lives billions of dollars
and many other important things and the reality is is
that most people would not be able to fit in
these jobs and to execute these jobs because they're just
so bad at making decisions they would screw it up
and they would run these companies into the ground so
it's not simply that the the ceo or something is
in this privileged capitalist position it is also that he
or she has developed the skills necessary to make important
decisions sometimes they make bad decisions and nobody is going
to be making important decisions perfectly all the time of
course many of these ceos make bad decisions but overall
um you know if you give the average person this
position they're going to screw it up royally so being
able to make high quality decisions requires quite a lot
of development ignorant people fools cannot make high quality decisions
making good decisions requires wisdom vision experience discipline integrity holism
big picture thinking education a sense of history a lack
of bias a clear undistorted perception of reality the more
twisted your mind is the more ungrounded your mind is
the more you're lost in fantasy and ideology the more
close-minded you are the worse you're going to be at
seeing reality accurately and then you won't be able to
make high quality decisions so here's an exercise i'd like
you to do at home ask yourself this question what
are the best decisions you've made in your life make
a list then make a second list what are the
worst decisions you've made in your life and after you
get both these lists i want you to compare them
and ask yourself what made the best decisions so good
and what made the worst decisions so bad that's a
homework assignment for you okay moving on so i've also
talked about the concept of integrity see my episode what
is integrity integrity requires being decisive why is that well
because integrity is pretty rare most people do not have
very high integrity and so if you have some kind
of vision for a great life for having a great
impact on the world for your life purpose for being
creative artistic whatever and then you go about trying to
execute on that vision you're going to need integrity to
execute on that vision and everybody around you your friends
your family your co-workers and just random people who are
observing you they're all going to start criticizing you nitpicking
what you're doing creating doubt in your mind and infecting
you with their own lack of integrity you are going
to have to stand up for your top values in
the face of an of an unconscious world and an
unconscious society remember we are living right now in the
dark ages the dark ages did not end a thousand
years ago we're still in the dark ages and if
you want to bring some light into the world you're
gonna have to contend with the darkness that's gonna try
to snuff out the light most people live like animals
along a path of least resistance most people are not
decisive they're not clear they're not living according to their
values they are not ambitious they are not seeking to
bring light into the world they are not making decisions
for themselves they are letting society and culture decide for
them by programming their mind with memes and ideology and
most people have very little integrity because all they're doing
is they're just struggling to survive they're just doing the
thing that will allow them to survive to the next
day and throughout the next week they're not thinking very
far they're not interested in developing themselves they're not interested
in health and holism not individually but also not collectively
they're not properly educated they're not very conscious they're not
doing spiritual practices they're not eating healthy none of these
things they're just chasing their base instincts cravings and desires
and avoiding their deepest fears that's what's controlling most people
they're like puppets on strings and even the ones that
think that they're above it they're still puppets on strings
the ones that think that they're contrarians that are challenging
mainstream society those people are especially puppets on strings they're
doing all that unconsciously with very little integrity so if
you want to be a high integrity person a high
consciousness person you're gonna have to hold yourself to a
much higher standard because society other people they will not
hold you to a high enough standard because their own
standards are so low you're going to have to set
the standard for yourself and for everybody else around you
this is what it means to be a conscious leader
and to set this standard and to live by this
standard to meet this high standard of your own you're
going to have to make some bold decisions and you
have to stick with them in the face of all
the darkness that surrounds you all the ignorance and unconsciousness
that surrounds you all the group think and the mass
paranoia and hysteria the culture wars and all the distractions
all the petty human [ __ ] that's around you
this is all going to be trying to distract you
and tempt you to break your integrity and you have
to make a decision you know one of the most
important decisions you can make in your life is whether
you want to be a high integrity person or not
being decisive gives you a sense of direction and clarity
of mind and peace of mind it's very relieving to
know what you're doing in your life what your ultimate
mission is the big picture because then that informs what
you're doing on a micro level once you've got the
macro level figured out you can easily figure out what
you got to do at the micro level every single
day and when this is all aligned with your top
values it's it's very fulfilling it's very rewarding and it
gives you a certain groundedness and stability in the face
of chaos and distraction and hysteria that's all around you
you know you got a purpose you got a mission
you're on it your mind is clear you know what
your values are you know what the right decisions are
you know you're going to be a high integrity person
this gives you enormous peace of mind to know that
you don't need to compromise on these things and that
you know where you're going that's one of the benefits
of being decisive when you're indecisive you're wishy-washy you're like
a leaf blowing in the wind you know anybody can
pull you in one direction or the next every every
little you know bump in the road every little hysteria
in the news cycle it's got you all riled up
and you're running around you know you're ungrounded you're very
easily influenced and misled you cannot create a good life
without being clear about what you want first of all
you have to be clear that you want to create
the good life most people don't know what they want
they're very unclear and in fact clarity itself should be
a core value of yours i'm going to have a
whole episode in the future just about the value of
clarity because it's one of those values that usually people
don't think about when they're thinking about their values but
clarity is a very powerful potential value because clarity is
what allows you to be decisive you can't be decisive
unless you know what you really want out of life
once you figure that out being decisive is rather easy
so i recommend that you make a sort of principal
decision to never be squishy unclear mumbly and wishy-washy not
in your language or your communication not in the decisions
that you're making in your life not in the projects
that you're undertaking not in the people you're choosing into
your to allow into your life or or not like
be clear about all those things set that as a
goal for yourself is that kind of inner clarity and
then once you have that clarity that's what's required to
also become a conscious leader because most people are unclear
so what they need is they need somebody to follow
who is clear and i'll have an episode about conscious
leadership in the future coming soon as well have you
ever even sat down in your life and made a
decision about who you want to be like what kind
of character do you want to be when people look
at you or they talk about you behind your back
what do you want them to say about you what
do you want them to perceive your highest values to
be and then what kind of actions would you have
to take how would you have to carry yourself so
that people felt your values without you even having to
explicitly tell them what your values are they just know
what your values are because of the way that you
carry yourself and the way that you embody them in
your life so think about that sit down and spend
a couple hours just thinking about what kind of character
do i want to be how do i want others
to perceive me do i want others to perceive me
as somebody whose top value is money or sex or
laziness or depression or judgment and hatred or dogmatism and
closed-mindedness or lack of health think about that decide what
you want in your life and decide what you definitely
don't want in your life for example decide that you
don't want hard drugs in your life decide that you
don't want to be a cheater decide that you don't
want to be a thief decide that you don't want
to be taking shortcuts decide that you don't want to
be eating junk food decide that you don't want to
be chasing get rich quick schemes decide that you don't
want to be a leech on society and a value
leech upon the world decide that you don't want to
be a net drag on the environment for example these
are all decisions you could make now i'm not telling
you what to decide you can decide whatever you want
these are just examples of things you could decide that
you definitely don't want and then you can cut those
out of your life permanently also what's what's nice about
being decisive is that when you're indecisive this actually wastes
a lot of mental energy because you're kind of like
in the in this gray area where you're not sure
like maybe you're in a relationship but you haven't decided
clearly that you don't want to be a cheater therefore
you're tempted to cheat and maybe sometimes you do cheat
sometimes you don't cheat and so this whole like tug
of war in your mind of like should i cheat
shouldn't i cheat should i cover up my cheating what
should i say how should i lie about it and
then like you're you're doing all this and even if
you're not cheating let's say you hold off and you
don't cheat but just the fact that you're thinking through
all this stuff and that you're even allowing the possibility
of cheating to be part of your reality this is
already wasting a lot of your mental energy that you
could and should be using towards much higher things similar
like with eating junk food for example when you haven't
made a clear decision to cut out all junk food
in your life your life is actually much harder because
everywhere you go you're tempted by junk food you know
you go to the airport you're driving down the street
you see some some billboard for some new burger or
whatever or some new ice cream flavor um or a
new bag of chips that they're selling at you know
at the gas station or something and you just instinctively
reach for it you get a craving for it because
you haven't made the decision to be a model of
health of healthy eating in your own life you see
and so you're wrestling with this and then sometimes you're
able to resist the junk food other times you pig
out on it you eat a little bit or eat
too much then you feel bad about that you feel
guilty then you gain some weight you get on the
scale you look at your weight now you're not happy
then you have to go on a sort of a
diet and so you're kind of yo-yoing back and forth
and once you lose the weight then you feel like
you can allow yourself a little bit of a cheat
day here and then you go and you pig out
again and the whole cycle begins all over again and
you're wasting so much mental energy on this that you
really should be channeling towards your spirituality your self-actualization work
towards your meditation practices towards your you know explorations with
psychedelics towards your business towards your family towards your spouse
kids and so forth so indecision wastes a lot of
energy it's not efficient to be indecisive what are the
biggest causes of indecisiveness first and foremost it's a lack
of clarity a lack of self-knowing and self-understanding you see
when you're born into this life you don't know anything
about yourself it's very funny very kind of paradoxical because
you are yourself but you don't really know your own
personality i'm not even talking about that you don't know
like your god self forget that uh you don't even
know your personality you don't even know it takes it
takes decades for you to discover your own personality it
takes decades for you to discover that you're an introvert
or an extrovert or an ambivert or that you're um
[Music] you're a thinker or you're a feeler or that
you're highly intuitive or that you're very intelligent or that
you're very you know gifted athletically or that you have
a certain strength or a certain talent with people you're
like you're a great communicator you're a good leader or
maybe you're a good lover or maybe you excel at
um you know working with with technical data and numbers
you know whatever it is it takes you a long
time to discover that it takes you a long time
to discover what you want in your life and what
you don't want in your life like do you want
to have a boss do you want to be your
own boss what do you what do you want there
um do you want to be a highly social person
or or not um are you the kind of person
that's like a family person or not are you a
very materialistic person or not does does material stuff satisfy
you or not are you very intellectual person do you
need a lot of like books and learning and information
in your life to feel happy or are you more
of an artistic person or are you more of a
salesy businessy type of person it takes a long time
to discover all this and figure this all out for
yourself especially because a lot of times we're traumatized when
we're young and then so that trauma obscures because the
trauma requires us to then come up with coping and
defense mechanisms and then we confuse those coping and defense
mechanisms for our own authentic personality and then we can
have these defense mechanisms we can identify with them and
we can think that those are really who i am
but they're not those are just like those are just
armor armoring that you've created to prevent yourself from being
further hurt in your in your life and to reduce
your suffering and pain but that's not the same thing
as being you know authentic and really understanding who you
are underneath all that armor for example maybe you were
bullied in school and so now because you were humiliated
and bullied in school you might think that you're not
really a social person but that's not really because you
don't authentically enjoy being social you actually do it's just
that you've been so bullied and you have wounds around
that and trauma that until you heal all that and
remove all that armor then you're not a you're not
going to able to be able to really connect with
that authentic part of you that wants to socialize and
connect with with other people right and so now you're
socially crippled and you might even think that all i've
just thought i'm a very shy introverted almost autistic-like person
but it's not that you're really autistic it's actually that
you're you're inexperienced because you got that early trauma and
you're just socially inexperienced and that's something that you can
work out but it might take you years to work
through that trauma so clarity is gained by really observing
and studying yourself and understanding yourself at deep ever deeper
levels so that's the first cause of indecisiveness the next
huge cause of indecisiveness is fear you fear making the
wrong decision the next big cause of indecisiveness is just
being lazy and hoping and thinking that things will automatically
work themselves out it's sort of the passive approach rather
than the proactive approach to life siding with passivity versus
proactivity this is almost always the wrong move the next
big cause of indecisiveness is a lack of responsibility you're
not actually taking responsibility for making important decisions in your
life you want somebody else to make it for you
the next big cause of indecisiveness is placing too much
importance on the decision it's ironic and paradoxical that a
lot of these important and bold decisions even though they
are important and bold and they will shape the whole
trajectory of your life if you placed too much emphasis
on their importance then actually that's going to make you
indecisive because you're going to be like oh my god
this decision is going to change my whole life i
have to get it perfect and that perfectionism is actually
going to get in the way of you making the
decision again this actually is very connected to fear because
really in this instance what you're doing is you're you're
scared of making the wrong decision so it's important in
your own mind to reframe decision making to take the
fear out of it and here's how you can do
that first by realizing that most of your decisions can
be remade if you make the wrong decision usually you
have enough time in your life to go back and
change it and redo it and oftentimes making the wrong
decision actually gives you the information that you lacked and
the clarity that you lacked and it helps you to
figure out your own deepest authentic desires and self for
example when i got my first job as a game
designer at that point i didn't know how deeply i
needed to be my own boss it wasn't until i
had a boss for a year that i realized the
problem that i have at my core with having a
boss it wasn't that you know i didn't like having
somebody tell me like what to do and being somebody
subordinate that wasn't my problem my problem was that i
was deeply creatively artistically ambitious and i needed to get
those ideas out right i had like a visionary core
to me that needed to be expressed and i was
not able to express that when i had a boss
and my job was helping him to express his artistic
core right this that that doesn't work for me somebody
else can fill that role but i can't feel that
rope fill that role and i didn't know that nobody
told me this when i was young school didn't teach
me this my parents didn't teach me i had to
figure this out through trial and error so i made
a decision to get this job but then i realized
that was the wrong decision the right decision for me
was to start my own business but i couldn't know
that until i made this wrong decision so don't be
afraid of making wrong decisions and failing as a result
because actually failure is okay i have an old old
episode that talks about how to reframe failure how to
really think deeply about failure go search for it um
very important one actually i should probably do a sort
of a a new updated version of it because there's
uh people really trap themselves with their fear of failure
and people really have a low tolerance for failure and
in this work to succeed at life and to actualize
your full potential you have to fail so much you're
not going to get through this without massive failure in
fact you have to embrace failure and look forward to
failure and actually find ways of failing faster get the
failure out of the way and one of the ways
you do that is you make decisions clear decisions rather
than stalling stalling stalling stalling because you're afraid to fail
another uh way to reframe fear of failure is to
remember that most of your decisions are not going to
kill you which means that you're going to be able
to get a second chance and a third chance and
a fourth chance and this is realistically how you're going
to solve most your problems in life you're not going
to solve them by making the one perfect decision right
off the bat and then succeeding it's going to be
like you're going to make the wrong decision you're going
to fail fail fail fail five 10 times and then
on just because of your persistence and your sheer dogginess
and and you know your your commitment to your life
purpose and self-actualization if you're persistent enough eventually like on
the 11th attempt you'll succeed and it's not by accident
you're going to succeed you're going to succeed because of
those first 10 failures because each of those 10 failures
are going to teach you important lessons that you're going
to use to fine tune and to calibrate your approach
until finally you get it right and you learn on
the 11th time and then you succeed and so really
you should look at the entire process as a process
of success it's not that success comes on the 11th
time it's that those first 10 those that was your
success happening it's just that success has a long like
a wind-up period another way to reframe fear of failure
is remember that making choices even the wrong choices will
expose you to massive experience and this is really good
this is what you're going to use to then learn
and grow yourself so just because you made a bad
decision doesn't mean that it wasn't good for you see
my episode called expose yourself to massive experience so the
general rule is this if you have a decision to
make and you're deciding between sort of the status quo
your current default trajectory which is not going to expose
you to any really new massive interesting experience that's going
to grow you significantly versus a decision that is going
to thrust you into a new situation and really going
to challenge you choose the one that's going to challenge
you this is almost always the best choice even if
it ends up being not your ultimate destination it's still
going to grow you and challenge you whereas if you
just stay in your comfort zone what's gonna come of
that you're just gonna you're gonna stagnate that's what's gonna
happen so i would say all else being equal always
err on the side of action proactivity and massive new
experience like let's say you can stay at your current
job that you've been working for the last 10 years
and just keep doing the same old thing over and
over again or you could take a risk and maybe
some new job was offered in some new country that
you've never been to before this would require you to
relocate to take the risk of living in a different
country maybe you won't like it maybe that job doesn't
even pay as much money maybe you're not going to
like that new job whatever but even if all that
is true even if it's the worst case scenario that
you don't like the country you don't like the job
and so forth just the fact that you go through
the process of moving there and going through maybe a
year of working there before you decide to quit that
that massive life experience you gain is going to be
so much more valuable than just doing the same old
thing you've been doing the last 10 years also most
in most cases when you have a decision and you're
not sure between which two to choose because it's so
close like should i become a filmmaker or a musician
i don't know i like both you can kind of
get stuck in that because you make it in your
mind you make it seem like you can only choose
one but realistically what you can have what you can
do in most times is you can do one for
a couple of years and then if it doesn't work
out you can switch and do that the other option
that you didn't choose you can then explore that option
so most of the time you can explore both sides
of the fork that's what i'm calling the fork you
can take the fork you can take both sides of
the fork now what that's going to require is that's
going to require working twice as hard see because the
fear you have is like well what if i work
out on being a musician for two years and then
i realized that all that time and energy and effort
was wasted because i don't really want to be a
musician doesn't align with me and then i have to
go to become a filmmaker i have to start from
scratch that's going to require another two years i'm going
to lose two years not really though because even that
experience you gained with the music those two years of
music and working on that you're going to be able
to translate a lot of that over a lot of
it's going to be applicable even to your your filmmaking
and you're going to learn a lot about yourself in
the process of making that music and you're going to
develop some core skills like you're going to develop discipline
work ethic you know a good morning routine waking up
on time this kind of stuff you're gonna you're gonna
learn you can learn those making music and then you
can switch to filmmaking and those will still apply within
filmmaking you see so um don't fret too much about
making close decisions you can often do both just not
at the same time right don't do both at the
same time don't try to become a musician and a
filmmaker at once what you can do what you should
do ideally is say okay let's say i'm 90 passionate
about being a a musician and i'm 85 passionate about
a filmmaker about being a filmmaker therefore i'm going to
go with musician i'm going to do that for a
few years see how that works out if it's not
working out then i'm going to go transition back into
filmmaker let's say and then i'm going to do that
and then if that doesn't work out then i'm going
to find some third thing this means you're going to
work a lot harder than most people but this will
actually be good for you because you're also going to
grow from that work don't be afraid of hard work
don't be afraid of working more than everybody else is
working around you it's going to pay off for you
eventually now you might say but leo what if i
make a disastrous decision shouldn't i be worried about that
that's possible of course there's no guarantees that you won't
make a disastrous decision however consider the following what if
your fear of making disastrous decisions actually leads you into
the disaster of not making any decisions at all stalling
out the clock in your life and then just ending
up with mediocrity why aren't you more afraid of that
possibility because that is the most likely possibility the most
likely possibility is not that you're making a disastrous decision
is that you're going to make no decision at all
and that will be the disaster of your life now
you might say well leo that's not going to be
a disaster that's just going to be kind of a
comfortable cushy normal life don't be so sure about that
because you see when you get stuck in a rut
of a comfortable cushy kind of life it's okay for
the first five ten years but then after ten years
you got so sick of it you start getting depressed
you stop going to work on time then you lose
your job you start backsliding you start drinking you start
doing drugs you start hanging around with the wrong people
you get depressed you go on medication to treat your
depression then you're addicted to that medication then you become
suicidal and you lose all your passion for life you
slowly slide down this slope of mediocrity this happens with
a lot of people this is very common so this
is something you should be genuinely concerned about don't be
paranoid about it but it should be always in the
back of your mind that if you're not going to
be decisive then this is likely what's going to happen
you're going to slide downward in your life into mediocrity
and especially you should be worried about this if you're
listening to my content right because you're going to see
me growing over the years you're going to see me
growing massively and talking about these cool things that i'm
discovering and sharing these new insights and spirituality and all
this and the business stuff that i do the creative
stuff that i do you're going to see me growing
massively but then you're not going to be doing it
and if you're not doing it along with me then
that's just going to make you feel even worse because
you know your full potential i'm if you're sticking with
me i'm i'm going to be highlighting to you the
highest potential that you got as a living being but
if you're not taking action towards that you're not living
in a principled integras manner you're just you know going
with the default trajectory with all your friends and family
listening to me is going to make you depressed it's
going to make you hate your life it's going to
make you hate god because you're gonna wonder like leo
why why isn't god giving me all these gifts that
you keep promising well because you are god and if
you're god then for god to give you the gifts
that god can give you you have to give them
to yourself you have to create them you get that
god has no hands other than your own your hands
are god's hands your mind is god's mind your goals
are god's goals your decisions are god's decisions if you
decide to sit at home for 10 years living off
of you know government subsidies or your parents money living
in their basement playing video games and eating junk food
that's you as god deciding that that's the kind of
life you want the problem is that you're making that
decision unconsciously because nobody would consciously choose such a thing
that's a decision made by default that's what you get
when you don't make a decision that's what you get
when you're indecisive so finally let's get to the core
of this topic which is how to be decisive number
one be willing to make mistakes don't be afraid of
making bad and wrong decisions number two train yourself on
minor mundane decisions before you go making bold decisions in
your life because those are challenging to make first you
can train yourself every day on little things throughout the
day for example when you go to the restaurant with
your friends and they are ordering something off the menu
how long does it take you to decide what you
want to order are you sitting there hemming and hawing
and mumbling about oh well i don't know should i
get the chicken should i get the fish i get
the steak what should i get i don't know no
train yourself from now on to make those little decisions
quickly decisively this is probably the best method i know
for how to train yourself to be decisive like practically
how do you do it start with little decisions and
force yourself to make them rapidly the stakes there are
not very big that's what's nice with the little decisions
you don't have to you know if you choose the
wrong meal at the restaurant it's not a big deal
force yourself to choose it quickly and then figure out
what does it take for you to choose the right
meals you can actually dissect that you can kind of
see like what are what are your culinary values and
what meals honor those values and then you can make
good decisions based on that by knowing what you like
what you don't like other little decisions even like for
example when you're when you're driving somewhere let's say you
gotta drive to you gotta drive to your dentist's office
tomorrow right for an appointment now you could take one
road or another road to get to the dentist let's
say both roads are about equally long they take about
the same time sometimes one takes a little bit longer
it has some construction on it sometimes another road takes
a little bit longer because it has more traffic on
it depending on the time of the day right and
you're you're in your car and you're about to drive
to the dentist's office and you don't know which which
which which road to take you don't know and you
might sit there in your mind for a few minutes
and just kind of like stuck paralyzed well now you've
made you've set the intention that you want to become
a decisive person in your life so make that decision
quickly even if it's going to be the wrong decision
make it quickly and train yourself to keep doing that
and when you do that experience the kind of joy
and relief that comes with being decisive versus the pain
and suffering that comes with being indecisive about such things
often times you should also notice that you're being indecisive
about trivial things that don't even matter like in this
case the difference between taking road a versus road b
might be two minutes you might spend 10 minutes in
your own mind wrestling with which road to take without
realizing that actually it doesn't matter which road you take
it really doesn't matter take the more scenic route take
the route that takes two minutes longer and listen to
some music and enjoy your day right rather than being
stuck in your head beating yourself up about taking the
wrong road be very mindful of that a lot of
times you're forced with a decision which is actually very
trivial it seems significant but it isn't therefore don't waste
your mental energy on it just choose and go go
with the thing you know get on with your life
the third step for how to be decisive is deliberate
about important decisions but once you've made your decision stick
to it train the habit of sticking with it rather
than the habit of backtracking so one of the worst
things you can do is make a decision then the
next day change your mind then the next day change
your mind back again and do this over and over
again it's like let's say you've decided to break up
with your girlfriend because you think she's not right for
you so you break up with her and then the
next day you're like ah but but i really like
her maybe she is right for me then you go
back and then you say i know actually i was
right the first time then you go back again like
this this this sort of back and forth this crap
it wastes a lot of time a lot of energy
and um it creates a lot of suffering for you
and for others in your life so train yourself not
to do that it's sort of a a decision you
make you make a decision that you're not going to
be backtracking on your decisions and then you stick with
it and you incur the cost that means if you
make the wrong decision you stick with it you don't
backtrack and you feel the cost of the wrong decision
because actually you recognize that training this habit of backtracking
all the time this is actually sort of an even
worse meta decision that you're making and you don't want
to do that the fourth point about being decisive is
get really clear about your values your vision your life
purpose and keep working on that and clarifying it you
don't just do that once in your life then you're
done you keep clarifying and massaging your values and and
really poking and prodding at them over your lifetime until
they get clearer and clearer and clearer and clearer and
then when you're rock solid on that it becomes very
very easy to make decisions it becomes easy to decide
what kind of people you should have in your life
or which kind you can't you shouldn't it becomes easy
to decide you know where to go friday night it
becomes easy to decide what kind of food you should
or shouldn't eat and um what kind of business proposals
you should entertain which kind you can't you know if
somebody sends you an email promising you to make a
bunch of money through some get rich quick scheme by
collaborating with them you can quickly say no that's against
my values i don't even need to think about it
it's just contrary to my values and therefore no it's
an easy no when you're not clear about your own
values you become very easily manipulatable very easily influenced other
people become your puppet masters the next point closely related
to this is leverage your top values that you found
using the life purpose course process that i helped you
to go through use your top 10 values to help
you make your decisions so literally into every important decision
you go in there and you ask yourself okay my
top 10 values where does this decision you know which
of these top 10 values does my does this decision
honor and which of them does it dishonor and if
it dishonors more than it honors that's a bad decision
easy and if it honors like your top three values
that's an easy yes decision because you can't really get
better than that if some decision is honoring your top
three values what more could you want the next point
is take responsibility for being a decision maker think of
yourself as a decision maker and stop trying to outsource
decisions to other people don't ask others to decide for
you a lot of times people will send me a
message hoping that i can decide something for them like
leo should i break up with her or shouldn't i
leo should i do this thing or should i do
that thing leo should i take psychedelics or should i
wait a few years leo should i pursue this life
purpose or is that life or should i pursue this
passion or that passion first should i start my business
now or should i finish my education first should i
go pursue awakening today or should i wait to get
my finances in order don't ask me these questions assume
responsibility for making these decisions remember you're the ceo of
your life not me the next point is don't stall
or procrastinate decisions train yourself to make decisions as they
arise the next point is observe the consequences in suffering
that comes from backtracking and stalling on important decisions observe
the inner turmoil it creates observe how it drains your
mind how it causes you to overthink over worry and
fear like what's nice about training yourself to become decisive
is that it also gives you sort of a cool
and calm and groundedness amidst chaos that's an attractive quality
it gives you confidence that doesn't mean that you're always
gonna be making the right decision it means that even
if you're making the wrong decision you're still going to
do it in a cool collected way and you're not
going to be lured in by backtracking and you're not
going to be procrastinating you're not going to be afraid
of these decisions you're going to confront these decisions head
on with responsibility and it's going to be relatively easy
for you to do so because you're very clear about
your values unlike most people so it's not i'm not
just telling you that you're going to be making decisions
kind of like randomly really quickly based on nothing just
in order to kind of like project an air of
confidence and decisiveness this this is kind of like a
fake way of going about it i'm not telling you
to become like that um fundamentally you're going to be
grounded in your values you're going to know your values
so well that you will be able to make really
high quality decisions very quickly in most situations and they're
going to be very accurate but it's going to take
you time to train yourself to get to that point
right you're not going to start there this this is
an aspect of your character that you're developing is decisiveness
it might take you five or ten years of incremental
work to get to that level of like really solid
precision level decisiveness very authentic decisive confident um sort of
manner it's going to maybe take you 5-10 years to
develop that you're going to start today and you'll start
with these little decisions and then make make your way
up to bigger ones that's something you're going to develop
and then kind of like envision to yourself how awesome
it's going to feel once you reach that level the
next point is observe the consequences of not being clear
using introspection that method that i have a video on
called developing introspection i also have a couple of other
videos one called learning equals observation another one called learning
equals behavior change so those come into play here um
you're going to learn how to be decisive by observing
the consequences of your indecisiveness and lack of clarity get
that you're also going to learn in this case how
to be decisive by changing your behavior through the observation
then you're going to ask yourself how do i got
to change my behavior to become a more decisive person
that's the key question how do i have to change
my behavior to become a more decisive person look ultimately
becoming more decisive is it's not rocket science it's pretty
simple you become decisive by making lots of decisions and
kind of pushing yourself to make them quicker and to
observe the consequences of making them to observe the ways
in which you procrastinate and resist making these decisions and
to and to observe and to kind of line up
force your decisions to line up better with your top
values which you're clarifying all the time so by doing
this combination of things this is how you become decisive
and this is something you practice over we i mean
you don't need to practice it every day because some
days you won't have any important decisions to make but
like you'll be practicing it on a weekly basis over
the next you know five to ten years and then
if you keep doing that eventually you'll become a much
more decisive person and then you'll become a lot more
confident and people will look up to you and will
respect you a lot more when you develop this capacity
it's very similar to developing the capacity of a sense
of humor i have an episode called how to be
funny where i give you a step-by-step process for how
to develop a sense of humor you could actually do
that you're not just born with a good or bad
sense of humor you have to develop it and there's
a method you can go through to actually train yourself
to develop a much higher sense of humor i outlined
that in that episode well you can go through a
similar method to train yourself to become decisive the more
decisions you make the more consciously you make them the
better you're going to get it at it also what
will help you in this process is to put yourself
into positions where you have to make lots of important
decisions the most obvious place where this can happen is
at a leadership role at your job push yourself into
leadership roles management roles and so forth these roles come
with more responsibility and more decisions a lot of times
people don't take these management jobs because actually they're not
good at making decisions making decisions is stressful um and
so people just you know stay in the lower positions
then they earn less money they also grow less it's
not easy to be a good manager also train yourself
to make decisions before problems arise you want to be
preemptive with your decision making so you know a classic
example of this is always use condoms decide to always
use condoms that's a really good decision to make because
it's too late once you have a pregnancy scare it's
too late or for example quitting the wrong career if
you're in the wrong career and you sense it quit
as soon as possible don't stall on it because the
problem is going to get worse and worse and worse
over time preempt the really worst case of this situation
by quitting within the next six months because if you
stay there for five ten years that's when it's gonna
get really bad you gotta foresee that for example if
you're involved in a criminal lifestyle maybe your family is
involved in some criminal activity you got to see that
this is not going to lead anywhere good and you
got to make a decision to to exit this lifestyle
distance yourself from these kinds of people this family these
kinds of friends that you have or if you're involved
in it yourself you need to plan an exit strategy
because you know there's serious problems are going to arise
if you keep doing this so far you've been lucky
maybe you haven't gotten caught yet but eventually you'll get
caught and it'll be disastrous so make a decision preemptively
to get out here's another distinction you should make is
between shallow decisions versus deep decisions a deep decision is
one in which you've deeply contemplated unders and understood why
you should or shouldn't do a thing why a thing
is right or wrong for you right so a shallow
decision might be like you're you're walking down um the
street and you see a food stall with some junk
food there like they're selling greasy pizza and you feel
you feel a craving for that pizza but you say
you know what no i'm gonna go eat something healthier
you know further down the street there's a healthier type
of food i'm gonna get that instead and that's but
that's just like a little one-off like shallow decision you
just made it's not very deep by a deep decision
i mean like you sit down and you really contemplate
like okay let me think about all the stuff that
i'm putting into my body on a daily basis all
the food that i put into my body what is
this going to have what impact is this going to
have like on my life what are the most important
things in my life let's say for me the most
important things are my my creative work my business my
life purpose let's make let's say maybe time with my
children if i have them right maybe these are my
top four priorities and then i have to connect and
say like well how does eating this junk food all
the time how does that connect with serving my top
values and then you realize wait a minute it's contradicting
those values right because if i'm eating junk food i'm
not going to have as much time to spend with
my kids because i'm not going to be feeling so
good i'm not going to have enough energy maybe i'll
die younger there's that i'm not going to be as
creative and artistic because also my brain's not going to
be functioning as well and so forth and you know
and so forth it contradicts your top values and so
when you sit down and deeply contemplate this then you
can ask yourself well what if i make a decision
to not eat junk food ever again not because just
like i don't want to be fat or something or
because i don't want to have a stomach ache one
day not because of that but because i want to
honor my top four values let's say and this is
conflicting with that and it's undermining my top four values
therefore i'm going to decide for the rest of my
life never to touch pizza ever again that would be
a deep decision that's what i mean by a deep
decision where you really think through like what the full
consequences are long term and towards your ultimate overarching life
purpose and vision for your life and your top values
and who you want to be as a character in
life and then based on that you say no to
a thing or you say yes to someone some other
thing that is aligned with that for example make a
deep decision not to drink alcohol that would be different
than a shallow decision a shallow decision is like you
know what um i had a hangover last night so
tonight i'm not going to drink because i don't want
another hangover that's a shallow decision that's like a one-off
kind of thing because a few weeks will pass then
you'll you'll go drinking again because you didn't really think
through what drinking does to you a deep decision about
drinking is when you think about all the impact that
this drinking has on your liver on your health on
how you feel about yourself on how you're able to
communicate with others the kind of problems that arise when
you drink too much the amount of money that you
spend over your lifetime on drinking and the effect it
has on your brain and the bad example it sets
for your for your children and your friends and maybe
the kind of danger gets you into when you're driving
drunk occasionally from from the bar back home because you
don't have a a ride right but you're incurring some
risk there and then you think about all the hangovers
you're gonna have in your whole life and you think
about all the vomiting you're gonna do and you're gonna
think about all the extra calories it's gonna add you
know all that alcohol and how fat it's gonna make
you and how it's gonna conflict with your deepest values
and how it's gonna conflict with spirituality and meditation you're
going to skip days of meditation because you're going to
be too hungover from drinking to meditate right so like
when you connect all of that then you can make
a deep decision not to drink ever again likewise you
can make a deep decision not to cheat in relationships
a shallow decision not to cheat would be just like
you know like oh i find her really hot but
like ah i would feel guilty if i cheated so
i don't cheat this one time it's like yeah but
that's just like one time the next time maybe i
will cheat if i find something hotter right it's not
a deep decision a deep decision would be like do
i want to be the kind of person that cheats
because cheating involves lying do i want to be a
liar what would it mean if i said yes to
lying how is lying going to impact my top values
and what kind of example i set and also my
ability to have a family to have children to maintain
a deep intimate relationship with a spouse all this sort
of stuff is that going to be possible if i'm
the kind of person that's going to be tempted to
lie and then to cheat right you think through all
that and you say oh okay then easy it's easy
now to say no to cheating how about a deep
decision not to exploit your customers or a deep decision
to set boundaries in relationships a deep decision never to
allow yourself to be to have your values violated your
deepest values violated in a relationship a deep decision not
to chase get rich quick schemes if you're involved in
business okay so now you understand shallow versus deep decisions
here's some things i want you to contemplate write down
some of these questions these are going to be very
good homework assignments for you so first of all contemplate
do you want to be a decisive person or do
you want to be an indecisive person actually think about
that think about the pros and cons also think about
what it's going to take the work it's going to
take to become a decisive person because it's going to
take work you have to retrain yourself do you want
to do that work is it a worthwhile investment for
you contemplate that and then make a deep decision if
you want to be a decisive person as you're thinking
about that contemplate what indecisiveness will cost you over your
whole lifetime you need to drill into your mind that
indecision is much worse than making the wrong decision it's
also much worse it's going to cost you much more
in the long term than it will to just train
yourself and discipline yourself to become a decisive person the
work you do to become decisive in the end is
going to be less than all the misery and [
__ ] that you put up with by being indecisive
for the rest of your life think through all that
don't just listen to me mindlessly think through it your
mind has to gain traction with these ideas you have
to like think them through almost like logical proofs or
mathematical theorems you have to think through them and understand
why the math turns out to work the way it
works also contemplate this why have you been indecisive in
your life if you think of yourself as an indecisive
person and indecisiveness has been a problem your whole life
ask yourself why also think about what have been the
costs the trick with this is that you probably don't
even realize the full cost of your indecisiveness there have
been many bold big important decisions in your life that
you've stalled on or ignored making that would have massively
improved your life and you don't even know what those
are because you've just been stalling and being indecisive for
so long you don't even know how amazing your life
could have been if you've been making better decisions and
being more decisive so kind of you have to kind
of like go back and think about like where could
my life be if i was really bold and decisive
you need some vision here also contemplate this what are
some really good decisions that i could make for my
life and also the opposite what are some really bad
decisions that i could make in my life and then
contemplate what decisions have i been stalling on then i
want you to contemplate how can i make better decisions
and i want you to contemplate what makes a decision
good actually do this as your homework assignment this will
gain you valuable insight beyond just the theory that i
give you here it's going to be more powerful than
hearing it from me making great decisions also ties in
with intuition and wisdom i have two episodes about that
i have one episode called how to harness your intuition
go look at that another episode called what is wisdom
go look at that developing your intuition your creativity your
wisdom and exposing yourself to massive experience will make you
a really good decision makers decision maker these skills and
capacities will all synergize together and in the future i'll
have an episode about how to be very creative i'm
very passionate about studying how to become creative and what
creativity is it's a tricky topic but also very important
one so look intuition creativity wisdom and massive experience all
these three things or four things will synergize together in
addition to your intention and your decision to become decisive
in your life so in conclusion decide to push yourself
rather than waiting for life to push you your most
powerful decisions will actually be so strong they won't even
feel or seem like decisions at all at least that's
how it should be there are things in your life
i want you to notice that you have decided that
are so non-negotiable for you that they don't even feel
like decisions for example like for me for me that
would be living a life with passion and purpose and
not wasting my life to me that's absolutely non-negotiable i
can't live life without that it's so non-negotiable that it's
it's even wrong to call that a decision because when
you say it's a decision it's as though like there
was an alternative option and there never was for me
it was obvious since i was like seven years old
that that's what i want from life and it's this
kind of decision that is the most powerful decision the
kind that leaves no alternative another one for you is
rejecting the easy life rejecting the path of least resistance
never doing a thing just because it's the easiest of
all the alternatives that was also a decision i made
early on in my life that was really not a
decision but it's shaped the whole trajectory of my life
that's non-negotiable for me it's invalid in my own world
view to do something just because it's easy you have
to do the thing that's right not the thing that's
easy another one for me was the pursuit of philosophy
truth and profound understanding to me this is non-negotiable there
is no life for me without this it's this or
death that's how i frame it in my own mind
so in that sense it's not even a decision it's
so aligned with my top values that i couldn't imagine
living life without this i don't even understand how people
can live life without this it doesn't compute in my
world here um but you see there's a lot of
power behind that when you take something so seriously there's
so much power behind that it grounds you so deeply
it tells you the direction it's sort of like the
the absolute compass of your life these examples i'm giving
you right now these are sort of like the ultimate
compass that runs in my life i have other values
besides this that are a little bit more negotiable but
these are just absolutely non-negotiable and then the last example
is awakening so when i heard that such a thing
exists as awakening before i even had one when i
first heard about it like 10 years ago or so
for me in my mind it was absolutely clear that
i needed to have it i needed to experience it
i didn't even know what it was i just know
i needed it and there was no there's no alternative
there was no options like well should i pursue awakening
or maybe i should go chase girls or earn more
money it's like i don't know like maybe i'm a
little bit leaning towards i'm mostly leaning towards awakening but
part of me is like wanting to chase it was
like no like awakening it's like not non-negotiable right there's
no alternative to that that's what you need if you
really want to wake up it's that that level of
commitment and clarity that you need um so i suggest
you you contemplate your deepest values very deeply find the
ones that are non-negotiable for you and stop compromising on
those make some permanent decisions about honoring those top values
of yours and if you're still confused about what i'm
talking about here with top values and you're wondering how
to find yours that's what my life purpose course is
for it's over 20 hours of exclusive content that is
not featured on the main channel that shows you how
to find your top values and how to align your
life with that so go check that out if you
haven't alright that's it i'm done here check out my
website check out my blog check out my patreon page
check out the forum check out my book reviews list
check out the life purpose course check out all this
stuff i have more stuff coming in the future i'm
working on some new courses coming in the future so
stick around for all that and lastly i want to
tell you this look if you found my work if
you found this channel these videos you've been very lucky
extremely lucky you stumbled upon this channel by fluke luck
you are like one you won the lottery 100 000
people will stumble upon these videos by fluke luck everybody
who stumbles upon my content does so through fluke because
i don't i don't go out there advertising or anything
like that if you found my content on youtube or
or itunes or whatever it's through fluke luck understand this
um you were very lucky but that's not enough you
were lucky to find the content now you got to
work the content you found a gold mine of life
transforming information these ideas concepts perspectives will transform your whole
life if you apply them properly and you really work
them but it's very easy for you to squander your
good fortune here it's not enough for you to be
lucky in this work you were lucky to stumble upon
the possibility of this work now you've got to actually
listen to all of it contemplate it do the homework
assignments journal about it think deeply about it start applying
it in your life and you've got to be consistent
with it on a weekly basis for years and decades
without that you're not going to get the results so
the biggest honor you can pay to my work is
by doing it i'm receiving more and more comments from
people on the forum on youtube on instagram on you
know through email and so forth i'm receiving more and
more comments from people telling me that this work they've
been following it for like five years eight years three
years whatever and they tell me that it's transformed their
life so i'd like you to think about that possibility
to take that possibility seriously and to become one of
those people because the majority of people who watch my
content they're not going to be those people i would
like to say that everybody experiences that but they don't
because it takes a lot of work and it's only
going to transform your life to the degree to which
you take it seriously more than just a passing hobby
of listening to this kind of material while you're cooking
you know dinner or doing your laundry it has to
be something deeper than that it's for those people that
i do this work for the people who are going
to take it seriously those few who are going to
take it seriously i'd like you to make a decision
now perhaps one of the biggest decisions you'll make in
your life whether you want to be one of those
people that decision is up to you the results are
up to you you
