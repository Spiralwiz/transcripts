            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ZulzVTr0UCQ' target='_blank'>Overcoming Fear - How To Slay Your Greatest Demon</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Personal Demons as Hindrances</b>: Leo Gura focuses on the internal hindrances everyone faces, which he refers to as "demons." For him, a significant demon was reconciling business and profitability with creativity and beauty. He recounts his struggle in his first career as a game designer, where financial restraints often compromised creativity.
</li><li><b>Struggles in Creative Industries and Beyond</b>: Gura extends that this problem is not just limited to creative fields but can appear in virtually any aspect of life, including health, relationships, money, and family matters. He indicates that these "demons" may lead individuals to brush their issues under the rug or even run away from them temporarily.
</li><li><b>Application of "Hero's Journey"</b>: Gura draws a comparison of these struggles with Joseph Campbell's concept of "the hero's journey" where one encounters obstacles, or "threshold guardians," before achieving goals. He explains that these obstacles can take any form - financial constraints, cravings, negative influences, etc.
</li><li><b>Need for Persistence and Re-evaluation</b>: Gura highlights how sometimes, these threshold guardians can lead to failed attempts, leading to periods of reassessment and skill-building before re-engaging with the challenge. He relates this idea to starting his own business and the challenges he faced when marketing concerns threatened the quality of his work.
</li><li><b>Balance between Passion and Profit</b>: Gura discusses the concept of inversion in creative businesses, where the initial values of creativity and beauty are overshadowed by the pressure of profitability. He confesses quitting his job due to the deformation of his initial values but warns against running from these problems as they remain in the mind, indicating that they must be confronted and resolved. 
</li><li><b>Facing Demons Strategically</b>: Gura encourages viewers to reflect on their own demons without avoiding them indefinitely. He emphasizes the importance of strategic confrontation with these obstacles for a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Struggling with business and personal growth issues</b>:  Leo Gura is starting a new business and is once again facing tensions between his creative pursuits and the practical considerations of running a business, similar to his past experiences. He acknowledges that he needs to balance producing quality content with the necessary business and marketing aspects.  
</li><li><b>Evading problems</b>: Gura discusses how he initially avoided dealing with these conflicts by changing his career direction, yet the same issues have re-emerged. He underscores that simply avoiding problems doesn't eradicate them and they'll likely reappear, potentially causing damage in the long run.  
</li><li><b>Importance of confronting challenges head-on</b>: Despite acknowledging that it's sometimes strategically appropriate to temporarily avoid certain problems, Gura stresses that evading them indefinitely can lead to an unfulfilled life. He encourages viewers to honestly identify and confront their biggest personal challenges, implying that dealing with them can result in personal progression and a higher level of contentment.  
</li><li><b>Influence of personal values</b>: Gura notes that because he values beauty and excellence in creating high-quality content, he will always face challenges related to business practicalities, no matter his chosen career or business. He highlights this as a personal struggle and one of his biggest challenges or 'demons'.  
</li><li><b>Loss due to avoidance of problems</b>: Gura warns of the potential loss and waste that might occur if the tensions between the practicalities of business and personal values are not resolved, possibly leading to damaging situations such as quitting businesses multiple times or missing out on opportunities.  
</li><li><b>Proactive approach to problem-solving</b>: He instructs viewers to consider their future and envisage the recurring issues and potential loss that unresolved problems could cause over the next 10 to 20 years. Emphasizing that the pain of handling these challenges now is lesser than the accumulated distress over prolonged years, Gura advocates for embarking on solutions as early as possible.
</li><li><b>Overcoming challenges Â– sequential approach</b>: Leo advises taking on problems one at a time and progressing towards next levels in life. He notes that solving one problem may very well lead to another one cropping up, but emphasizes focusing on resolving one issue before moving to the next.  
</li><li><b>Call to action</b>: Gura concludes by encouraging viewers to  share his content and sign up for his free newsletter. He also uses his own struggles as a means to inspire viewers to tackle their own personal demons.
