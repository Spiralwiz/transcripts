[Music] legendary basketball coach John Wooden who won many consecutive
championships for UCLA and who was considered to be one
of the greatest athletic coaches of all time had a
very simple philosophy for success which Hill allowed him to
win so many consecutive championships the most out of anybody
and what was so powerful about his philosophy was that
it was simple and it had focused on the fundamentals
and what he would do you might think to get
these kids these college students to win all these basketball
games is that he would teach them flashy moves how
to Duncan how to do all sorts of fancy stuff
out there on the court but that's the opposite of
what he did he just focused on the stupidly simple
things you know how he would start his his students
off he would teach them how to put on their
shoes how to tie their shoelaces and before even that
he would teach them how to put on their socks
and you might think all but I've been playing basketball
ever since since high school and I'm already really good
and now I'm in college now I I don't need
to know how to put on my shoes and tie
my my shoes and how to put on my socks
that's obvious stuff duh I know how to do that
but what John Wooden would say is he would say
how are you gonna win the chance the championship basketball
game if you don't know how to tie your shoelaces
and you're running and you got ten seconds left on
the clock and you to score the winning shot and
your shoelace has come undone how are you gonna win
when your attention is distracted and you're tripping over your
shoelaces or you would say how are you gonna win
the championship game if we need to practice for five
hours a day every single day for months on end
and you put your socks on wrong such that the
seam of the socks isn't properly aligned with your foot
and with your choose so that after training for five
hours you develop blisters and pain and therefore you don't
show up on practice on Monday and you miss practice
and then you have those blisters for the championship game
how you gonna win it's the details that matter so
a lot of times when I start talking about very
simple things like in this case how to shop for
healthy food people tend to dismiss and say oh I'll
leo but shopping for healthy food what does this have
to do with enlightenment this is not advanced philosophical knowledge
or wisdom Ernie this kind of stuff this is obvious
I already know but do you really know food sets
the foundation for health and the foundation for the rest
of your life if you don't have a proper foundation
of nutrition then how can we speak about anything else
how can you meditate properly how can you work on
your addictions how can you do yoga how can you
do enlightenment work it's not gonna work most people have
no idea how to shop for healthy food because they
never been taught because our society doesn't teach these things
in fact our society doesn't just not teach these things
it does the exact opposite it teaches you all the
wrong things to shop for and you started learning the
wrong things right down to elementary school through middle school
through high school you got a 12 year education in
how to eat all the wrong foods and nobody really
told you that most modern foods are literally poison and
that food manufacturers and food advertising is highly misleading and
these people and companies they know that they are selling
you poison and yet every single year they invest billions
of dollars in focus groups and in marketing campaigns to
directly target you with poison getting you to buy more
of their poison addicted to their poison and then people
wonder why they have problems and why they're depressed and
why they have it ad/hd and then they can meditate
and they can't do this and they can't do that
this is one big reason it's not the only reason
it's a big reason because quite simply food manufacturers and
advertisers are literally Devils that's what they are they are
in the business of serving themselves at your expense and
of course they don't teach you this in school because
these very devils have infiltrated the government's nutrition programs they
have actually constructed engineered the food pyramid and all the
recommendations by the government to in fact get you to
buy more of their poison that's how clever these Devils
are and of course there's one other benefit that you'll
get from learning how to how to shop for healthy
food besides just your health and that's never having to
worry about your weight ever again if you follow these
guidelines that I'm gonna give you not only will you
significantly improve your health and enable yourself to do more
of the advanced consciousness work that I want you doing
but you will never have to worry about being too
fat not fitting into your jeans you won't even have
to go to the gym you'll be able to stay
at a good healthy slim weight no matter what you
eat as long as you follow these guidelines so let's
talk about this the key food groups that you need
to avoid the most are brace yourself wheat dairy sugar
corn soy and artificial chemicals and sweeteners and coloring agents
these are the big ones these are the ones that
really make a difference why because these cause allergic reactions
in the body and a host of autoimmune diseases a
lot of people aren't aware of this category of diseases
called autoimmune diseases it's actually one of the largest category
of diseases this is not some kind of rare one-off
disease it's extremely prevalent over 50 million Americans have an
autoimmune disease of one form or another and the trick
with these autoimmune diseases is that there's over a hundred
different types they can be very severe or they can
be subtle there are many gradations of them and many
people aren't diagnosed well so not those 50-million those are
the ones that are diagnosed then there are millions more
perhaps just as many million more who are not properly
diagnosed because doctors generally speaking don't know how to diagnose
these very well and the cures and treatments for these
diseases are also very slim science doesn't understand disease very
well and that's because of most of them are caused
by improper diet and of course a doctor will tell
you everything that you can do all the medications you
can take and all that but he's not gonna tell
you how to correct your diet and how to shop
for healthy food the one thing that cures many of
these autoimmune diseases because that's the root cause and in
fact just taking medication doesn't cure you of the root
cause the disease will still continue and that's actually another
corruption of the medical system where these Devils come in
and what they do is of course you have an
autoimmune disease so what they do is they just give
you some drug and then they force you to take
that drug for the rest of your life and of
course that's perfect from them from their perspective because that
means you got to show up to the doctor's office
for a new prescription every single year or every six
months and you got to buy their expensive medicine and
you got to do that for the rest of your
life that's like an infinite pool of clients that's 50
million clients to physicians offices every single year that's perfect
for the doctors it's perfect for the medical industry perfect
for hospitals but it sucks for you and the reason
I'm passionate about this is because I have some autoimmune
diseases and although there's a genetic component of course for
example some of my Ottoman diseases my mom also has
I have hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's which is related to hypothyroidism
it's it's when your immune system attacks your thyroid gland
but in general all autoimmune diseases are like that it's
your immune system overreacting to something same but what I've
discovered is that in my own case it's my diet
it's because the terrible terrible diet that I had that
I was growing up with as a kid because my
family knew nothing about nutrition in fact it was the
exact opposite I was taught all the wrong stuff about
nutrition in my school through elementary school through middle school
through high school through college and only then did I
start to turn this stuff around through a lot of
research and education so even though there is a genetic
component what people don't understand is that the genetic component
only gets triggered and actualized by the poor diet specifically
these bad key food groups like wheat dairy sugar corn
soy and artificial chemicals see because your body didn't evolved
for those things when it gets into your body it
starts to wreak havoc with your with your gut with
your liver with your immune system with your brain and
different people have different susceptibility so some people can tolerate
that stuff more than others and I'm not saying that
you're 100% open to autoimmune diseases but a lot of
people are and these autoimmune disease we gotta understand about
them is that it's not just an on/off switch like
I either have one or I don't there's gradations of
it and these allergic reactions that you encounter with things
like wheat dairy sugar corn soy and artificial chemicals they
are not necessarily always like you go and you start
heaving and throwing up that kind of you know class
like allergic reaction we think of your body has subtle
sensitivities that many people have become so numb to because
of the food they eat there so unconscious not unaware
of what they're putting into their body that they don't
even know when your body is sending them the signals
that you know I there's something wrong with the digestion
or there's something wrong with my immune system or there's
something wrong with my energy which is why we have
all these problems which are difficult to treat and difficult
to diagnose like chronic fatigue fibromyalgia leaky gut syndrome all
the sort of stuff a lot of that comes from
autoimmune diseases which come from improper diet and if you
take a look at what are the most common diseases
that Americans face for example heart disease diabetes arthritis hypothyroidism
Hashimoto's disease celiac disease cancer chronic fatigue leaky gut ADHD
and a lot of these have to do with your
nutrition a lot more than your doctor will admit to
you because hey you know if your doctors like my
doctor he's probably fat so he doesn't know this stuff
either which is really mind-blowing but anyways so that gets
you a little bit of an understanding of kind of
where we're coming from and why we're gonna be avoiding
these food groups and some of these lists that I'll
be giving you I'll be giving you a lot of
lists here for what not to shop for and for
what to shop for but before we get there let's
talk about the the fundamental principles of how to actually
select food at the grocery store I know it sounds
basic but there's actually some valuable insights here that I've
learned and I've taught myself so firstly ignore the calorie
and the fat label on the back of the box
calorie counting is completely useless and unnecessary you won't need
it with this system that I'm going to give you
looking at the calories of a food is irrelevant looking
at the fat content is irrelevant as well only look
at the list of ingredients on the back of the
box that's one of the few things that the marketing
companies can't screw around with too much they have to
actually list all the ingredients on the back of the
box they legally have to they can't hype that up
they can't fudge the numbers there and they also have
to list them in the order of greatest quantity to
lowest quantity so that helps you to distinguish what you're
actually putting into your body and the key that you
want to look for and the way that you're going
to basically select foods is the grocery grocery store is
you're gonna look at the back of the box and
you're gonna ask yourself how many ingredients are here and
are these natural and whole ingredients or are these artificial
chemical type of ingredients what you're looking for is you're
looking for foods that are five ingredients or less per
box ideally of course your food is not even in
a box but let's just say you're going with a
box or a can that has that label on it
so if you take a box and you look on
the back if it's something like a frozen pizza how
many ingredients this is gonna be on that list it's
gonna be over thirty or fifty including a bunch of
complicated chemical names hydrogenated fats trans fats oils and all
sorts of weird stuff that really you would think belongs
in a chemistry class more than the does in your
stomach so what you're gonna be looking for is five
ingredients or less and all of them need to make
sense to you so if it says it's got carrots
and broccoli and some salt and pepper and oil okay
that's good that's fine but if it's got a bunch
of other stuff in it like take a look for
example at your typical carton of ice cream and look
at all the ingredients it's not just gonna be sugar
and milk and some chocolate flavoring you know that would
be a high-quality ice cream I mean ice cream is
a problem you want to avoid ice cream but that
would be a high quality ice cream because it only
has three ingredients you see doesn't have a bunch of
preservatives and this and that and God knows what else
they stick in there but if you take a look
at your standard cheap carton of ice cream that you
find at Walmart it's gonna have like thirty ingredients half
of them all sorts of chemical stuff so that's the
one you definitely want to avoid next principle aha for
he has never assumed that an item is healthy just
by looking at the front of the box you always
have to read the ingredient list so when I'm in
the store and I'm looking for a new item that
I never bought before I'm always double checking the ingredient
list cuz a lot of times you pick up a
bag of chips or you pick up a can of
fruit or something anything god this must be healthy you
know it's just potatoes or is just like broccoli in
a can but then you flip it around you look
at it you know what's actually there and you see
all sorts of weird stuff that shouldn't be there and
you'll notice that the higher quality of the can the
more expensive it'll be the fewer ingredients it'll have whereas
the low quality stuff will have more ingredients because they
need to pack in a bunch of preservatives to preserve
that stuff so the reason that can is cheaper is
because it can stay on the shelf for like three
years and why can it do that because they've packed
it full chemicals so these food manufacturers are strongly incentivized
to make food that lasts as long as humanly possible
long shelf life which is the exact opposite of what
you want you want food that deteriorates very quickly food
that lasts less than a week that's raw fresh alive
food or as close to that as you can get
and you know if you can keep food in your
pantry for three years and it's still good it's probably
not good food to begin with you're a few more
principles avoid all hydrogenated fats and oils if it's a
complicated oil if it's not a natural sounding oil like
olive oil or coconut oil avocado or something like that
then then it's probably one of these chemist chemistry created
oils these oils are very unhealthy avoid sugar and corn
syrup and you'll be shocked to discover when you start
actually look at the ingredient labels that probably 80% of
all items in the supermarket contain corn syrup or sugar
in them in large quantities so look out for that
avoid those avoid generally speaking all boxed and processed foods
if your food comes in a box it's probably not
very high quality if it comes in a can that's
borderline you can buy stuff in cans but generally what
you're looking for is you're looking for fresh stuff avoid
complex preservatives and coloring agents your food should not have
any coloring agents in them avoid cheap meat and eggs
and as a rule of thumb which are shooting for
is you're looking for stuff as close to unlive as
possible plant-based as much as possible lots of pigments plants
contain those different colors and pigments which are good for
fighting cancer cells and overcoming aging they act as enzymes
and they repair your body look for organic as much
as possible go for least cooked as much as possible
and single ingredients as much as possible here's a list
of labels which these advertising companies love to use to
try to trick you into thinking that their food is
healthy see because in the last 10 20 years there's
been sort of a health food movement afoot and you
got stores like Whole Foods opening up and becoming very
popular and so these these manufacturers of food who used
to manufacture a really low quality food now they're getting
a little bit scared because people are now shopping for
low-fat low-sugar all the sort of stuff you see but
they still don't want to sacrifice their profits and they
still don't want to actually offer you healthy food so
what they do instead is they resort to all these
devilish tricks to get you to think their food is
actually healthy and good for you so here are the
misleading labels which are completely meaningless cage-free that's a meaningless
label vegetarian fed that's a meaningless label a lot of
times they'll put these on cartons of eggs and say
oh it's caged freedoms vegetarian fed and then you read
that you say oh these must be good organic like
eggs no they're actually not organic and what that vegetarian
fed means is that to actually pack these chickens full
of corn that's what they feed them as corn corn
is vegetarian but that's not what chickens should be eating
also what they like to do is they like to
slap on the label antibiotic free and hormone free as
if that actually has any significance whatsoever it's illegal to
actually put antibiotics or hormones into chickens into chicken eggs
and into I believe most cattle in the United States
that's actually against the law so saying that your meat
or your eggs are antibiotic free or hormone free that's
like saying nothing that's the bare mineral like that's sort
of like having a pizza box a frozen pizza box
and saying it's poison free yeah no duh no it
should be poison free but that doesn't mean that it's
healthy just because it's poison free cyanide free okay yeah
it's iodide free but so what I'm expecting something a
little bit more than just cyanide free for my food
also the label all-natural they'd love to use that label
it's completely meaningless it's completely unregulated you could slap that
label onto almost any food there's no government controls over
that label no trans fats is often also very misleading
because what no trans fats actually means is that it
has to be below a certain percentage of trans fats
so what they can do is they can they can
fudge the numbers with the portion sizes they can reduce
the portion sizes such that as long as there's like
less than some microgram amount or some milligram amount of
trans fats then they can actually claim no trans fats
when in fact there actually are trans fats in the
food it's completely misleading so to completely avoid trans fats
what you have to do is you can't trust that
label you have to actually look at the ingredient list
and check it for trans fats because they might still
be there you though the front of the box says
no trans fats in big fat letters also watch out
for the labels fat-free and low-fat these are quite meaningless
because fat is actually not a problem there's no problem
with eating fat that is healthy for you and the
label low calorie and sugar free these are also misleading
labels because they know that people are shopping counting calories
so they think oh if I just say it's low
calorie or sugar free that means people think it's healthy
and then of course to make it taste good and
sell well they'll pack it full of other chemicals other
crap that isn't good for you same thing with fat-free
and low-fat you see they think that people are walking
around trying to avoid fat they think that makes the
fat so they say oh this is fat-free and sure
maybe it is fat-free but then it's got all this
other crap in it like it's got a bunch of
sugar in it sugar isn't fat but you don't want
to be eating a lot of sugar so watch out
for all these labels here are the meaning meaningful labels
that you can actually rely on if it says organic
especially USD a certified organic that's really good because that
is actually enforced by the government that's checked and maintained
and you do want to buy as much organic food
as possible grass fed and pasture raised these are good
labels and they actually do mean something it means that
the animal was actually raised on some kind of pasture
or grass the way that it naturally should be look
for grass fed and pasture-raised eggs and meat vegan is
a good label if you're trying to avoid meat and
animal products dairy free gluten free soy free these can
be trusted although of course remember that just because something
is gluten-free doesn't mean it's healthy or just because it's
dairy free does it mean that it's healthy that's just
one piece of the larger puzzle that you need to
be watching out for but it's good for example when
you're looking at a product and you know you're trying
to avoid dairy or gluten and you see that label
it's dairy and gluten free that's good cuz then you
can at least know that it fits that criteria for
you and the last label is non-gmo that's also one
that actually has some meaning behind it so that's the
good list now let's move on to all the stuff
that you should never buy again in the grocery store
brace yourself for this one so here all the categories
a lot of the stuff if you've never studied nutrition
before and if you're eating the standard American diet you
are gonna be quite outraged at this list that I'm
putting forth but this is it this was gonna make
you healthy never again should you ever buy soda of
any kind or why vitamin water never again should you
buy pasteurized fruit juice which basically includes all fruit juice
that's not in the refrigerated section pasteurized fruit juice is
all the bottled both glass and plastic bottles and boxed
and bagged juice that you find on the shelves this
is the kind of juice that can stand on a
shelf for a year and then you can still drink
it and the reason can do that has been pasteurized
pasteurized means it's been cooked at high heat which destroys
a lot of the the whole value of the juice
so if you're gonna be going for fruit and vegetable
juices make sure you're getting raw cold juice which has
not been pasteurized and usually it has a very short
shelf life it only lasts in a refrigerator for a
couple of days a week maximum and even then you
should go light on the fruit juices because they contain
a lot of calories here's perhaps the worst category of
all which is no bread of any kind I haven't
eaten bread for the last two years at all and
not just bread but all wheat containing products wheat is
the number one culprit and cause of all autoimmune diseases
and chronic fatigue and leaky gut syndrome because what people
don't understand about wheat is that modern wheat is both
engineered but also it was artificially bred even before it
was genetically engineered in the early 20th century it was
artificially bred to be pest resistant so that manufacturers could
grow tons of this wheat at a very high yield
at very low costs because wheat provides most the calorie
intake for most human beings on the whole planet so
what happened is that they created and they they artificially
bred these very highly resistant forms of wheat which are
covered by this coating which is very difficult for pests
to penetrate so that's good as far as pests go
doesn't ruin the crop but it's terrible for your stomach
because your stomach has not evolved to digest these newly
bred forms of wheat and so because of this what
happens that you eat the wheat with almost every meal
and just becomes this chronic feeding of these indigestible wheat
molecules into your gut and then they go through the
lining in your gut and then your immune system actually
has to be constantly fighting this wheat that you're pumping
into your body because your stomach certainly can't digest it
and then this leads to all sorts of problems from
that on that's what activates these autoimmune diseases a lot
of autoimmune diseases can simply be cured by cutting out
all wheat from your diet so what I highly recommend
for you if you're really into consciousness work and you
care about your health bite the bullet and ditch all
bread and all wheat from your diet also of course
that means you have to avoid everything in the bakery
aisle which includes all pastries pies cakes cookies muffins bagels
Donuts and so forth croissants also of course this includes
pasta and cereal so what we're doing here is we're
cutting out some very major food groups as you can
see on the one hand this might sound depressing and
it might sound difficult to do but on the other
hand you can see that this is a big change
and you'll see the list of positive stuff that I'll
give you after we complete a list of stuff to
avoid is gonna be a lot of very healthy food
you can see how that will make a big difference
in your in your nutrition and also what should harden
you from this discussion about wheat is that actually a
wheat is the single largest contributor to obesity into fat
if your fat is primarily because you eat so much
wheat when you stop eating wheat it'll be very very
difficult for you to put on weight no matter how
much of it you eat as long as you also
avoid lots of sugar the next huge category is dairy
I recommend that you cut out all dairy dairy contains
various proteins in it like casein - which many people
are sensitive and allergic without knowing and I'm not just
talking about lactose intolerance for example I'm not lactose intolerant
I've ate dairy for most of my life although I
haven't for about the last year or two I've cut
it out entirely and it's huge it's huge because these
autoimmune disease are also triggered by dairy most of the
dairy that people consume are is very low quality pasteurized
dairy and acne for example I used to have a
lot of acne completely went away after I eliminated dairy
so of course the dairy category includes not only milk
but also all the stuff you love like cheese ice
cream yogurt butter sour cream and of course all the
products that use that such as pizza of course you
should have a limited pits already because it's bread mostly
bread but it's a bad combination of bread and also
cheese dairy you should also specifically avoid sweetened yogurts those
are particularly nasty got chemical and artificial sweeteners in them
you should also avoid all corn products as much as
possible a lot of corn is genetically modified and also
difficult to digest it just has very low nutritional content
overall also soy products people think soy is healthy there's
nothing particularly healthy about so in fact soy can also
cause allergic reactions in your body and for men so
it can be problematic because it actually puts too much
estrogen hormones into your body because that comes from soya
as well so all soy products basically I avoid and
of course that includes even soy sauce and soy sauce
is problematic not because just it contains soy but also
it contains wheat you should also avoid all pre-made meals
such as Lunchables rice mixes potato mixes all the kind
of stuff you find in boxes there in the grocery
store also of course avoid all frozen meals such as
TV dinners frozen pizzas Hot Pockets pot pies and all
the sort of frozen stuff that's available there completely avoid
all that avoid all chips avoid all deli meat like
salami 's and hams all canned meat bacon and sausage
and all other kinds of processed meats avoid frozen desserts
like ice cream pies cakes avoid store made sandwiches and
wraps and pasta salad of course because that's all we
tanned usually it's the lowest quality of ingredients that you
can find all the store made sandwiches and stuff like
that you think they're using high quality organic ingredients in
that no they're using the cheapest possible stuff in there
avoid all salad dressings pre-made salad dressings stuff that you
find in bottles on the shelves of course it contains
a lot of preservatives and also most salad dressings also
contain dairy stuff like ranch dressing and so on make
your own salad dressings using olive oil vinegar lemon juice
and spices and that kind of avoid dried soups and
noodles like ramen noodles those are terrible for you avoid
heinz ketchup it contains a bunch of sugar in it
avoid barbecue sauces it also contains lots of sugar avoid
whey protein whey protein also in addition to casein is
one of those molecules which is difficult to digest and
many people have problems digesting it which is why if
you do consume whey protein and your protein shakes or
workout supplements which I used to take a lot of
then you you know you got a lot of acne
from that and now you know why it's because of
the way your body can't process it and it's not
just that you're having acne and doesn't look good it's
also what's going on on the inside not only in
getting out acne on the outside on the inside what's
happening is that your immune system is struggling to fight
all this stuff and it's sapping your energy and causing
diseases avoid protein bars and protein shakes those are often
advertised as being healthy but literally what most protein bars
are is just candy it's like a Snickers bar except
they put a little bit of protein powder into it
which isn't good for you to begin with and then
they put all sorts of chemicals and sugar packed with
sugar in there same thing with all those shakes avoid
Atlantic salmon tuna swordfish and mackerel these big fish are
often contaminated with heavy metals like mercury avoid farmed fish
because most farmed fish are of course fed corn so
the corn fed fish this one I'm a little bit
more lenient on so if you need to buy some
seafood this farm farm farm raised then that's that's alright
it's not the end of the world but try to
avoid and go for wild fish whatever it's available avoid
canned tuna that contains a lot of mercury in it
avoid coffee avoid alcohol never again buy candy or milk
chocolate don't buy safflower oil canola oil or oil sprays
that kind of Pam spray that you spray on your
and it's completely unnecessary and it contains all sorts of
artificial oils and hydrogenated fats they're bad for you avoid
butter substitutes like healthy Smart Balance butter and I can't
believe it's not butter and margarine this is all terrible
stuff just use healthy olive oil or some other kind
of oil for that avoid sugar of course and artificial
sweeteners like Splenda and aspartame and all that kind of
stuff avoid corn fed meat and avoid corn fed or
vegetarian fed eggs so that's my list of all the
stuff you should never buy again here's a list of
all the aisles in the grocery store that really you
should never visit again in your entire life the candy
aisle you have no business being there the deli meat
aisle the cheese aisle the soda and juice aisle the
bread and bakery aisle the cereal aisle the chips aisle
the alcohol aisle and the protein bar aisle all of
these aisles if you never went to again in your
entire life you would be very well served and I
almost never go to these so that's the bad news
here's the good news here's what you can actually buy
fresh fruits and veggies this is a huge category you
should be shopping in this category a lot there's a
lot of different fresh fruits and veggies that you can
eat most almost all of them are healthy for you
frozen fruits and veggies these are also really good I
like to rely on frozen fruits and veggies because they
can store nice and well in my freezer just make
sure to to buy organic as much as possible and
to wash them very well if it's fresh if it's
frozen of course you're not going to be washing them
which is especially why I buy frozen stuff as organic
as much as possible pre-wash salad mix is very good
although you're wasting some plastic therefore the environments not that
good but as far as saving you time is quite
convenient 100% pure canned fruits and vegetables these can be
alright they're not ideal but you need some options for
storing food so this is probably the best way to
do it just make sure they don't have too many
artificial preservatives in there and also watch out that they're
not filled with sugar for example a lot of canned
fruits are really just uh packed with sugar so you
want to find canned fruits that are very low in
sugar or no sugar at all fresh cold juices these
can be good like I mentioned before fresh or frozen
meat especially as much as possible organic and grass-fed those
are good if you're into meat if you're not into
meat if you're a vegetarian or a vegan well then
you're gonna skip this category pure nuts is another good
category all kinds of nuts almonds walnuts and pistachios and
so forth what I mean though by pure nuts though
is be careful not to buy nuts in those kind
of nut mixes which contain sugar and there's also like
candy coated nuts which people might consider nuts these aren't
nuts this is candy or sugar-coated are honey-coated know what
I mean by nuts is just either raw or roasted
with as little salt as possible nut butters can also
be good like almonds or hazelnuts peanut butter I guess
is alright although I think peanuts can can cause reaction
so I usually stay away from peanuts depends of course
on you you can also buy organic pasture-raised eggs they're
more expensive but they're higher quality of course spices are
pretty much all good vinegar is okay hot sauce is
okay mustard real ketchup not heinz ketchup but other kinds
of ketchup which contain lower quantities of sugar you can
even find sugar-free ketchup which tastes actually much better than
Heinz so these are like all your condiments spices you
want to buy organic spices as much as possible as
far as oils the best oils you can buy our
olive oil coconut oil avocado oil flax oil and sesame
oil seaweed can be good olives pickles Cape sauerkraut hummus
you can buy these you can buy kombucha almond milk
and coconut milk are great substitutes for any kind of
dairy that needs to be used in smoothies or dairy
recipes you can even buy almond milk or coconut milk
ice cream if you want to get a little bit
of ice cream into your diet sometimes that's that's good
as far as the kind of grains that you can
eat gluten-free oatmeal is alright quinoa is alright rice and
beans are alright meat and vegetable stocks in cans or
in boxed cartons these are okay although of course ideally
you'd make your own stock but just for convenience yeah
you can get it in a can try to get
cans that are bpa-free wild seafood as much as possible
make it wild rather than farm raised sardines certain versions
of sardines can be pretty good coconut yogurt is a
good substitute for yogurt if that's what you want for
dairy yogurt dark chocolate if it's 80% or higher that's
alright with in moderation because it still contains quite a
bit of sugar you can buy raw honey if you
need a sweetener of some kinds like a sweetener for
your tea or sweetener for some kind of dessert recipe
that you're making or to to scratch that sweet tooth
that you have spring water sparkling waters alright unsweetened tea
is alright green tea is good and as far as
buying pre-made food at the stores sushi is good if
you're into that and whole roasted chicken because usually they
don't screw around too much with the whole roasted chicken
you just buy one of those so that's my list
of the good stuff of course it's much smaller than
the other list and you can see that now you're
working with limitations here and perhaps the biggest limitation is
where you can go as far as restaurant and what
you can eat out because if you apply this list
that I gave you if stuff you can't eat then
basically that eliminates like 95% of all of your restaurant
options if you go to a typical restaurant you look
at their menu 95% of their stuff will contain either
dairy or gluten or corn or sugar or a combination
of all the above so this basically means that you
need to cook most of your meals at home so
get good at doing that perfect that process and then
actually it'll be quite um efficient for you now I
know this might sound depressing and even impossible to follow
these lists that I gave you but let me assure
you that it certainly is possible it just requires vision
and purpose for why you're doing it not just for
a quick little rapid weight loss and this requires a
commitment to healthy living and also it requires a gradual
transition this is not something that you do in a
week or in a month or even in a year
I've been transitioning my diet probably for the last 10
years to fit these lists that I've given you and
at this point in my life is pretty effortless to
sustain I feel pretty good about the food that I
eat I can eat any quantity I food that I
that I want I don't limit myself in quantity at
all the food that I eat I love it tastes
really good and it's great I feel all the conditions
that were worsening with my old diet that those have
been kind of stopped dead in their tracks and that
I've prevented a lot of worsening of my conditions that
could have happened otherwise of course a mistake would be
to try to be a hundred percent perfect and following
all these lists you don't need to be a hundred
percent perfect aim for about 80% of the time that
you're able to execute on this and then leave yourself
some wiggle room 20% for when you need to go
to a restaurant with your friends or when you're traveling
in the airport they don't have a lot of options
so you grab something that's not as healthy although you
know like these days I eat about probably 90% plus
within these guidelines that I'm giving you and then maybe
10% of the time I eat something that I that
I shouldn't eat although I'm really really strict with avoiding
wheat and dairy like I never touched those I haven't
touched those in a couple years and I have made
a commitment that I never will for the rest of
my life I'm never gonna eat a piece of bread
for the rest of my life and I've made peace
with that same thing with dairy I told myself I'm
never gonna eat another piece of cake or some dairy
ice cream again in my entire life and that's that's
the hardest challenge here is to kind of like to
accept the shock of that the first time you try
to think even of making that commitment sigh goddamn that's
gonna be impossible it's like oh man I'm giving up
so much all my favourite food I'm never gonna eat
a piece of pizza again I'm never gonna eat ice
cream again I'm never gonna eat a croissant again or
a donut again and at first it seems kind of
depressing it's like oh I'm loading myself myself so much
why should I be so strict with myself but actually
as you start to implement this you start to see
the benefits in terms of your energy in terms of
your ability with your consciousness and what you can do
especially if you're doing yoga or you're doing meditation or
self-inquiry practice and maybe you taking psychedelics and then you
see just how much better you feel from eliminating these
offenders these worst offenders from your diet I would say
start very slow with this transition and work on eliminating
the worst offenders which is the category of wheat and
dairy those are the two worst by far if you
can ditch those two right there that's huge and also
if you can dish all soda all deserts all coffee
all sugar and all boxed foods this will be huge
and then if you can change all of your vegetables
and all of your meat to be organic that will
be huge so what I recommend is that you you
kind of pick and choose divide and conquer because you
can't do all this at once you're you're very likely
to succumb to to peer pressure and to your hunger
and your cravings so I would say you know work
for a couple of months just to eliminate dairy then
or maybe work for a couple more months to eliminate
wheat and then soda and sugar and just kind of
like divide and conquer like that and then over the
next let's say five years you're gonna be implementing this
plan gradually slowly it's a long term process requiring vision
you see the vision is like why are you doing
this because you really care about your health you care
about your energy levels you care about the quality of
your consciousness and how conscious you're able to be throughout
your entire day you don't like feeling groggy or sleepy
or needing to take a nap and you don't like
dealing with acne and you don't like dealing with all
the autoimmune issues that you're gonna get you don't like
being fat all that sort of stuff but really you
need to do it not for negative reasons but really
for positive reasons for me the positive reasons are that
I've committed my life to the pursuit of consciousness and
I just know the huge difference this makes in my
ability to be conscious for example wheat wheat makes me
very groggy and very sleepy all the time that I
did I eat it and it just sends me to
these spirals of of unconsciousness which I've I've had so
many of those that I'm sick and tired of them
that I would rather never eat wheat again then go
down those spirals again so you got to reach that
kind of point in your own life as far as
eating out at restaurants you're probably not gonna be doing
that nearly as much anymore you can still eat out
at restaurants you just gotta find the right restaurants and
the right items on their menus that you can still
eat but but yeah generally restaurants are bad because the
kind of ingredients that they're serving you just think about
it it's going to be the lowest quality ingredients it's
definitely not going to be organic and they are in
a position where they are incentivized to serve you the
cheapest possible eggs bacon meat and every other kind of
item that you could have on your plate it's gonna
be the cheapest thing that they could have found that
they could have sold you without you looking at it
and sending it back to them basically so be very
very suspicious of restaurant food even especially even if it's
are an expensive restaurant you think that a great steakhouse
which is serving you a $50 steak is serving you
an organic steak no of course not of course not
they're serving you the cheapest steak they can get away
with and still maintain their status as a expensive steak
restaurant as far as traveling goes that's a little tricky
you want to develop some solutions and some options for
how to prepare snacks for yourself when you're at the
airport because the airport has notoriously low quality food so
whenever I go to the airport usually I cut up
a bunch of apples and strawberries and and fruits and
bananas and stuff like that and I make myself a
little pack of snacks which holds me over until I
get to my destination so you got to be able
to plan that ahead so you can definitely find solutions
for that maybe take some almond butter with you you
know high-energy snacks maybe some dark chocolate stuff like that
those are usually very portable and high in calories so
that's basically my list for you that's all the guidelines
the good news is is that you can eat all
these healthy foods that I talked about in unlimited quantities
knock yourself out what you'll notice is that you'll never
be a fad I actually haven't gone to the gym
in about a year and a half until then I
went to the gym every single day pretty much or
at least five five times a week for about ten
years straight and then I just got tired of it
and I stopped because I felt like actually I needed
to recover because I was working out too much and
also I got into consciousness work so I wanted to
focus my time on that so I haven't been go
to the gym lately and I know that I need
to be so I will be doing that in the
future I'm gonna kind of work that back into my
route into my schedule but what has been very interesting
to me is that I used to be 65 pounds
overweight until I started going to the gym and I
thought that it's hey it's going to the gym that's
gonna make me slimmer but actually not so much what
made me slimmer is changing my diet that's what really
mattered the most and I've been able to keep my
weight exactly as it is whether I'm going to the
gym or not going to gym it doesn't matter I'm
always slim in fact people call me skinny now because
I eat foods that are almost impossible to make me
fat because all the stuff that makes you fat I
have a limited from my diet the sugar the dairy
the wheat so what's left fruits and meats you're not
gonna get fat on fruits and meats so that's one
of the upsides here you're never gonna have to step
on a scale again then we have to worry about
your belly again for the rest of your life that's
a pretty cool trade-off because you know a lot of
people waste so much emotional energy worrying about how they
look and I know that I used to do that
a lot too I used to worry every single week
and be like oh I'm getting a little bit fatter
I kind of like trim down I gotta stop eating
the ice cream stop eating the bread stop eating the
pizza you know and then it would always be this
game the sort of yo-yo like back and forth and
back and forth one week I would abstain from pizza
because I thought I was getting a little too fat
and then a month later I slimmed down a little
bit more again fitting into my pants like oh okay
now I can eat a little more pizza so I
go eat the pizza and pig out on pizza and
then it's like again next week I'm too fat I
don't like it I feel bad about myself so it's
just cause constant never-ending cycle and eventually just get sick
and tired of it cuz you know the cycle is
gonna continue for the rest of your life until you
make these systemic changes to your nutrition yes this kind
of diet will cost more it'll probably cost you one
uh well like I would say 50% to 100% more
so your expense for food might double you know if
you've been eating ramen noodles and and crappy sandwiches and
stuff very cheap eggs and meat then yeah your food
costs might double but here's how you got to reframe
that you got to reframe this as a long-term investment
first of all you're gonna save on healthcare down the
road you're gonna save on medicines guarantee you're gonna save
on medicines if you make these changes and you'll save
thousands of dollars you're gonna save money on health insurance
fees you're gonna save money on your doctors fees but
also of course you're gonna have more energy you're gonna
feel better you're gonna be more motivating to be more
conscious so how much is that worth to you to
me that's worth it now of course depending on your
budget I have a pretty good budget so for me
if I double my food budget it doesn't really make
that big of a difference I know people out there
who are tight with money so of course for them
that'll make a huge difference and maybe you can't even
afford that if you're a college student maybe you can't
afford that you're on a tight budget well you can
still find options so in though in that case maybe
you want to avoid the the expensive organic fruits and
vegetables maybe you want to buy inorganic for now until
you get a better job and change that situation but
ultimately you want to reframe this as an investment in
yourself and here's another way to reframe it think of
it this way your grandparents they ate 100% organic food
because 80 years ago there was no inorganic food it
was all pretty much organic food what's happened in the
last 50 years in the food industry has been really
shocking and remarkable all these chemicals all these shortcuts have
been taken by all these food manufacturers and farmers every
possible shortcut every possible way to slice every penny off
of all food costs and this might seem like a
great thing because now food is more affordable but also
the problem is is that your grandparents if you actually
do the math they would spend a pretty significant chunk
of their entire monthly salary just on food whereas today
we spend a much much less so we have more
discretionary spending but the problem of course is that people
waste their discretionary spending on all sorts of stupid stuff
they bought they buy all sorts of stuff they don't
really need but the one thing they really do need
which is good nutrition they don't provide to themselves because
before that was automatic in your grandparents days all they
have to do is just like raise chickens and cows
and and some apples pick apples off a tree and
it was fine they could eat that stuff and it
was all organic and and grass-fed and and great but
today you got to pay for that that's no longer
automatic you don't get that at the restaurant you don't
get that at McDonald's and you don't get it in
your basic grocery store you gotta like find the better
grocery stores which cater to people who actually care about
their health and unconsciousness so yes it costs a little
bit more but still in the overall picture it's still
gonna be cheaper than it was for your grandparents food
is still relatively inexpensive in our society which is one
of the luxuries of modern society is that it it
has become more and more affordable compared to in the
past but there is the danger in that you take
it for granted and you go for the cheapest cheapest
stuff and you try to save every single penny and
in the end you end up shooting yourself in the
foot and in the end it'll cost you much more
in the long run think about how much more you
can accomplish at your job how many more promotions are
gonna get how much better you're gonna be at following
your life purpose at running your business at not being
sick if you put this diet into place that will
pay for itself in the years to come and you're
gonna need some new recipes maybe half a dozen to
a dozen new recipes solid ones that you can rely
on every single week that use healthy ingredients that are
quick to cook up don't take a lot of time
and hassle and that store pretty well in your refrigerator
then you can heat it up and then eat it
all week long I've already shared some of those recipes
with you in the past I've shared my soup recipe
I've shared some recipes for four smoothies and salads and
in the future I'll continue to probably share more of
those as I develop more myself because these days I
cook a lot more at home and as a result
I have to get more creative with the recipes because
otherwise I get bored of them so I'm always on
the lookout for new healthy quick efficient recipes that store
well in my fruit in my fridge so that's basically
it I hope you can see the benefits of this
this is something that you really need to strategize about
and slowly and methodically put into place in your life
if you're college students this is especially important for you
if you're in high school and a lot of people
watch me who are even younger than college students you're
in high school this is especially important it's really hard
for me to emphasize just how much health will become
a nuisance for you if you don't get your nutrition
right when you're young when you're under 25 years old
you can more or less take it for granted and
still come out unscathed after you get into your 30s
that's not gonna fly anymore all that will come back
to haunt you and watch out it could really be
a major obstacle in your ability to self actualize to
run your career to run your business to follow your
life purpose so just ask yourself you know do you
really want to take that risk or are you willing
to sacrifice pizzas so that you never have to worry
about this risk any more in your life I think
that's a pretty good trade-off I've sacrificed speeds along I
don't know when the last time was that I ate
a pizza years probably five years or more that I've
eaten a slice of pizza and it's alright you get
used to it you get used to it you find
other tasty recipes and then really you don't think about
it ever again I don't have to hold myself back
it's not like I'm walking through the grocery stores like
Oh Pizza a lot of slice of pizza rarely very
very rarely I might get that but then I just
quickly throw it out of my mind and I don't
really give in to it because there's a larger vision
at work so that's what you need to pull this
off alright I'm done here please click like button for
me share this with a friend and comes look at
actualize Dorian's my website I've got the blog there the
forum there the life purpose course there the book list
I have some nutrition books on my book lists that
are worthwhile for you to read and actually I do
recommend that you read a dozen or so different nutrition
books so that the medical literature and all the anecdotes
that you read from those nutrition books they can penetrate
into your mind and they can they can really shock
you into like oh I'm really headed for a catastrophe
if I don't take care of this and if if
you're like me then maybe you already had a few
of those catastrophes maybe you already have a few of
these diseases some autoimmune disease some hypothyroid thing or some
arthritis thing or whatever well this is your chance to
actually take those and sort of Aikido your weaknesses into
your strengths so one of the good things about the
fact that I grew up in such an environment with
such bad food and bad nutrition is that now I'm
still relatively young in my early 30s I have basically
solved my nutrition dilemma for the rest of my life
whereas I think that if if I hadn't grown up
in such toxic environment I would have been slowly poisoning
myself for years and years and years and years and
years to come so sometimes your greatest weaknesses actually lead
to your biggest lessons your biggest shifts in consciousness and
then from those you mature and you grow and you
actually become wise beyond your ears so stick around with
me I'll have probably more recipes for you in the
future like I said of some of this healthy quick
efficient stuff that I that I make for myself and
so I'll probably be posting those not immediately next week
but like throughout the year sprinkle those in here and
there you
