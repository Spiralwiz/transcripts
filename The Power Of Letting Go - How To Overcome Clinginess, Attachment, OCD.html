[Music] in this episode we're gonna be talking about the
power of letting go how to overcome clinginess attachment and
obsessive-compulsive disorders I'm gonna share with you a very simple
technique that's all this episode is it's just a simple
technique lot a lot of complicated theory here just a
technique but this one technique if you apply it in
your life will transform your whole life but the key
to this technique is that you don't just do it
once there's not a bunch of work that if I
sit down and do right now rather what I want
you to do is I want you to take this
on as a technique for the rest of your life
that you do a little bit of every single day
just for a few seconds for a few minutes every
single day and then you make a habit out of
it and then if you do that that's what will
transform your life this is not something that you can
just run off and do five hours of this is
something that you just have you have to do it
daily over years and then it'll transform your life so
the technique is very simple you identify something within your
experience anything and you let it go that's the whole
technique you let go of desires needs attachments frustrations emotions
grudges habits thoughts obsessions and so forth that's it but
here's a little trick that I'll give you and I'll
give you a list of examples of how to apply
this in him in a minute here but here's what
I want to do I want you to turn this
into a game that you play with yourself from now
on all through the rest of life you're gonna be
playing this little game you're gonna be challenging yourself to
let stuff go just for the sake of letting it
go not because it's gonna get you a bunch of
money or not because you're gonna feel super happy and
excited about it but just you're practicing letting go you're
flexing that letting go muscle and it's a muscle that
most people have not consciously used in their life because
nobody taught you that you could just let stuff go
that's that's a huge realization for most people it's like
what you can just let go of anger you can
just let go of sadness you can just let go
of some neurotic compulsion you have and the answer is
yes but you have to practice so you gonna be
playing this little game with yourself and I'm gonna see
how far you can push it some days you're gonna
try to let go something big that might seem like
Critias crazy that you couldn't let go of and then
other days you're just gonna be mostly letting go of
little things and don't worry about not being able to
let go of everything you try to let go of
some stuff is gonna be big and it's gonna be
too powerful inside your mind and you're gonna be stuck
on it and then you won't be able let it
go like if you're feeling very depressed yeah maybe you
won't be able to let it go at first and
that's okay mostly gonna be starting with small stuff so
here's a list of examples for you and remember the
reason I'm trying to frame this has like a little
game that you play with yourself I don't want this
to be some giant sure that you're forcing yourself to
do some deliberate method you just have to like make
it natural make it organic make it something that you
do like when you're standing in line waiting for for
the cashier or at the grocery store or when you're
pumping gas the gas station got nothing to do instead
of checking your phone just play a little game for
30 seconds for 60 seconds of letting something go maybe
you don't like the smell of the gasoline let it
go and so here are some examples on top of
that one there's an itch on your face normally you
would want to scratch it or you would have some
opinion or judgment about it like oh it's this isn't
good why is my face sitting here what you do
is you notice it and that's one of the keys
to this technique is that before you can let something
go you first have to feel it and notice that
it's a thing at all this is consciousness work a
little bit of consciousness work so you have to rather
than just instinctively scratching an itch the way that you
normally would do here you like you have to first
pause and notice okay there's an itch and then you
have to notice that old there's an automatic reaction it's
gonna usually happen I'm gonna scratch it in here you
just let it go you notice that you have this
sort of desire to scratch and that's the thing that
you let go or let's say you're at a restaurant
you order your food and something about your food doesn't
come out right they get part of your order wrong
normally you would want to sighs the waitress complained get
it changed blah-blah-blah-blah-blah in your mind there'd be this whole
thing about like oh oh my food isn't the way
I wanted to this sucks it's ruin my night whatever
just let it go but again you have to catch
yourself right because because all of these patterns that are
gonna be letting go up here they're all gonna be
very instinctual and habitual and automatic and you're gonna execute
them so fast that a lot of times you won't
be able to catch yourself soon enough you'll start to
complain before you even realize that you're complaining and then
that's that's when you notice and then the next time
let it go you don't need to be perfect at
this just because you know you're gonna have hundreds of
these opportunities throughout the day I'm not saying you have
to capitalize on every single opportunity I'm just saying a
few per day that's all a few per day very
easy a child can do it in fact if you
have children you should teach them this technique let's say
someone cuts you off in traffic when you're driving to
work normally you would like have a story in your
mind about oh this is a bad guy and how
could he do this and what an [ __ ]
what what bad city I live in the drivers suck
here all this just notice that and then let that
go and when you let something go what happens is
that you return to a state of peace and just
a state of being a state of calmness you're no
longer agitated by that thing that was bothering you or
let's say you're listening to the radio in your car
there and some song comes on that you hate normally
you would complain or maybe you would even want to
quickly switch the station or judge the song just try
it letting it go let the song play let go
of your desire to need to change the song or
to complain about the Sun just let it go or
let's say somebody criticizes you in some online comment on
some forum via Twitter or even in person normally you
would get defensive about it and you would try to
justify yourself to that person and bla bla bla bla
get an argument with them stop yourself and just let
it go just let it go as if nobody even
criticized you like that just as simple as that or
let's say you have the urge to punch someone in
the face because they pissed you off notice it and
let that go and I'm not saying here per se
that you're gonna suppress anything or repress anything or ignore
everything I'm telling you to let it go which is
a it's a distinct letting go is a distinct thing
from suppression and repression and ignoring so here you notice
the desire or the tendency and you let it go
which is a conscious choice that you make see that
it's different than repression or denial or ignorance in which
literally means ignore ants to ignore something ignorance here you're
noticing it and you're making a conscious choice to let
it go and you're not even you're not even thinking
so far as to say like well I shouldn't punch
this guy in the face so that's why I should
let it go no no no I'm not giving you
any kind of like selfish motive for why you should
let it go rather in this game that you're playing
you're just letting it go just to see if you
can let it go that's it that's all you care
about in this game or let's say you have some
craving for some ice cream that normally you would indulge
and here you just let it go like yeah okay
I have a craving for ice cream right now can
I let it go yeah I can let that go
and just let it go and return to a state
of peace the way you were before you had the
craving or you get a sexual craving you get the
urge to jerk off just let it go now again
I'm not saying you have to never jerk off ever
again in your life that's not what I'm saying I'm
saying just let it go once you probably get the
the urge to jerk off multiple times a day I'm
saying just let go of one of those and not
every single day I don't make a habit out of
it just let it go you know randomly maybe let
go of it a few times a month let it
go the rest of times jerk off I don't care
let's say feel guilty today for not having meditated normally
you would guilt yourself over this and you would feel
bad and you have a whole dialogue that you go
into just notice the guilt and let it go or
let's say your girlfriend or boyfriend or spouse does something
to displease you they make a mistake or they say
something nasty to you because they they were in a
bad mood just let it go as if they didn't
even say it let's say that someone insults you just
let it go let's say you see some injustice in
the news on the newspaper and on TV or whatever
in the mainstream news do you see some some new
outrage normally you get outraged by this just let it
go even if it's something important let's say something important
to you like you care about the environment and you
turn on the news and there's some horrible news about
the environment and normally you get outraged by in all
those greedy corporations those oil companies you know they're screwing
us over and blah blah blah let just let it
go now again I'm not saying that now you never
have any environmental concerns again in your life or that
you ignore the problem of climate change and deny that
it's real I'm not saying any of that I'm just
saying let this instance of it go you see because
this this notion of of climate change and environmentalism this
is an abstraction in reality what happens is that throughout
your day you have these little micro moments of you
notice stuff in the news and you get outraged by
it or annoyed by it or you get judgmental I
want you to start to notice those micro moments and
let those go let's say you feel a discomfort in
your body like you're sitting for a long time your
ass is starting to hurt or your leg is uncomfortable
and normally you'd want to move just let it go
well let's say you have a wish for something like
you really wish for a for a brand new house
or you really wish for a new job or you
really wish for a new vacation or something like that
just let it go which again is not the same
thing as saying like throw away all of your dreams
and just work your lame nine-to-five job for the rest
of your life and don't improve I'm not saying that
I'm just saying just notice when you're wishing for something
and throughout the day you have your daydreams and you're
wishing for something just let one of those go at
least once let's say you're hungry in the morning let
it go let's say you're excited about something let that
excitement go like let's say you're excited about meeting up
with your girlfriend or boyfriend because you're going on a
road trip or something and you're excited and just let
it go that doesn't mean you let go of the
road trip you'll do the road trip it's gonna come
but just let go that excitement let's say you're bored
sitting in class or sitting at work waiting for somebody
let go of that boredom or if you're meditating and
you're bored let go of the boredom let's say you
have the urge to check your phone you know that's
a huge OCD habit that most of us have these
days because we're so we're so conditioned to check our
phone all the time let that go at least a
couple of times a day just let go of that
urge to check your phone that doesn't mean you never
check your phone you can still check your phone just
check it instead of checking it 25 times a day
check it 24 times 23 times and do that consciously
so actually consciously feel that urge to to reach for
your phone to check your text messages or whatever and
just let that go you're sitting in a room you're
feeling hot or cold and you're annoyed by that let
that go you're too sweaty let that go and speaking
of OCD you know there's a lot of different Oh
CDs that people have these days and a lot of
them are very minor this technique will work for big
OCD stuff or a little OCD stuff like maybe you're
a grammar nazi you're reading something and some you see
some grammar mistake that somebody wrote online somewhere in some
news article and normally you get like oh ha you
got annoyed by it just let it go that's really
the key to to overcoming OCD is just noticing that
urge and then letting it go and then doing that
over and over and over and over again of course
if you got some terrible OCD it's gonna be difficult
to do you won't be able to just do it
on your first attempt will probably take you hundreds of
attempts but each time you do that you chip away
at it next example let's say a co-worker does something
wrong at work and normally you'd want to criticize and
um I'm out about it just let it go let's
say somebody is being ignorant and normally you'd want to
you know also chide this person out for their foolishness
and their ignorance just let it go allow ignorant to
be ignorance without having it affect you let's say you
notice that you judge somebody for something let that go
like maybe you you're driving down the road you see
a poor person panhandling for four quarters and normally you
would judge that person say oh look at this dirty
bum why doesn't he get a job bla bla bla
bla bla just let that go or maybe you see
that that person you feel guilty you feel guilty that
all society isn't doing enough to help these poor homeless
people let that go let's say you're in school or
in college and you just you don't feel like doing
your homework today let that go let's say you're obsessing
about what somebody thinks about you you want to gain
their approval let that go catch yourself thinking about how
others are perceiving you when you're out in public you're
at a party or at a club or at a
bar talking to a girl talking to a guy whatever
you're nervous let that go let's say a friend of
yours snubs you let that go let's say somebody doesn't
show up on time for a business meeting or you're
just meeting friend a friend for coffee or for drinks
and they're 10 minutes late it's 20 minutes late just
let it go just to see if you can do
it let's say you feel inadequate you're at work and
there's somebody at work who's way better than you more
experienced has more Skills more intelligent and you feel inadequate
about this let that go let's see let's say in
the morning you look in the mirror and you see
a pimple on your face and normally you'd be annoyed
by this pimple you try to hide it you try
to change it you try to ask yourself what's going
on why did this people come where'd it come from
let it go or let's say you're worried about how
you look whether you're a guy or a girl whatever
we all have our own insecurities about our looks you
don't like your face you like your body you don't
like your whatever let it go let's say you feel
like quitting on some project let that feeling go let's
say you're rushing to be on time you're kind of
late and you're rushing to get to work rushing to
to jump in your car rushing to drive through some
yellow light let that go let's say you've got some
worries about your finances let it go let's say you
feel some tension in your body there's some tension in
your hands in your jaw and your legs and your
belly feel that tension notice it and let it go
let's say you have the urge to lie because it
would be beneficial for you to lie in this situation
like at work maybe there's an opportunity to lie to
a client order to get the sale let go of
that desire to lie or let's say you have the
desire to cheat or to steal there's many different ways
you can cheat in life many different ways in which
you can steal stuff let that go or let's say
you have the desire to manipulate somebody let that go
but of course that's tricky because in order to let
that go you have to first be aware of your
own manipulations how you manipulate people see most people don't
understand how much they manipulate others all the time so
you see for this technique to work you really have
to be more aware of all of your actions throughout
the day on a sort of a micro level which
is part of the power of this technique let's say
you want to have the last word in some argument
let that go let's say you have a need for
for this thing to be perfect whatever you're creating whatever
you're working on some work of art some music that
you're composing or something at work that you're doing or
some some book that you're writing or some you know
some article you're writing they're gonna publish you just want
it to be so perfect let that go let's say
you want to impress somebody you want to please somebody
so they like you let that go let's say there's
some physical pain in your body that you're resisting let
that go or what if you are distracting yourself like
you sit down to do some work you sit down
to write something you sit down to do your homework
or you sit down to do some self-improvement work like
you're journaling in your journal and then there's a desire
to distract yourself with some television some video games some
looking at your phone some internet whatever notice that distraction
and let that go let's say you feel self-conscious in
public let that go let's say you feel bad for
doing something wrong for making a mistake at work or
whatever let that go or if you feel embarrassed let
that go or if you're confused maybe you're watching some
of my videos and I leave you confused sometimes let
that go let's say you feel threatened by somebody else
let it go let's say you smell something disgusting in
your refrigerator or wherever let that go now okay I
don't mean that you don't ever clean your refrigerator I
just mean let go of that that disgust let's say
you feel depressed try letting that go and also it
can be very powerful to just try to sometimes let
go of really big things things that you would normally
think couldn't be let go of and usually of course
these big things can't just be like oh of in
a second or a minute but you can still try
and it helps like for example try to let go
of your entire point of view on a matter or
your entire worldview or your entire ideology as a whole
like if you're a conservative try to just let go
of conservativism that's a tall order to fill for many
people or if you're a liberal try to let go
of liberalism just like have you tried actually do it
try it even just let it go for five minutes
and see if that sticks and then you could you
could pick it back up five minutes later but try
letting go for 5 min to see the problem when
people get stuck on ideology is that they're so stuck
on it that they don't want to let it go
try letting go of your entire religion like if you're
Muslim try to let go of Islam for five minutes
completely let it go as though you don't believe in
it at all or if you're Christian completely let go
of Christianity as though you don't believe in it at
all become an atheist for five minutes can you do
that can you see that if you can't do that
can you see how wrong that is now see here
religious fundamentalists and these types they'll say olio but but
I really believe in this stuff now you're you're asking
me to go against my faith and against my tradition
and against my morals and all this but you see
what is your faith in your morals and your God
what is it worth if you can't let it go
for five minutes if you're so stuck on these ideas
and beliefs and this ideology see you've confused it from
the real thing you've confused your your ideology for actual
true love and compassion and for the reality you've confused
that see real God doesn't mind if you let go
of the idea of God for five minutes can real
God's not threatened by that Allah is not threatened by
you not believing in Allah for five minutes if you
think he is then you don't really understand Allah and
you should you should Intuit that there's something wrong with
you if you can't do that this doesn't make you
some atheist or some-some devil or some nihilist this ability
to let things go this is critical to all true
religion to true spirituality this is what a healthy mind
can do an unhealthy mind cannot do this which is
the whole reason why you adopt and cling to this
religion or to this ideology or it's this political position
try to let go of your national identity like if
you think you're American just let it go pretend that
you're not American for five minutes see how that feels
see there's actually what you'll discover if you do let
go is that there's actually no problem whatsoever and this
is something you'll notice like if you let go being
Christian there's no problem nothing bad is gonna happen to
you if you let go being Muslim nothing Bad's gonna
happen to you if you let go of being American
or or white or black or whatever nothing bad is
gonna happen to you but the whole problem is that
you're so scared you're so attached to these identities into
these ideas and it's so habitual that you're afraid to
let it go even for five minutes see but that's
just a story you have in your mind about all
the fears and all the bad stuff like you're gonna
go to hell if you let it go no not
at all so just this'n trained yourself through this method
you're gonna train yourself over the months and years that
letting go is perfectly safe normal and actually very healthy
and that all of the fear-mongering that your mind does
about all the stuff that's gonna go wrong if you
do let go then see you're gonna disprove that not
through theory but through direct experience you're gonna see that
oh well I've let this go and I've let that
go look at how much stuff I've let go throughout
my life and nothing bad has really happened to me
so therefore letting go isn't bad in fact actually it's
good it's the best good it's the highest good and
lastly I would urge you to experiment with letting go
of prized physical objects like maybe you have a favorite
pen a favorite mug a favorite t-shirt a favorite set
of shoes a favorite hat it was a small stuff
I'm not asking you to let go of your of
your luxury yacht and by letting go of it also
notice I don't mean that you throw this object away
that you never use it I mean you notice your
attachment and love for this object and you let that
attachment go which means that if you have a lucky
hat that you wear all the time maybe one day
you don't wear it you just let that go and
you even let go of the idea that you need
this hat around you and then somehow it's important to
you or somehow that if you lost this hat you
would be sad or you just let that let that
whole thing go as though this hat doesn't matter to
you anymore and maybe you know try with your car
as well if you have some sports car that you
love and try this with prize ideas and theories that
you have maybe you have some scientific theory that you
you know you little pet theory about quantum mechanics let
that go or you have your little pet fear about
evolution let that go and so you can see now
all the different ways that this technique work those are
my examples for you now of course you're wondering Billy
oh how how do I let it go you make
it sound so easy well it is that easy just
let it go you notice the thing and then you
just drop it and what helps me to do this
and here's a little trick for you if you want
to know how is actually visualize yourself dropping it and
entering a state of peace and the way that I
sometimes do this is I almost do it like I
imagine sort of a role model in my mind and
usually I think back to like a Greek philosopher like
Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know I think about like
if something bad happened to Socrates how would he react
to it would he get like all [ __ ]
dramatic about it and [ __ ] and moan and
complain about what do you just be like oh well
okay screw it doesn't matter and just like return to
a state of calm that's how I imagine Socrates would
react you know if something happened in his life so
just literally imagine that and imagine that you're that person
just letting it go and you don't have to use
Socrates use whoever you want you want Jesus you want
Mohammed you want the Buddha you can use that you
want Martin Luther King you want Gandhi you know use
those people whoever you admire some stoic person you want
to think of like Arnold Schwarzenegger as your kind of
role model of stoicism uh yeah think about that like
what would Arnold really like let's say he's on the
movie set and something something happens like someone scratches his
car and he's on the movie set what do you
think he would care would he be like at all
dramatic about it or would he be just like ah
who cares no you wouldn't care right or at least
that's what we like to imagine maybe he does care
I don't know maybe he's a drama queen but yeah
so you it's sort of like you're training yourself to
adopt a little bit of this attitude of stoicism but
you're not you're not really bearing the pain of it
I'm not really asking you to endure some terrible pain
I'm asking you to actually let it go that's a
distinction that's this distinct to let something go means that
it stops painting you like see there's a difference between
if i insult you and then you just you take
the insult personally and then it's painting you but then
you're just kind of like holding it in and you're
not saying anything you're just kinda like closing your mouth
right but inside of you it's like I need to
get back at him he insulted me like it's like
you haven't let it go at that point even though
you're repressing to let it go is like oh why
is this thing even affecting me at all and just
imagine letting it go and then that becomes the case
now of course sometimes you'll imagine letting it go but
then your mind will get stuck on it and it'll
come right back at you again so you might let
it go for five seconds but then it hits you
again because you know the mind gets in these cycles
and vortices and that's exactly what this obsessive compulsive disorder
is a sort of like this cycle that you can't
break out of because you're so habituated to it and
literally it's almost like a computer porn name that they
get stuck on a loop and it feels like your
mind is doing that as well well that's exactly right
your mind gets stuck on these things and especially if
you spent years feeding these these cycles these cycles can
get very strong and they can get difficult to break
so just practice practice practice practice now the other objection
people have yours is this butBut Leo if I let
it go then I won't get what I want let
that go let go of the need to get what
you want be chill trust that the universe will bring
you what you need in the long run and that
you know you don't need to be neurotic to get
it this requires developing some some confidence in the power
of letting go trust that letting go will actually make
you a more powerful person and it will this is
a powerful principle I'm teaching you a powerful spiritual technique
here really this is a technique of detachment detachment is
counterintuitive letting go is very counterintuitive because the ego thinks
that by clinging and attaching to things that it will
get more see the ego is always needy it needs
money it needs sex it needs food it needs ice
cream it needs to delation it needs excitement and needs
to feel warm or it needs to feel cold because
it's too hot or whatever and so it always needs
needs needs and it feels like it needs to grab
and cling on everything to kind of get its way
to survive and here we're we're going directly against this
is a counterintuitive move we're trying to teach your ego
to realize that oh I don't need to live life
like that to be satisfied in fact I'll never be
satisfied if I live life like that that's a neurotic
way to live this teaches you confidence that teaches you
poise this teaches you a little bit of detachment and
stoicism the other question people have here is believe if
I let go how will I get stuff done and
this is where it's counterintuitive what I'm suggesting is that
actually you'll be better at getting stuff done by letting
stuff go like you might wonder if you're an artist
you get a bit obsessive and perfectionistic about your art
you want to be perfect and see if I tell
you to just let it go you might say well
leo but but I need to be perfectionist because if
I'm not perfectionistic in my work then my work is
my art is not going to be as beautiful and
as perfect as it is and what I'm telling you
is that no actually it's the opposite it's your perfectionism
and your artistic neuroticism which is getting in the way
of you making better art the best art is made
in a in a relaxed state when you're in a
relaxed State creative ideas come to you you get inspired
and you're in a flow state whereas when you're neurotic
and you're you're trying to force it to be perfect
that's precisely the thing that will make it imperfect the
other objection people have here is this one but Leo
won't this make me a cold-hearted monster letting stuff go
it's like you're trying to train me to be this
Android that doesn't care about anything as it isn't affected
by anything and I won't be emotional I won't be
able to feel you're trying to like make me dead
inside especially women can have this objection because of course
women value emotions more women are run by emotions more
and to women it feels like when we talk about
detaching from emotions that feels like we're becoming hyper rational
or logical or disconnected from feeling no that's not what
I'm saying it's the opposite what I'm saying is that
you feel into it you're gonna be more capable of
feeling this is actually gonna help you to open your
heart and to be able to be more loving and
compassionate because you're gonna be less clingy and less needy
so you can still feel emotions you can still be
run by emotions at times but also I want you
to get good at just letting it go let go
of emotions this will make your emotions this will actually
elevate the quality of your emotions your emotions will become
more spiritual more sort of metaphysical and more detached in
a good way not in a bad way if you
practice this technique you won't be as run by your
emotions but you're still gonna be able to feel and
even feel more deeply because you're practicing being aware of
how you're feeling that's how helping you also I just
want to warn you that remember that I'm not saying
you have to let go of these things forever just
on this one particular occasion I'm not saying if to
go around for the rest your life feeling hungry just
because you have hunger pip hunger pains you know most
the time when you feel hungry feed yourself but sometimes
let go of the hunger I'm also not telling you
to never enjoy pleasure and I'm not saying that you
need to feel bad for indulgences when you indulgence in
some some sinful pleasure and I'm not saying that you
need to stop fixing problems like if there's a problem
in your life fix that problem I'm not saying to
ignore and deny and repress issues like for example if
if some co-worker is is committing fraud at work and
you notice that I could tell you to let it
go and you could let that go but I'm also
I don't mean that you just like let that person
keep committing fraud or that like if your boyfriend is
cheating on you then you just like let that go
and then you're just like don't tell him anything you
don't confront him and you just let him keep cheating
I don't mean that I mean that let go of
that hurt that you feel from being cheated on let
that go of course that's gonna be very difficult to
let go and practice but try to let it go
at least for a minute let it go even if
you do pick it right back up a minute later
I mean then you can still have a conversation you
can confront the person about it you see so letting
go of these emotions and feelings and compulsions doesn't necessarily
mean that you then don't do anything about the issue
in fact this is a common problem people have is
that people are such animals they are so run by
their knee-jerk emotions without any separation between that and getting
stuff done that over time over the decades they they
train themselves to believe that in life the only way
you can survive and get stuff done is when you're
run like an animal by your emotions so it's like
leo but how am I gonna close the sale if
I'm unable to manipulate the client well there's ways to
do sales without minute billion clients anyone said well but
leo how am I gonna deal with my co-workers usually
I'm angry at them and the only way I get
it work out of them is because I'm angry and
I'm pissed off and I yell at them and that's
how I get my work done because you know they're
making mistakes all the time and if I'm not pissed
off at their mistakes then the works gonna be bad
well the problem is is that you need to find
a more resourceful way a more conscious way to deal
with with your employees there you see anger sure it
might work but it's only gotten you this far now
how do you get to the next level not through
anger anger is not a very effective way to get
stuff done so you can still be very effective in
fact you will be more effective by being detached that's
the whole point but people are skeptical of this but
I'm not asking you to trust me I'm asking you
to try and to experiment run a scientific experiment in
your life through this process and prove to yourself through
direct empirical evidence that being detached is a better way
to live and a more resourceful way to live and
you will be happier in the long run and you
will actually get more stuff done and the last warning
I'll give you here is also this you can let
go of fear letting go of fear is important it's
a very common emotion we have as fear in various
kinds of situations but when you letting go of fear
you have to distinguish carefully between fear and caution so
if you're in a truly dangerous physically dangerous situation letting
go of fear you know don't make the mistake of
like if you're if you're in a forest with a
grizzly bear you confront a grizzly bear and then you
just like let it go like no in that situation
you need to also be cautious you don't want to
be foolish so sometimes fear is alerting you to a
legitimate threat to your survival but most of the time
your fears are just overblown as they say false appearances
appearing real false expectations appearing real so yeah let go
of the fear but also you can still be cautious
you don't need to be filled with the emotion of
fear to be cautious about something all right like I
don't need to be terrified of walking off a cliff
to not walk off a cliff I can be cautious
around cliffs without being paranoid or filled with the physical
sensation of fear right so that's that's different feel I
mean a fear feels a certain distinctive way in your
body and then just being cautious feels different is caution
it's not so much an emotion caution is more of
like you're conscious that there's a threat here and you're
gonna be careful about it but you're not reacting to
some sort of chemicals in your body so make that
distinction what is neuroticism neuroticism essentially is holding on to
something and not being able or willing to let it
go you're clenching onto something that's essentially what neuroticism is
and we have we all have a lot of that
in our lives so try to find those areas where
you're neurotic and let that go now of course you're
not gonna want to because what keeps you from letting
go fear you're afraid of what will happen and also
a sort of discomfort you don't want to leave your
comfort zone it's almost like you're holding this little baby
blanket that you're comfortable with and you don't want to
let it go well the solution to that is to
practice letting it go one final warning though this is
where it gets a little tricky is as you're practicing
this technique be careful about becoming neurotic about letting go
so you might start to guilt yourself about like oh
well I had some fear a minute ago and I
didn't let it go and like all right now I'm
feeling hungry oh I need to let that go and
then next minute that's something else is happening I gotta
let that go and you're always just trying to let
everything go and then you're feeling bad because you're not
able to let it all go you see how the
neurotic that is so let go of doing that let
go of needing to let go use this technique sporadically
don't try to like be obsessive about it and do
it every single time because you'll drive yourself crazy make
it natural and organic your power as a human being
is directly proportional to your ability to let go I
hope you realize that letting go this is a superpower
really weak people don't know how to let go neurotic
people don't know how to let go crazy people don't
know how to let go ideological people fundamentalists and these
types zealots they don't know how to let stuff go
people who get into bar fights why do bar fights
happen simply because the guy's not able to let it
go you're not able to let go of an insult
now as you're practicing all this for a long time
you will struggle with certain things you're not gonna be
able to let go because you've clung to them for
so long but practice anyways practice on smaller things other
things you don't need to be successful at all letting
go attempts and it's gonna take courage for you to
let go of certain things like maybe you have this
impulse to control your children to tell them what to
do to tell them what to wear to you know
this sort of overbearing micromanaging over micromanaging parent mode that
parents go into especially mothers with their children try letting
that go now that one's gonna be difficult because of
course you know you have a lot riding on your
children you've invested so much in your children you love
them so much and you have you know you think
you know better than them and you think you know
exactly what they should be doing it takes courage to
let go in that situation until let your child even
if they make a mistake let them make that mistake
or with a co-worker you don't see that takes courage
not to micromanage at first this technique when you try
it it's gonna seem kind of weak and it's almost
gonna seem likely oh why did you even spend an
hour talking about this this isn't a worthwhile technique tell
me something more interesting tell me something more powerful this
seems kind of pointless or it might seem impossible it
might seem like leo but I can't let go of
my children I can't let go of my car I
can't let go of my job I can't let go
of some terrible disease or some doctor you know gives
me some terrible diagnose and years of practice before you're
able to let go of really big stuff like that
but since you gonna be practicing this technique for the
rest of your life a little bit every single day
from now on don't worry you'll get there there's no
rush just keep practicing a little stuff at first eventually
you'll get so good at this technique that it'll go
from just the the mundane little stuff that you let
go to like big existential letting goes and eventually what
we're trying to get you to is getting you to
the point where you let go of needing to be
alive you stop caring if you're alive that's the key
thing you want to let go eventually you will let
go of your life story you will let go of
self involvement you will let go of thinking and internal
dialogue you will let go of worrying and fear you
will let go of physical pain you will let go
of major attachments to two people and things in your
life like you'll let go of your entire career you'll
let go of your business you'll even let go of
things like your health and your physical appearance and you
will have to let these things go you see you
don't really have a choice in the matter because you
will lose absolutely everything that you have in life that
you cling to everything including your physical appearance your youth
your your parents your girlfriends and boyfriends your marriage your
career your job your money everything and you're gonna lose
your life so really the option here is will you
let it go willingly and consciously or will you be
unconscious and will you resist the process of letting go
because those are the only two choices there's no choice
you're gonna have to let go of everything in your
life because you're gonna die see so let's prepare you
for that now see if you invest a little bit
every single day it's almost like investing into a retirement
account just like that you know they show you those
charts where like if you start to invest into your
401k 20 years or 30 years before you go and
retire then the the compound interest leads these exponential results
at firstly to the first 10 years of investing you
don't really get much out of it but then the
last 10 years you get this massive spike in your
wealth that's exactly what's gonna happen with this technique so
keep using it and then the really big payoffs these
really big items and ultimately letting go of your life
that's gonna come towards the very end and that's where
the real fruits of it will come and you'll notice
that you know as you do psychedelics as you meditate
as you do yoga and various other kinds of techniques
as you do spiritual work as you do self-actualization work
you'll notice that this technique will come in handy in
all those different areas and then it'll come in handy
in your family life it'll come in handy with business
it'll come in handy with with your health it'll come
in handy with your finances you'll see that this technique
is so universal and so powerful precisely because it's so
simple and so fundamental you see because all everything that's
happening to you all these things whether it's in business
or in family or at school or at work or
whatever it has to go through you through your mind
and through your emotional system so if you're able to
let go of stuff in your mind and let go
of stuff in your body various tensions and emotions in
this way like yeah that's a superpower because that is
the the the Nexus or the the bottleneck through which
all of life comes at you from so if you're
able to master that bottleneck and you're able to be
the gatekeeper who is able to regulate that rather than
having stuff just to cost you from the outside that's
you taking control of your life that's you taking responsibility
for your emotions and for your reactions and rather than
reacting now you're able to respond and you're able to
get some separation between the occurrence of the event and
how you act that that gap it could even just
be a 10-second gap is is what makes you a
much a much wiser human being because in that 10
second get that's where the wisdom comes from and by
not being attached to something by not being needy about
it that's also where you can muster wisdom and then
eventually if you do this you'll master this technique and
you'll become invincible literally invincible but the only way you'll
get there is if you can have enough vision to
see that this technique can be powerful and that doing
it a little bit every single day over the years
is something that you're committed to something you you believe
in something you find valuable this is an investment you
have to make into your future so I recommend that
you do just that and that you return to this
technique over and over again throughout the rest of your
life is not going to be any point in your
life in the future where this technique won't be useful
to you it can be useful to you every single
day and every single year from now to middle age
to old age and to your very death alright that's
it please click the like button for me and come
check out actual Asador gasps my website on the website
you'll find exclusive free content and resources videos that I
share blogs insights resources links to things research studies research
articles and papers that I sometimes link this is powerful
stuff you'll only find it there come check it out
on my blog come hang out on the forum ask
questions we have some new sub forums that were open
recently we have one about politics and society and environment
and then we have another one which is just purely
about sharing high consciousness resources there's some great resources they're
going to be developing as a community there we're sharing
videos articles research links books websites just a few of
those resources just a few of the right resources at
the right time in your life is enough to change
the whole trajectory of your life so come check those
out and also I encourage you to contribute that's it
for this one let me just say one final word
which is that all of the actualized theory is here
to convince you to do the practice without the practices
the theory has no teeth it's okay if you just
watch these videos for educational purposes or even for entertainment
for a few months or even for a year but
after a certain point you've watched enough of them where
you start to see you know the big picture starts
to shine through at least a bit at least conceptually
at least in theory and now you're starting to see
that man this could really be powerful imagine if I
started to do all the stuff Leo talks about imagine
if all of the things he talks about weren't just
theories but I felt them in my life and as
if I started doing even half the techniques he says
what would my life look like three years from now
five years from now ten years from now this is
how you have to think to be successful in life
nothing in life can really be achieved by thinking a
month in advance and thinking like well but yeah Leo
I've done some yoga for a month and I didn't
really get any results so I quit you can't you
can't succeed in life this way you need to have
a much longer time horizon you need to have more
commitment to to these practices if you see the value
of the theory create the vision in your mind a
powerful vision of how all these pieces will fit together
and they will make you an extraordinary human being but
not within a year it's gonna take more time than
that you might need to just spend it here just
watching these videos and just reading some books just to
just to be a little bit of a theoretical foundation
and to get yourself bought into the idea of doing
this work so your vision has to go beyond just
a year five years ten years and especially for many
of you who follow along you're so young you're in
your twenties for [ __ ] sake this information is
absolutely crucial and valuable to you this will make or
break your whole life if you do this stuff start
investing right now into your life the younger you are
the more you have to gain from these techniques and
stay tuned for more you
