            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Personal Experience</b>: Leo shares that his transition from being a video game designer to starting his own business was consequential and presented a significant change in his life. Despite the risk, he realized the job was not aligned with his values or lifestyle and took the step for a more fulfilling career.
</li><li><b>Understanding What You Want Out of Life</b>: Leo advises that getting clear about what you want out of life can assist you in tough career decisions. This involves identifying your top 10 values and using them as a guide for decision-making.
</li><li><b>Alignment of Current Career with Top Values</b>: It is essential to measure how well your current career aligns with your top values. This should then be compared with how another career (option B) might match these values. By doing so, it will be easier to make decisions and potentially decrease some uncertainty.
</li><li><b>Reasons for Transitioning Careers</b>: Leo suggests that there may be various reasons for considering a career change. One primary reason could be that your current job may not provide the lifestyle you desire. Another reason could include a lack of passion for the work and a sense that you are better aligned with something else.
</li><li><b>Honoring Your Values</b>: Your subconscious mind sends signals of pain and resistance when you're going against your values, which can cause dissatisfaction with current employment. Aligning your career with your life purpose and whatÂ’s important for you can increase job satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Long-term Payoffs vs Short-term Costs</b>: Transitioning careers could involve short-term costs such as temporary joblessness or training. However, considering the long-term payoffs such as more fulfillment, increased earning potential and alignment with personal values, can make a career change worthwhile.
</li><li><b>Job Satisfaction</b>: Spending most of your waking hours in a career you aren't satisfied with can lead to a perpetually negative outlook on work. Seeing your career as a valuable part of your life rather than just a source of income can help improve overall satisfaction and happiness.
</li><li><b>Cost and potential benefits of career change</b>: Despite potential short-term costs including time spent unemployed, retraining, or even going back to school, Leo emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term payoff. One is likely to feel more fulfilled and potentially earn more money when following a career that aligns with their passion.
</li><li><b>Impact of passion on work</b>: The drive from being passionate in your career can lead to more vibrant interactions with others, a more inspiring presence, a greater willingness to work harder and thus producing more value that can enhance your earning potential long term.
</li><li><b>Fear and skepticism</b>: It's suggested that skepticism and pessimism can hinder the transition process. Succumbing to fear and rationalizing accepting mediocrity is seen as contrary to living your values. 
</li><li><b>Approach to change</b>: Quick drastic changes aren't advised. A steady approach, pairing your current job's financial stability with gradual progress towards future career goals, is suggested. Building up skills and confidence and ensuring a smooth transition are essential parts of the process.
</li><li><b>Need for research and training</b>: Figuring out passions and values, identifying practical steps for transition through research (books, online, training programs), and implementing these learn the way are emphasized.
</li><li><b>Value of current job</b>: Recognizing positive aspects of the current job, like financial stability, and using it as support while transitioning to a future career gradually is advised.
</li><li><b>Engagement with the audience</b>: Leo encourages comments, likes share, and directs viewers to explore more advanced strategies on his website, Actualized.org. He promises more such helpful videos through a subscription to his newsletter.
