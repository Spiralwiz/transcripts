hey leo here for actualised org and isn't this something
different so this is more of a video blog style
of video and I'll tell you in a second why
that is and what's going on here but I'm sitting
in my car and I'm outside my apartment complex and
I'm getting ready to go on a trip so what
I'm doing here is a solo meditation retreat it's going
to be ten days well really nine days of solid
meditation non-stop meditation in a place that I rented basically
I've rented a house in the middle of a forest
in Arizona I live in Las Vegas this what you're
seeing behind me is Las Vegas sunny Las Vegas it's
beautiful spring here right now in April and I am
going to be doing a 6-hour drive all the way
to the middle of Arizona where it's rather Foresti you
might think that Arizona the desert but actually there's a
forest there so in the middle of this pine forest
it's going to be my meditation retreat and it's just
going to be myself so this is an idea that
I got a while ago from doing the pastina retreats
now the Posner retreats are great I recommend you do
them but the problem with them is that you're there
with a bunch of people and to me meditation is
at its peak when it's so low so when I
go meditating I like to meditate by myself even when
I do have a Posten retreat I'll just sit in
my room and meditate there the whole day or the
whole week and that's worked well for me because I
tend to be a pretty introverted individual and I don't
like to do group meditation to me that defeats the
whole purpose of why I meditate so that's why I'm
doing this solo trip that's the first time that I'm
trying this out so it's a bit of an ordeal
try to figure out the logistics you might think that
oh well ten days by yourself that's easy as far
as logistics but there's a lot of stuff so you
have to prepare the food you have to plan everything
out ahead because when I'm talking about meditating for ten
days straight that's like every single day your mind is
on meditation and nothing else no distractions no internet no
cell phones not even going to the grocery store or
not getting in your car so I mean you're fully
committed to 24/7 meditation even as you're going to sleep
and your head is hitting the pillow after a full
day of meditating you are still maintaining mindfulness and you're
still labeling and noting and doing the formal meditation practice
what happens when you do this for 10 days straight
is that you reach levels of consciousness that are simply
have never been experienced by you before so anyways I
digress I don't want to go too deep into that
what I want to tell you here is that I
packed my car for a full of stuff you can
see I got food it's got a cooler with food
and I got all sorts of gear back there but
anyways so I'm going to do this trip and I
want to record videos of it and then what I'm
going to do is I am going to be meditating
for the entire nine days and what I will do
though is I will do one short maybe 10-minute video
recording at the end of each day I'm thinking with
just the insights that I had that would be pertinent
to you so the idea of this video this whole
series is going to be that I want to put
together kind of a recording of what it looks like
to set up a solo meditation retreat so that for
those of you who are really into consciousness work and
are really serious about it you have a template that
you can use so I'll talk about the food that
I prepare some of the logistics and planning that goes
on how I structure my days and what exactly I'm
doing some of the exact techniques that I'm using how
I'm self inquiring how I'm meditating how I'm labeling and
noting and so forth so hopefully that will be useful
to you I will record a little bit more as
I'm driving on this trip we'll see what the footage
is like so this is a very kind of a
raw unscripted I didn't plan any of this stuff I
didn't think any of this stuff at a time for
what I want to tell you and what it's going
to be like because it's experimental so come with me
on this journey I've been meaning to do more of
these kind of like raw experimental types of personal development
videos for a while but just the opportunity hasn't been
presenting itself because I've been pretty busy but I think
that in the coming years I will be doing more
of these so that you can see what actual self
actualization looks like in the flesh it's one thing for
me to stand up and preach a bunch of theory
at you that's well and good but then you got
to take the theory that I talked about and then
embody it by doing stuff like this and there's a
lot of different techniques there's hundreds probably thousands of different
techniques that that you can be learning and practicing to
embody this stuff in your life the real key in
this work is the embodiment component it's like the theory
you know as much time as you waste watching my
videos and listening to me or to other self-help gurus
and so forth I mean that's well and good that's
just as that's the beginning you see people think that
okay yeah watched I watched a hundred videos and that's
pretty good I'm all set no man that's just the
beginning that's where it starts the couple hundred hours that
you invest into watching some videos or reading a couple
of books or watching some audio programs or listening to
some audio programs yeah that then only tells you what
you need to be doing right because before you even
begin you don't even know what you need to be
doing so that just tells you what you need to
be doing and maybe gives you some tips about how
to do it some guidelines a template but then you
got to go and do it so the theory is
really just like one percent of all this work one
percent of theory me standing up there preaching at you
and 99 percent is you doing stuff like this meditation
retreats cleaning up your diet reading books I mean that's
an action step there's hundreds of hours of books you
need to be reading so the list just goes on
and on and on with all the different techniques and
I try to share techniques with you in my videos
so they are not so theoretical because I know how
easy it is to get trapped in the theory but
anyways I don't want to ramble on for too long
I have a six hour drive ahead of me it's
going to be a little bit tedious but the place
that I'm going to should be beautiful it's a very
kind of wooded area I rented a cabin through air
B&B cost me a bit about $1700 for 10 days
you can certainly find cheaper cabins this wasn't just a
cab and this is really a full outhouse and I'll
show you what the house looks like it should look
pretty cool so you'll see why I paid a little
extra for it but this should be a nice beautiful
natural setting the reason I'm driving all the way to
damned ass Arizona is because in Vegas there's a lot
of amazing stuff in Vegas but one of the things
I really don't like about it is that it's a
desert so there is no greenery here I mean you
see some palm trees behind me but there's no like
natural parks there's no forests it's dry as a bone
here for the whole year so I like to meditate
in lush green jungle or forest II type environments so
this is going to be my Arizona trip and then
I'm planning another solo meditation retreat to Hawaii sometime later
in this year probably actually pretty soon in a couple
of months hopefully we'll see how my schedule looks but
bitching anyways so so yeah so that should be cool
I'll be in the jungle in Hawaii meditating so I
want to show you some of that and I want
to show you also how you can make meditation and
this whole self inquiry becoming a sage becoming a mystic
business you can make it pretty cool and adventurous so
you might think of like a monk is this lame
guy who just sits in a Zen monastery staring at
a wall that might sound pretty boring to you but
also you can make it an adventure you know you
can get in your car travel around the country meditate
different places go to national parks meet people you know
go to seminars go to different gurus so there's a
lot of opportunities like that out there which can make
it a little bit more exciting for you if you're
the adventurous type and you're also sort of like you
want to get out of your house but of course
you have to remember not to mistake all that external
activity for actual meditation contemplation that still has to take
place so no matter where you go whether Hawaii or
Antarctica it doesn't matter where you're meditating in the end
you're facing yourself there's nobody else that you can face
but you and that requires turning inwards right so you
got to turn inwards so you can't run forever and
if you think that well leo so does this mean
that I can't meditate effectively at home because now you're
telling me I need to rent a a two thousand
dollar house somewhere in the woods in order to go
meditate no I meditate at home every single day for
many hours I've meditated at home for hundreds of hours
so the reason I'm doing this trip is because I
want to do a very strict very serious solid ten
days of meditating and that's hard to do at home
especially for me because I work from home I have
computers and all sorts of distractions there plus I meditate
there regularly so it does get boring after you know
hundreds and thousands of hours of sitting on my couch
it does get boring so I do like a change
of scenery sometimes especially for like a retreat setting so
I think that shifting my environment is is a good
tactic here there's something about going to a new place
that kind of resets your mind resets your brain so
now when you get there you're serious you're not screwing
around also the money investment is also a nice thing
because one thing you'll discover if you go on a
10-day solo retreat is that it's very damn difficult to
stay consistent with it and to to stick through the
whole thing I know because I've tried to start some
in the past and then I failed one or two
days in so this is sort of a advanced personal
development here you're not going to be able to really
pull this off as a newbie it's really challenging to
even spend 12 hours straight fully mindful fully meditating using
a formal technique let alone do that day after day
after day for over a week that's a that's challenging
to pull off so I'm a little bit intimidated I'm
not sure how it's going to go so this is
kind of part of the experiment why it's going to
be fun is because you get to see what actually
happens maybe I'll quit halfway through I don't know on
the other hand I am optimistic because I've been meditating
and self inquiring and contemplating now for like three years
or so and I've been going to retreats that I've
been learning from a lot of different non dual teachers
traditions and gurus and at this point it feels like
all that stuff is sort of crystallized and only now
do I really feel like I conceptually understand all the
traps and the full scope of this journey and what
I'm supposed to be doing what I'm sitting there on
the meditation cushion so that being the case I think
that there's a great opportunity here this week for me
to experience some powerful mystical experiences perhaps an Enlightenment or
some deep insights into my inner demons so shadow work
is going to get done here so either way something's
going to happen if it's not going to be an
enlightenment experience that's okay you can't predict these things it's
really not in my power to decide whether I'll have
one or not whether I'll become enlightened or not that's
not in my power to decide the only thing I
can do is just put in the work and be
very disciplined and serious about it so that's where my
full intention and focus is going is to be very
strict in my in my process in my method and
to not quit it's not slack off it's not start
daydreaming about stuff because I could easily start daydreaming up
business ideas and travel plans vacations girlfriends sex food and
all this sort of stuff so that's not going to
happen this time I'm going to be very strict because
I feel like I'm on the brink now I've had
enough experiences now with psychedelics with some Samadhi states that
I achieved in Prior meditation retreats various insights about enlightenment
and reality that I've had just from contemplating on my
own at home that now it feels like stuff is
starting to crescendo and that there's going to have to
be a crack or a break in the mind at
some point and that's both intimidating frightening and promising and
exhilarating because that's what this work is about and I'm
really as I shoot more videos as I talk more
at you it really makes me conscious of how much
more I have to do to embody in myself all
the things that I talk about and so that just
makes me sort of like double down on my commitment
to actually actualize the theory right you have to actualize
the theory and what are the first three letters of
actualize act how do you actualize you act on the
theory how do you act on the theory well it's
not as complicated as you might think it's not as
murky might seem like well Leo I'm confused about how
to actually act some of the stuff you say no
really what's going on is that you're not serious you're
not committed if you were serious and committed you would
be committed and serious at all costs and then your
brain would go and figure out how to actually implement
some of this stuff but when you're just sitting at
home and you're just watching these videos while you're cooking
your dinner or something you're just listening to me I
mean that's good you got to start somewhere that's good
but if you're not going to get very deep in
this work not as deep as man as a possible
loop the reason you want to go deep in this
work is because it's so ridiculously amazing the deeper you
go you see maybe you've noticed that my tend to
be long and they tend to be a little deeper
than most self-help videos why is that because I want
to share with you the beauty and power of the
depth of this work not just the surface level stuff
and not the middle level but like the very very
depths of it it's ridiculously powerful and amazing and life
transforming this is what you want the problem is that
the deeper we go the more hardcore it is in
the sense that you have to be more serious about
it so anyways I'm rambling now I don't want to
make this video too long but yeah so that's I
just wanted to introduce a little bit of that and
relate it to what you're doing in your life and
how this might help you hopefully you can take the
lessons from this and and then this will inspire you
to go out there and get more serious about your
own consciousness work all right I'm off I've got six
hours of driving to do hopefully I can pull that
off and my back doesn't start hurting and I'll see
you soon with some more footage of the place that
I'm staying at and the food that I'm eating and
all this other stuff so here I am in the
Arizona forests you can see it behind me there you
can hear the cars because I'm near a highway I
actually haven't arrived yet to my final destination but the
since the Sun is setting I wanted to show you
some of these Arizona pine trees you might think that
Arizona is all desert if you haven't driven through it
especially up north but actually towards the Grand Canyon which
is where I am pretty close this giant pine forest
National Park here and it's filled with pines so my
final location is going to be kind of in this
area but deeper so I still have a few more
hours of driving to go but this is basically what
I should be looking forward to some beautiful trees unlike
Vegas where it's bone-dry so I'm excited to be out
in the woods again especially when I'm meditating the best
all right so take a look I just arrived and
I've been setting up in my little cabin here in
the woods in the middle of Arizona so the trip
was longer than anticipated and there were some hiccups getting
in but anyways now I'm inside here's the cabin you
can take a look this is the main loft area
the lighting here is pretty terrible I set up so
my own lights which I'm going to use for shooting
videos but this place needs some better lighting but anyways
what I want to do now is just kind of
show you around a little bit and show you how
I'm getting situated I'm organizing all my supplies so basically
what's going to happen is going to be I'm going
to be here for nine to ten days the tenth
day is going to be basically the wrap-up day and
today I'm just organizing everything I'm going to cook some
food prepare all my supplies so that I can spend
nine solid days just doing meditation and what I want
to do is just show you around and show you
what my supplies look like so here you can see
the the den area this is where I'm going to
mostly meditate those blinds over there they open up so
there's going to be a lot of light here during
the day but I just wanted to show you because
I arrived here in the middle of the night what
it looks like here's the kitchen here are all my
supplies we've got water all sorts of cooking supplies mostly
cooler full of food this is most of my supplies
in there I've got a lot of frozen berries for
smoothies almond milk I've got cut-up pre-made vegetable soup ingredients
I got a bunch of broccoli carrots green beans and
all that stuff that you saw in my soup video
I've got some basic supplies here like rice rice oatmeal
vegetable stock potatoes olive oil a bunch of bananas a
bunch of pineapples here I also bought some more foreign
jizz and mangoes but this is mostly what we've got
going here this is what it looks like it'll be
a lot nicer during the day and then let me
show you the bedroom so that's the bedroom here yeah
the lighting is terrible sorry about that test just how
this place is this is what you get when you
shoot raw without preparing anything so it's a very rough
let's say but I think this is going to work
out fairly nicely it's about 50 degrees Fahrenheit outside 45
maybe actually so it's fairly chilly but during the day
it should be around 70 to 80 degrees sunny all
week so the weather should be nice as I was
driving in here I couldn't really see the the forest
too much but I did see some giant trees so
I think that it'll be pretty nice outside there should
be some hiking trails I heard that there's a stream
somewhere around here a little stream so I'll go check
that out tomorrow maybe show you some footage of that
but that's it for getting set up so this is
a pretty nice setup if you want to plan a
retreat then this might be some of the best of
the accommodations that you might find if you want to
go cheaper and more threadbare then you can do that
too then you'll you'll have to scrap by somehow and
not have all these amenities but I do have a
refrigerator I have heater air conditioning and pretty much everything
I need here so this will definitely work out and
it's in a nice secluded area so I shouldn't have
too many noises and neighbors disturbing me so I unpacked
my cooler it was completely full and let me show
you what was inside of it so basically what I
did is that soup recipe that vegetable soup recipe that
I showed you in a prior episode I've got ingredients
here that I've already pre chopped up all organic vegetables
for two bachelors of that soup so that should be
plenty for the next ten days I've also got over
30 eggs here I've got some lemon for the soup
I've got spinach baby spinach for the smoothies that I
make here's the almond milk for those smoothies so that's
mostly all of that and then in the freezer I
have a ton of frozen blueberries and other vegetables and
other berries which I'm going to be using for oatmeal
toppings and for blueberry smoothies and some stuff for the
soup as well and then as far as produce I
have three pineapples giant and watermelon and those are some
of my dry goods they're rice and oatmeal and stuff
that's my water I have ten gallons of water each
one of those is one gallon there's more in the
car and then I have various fruits mangoes ton of
bananas and a whole bunch of oranges so I'm hoping
that that's kind of last me for ten days we'll
see how that goes so this is just kind of
a rough estimate that I made and will see by
trial and error if I'm going to need more or
I'm going to have too much so right now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a
batch of my soup which will last me for a
whole week I got that ready and I'm pretty much
done for the night hey it's morning of day one
and now you get to see my place in the
daylight so I just want to show you what this
looks like this house that I've rented it's got this
very nice glassy loft area which was where I'll do
most of my meditating on this couch here you can
see the glass comes around there and also what's nice
is that I can meditate outside too so if we
go through here there's this balcony some benches and you
can see we're sort of in the middle of this
pine flash oak forest there's all these Oaks but I
guess it's not summer yet or spring enough yet that
they haven't grown their leaves so they look kind of
dead but there are some nice pine trees in the
distance they're up there so that's what it looks like
and there's actually supposed to be a stream down there
baffling down there is a stream but there's no water
I guess it's too dry this season so I didn't
luck out there all right yeah I just want to
show you around what this place looks like I'll also
be doing some walking meditation actually quite a bit of
it because sitting straight for 10 hours is way too
hard on the back and on the ass so it's
good to be just walking and being mindful and noting
and labeling while walking so I'll be doing that as
well let me show you what this cabin looks like
from the outside that's my car and that there is
the house not really cabins pretty solid house so there's
a bunch of trees although this is a pretty steep
slope but I also want to try meditating outside too
just sitting meditation outside I already scoped out some spots
down there there's some some big trees you can see
that there's a tree over here that would be a
nice spot and also there's a there's another tree over
there that big pine tree right there that's also a
pretty good spot I have a lawn chair that I
brought with me so I'll be doing some meditating there
as well that's what the house looks like [Music] [Music]
[Laughter] this [Laughter] [Music] you know [Music] you [Music] we
[Music] hey guys look I want to show you something
cool can you see it watch I'm going to zoom
in on this thing whoa look at that he's a
giant huge ass Falcon and he's got this beautiful camouflage
he's really hard to see I barely spotted him walking
through the trail here pretty windy you can hear the
wind this is the only way and shoot he's probably
gonna fly away in a minute but I wanted to
show it to you because it was pretty cool this
tree is gigantic so this this bird is probably half
my height he's huge absolutely huge let me see if
I can walk up a little closer to him pardon
the shakiness because I'm walking on some uneven terrain here
let me zoom out a little bit so it doesn't
look terrible I'm gonna walk him a little closer he's
probably going to get spooked and fly away here oh
man I'm making a lot of noise [Music] [Applause] [Music]
Oh [Music] you and [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music]
[Music] Oh [Music] you you Oh [Music] I am in
the mountains right outside the area where I did my
retreat my retreat is basically over and I just wanted
to show you how lovely some of the nature and
the scenery is here it's really bright so I'm going
to put on this hat and talk a little bit
while I show you around so I'm on this nature
trail up in the in the mountains or Hills I
guess you would call them and there's a beautiful view
up here and I bet you wouldn't think that northern
Arizona was like this but this is actually northern Arizona
I was quite surprised at how green it is you'd
normally think of Arizona at the desert let me keep
walking I'll show you some of the mountains and some
of the view there so the sun's going to set
in a couple of hours it's really beautiful perfect weather
here a little bit windy which is why you might
hear some noise in the background as I keep talking
so let's walk here a little bit I finished my
retreat it was eight to nine days the last day
was kind of iffy I basically half-assed it I didn't
meditate all that much the final day I was way
too Restless but I learned so much on this retreat
I got so much growth on this retreat that I'm
already in my mind planning several more for this year
in different locations I'm not going to come back here
because I want to do new locations every time I'll
do Hawaii and some other cool places for you and
get some beautiful footage that I've shot and there's beautiful
footage here that I shot of the creeks that I'll
show you there's like huge birds of prey flying around
here sometimes vultures and falcons and stuff I managed to
get some footage of a falcon but anyways yeah so
this retreat was so powerful in terms of how much
I've grown I didn't get any enlightenment experiences like I
was hoping but I felt like I made massive progress
on understanding how self inquiry works just a lot of
subtle insights that we'll have to formulate more carefully here
to come to the win I'll have to formulate those
insights a little more carefully and then methodically to share
them with you and I've got tons of notes at
least six pages of notes worth of insights for new
videos and ideas I want to share with you and
then I'm going to talk about how to set up
the retreat so if you're doing a retreat like this
or if you want to and you've been inspired by
this episode then I will tell you how to get
the right food what quantities other considerations and tips and
guidelines that you need to make sure you can make
the best of this review look at this it's awesome
pretty pretty cool stuff here there are houses down there
that's basically roughly in the area where my cabin was
that I used for this week-long retreat and and yeah
doing a retreat like this out in nature is ideal
actually you can get enlightened much easier if you do
it outdoors than if you do it indoors the trick
is of course you have to brave the elements and
you have to find a suitable location where you can
do that so if you like camping and stuff like
that then there are a lot of opportunities for you
and if you live in the US there's a lot
of beautiful areas national parks campgrounds and so forth but
I think getting a cabin is pretty important because you
need a kitchen to cook and so forth but yeah
doing it outdoors where you can really get in touch
with nature and most importantly out of your typical environment
that you live in with all your distractions and internet
and friends and family and all that nonsense so you
can get all that out of the way and then
it's basically like hitting a reset button on your mind
everything becomes clear and back into focus you feel like
you're you're back with your ancestors up here look at
this beautiful sky it's perfect it was cloudy earlier today
but all the clouds went away and now you've just
got this beautiful sky and all these huge pine trees
I love pine trees so this is like the ideal
location and of course you want to have decent weather
so it's not too cold so you can spend time
outside so yeah it takes some planning you got to
plan it out but I think that if you're serious
about personal development you should be doing at least two
if not four of these retreats per year for yourself
this is so low this is just you nobody else
you plan it all you run it all and you
get all the juicy insights for yourself from the days
and days and hours and hours and hours of isolation
meditation contemplation self inquiry all that good stuff so so
yeah you got to plan these out and for you
know how do you manage to pull off for these
vo that's like one per quarter well most people won't
be able to because they just don't get that much
vacation time and this isn't like a vacation this is
like hard work stuff so so yeah that tells you
that you got to maybe rethink your job situation plan
more time for inner work because that's really the biggest
problem is that you're so distracted by the outer work
of your life that you neglect the inner work and
our society doesn't even allow you to really get time
off to do the deep inner work the stuff that
will grow you but you know that's a that's incumbent
upon you to figure that out for yourself how to
do that I have the luxury of doing that because
I work for myself and that's one of the reasons
you should start working for yourself is so that you
have time off to to invest in this inner growth
stuff but this is really butyl bit into the Sun
yeah this is a this is how you grow I
mean sitting at home and watching videos and reading books
yeah that's nice going to some formal meditation retreats like
the Posada that's also really great they'll set up and
organize all the stuff for you but then the next
level after that is doing it all by yourself all
alone Renaissance man style you know like BIA as they
did in the old days or like some shamans probably
still do today so this is basically a form of
shamanism that we're talking about you could either you can
even combine this with some psychedelics although that can be
a distraction I specifically didn't take any psychedelics with me
to this retreat because I knew that I would be
tempted to use them and I wanted to focus all
my energy on her BIA the really hard inner work
not to say that you don't get that with psychedelics
but you know the manual kind of work is the
hardest and then I'll probably do some of these with
psychedelics just to see what that's like and compare and
contrast but basically I've been experimenting with different techniques I'm
going to keep experimenting in the future because I want
to share with you the best techniques that I find
for all sorts of stuff and I'm not just talking
about enlightenment you might think oh well this is all
for enlightenment yeah it could be for enlightenment but it
could just be for analyzing your own life if you
have some psychological hang-ups some relationship problems some family problems
you need to figure out your life purpose you need
to figure out your diet and your health you know
you need to detox you need to unexcelled from porn
internet bad food and all this other kind of stuff
or you just need to contemplate and work on other
you know facets of your development not just enlightenment not
just spirituality but there's a lot of stuff for you
to contemplate from your work to your family to everything
else all that stuff needs to be contemplated you know
your emotions need to be contemplated and seriously thought about
I thought about doing these retreats where I don't focus
on enlightenment at all but I just sit there with
a journal for a hundred hours for a whole week
and I just journal in journal and journal in journal
sort of like a self psychotherapy session you know one
long-ass it's like a therapy session and then if you
combine that with some psychedelics you got a winning formula
for some real serious inner growth there I can I
can feel that so there's a lot of opportunity and
possibility here I want you to start to get creative
with this whole personal development journey customize it to your
own desires you know go to the places you want
to go go to the places you find beautiful maybe
it's the beach maybe it's some tropical island maybe it's
in the forest maybe it's in some snowy winter land
up on on some mountain you know whatever is available
to you whatever you like this has been such a
rewarding experience for me that I wish I had had
done it sooner I was planning for about a year
to have to do it but I just couldn't find
time and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to I'm going to pre-plan these ahead of time
so I'm going to put in one of these per
quarter when I get back home right on my calendar
so that my work revolves around these retreats and not
the other way around you see so that's that's all
about getting your priorities straight well I think I'm done
here I showed you some of the beautiful scenery I
hope it's inspired you and I hope that you seriously
consider doing one of these retreats for yourself
