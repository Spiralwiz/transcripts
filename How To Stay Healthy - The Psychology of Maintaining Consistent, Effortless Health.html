hey this is Leo for actualize that org and this
quick self-help segment I'm going to talk about how to
stay healthy alright so what is the bottom line what
is it that causes some people to be healthy and
to take care of their health and to really get
that part of their life dialed in and other people
not so much in fact most people I would put
in this category and it's not just not so much
it's that they have miserable health or even if they're
not showing signs of miserable health yet the way that
they're treating their body the way that their their relationship
to health is so poor that you could just see
the trajectory that they're going down I hope that's not
you but if it is we'll fix that too so
here's the bottom line and what I want to cover
here is the psychology of staying healthy because that is
more important than one specific technique about which food you
should eat or what kind of exercises you do at
the gym here's the bottom line the reason that you're
not healthy and you're having difficulty staying healthy is because
you have a bad psychology about health you're not really
valuing it you're not in touch with why you want
to be healthy for me and this has been a
long journey for me because I was overweight my whole
life up through college and I went through a process
where I lost about 65 pounds and five months and
I got very health conscious back in college and I've
kept with that and I kept kept at growing and
growing and growing and every year I just feel myself
getting more and more in touch with my health and
valuing my health and my body my fitness more and
more and more and so as I'm going through this
process of psychological change I can see very clearly why
people who tried to diet or who try to go
to the gym for a new year's resolution type of
deal or to try to get fit for their their
upcoming high school reunion you know when I see this
I can see why those people are struggling so much
and why people aren't healthy first of all it's hard
to be healthy to be healthy means that you have
to put your attention on this this takes awareness right
if I take my awareness off of my health then
I'm going to stop going to the gym I'm gonna
stop preparing my healthy meals I'm going to stop shopping
for good types of food I'm going to be careless
I'm going to be casual and I'm just going to
do what well I'm going to go stop at the
McDonald's for a quick snack I'm gonna go to the
Starbucks get something there I'm gonna go to a restaurant
and order some some big dessert or some meal it's
not healthy for me and my health is going to
deteriorate in interior a deteriorate to the point where I'm
just going to be doing what society makes easy and
society unfortunately society we live in America other first world
countries we make it very very easy to eat the
wrong things we make it very very easy to not
go to the gym because we have all this unhealthy
food around us we have all this disinformation about food
around us we have ads about unhealthy food around us
we have all these distractions that keep us from going
to the gym we have all these commercials telling us
that the gym should be easy and effortless and all
of that is playing on your psyche and basically it's
putting you in this very unrestorable state where you don't
even sometimes realize that what you're doing is unhealthy so
the first step I would say is start getting educated
if you're interested in this topic one of the things
that I started doing is I started reading about nutrition
I started reading about Fitness I started watching workout videos
on YouTube I started reading books about nutrition I started
researching different types of dyes that are out there then
I started experimenting and through this process you're going to
start to see patterns emerge and it's it's challenging and
sometimes it's frustrating because there's so much different and conflicting
health advice out there you can probably find a hundred
videos right now on YouTube about how to lose weight
and half of them would conflict' with the other half
right and that's just kind of the state of nutrition
and our understanding of nutrition and weight loss at this
point in human development but there's a lot of stuff
out there that does work and what you just got
to do is you got to sort through some of
it see what works for you adopt the things that
work for you and use them and throw away and
discard the stuff that doesn't work but start with the
psychology and the most fundamental question is why do you
want to be healthy why is that important have you
actually stopped and asked yourself that don't just dismiss that
the answer to that question and take it lightly because
for me there's something deeper there as I've gone through
this transition at first it started with well I want
to get healthy and I want to drop fat for
me looks was important because I was so overweight my
whole life I didn't even know what I looked like
in my ideal form I didn't know I didn't even
have an image in my mind of what I could
look like and that crippled my self-confidence and it crippled
my ability to go out there and date and have
relationships and so that was so crippling for me that
for me I said you know what if I can
get my fitness and my health into shape then I'll
be able to go out there and date have more
self-confidence like how I look be able to dress in
nice clothes and for me that was enough motivation to
get me going that was a good reason and today
I look at that and I kind of laugh and
I chuckle I say wow that's you know that's kind
of nice that's a good place to start but and
it got me some good results but it's kind of
pales in comparison to the depth that I'm at right
now where I'm at right now let me tell you
the reason that I take care of my body right
now I go to the gym and I eat really
really healthy is because I just care about my body
I see my body as this machine and it's one
of the most amazing machines on the planet the complexity
and especially the human brain the way the human brain
works to me when I see that that's something beautiful
and I want to preserve that and for me the
food that I'm putting into my body is directly correlated
in my mind I can see that if I think
a Big Mac and I eat it and how I
feel after I eat a Big Mac I can literally
feel my body deteriorating from the inside out these are
the images that I'm drawing in my mind right this
is what I create this my psychology that I've created
so this for me makes it very easy to avoid
a Big Mac right it's just quite that simple but
there's layers of depth here so one is just taking
care of my body just for its own sake you
know I want to treat my body well I want
to treat my body like a temple treat your body
like a temple not a wooden shack as Jim Rohn
would say treat your audience a temple and I'm trying
to adopt that that more and more and more and
really soak that into my my subconscious so that everything
I'm doing to my body is is improving it it's
like if you had a performance car if you had
a million dollar collectible automobile and it was the last
one left on earth would you put good fuel into
it would you go take it for a car wash
every once in a while would you put low mileage
on it would you would you rotate the tires on
it would you make sure that you put in the
right oil when we need to do an oil change
and make sure that you do frequent oil changes right
you would because that's something that you see as precious
it's something that's valuable and what you gotta do is
got to start to see your body that way so
that is one part of it for me the other
part is that I actually want to live a long
life and I want to live not just a long
life but I want to live a long and prosperous
life where I'm active I have energy I'm able to
go out there and do all the stuff that I
want to do because I have so much that I
want to do with my life it's ridiculous how much
I want to do I don't have enough time every
day to do all the stuff I want to do
I want to travel the world I want to build
businesses I want to go out there and talk to
people I want to motivate people I want to interact
I want to experiment I want to have all sorts
of crazy hobbies and literally try out and read every
book that's out there on every topic for me that's
an that's that's more stuff to do that I could
fit into ten lifetimes and I just don't like the
idea that when I hit 45 I'm going to be
struggling with an extra 50 pounds of weight and that
I'm going to be so tired that I'm not gonna
be able to walk a flight of stairs and I'm
going to be so crippled with with potential diseases like
heart disease and diabetes and all this other stuff that's
out there are cancers that basically my life is going
to be cut short I want to extend my life
as many years as future as possible and I want
to give myself the highest quality of life that I
can get so for me that's a big one another
one is brain health when you start to do the
research and you start to realize how connected the health
of your brain is to your help of your body
you start to see whoa this is really really important
and you start to another reason for why you want
to work on your health and stay healthy because first
of all for me the way that I look at
this is like this my brain is really important for
me to have the kind of impact that I want
my life because I'm an analytical type of guy that's
my biggest strength so I'm using my brain all the
time I'm using my brain to come up with ideas
I'm using my brain to run my business I'm using
my brain when I'm interacting with people I'm using my
brain when I'm reading I'm using my brain when I'm
meditating I'm always using my brain and so every extra
little edge that I can get to my brain performance
is huge for me this is my consciousness that we're
talking about so that means that as soon as I
spot something that's hurting my brain performance I cut that
out of my diet and I'm very cognizant of that
and I want to maintain strong healthy neural connections throughout
my whole life I don't want Alzheimer's disease I don't
want brain tumors I don't want to become listless and
have memory problems I don't want to become so feeble
when I'm in my 50s or my 60s that I'm
not able to go out there and create the kind
of things that I want to create and in fact
I want to be on top of my game today
because there are things that I could be doing right
now in my diet that if I let loose on
then I will not have the kind of performance that
I have right now I'll not be able to make
the same quality videos that I'm making I'm not gonna
be able to go out there and write the same
things that I'm writing I'm not going to be able
to go out there and give the kind of speech
that I want to give or whatever else that I'm
working on right now in my life I'm not going
to do that at the same level of performance so
for me when I realize that and I make that
connection in my mind that's a huge reason to stay
motivated of course there's many others looking good you know
I like to look good I have a good physique
that's important to me performance in bed sex I like
to have stamina when I'm having sex I want to
have amazing crazy sex why not you're only going to
live once make the best of it right I don't
want to be some fat ass having sex that's ridiculous
that's stupid why would I want that to me if
I sacrifice a couple of Big Macs so that I
could have amazing sex that's a worthwhile trade-off for me
so there's that one you know uh what is it
maybe for you there's some other ones that I haven't
really connected with maybe for example I don't have kids
but maybe you have kids and one reason that you
want to have a good health and good nutrition and
practice good fitness is because we want to set a
good example for your kids so that they're growing up
and seeing how it is and so that they're not
overweight and not they're not hurting themselves maybe B you
want to live long enough to see them get married
and you want to see them have their own kids
and you want to see their graduations and you want
to see them killing it in their career and you
want to see all that and so you just want
to live long enough to see that that's a very
good reason to to practice good good health and then
you know what else maybe maybe you want to have
more energy maybe you're feeling like right now you're just
kind of a little bit groggy a little bit listless
your mood is down because the food that you're eating
and so now you feel like you're not on top
of your game you're not able to educate your kids
the way you want to you're not able to take
them to soccer practice or to do this or to
do that and you're missing out basically and you're shortchanging
them and you're short chaining yourself on the experience that
you could be having with your family so all of
those reasons are really good reasons to get and stay
in health right now I didn't go into the technical
details of what you got to do what diet you
got to eat or what the exercise you got to
do at the gym but I wanted to cover the
deeper psychology I want you right now to sit down
after this videos over and write down your top reasons
for being healthy for staying healthy I'm promising you that
this is the key once you start tapping into this
you get the motivation and then it becomes much easier
to resist all those convenient things that are out there
for us tempting us and breaking us away from the
path that we want to be on first decide on
the path and why you want to be on it
then you will have enough reason to deal with all
that other stuff there's plenty videos out there that will
tell you which diets you should be on and which
workout written regimes are going to be the best for
you all right so this is Leah andriy signing off
