            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/eg7us76XBEQ' target='_blank'>How To Stop Moralizing - Removing The SHOULDs From Your Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding 'Should' Statements</b>: Leo Gura argues that 'should' statements restrict us and undermine the quality of our life, often resulting in negative emotions such as guilt, blame, and bitterness. He provides examples like "People should be nice to me," or "I shouldn't be lazy," emphasizing that these type of statements are often rooted in external expectations or societal norms.
</li><li><b>Personal Story Introduction</b>: Gura begins with a story about a previous girlfriend whose life was dominated by the 'should' statements instilled by her moralistic and neurotic mother. The result was a person so constrained by rules and rigid beliefs she was unable to fully participate in life or maintain her relationship with Gura.
</li><li><b>Creating a More Flexible Mindset</b>: Instead of dictating behavior through 'should' and 'shouldn't,' Gura suggests that we can improve our lives by letting go of these statements. However, he is careful to clarify this doesn't mean these actions are wrong or bad; rather, it is an optional route to better living.
</li><li><b>Accepting Reality as It Is</b>: Gura introduces the concept of accepting reality exactly as it is, rather than how we think it should be. This acceptance can cut through guilt, bitterness, and blame, leading to greater understanding and peace.
</li><li><b>A Counterintuitive Approach</b>: Recognizing the counterintuitive nature of his argument, Gura warns viewers not to misinterpret his words as a moral mandate. Instead, it's a piece of advice grounded in psychology and personal experience. Confronting reality without judgment can lead to a liberated, happier life.
</li><li><b>The Power of Should Statements</b>: Gura suggests our lives are often governed by 'should' statements, limiting our potential for joy and authenticity. By embracing reality as it is, we can free ourselves from unnecessary restrictions and live more genuine lives. 
</li><li><b>The Paradox of Nature vs. Nurture</b>: Gura observes the paradoxical nature of humanity: we are primed for survival and yet our sense of reality is often skewed by supporting cognitive constructs, namely 'should' statements. He suggests dismissing this moralistic perspective and replacing it with nuanced, gray-scale thinking to live a more balanced and fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Questioning Societal Norms and Beliefs</b>: Gura poses a challenge to viewers: question the societal rules and norms shaping your life. From trivial customs to deeply ingrained moralistic constructs, he urges viewers to dig deep into their beliefs and live more conscious and flexible lives. 
</li><li><b>Dropping Negativity</b>: Gura identifies the source of negativity as the gap between our idealized version of reality and the actual reality. He suggests diminishing these negative emotions by removing all rules about how one should be and embracing oneself as is. He warns against resisting temptation as it only makes the forbidden more desirable, potentially leading to serious consequences.
</li><li><b>Internal Problem-Solving</b>: Gura underlines that problems must be resolved internally, not externally. Blind obedience to rules can lead to improper motivation and limited consciousness. He advises replacing 'should' statements with a more flexible mindset and encourages viewers to explore this new paradigm without judgement from the old one.
</li><li><b>Understanding Terrorism</b>: Gura highlights that understanding and acknowledging the factors that lead to terrorism is critical. While offering a compelling worldview of non-judgment and acceptance, he emphasizes that this does not dilute the necessary negative reaction towards violent acts, such as terrorism.
</li><li><b>Differences Between Right & Wrong</b>: Gura argues that our notions of right and wrong are grounded in ego and desire. He advises letting go of the bitterness driven by moralistic ideals and accepting reality as it is. Following our natural desires can act as a catalyst for positive change and removing restrictions.
</li><li><b>Self-Acceptance</b>: Key to self-improvement, according to Gura, is self-acceptance. He urges viewers to embrace their imperfections and desires, rather than shooting oneself down. This change in paradigm can lead to positive transformations in the individual and societal constructs while maintaining respect for others.
</li><li><b>Shaking off 'Should' Paradigm</b>: Gura proposes that to make a positive change in reality, we must disconnect from the 'should' paradigm and connect with our genuine desire for change. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity and consistency in achieving goals, offering progressive approaches to child-rearing and promotion of emotional maturity.
</li><li><b>Holistic Approach Towards Drugs</b>: According to Gura, it is essential to be honest about the reasons for drug use and to approach it from an open-minded perspective. Exercising personal preference over mandates can aid in developing wisdom and critical thinking skills.
</li><li><b>Importance of Non-Judgment in Personal Growth</b>: Gura proposes that the path of self-actualization is heavily dependent on our ability to stop judging others. He advises practicing authentic action and desires without justifications while acknowledging that there are consequences to actions.
</li><li><b>Freedom vs. Responsibility</b>: Gura offers insights on embracing aspirations freely while shouldering responsibility. He discourages predicting the future and instead encourages following personal desires with mindfulness and gradual questioning of rules.
</li><li><b>Building Self-Trust</b>: Gura suggests replacing stringent rules with self-trust for personal growth. He advises starting small and gradually advancing towards more complex rules, highlighting the importance of humanness in making mistakes.
</li><li><b>Flipping the 'Shoulds' and 'Shouldn'ts'</b>: Gura emphasizes the practical power of enlightenment derived from mindfully acknowledging and flipping one's 'shoulds' and 'shouldn'ts.' He points out that these statements often lead to negative emotions like guilt, resistance, and laziness, and a change in perspective can alleviate these feelings.
</li><li><b>Embracing the Power of Truth</b>: Gura concludes by stating that our integrity and emotions like guilt, shame, fear, and anger are influenced by the truth. He instructs viewers to stay on track with these insights and not fall back into old patterns, stressing the transformative power of this shift in mindset.
</li><li><b>Understanding reality and the notion of "shoulds"</b>: Leo Gura illustrates that the idea of how "reality should be" is rooted in personal ego and individual survival/reproduction agenda. This agenda infiltrates every aspect of human life, interfering with the understanding of reality. When one subjects reality to personal expectations, it encourages a skewed perspective.
</li><li><b>Imposed rules and reality</b>: People grow up being told what they should and shouldn't do, with these rules often coming from a moralistic perspective. Familiar directives, such as children shouldn't do drugs or eat too much candy, are taught with the implication that not adhering to them is fundamentally wrong. However, Gura views these rules as simplistic and insufficient for a high-quality life.
</li><li><b>Societal norms and rigid beliefs</b>: Rules and beliefs that are imparted on us are portrayed as being set in stone or as the indisputable truth. Still, Gura urges listeners to question the origin and validity of these rules. He cites the influence of Confucianism in Asian culture and Islam in the Middle East as examples of deep-rooted moralistic beliefs that need reassessment.
</li><li><b>Questioning and flipping "should" statements</b>: Gura encourages the practice of flipping common "should" statements to their opposite to appreciate their effects on one's perspective. By converting phrases like "I should go to the gym" into "I shouldn't go to the gym", individuals may experience initial resistance but will eventually realize that life is not bound by rigid "shoulds"; it's more nuanced than that.
</li><li><b>Challenging traditional paradigms</b>: Gura reiterates that it's essential to challenge traditional paradigms and adopt a more flexible mindset. Reducing our reliance on fixed rules allows us to live consciously, assess situations from a nuanced standpoint, and foster a better understanding of the world. 
</li><li><b>Understanding cultural dogmas</b>: He points out that many cultures, especially those influenced by Confucianism or Islam, have deeply embedded moralistic beliefs. These binding norms often go unquestioned, affecting the people's ability to perceive reality beyond their cultural conditioning. Gura advises individuals from these cultures to reexamine these deeply ingrained principles critically.
</li><li><b>Reevaluating rules and norms</b>: Gura suggests that many societal rules and norms, such as obligatory respect for parents or the mandate to work out, could be arbitrarily created and not universally applicable. He encourages people to question these norms and redefine their own standards based on personal values and genuine desires. By removing the supposed "shoulds" from life, we can gain a better understanding of our true desires and motivations.
</li><li><b>Harmonizing with reality</b>: Gura reveals that many of our should statements are fantasies that limit our understanding of reality and its true potential. By accepting reality as it is, rather than how it should be, we can start living a more genuine life that aligns closely with our authentic desires.
</li><li><b>The Consequences of 'Should' Statements</b>: emonstrates how common 'should' and 'shouldn't' statements can limit us, often stemming from our insecurities, neuroses, and fears. He argues that this creates a distorted, black-and-white perception of the world and prevents us from recognizing the complex, gray-shaded reality.
</li><li><b>Living in A Gray Scale Universe</b>: Challenges viewers to flip their habitual 'should' statements to their opposites, which he suggests often feels more truthful. This exercise helps to demonstrate the gray, nuanced nature of life, moving away from moralistic, black-and-white views.
</li><li><b>Examples of 'Should' Statements and Their Flips</b>: Provides a list of common 'should' statements and their flipped versions. These include "he/she should treat me better" reversed to "he/she should not treat me better", and "I should be good" changed to "I shouldn't be good". These practical examples underline that our rigid expectations are often not aligned with reality.
</li><li><b>Denial of Reality</b>: Outlines how 'should' statements often represent a denial of reality, as they reflect our fantasies rather than what is. He suggests that leaning into the discomfort of accepting that 'people lie' or 'people cheat', for example, can bring us closer to understanding truth.
</li><li><b>Insights into Self-actualization</b>: Defines self-actualized people as those who can act from a place of security and genuine desire, rather than adhering to strict laws and rules. This section challenges the idea that rules are necessary for upholding what is deemed as "right", instead arguing that guidance is already within us.
</li><li><b>Releasing Resistance</b>: Concludes that the power of dropping 'should' statements comes from their capacity to help us accept reality and stop resisting what is. Despite the fear this may provoke, he argues that this teaching can bring liberation and eliminate lifelong tension.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Human Imperfection</b>: In this section, Leo Gura emphasizes the damaging effects of holding ourselves and others to high and unattainable standards of perfection, which he identifies as part of the problem with "should" statements. He criticizes linking perfection to ideals in various aspects of life, such as finances, career, marriage, and others, which he suggests is a fantasy that does not match up with reality, causing suffering due to unmet expectations. Instead, he proposes a redefinition of perfection in which what is perfect is what's real, promoting acceptance rather than resistance to reality.
</li><li><b>Should Statements and Resistance</b>: According to Gura, "should" statements make individuals feel obligated to act in certain ways, often in denial of their genuine desires, leading to resistance, frustration, and guilt, and compromising their integrity. He argues that this is a major source of motivation problems and internal conflict, as people feel trapped and limited by self-imposed rules. He suggests that these problems are resolved internally through acceptance of both the reality and one's own desires.
</li><li><b>Idealized Expectations vs. Reality</b>: Here, Gura discusses the gap between idealized expectations and actual reality, stating that the frustration, pain, and suffering people feel are a result of expecting reality to be different from what it is. He suggests that the negative emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, and bitterness emerge from failing to live up to super-idealized expectations. He urges individuals to eliminate guilt by dropping all rules about how they should be and accepting themselves as they are.
</li><li><b>Resistance and Subconscious Problems</b>: Gura argues that resistance to certain realities not only prevents problems from being solved but also reinforces them within the subconscious. The more resistance to temptation, he asserts, the stronger the temptation becomes, potentially leading to catastrophic situations. He emphasizes the need for internal work and self-awareness, stating that feeling trapped by rules and "should" statements restricts conscious decision-making and authentic living.
</li><li><b>Breaking the Habit of "Should" Statements</b>: Gura presents a new existential paradigm devoid of "should" statements to his viewers, asking them to imagine how they would feel across various areas of life without these restrictive assumptions. He warns against applying the old paradigm in judging the new one and affirms that dropping "should" statements won't lead to condoning harmful behavior, such as terrorism. Instead, it would result in a rational, grounded, common-sense approach to such issues. He emphasizes that this paradigm shift involves empathy and understanding different perspectives without necessarily agreeing with them.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Reality</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that the world is as it is and it should be this way because that's the reality. He warns against denying reality and inhabiting a fantasy world shaped by one's ego and limited perspective.
</li><li><b>Objections to the Concept of Evil</b>: Leo addresses a common objection that his philosophy denies the existence of evil. He suggests that notions of evil arise from the creation of our minds; while the acts labeled as evil do exist, these acts themselves aren't inherently evil. They exist and our likes or dislikes of these actions are inconsequential to their existence. 
</li><li><b>Dismissal of Right and Wrong</b>: Leo argues that notions of right and wrong are constructs of the human ego and do not exist outside of human consciousness. He invites viewers on a self-reflective journey to examine their beliefs of right and wrong and to realize they are grounded in personal ego.
</li><li><b>Being Good and Effective</b>: Leo argues against the belief that "being good" is what life is about, labeling this as an "old paradigm" we need to dispose of. He encourages the audience to follow their desires rather than constructed moralistic ideals. According to him, our desires run us completely, including our moralistic ideals, and there's no way to avoid this linkage. 
</li><li><b>Notions of Laziness</b>: Leo tackles the fear of becoming a "lazy slob" when devoid of moralistic rules. He suggests that laziness is a result of the "should" paradigm, and true motivation can be found in the acceptance of natural desires. By acting out naturally occurring passions and desires, we can achieve more than we could possibly imagine under the old paradigm. 
</li><li><b>Improving Reality</b>: Leo discusses the objection of permitting harmful practices like slavery, terrorism, or incorrect scientific models by abandoning the "should" paradigm. He advocates for accepting these realities, then acting on personal authentic desires to stop such practices. Doing so allows for effective changes in reality.
</li><li><b>Dropping Weight Example</b>: Leo uses the example of losing weight to illustrate his points, suggesting that one can't force oneself to be healthy or lose weight through the "should" paradigm. Instead, to truly achieve the goal, one must accept their natural desire to be healthy and thereby make choices aligning with that desire.
</li><li><b>Change of Perspectives</b>: Leo reminds viewers that clarifying their points of view is not synonymous with instructing them on how they should act. He argues for a paradigm shift where people naturally follow their authentic desires, becoming less neurotic and more accepting of their actions and those of others. Leo proposes to explore and change existing paradigms organically.
</li><li><b>Dropping Should Statements and Aligning Parenting Strategies</b>: The video urges parents to drop should statements and to avoid directing their children's behaviors based on their personal paradigms of right and wrong. He highlights that setting boundaries and rules could be healthier without moralizing actions, encouraging parents to educate their children about the implications and possible consequences of their actions instead of enforcing prohibitions such as "you should not do drugs." By doing this, children are empowered to make informed and conscious decisions. 
</li><li><b>Should Statements and Beliefs Behind Their Use</b>: The video explains that the word "should" isn't inherently harmful but the beliefs and intentions behind its use can be. Using should statements casually does not necessarily impose moralistic weight. However, a problem arises when these should statements are believed to be a moral imperative or a law of nature. Leo advises listeners to examine the weight they attach to their use of "should" and "shouldn't."
</li><li><b>Avoiding Misinterpretation of Guidance</b>: Leo warns against misinterpreting his views as either encouraging a victim mentality or providing justifications for negative actions like cheating. He emphasizes that there can be grave consequences for actions. Even when expressing, "you should cheat," Leo is not justifying or encouraging the act but merely acknowledging its occurrence in reality. The goal is to remove justifications from all actions and promote authentic desires and authenticity in general.
</li><li><b>No Destiny and the Importance of Living in the Moment</b>: Leo discards destiny as a governing factor and posits that the future is inherently unpredictable. They recommend listeners to trust in their desires and act according to what they authentically want at any given moment, rather than to impose rules or restrictions on themselves that are driven by fear or a misguided sense of duty or obligation.
</li><li><b>Implementing a New Paradigm Requires Growth and Consciousness</b>: Leo warns that implementing this new paradigm of dropping moralistic should statements requires growth, consciousness, mindfulness and self-awareness. They caution against throwing away the rules if these are the only things currently preventing them from harmful actions, indicating that this could lead to chaotic consequences if one is not ready. Therefore, adopting this new perspective should be an intentional, conscious, and measured process.
</li><li><b>Intuitively trusting desires for growth</b>: Conscious growth requires a level of trust in intuition and desires. If the only thing keeping someone from committing atrocities is a moral law or rule, it is suggested they continue to adhere to that rule, indicating a weak or fragile state of mind that needs to be strengthened first. 
</li><li><b>Accept responsibility for desires</b>: Any desires a person has existed before any stimulus that may support those desires. It is essential to take responsibility for those desires and not use anything, such as this lecture, as a justification to pursue them. 
</li><li><b>Applying principles gradually</b>: It is not advised to discard all rules entirely; awareness and mindfulness of these rules should be the first step. Gradually begin questioning rules that won't drastically impact your life. There may initially be setbacks (like eating donuts, gaining weight) in dropping these 'shoulds,' but these are part of the growth process.
</li><li><b>Prioritize low-stakes rules first</b>: Experiment and build trust with smaller, less consequential rules before tackling significant ones, otherwise, there might be serious repercussions. Start with something small like "I should put the toilet seat down," for example, to gradually build up trust in oneself.
</li><li><b>Over time, you'll gain more self-trust</b>: This marks the end goal of fully embodying this paradigm, allowing for trust in oneself, consciousness, and freedom. The process is akin to training a horse removed from its natural environment to function naturally again.
</li><li><b>Write down the top 50 'should' statements</b>: Writing down one's most common 'should' statements can help individuals better understand and analyze their mindsets. Each statement should then be flipped around, noting the resistance and implicit tensions. Practice mindfulness of these 'shoulds' throughout the day and observe their effects on guilt, resistance, integrity, and laziness.
</li><li><b>Connection to enlightenment</b>: The shift in paradigm, grounded in perceiving reality accurately without the ego's distortion, is fundamental to enlightenment. While it seems abstract, enlightenment provides practical wisdom that impacts everyday life, from interpersonal relationships to emotional well-being.
</li><li><b>Consistent self-actualization</b>: It's common for people to fall back into old patterns after making progress toward self-actualization. Staying on track involves continuous learning and application of these principles. This process promises profound transformation and a shift in life perspectives.
