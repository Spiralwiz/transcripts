hey this is Leo for actualised org and I want
to give you a quick rundown of the most important
points that you need to keep in mind when you're
trying to get results from all the information products that
are out there that you could be using what do
I mean by information products well I'm talking about books
seminars CDs DVD programs that are out there any kind
of trainings that you go to any kind of workshops
so any kind of basically information products because right now
we live in an information product age so any kind
of information product that you might potentially want to be
using to improve your life in whatever capacity whether it's
just to get better performance at your job or to
get your life purpose on track or to get your
diet and your fitness on track or to get your
dating and relationship life handled whatever you're trying to do
there what I see of course is the big problem
is that people go in and they don't get the
results that are promised in these programs and so what
I want to do is I want to cover and
tell you exactly what you need to know about how
to make these programs work for you because what I've
actually discovered is coming into this five years ago it
took me a long time to get through a lot
of this stuff you know having processed literally hundreds of
books dozens of seminars all sorts of programs out there
everything under the Sun from marketing to dating advice to
personal development what I found out is some interesting points
that you don't really understand when you start this process
off and I'm going to cover some of the common
illusions about how this stuff is advertised how it's marketed
and then I'm also going to cover some of the
points where people slip up and some of the biggest
pitfalls that people make when they buy these products and
they don't get the results that they want so here's
the thing when I started off I was actually very
skeptical I was very skeptical and cynical guy and I
still am to some degree but I think I've backed
off of it through doing a lot of personal development
work but when I started off I was very skeptical
because you hear some program that says that you can
transform your life in a week or in a month
or that you can get these amazing results with your
business you can make all this money or you can
drop all this weight or you can get this hot
girlfriend whatever kind of results are being promised to you
you got to keep in mind that yes the advertising
can be exaggerated for some of this stuff but that
still doesn't mean that you can't get amazing results so
here are the common illusions that you have usually when
you go into buying one of these products and you
get hooked by it by the advertising so illusion number
one is that the pace at which the change is
going to happen so even though you can make really
big change that's true it's not going to happen on
the order of weeks and I would say it's not
even going to happen on the order of a month
or two it's going to take more like six months
to 24 months to see those kind of amazing results
that you really want whether that's in your business or
in your fitness or in any other part of your
life and that is just something that can't be helped
because the human mind is slow to change and when
you're trying to make a big change in your life
you've got a long history of a built-up bad track
record you have to retrain yourself and you have to
go out there and learn something do something put something
into practice and to do that you can't really do
that overnight so don't expect overnight success and don't even
expect a weekly success expect success six to twelve months
out that's when you get going to get your big
changes but you will get them the next thing you
must be consistent and persistent in order to get the
result a lot of people assume that they're going to
buy that DVD program or whatever and then they can
just sit back and now it's easy they got the
hard part done no no no that's not how it
works you just started your journey my friend this is
where the hard work actually begins now you got to
be persistent now you got to be consistent what do
I mean by consistent that means you do it every
single day you follow up on whatever material is there
every single day daily you do this it's a training
process and then persistent means that even when you're encountering
problems and you feel like giving up you still continue
even when you doubt yourself and you don't know if
you're doing it quite right and you have questions and
you think that nothing is happening and you're not getting
any results and you start doubting everything that's when you
got to still keep going so that's the consistent persistent
if you don't take that attitude then you're not going
to get any results or at least you're not going
to get those big results that you know you want
get from that program or that lieu that were advertised
the third point is that you must actually do the
exercises any assignments most of these programs if they're good
it's not just going to be theory theories nice it
can give you some awareness but awareness alone is not
enough to really get a big substantial change in your
life what you're going to need is take action and
that action is facilitated with the exercises and the assignments
that you're given it's very easy to go through a
self-help book and just kind of like say huh you
know that assignment that visualization exercise they told me to
do for 10 minutes I didn't I'm not going to
do that I already got that part down I'm gonna
skip these affirmations you know I'm going to skip this
this goal-setting process here I'm not going to do this
worksheet or I'm gonna do half the worksheet not do
the whole thing if you take that approach and all
you're after you're just going to be soaking up the
theory what's going to happen is you're gonna have so
much theory but you're not going to have anything implemented
and it's not really going to lead you to anything
good in fact it's going to get you very frustrated
and get you a very upset about the fact that
you're wasting your money and your time on this program
not getting results the next point is that there is
really no magic bullet a lot of programs will say
that this is it I've got the secret I've got
the 1 the 2 the 3 techniques of 3 strategies
that will just blow everything else out of the water
so the best program ever right how many times we
heard that the fact is that even though this could
be a really good strategy a really effective technique it's
not a magic bullet there's no one program that's going
to fix your whole life and make you happy and
they're not even going to be one program that's going
to fix one part of your life it's just there's
too much one program can't handle it and you're going
to need a variety of opinions and perspectives so for
example if you're trying to launch a new business online
and one pro you think that one program is going
to somehow magically allow you to do that now that's
not going to happen that one program I give you
some good insights it might get you a good chunk
of the way there but realistically you're going to be
investing in multiple programs to get that going and there's
nothing wrong with that it's just that don't set that
unrealistic expectation and don't buy into the hype that this
is be one magic bullet because there's no such thing
and this will apply to diet personal development career development
anything you're going to want to be read multiple books
studying multiple programs that's how you really get it handled
that's how you get the results out of it next
is you want to understand that if you want to
get the result you're going to have to have an
investment of emotional labor there's going to be emotional labor
involved you can't just sit back on the couch and
expect things to manifest for you there's going to be
emotional labor involved that means you have to struggle that
means you're going to be unsure about whether you're doing
it correctly and you're going to have to actually put
in some hard and some hard work you have to
grind through certain parts that doesn't mean that the whole
journey is going to be a slog but it can
be difficult there can be times you're gonna have to
really kind of crank yourself crank your brain wrack your
brain to get this stuff to work and to get
you to go and take the risks and get the
understanding that you need right you got to go through
that process of building an understanding and that sometimes can
be emotionally taxing so that's going to be required and
then of course another point is that just because a
product is effective and someone gives you a really good
technique on how to do this or strategy on how
to do that that doesn't mean that that product is
right for you at this particular time because we all
have different priorities you have to really prioritize your time
and understand what it is that you want to be
working on right now what is going to be make
the biggest difference in your life give you the biggest
quality improvement and that might not be what this one
program is offering this one program might be giving you
a really good marketing strategy but maybe what you don't
need right now is a marketing strategy maybe what you
need is you need something different maybe you need to
improve your product quality instead of your marketing strategy or
whatever it might be that is really crucial because sometimes
you can be taken away and distracted by the fact
that you see this amazing product and like yeah that
product sounds amazing it's got all these great testimonials and
it's clear that it's getting people results I've got friends
who use it etc etc and you're all the sudden
attracted to it but then you have to ask yourself
is that really what I need right now at this
point in time maybe I should put this on the
shelf for for a year down the road when I
get there right now I have bigger fish to fry
so there's that question that you have to keep in
mind so don't get seduced there and then of course
the last thing to keep in mind is realistic expectations
you can get really amazing change from these programs really
amazing results but you got to also understand that the
in the end the change is it's still going to
be subtle and what I mean by that is that
objectively it'll be a big change but too you can
still feel kind of subtle and it's never going to
be like that caricature that you imagined it to be
for example if a program promises you to make you
wealthy and financially independent and earning six figures right now
maybe for you if you're if you're earning low five
figures like let's say you're earning 25 30 grand then
six figures sounds amazing to you and it sounds like
it's going to revolutionize your life and the fact is
that there are programs out there that will help you
make six figures that will make that kind of dramatic
dramatic change in your life but you also can understand
that just because you're making six figures doesn't mean that
you're like a rock star now you're not living the
rock star lifestyle by any means it's still going to
be a pretty subtle change you can get those things
but your life is not going to change that much
from what it kind of is right now like the
feelings that you're getting you're kind of going to have
to wait for a long time you have to work
for a long time to really get substantial changes in
your feelings even when your external circumstances change so if
you want to get really big changes in your feelings
that's going to take even longer and that's going to
require a lot of deep inner work not just getting
an external result so just getting money in the bank
account is not really going to affect your life that
much more positively and then of course the last kind
of point to keep in mind is this rule that
I learned from Dan Kennedy who's a marketing genius who
has a lot of marketing seminars out there some of
the best and he has this concept called the 80
15 50 the 80 15 5 rule and what that
means is that no matter what sample of the population
you take and no matter how good your training is
and no matter how bright those people are just by
the dynamics of human nature the statistics are going to
break down as follows about 80% of those people if
you train them and you train them really well about
80% of them will get no results or very mediocre
results 15% of them will get pretty decent results and
then about 5% of them will get exceptional amazing results
and what's even more fascinating you think like how could
that be well what if we like improve the training
and what if we what if we took like really
bright-eyed bushy-tailed people who are like really high achievers and
like super wealthy and successful ready and let's say we
took a sample of them like a hundred of those
people put them in a room and trained them would
would that rule still apply and what he says is
that yes it still applies if you take a hundred
millionaires and you put them into a room and these
are all like super high achieving people super successful they
know how to get stuff done and they're very consistent
and persistent you take them and you give them a
training 80% of them are still going to get kind
of average mediocre results 15% of them will get pretty
decent results and then five of them five percent of
them will get amazing results why that is it's kind
of just like the way the laws of the universe
it just works that way tends to break down that
way because you're going through and you're you're just like
you're stratifying and every stratification level that you're going through
there's going to be a chunk of the population that's
just kind of averaging mediocre and that's the biggest majority
then there's going to be a kind of a medium-sized
group that's doing pretty decent and then there's going to
be a small group that's doing exceptional so you got
to ask yourself you know which of those are going
to fall into and what I'm going to give you
here right now is I'm going to give you some
points on how to make sure that you're ending up
in that 5% instead of that 80% because we want
you to be getting that because those exceptional results but
before I get to those points and there's going to
be about ten of them is I'm going to tell
you a bit more about kind of my story and
some of the concerns I had when I was going
into this because I was very skeptical and a lot
of times I would pick up a book and I
see this book on positive thinking or I see this
book talking about NLP or I see this book talking
about doing this Jools ation and how good it is
and how effective it is and I'd always come up
with counter arguments I'd say well it's worked for that
guy what if he just got lucky and now he's
just being used as an anecdote egg total evidence you
know that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work for
me what if you know what if my circumstances are
different here and they're not going to be like like
they were for that guy or a million different other
excuses to negate the results that these some of these
programs are delivering what I found out is that actually
most quality and I need to qualify this quality programs
that are either books or CDs or DVDs or seminars
from some of the big-name guys out there are actually
almost all of them are really really good it's really
hard to go wrong a lot of times I would
think like well is this program gonna like rip me
off what if I pay them five hundred dollars and
then I don't get my money's worth what if the
results are totally fabricated and false what if these testimonials
are false what if all these people saying that they're
getting good results are just full of you know how
do i how do I know that this is going
to actually do anything for me what I found out
is that all those programs are actually really really good
and on top of that just fundamentally speaking the stuff
that they're teaching is just true it's factually true the
stuff they're teaching is factually true and to me this
was a big revelation that I just had recently is
that damned if I survey all the different programs that
I've taken over last five years like it's really hard
to find one where like I was totally deceived or
somehow scammed of course I do have to qualify that
I'm talking about quality programs so you do have to
do a little bit of due diligence and vetting here
don't just buy program from some no-name guy who is
uh is running some ramshackle operation and who's faking testimonials
and stuff like that that of course can get you
can get can get you hurt you don't want to
do that but if it's someone like a big-name guy
in the industry or it's someone that you can trust
the testimonials of or it's someone who's just talking to
you and it makes sense and you can see that
they have a decent character that they're like not a
shady person then you can you can be pretty damn
sure that they're going to deliver a good program and
you know why that is actually it's kind of interesting
point because I think that people that are actually in
personal development and that are doing it for a living
and this is a general this is a generalization so
but don't hold me to this across every person that
works in the industry but I think in general people
that really love what they're doing and they're working in
this industry what's nice is that they're not like your
typical businessman because the typical businessman all he cares about
is like the bottom line and that's his core value
but for again that's your stereotype but for people that
work in self-help it's more like they they are using
the self-help on themselves who that's how they got into
the industry in the first place most of them so
for them they they want to be in integrity right
and actually what's important to them is not so much
even the money but it's like the impact that they're
having and I like having a positive impact on people
so like they bust their ass day and night to
create these amazing programs to teach you and you know
to give these speeches you prepare all this material write
these books like they really bust their ass to do
this and then bust our ass promoting it because nobody
wants to buy this stuff because I don't believe them
because it sounds too good to be true and so
what happens is that yeah they they really want you
to be successful so they create really good products they
tend to they tend to want to create good products
because their mission is to help people their mission is
not just to rip you off there are some scammers
like anywhere out there but I actually think that in
the self-help industry I think there's less scammers than there
are in other industries because in other industries they don't
have that same level of awareness they don't have that
same drive a need for contribution impact and significance that
I think people in the self in self-help industry have
and that's just because of the way you get into
the self-help industry it kind of filters you for that
okay so that point is important and I think that
if you can trust the character of the person that
you're buying the material from then you can be pretty
certain that it's going to be good material and then
of course a couple of more points about this that
I discovered is that negative reviews when you go out
there and maybe you you think they're going to do
a Google search on a program that you to buy
and you're like let me see if this like Tony
Robbins program has any negative reviews and you type in
like Tony Robbins unleash the power within a criticism or
negative review or you type in bad good bad or
good question mark you do something like that and you
can do this for any type of program the problem
with doing it that way is I found that it's
not very helpful because the problem is not so much
with the tool it's more with the person here's what
happens someone goes into a self-help program right like let's
say they take a Tony Robbins program and then they
go through it they listen to it it all sounds
nice or excited but then of course they're a part
of that 80% that 80 percentile that gets either no
results or mediocre results and why is that well for
many of the reasons which we're going to cover in
a second here because they're not persistent because they're not
they're not really motivated to do it it's because it's
not really aligned with what is there in their priority
right now it's all kind of some of those illusions
that we talked about maybe they have unreal unrealistic expectations
or they don't do the exercises the way they're supposed
to or maybe they have inner blocks limiting beliefs that
are just like holding them back from giving it their
all where they come in they're extremely skeptical and of
course it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and they fail
right if you get if you get a review from
person like that then it's not a very helpful review
and usually the negative reviews tend to be overly negative
and they're from these people that psychologically need a reason
to they need something to blame for why they're not
getting the success they want because like the program was
awesome Tony Robbins program is an awesome program but you
do have to work the program and then what happens
is that people don't work it and then they're like
well it's him it's like he's not teaching it right
or there's something missing in this program it's not like
it's just not working no the problem is that you're
not working it and that you're you're failing on these
common pitfalls you're actually falling prey to these common pitfalls
and now you don't want to admit that it's you
who's being lazy you have to go out there and
you know you're going to you're going to point your
finger at something I'm not saying this is true again
across the board I'm just saying that if you go
online and you start looking for these negative reviews deliberately
you can find negative reviews on and then of course
as with any product even the best most stellar product
I don't care in what industry it's in or what
kind of service it is you're always going to get
some satisfied customer just because you are dealing with large
customer bases you know if you've got thousands of people
buying a product you're naturally going to get people a
few of them at least that are going to be
disappointed because they got a defective product disappointed because something
went wrong maybe because the service or the product was
was not up to par for them or just because
they didn't fulfill their part of the bargain so keep
that in mind and then finally I want to mention
that you know faith is required for any kind of
psychological work and this is a subtle point that I
didn't appreciate when I got into this because I consider
myself to be this realist and to be very grounded
and to be based on science and fact and I
would go in there and I'd analyze and I'd be
skeptical and kind of cynical about stuff and I'd say
well I shouldn't have to believe it for it to
work if it works it'll work I don't need to
believe in it the thing is with psychological work it
really is a big mind game all of it all
of success is a big mind game and confidence is
a big mind game and a lot of it is
a self-fulfilling prophecy if you go in half-assing it thinking
that for example when you're starting a business that well
you know what I don't think this business is going
to work because the economy is doing bad and well
because look at those people over there they failed and
my friends they got these bad jobs why aren't they
starting business so that must mean that it's really hard
to start a business and so you come up with
all these excuses for why it's hard to start a
business and then you hold yourself back and then as
you buy this business starting program it's like a business
in a box you buy it and you work it
half-ass or you don't work it at all where you
sit there the whole time and you're always coming up
with reasons why this doesn't work and this doesn't work
in this won't work and then of course when you
go out there you try to take action on that
what happens very likely you're going to create a self-fulfilling
prophecy whereas if you come in there you're like okay
I'm going to roll up my sleeves I'm going to
get it done I don't care what it takes come
hell or high water I'm gonna make this thing work
even if this product doesn't have all the information I
got in I want in it I'm gonna go find
other products I'm gonna figure out on my oan see
like the difference in mindset when you come in with
that second type of mindset you're going to find a
way to make it work that's where the persistence and
the consistency comes in it's that difference and so it's
really important to consider that is that if you're a
very skeptical cynical type of person and you pride yourself
on your realism I can guarantee you you're going to
have a challenging time using self-help products to advance yourself
in any area of life and that's kind of a
shame because these products are amazing they're just incredible but
you have to buy into it you have to kind
of take that leap of faith and if you're not
able to take that leap of faith you're sitting anything
like yeah well you're just saying that because you want
to sell us some product and because you're bought into
this thing and you're like drinking the kool-aid with everybody
else that's in this industry if that's the mindset that
you're coming from I really have to ask you like
what is the limiting belief there that you've got what
is really holding you back there's some emotional deep-seated emotional
block that you've got because in the end what I
mean you're buying a book that's like 15 bucks you're
spending on a book you're buying a CD program that
might be 100 200 bucks you might be attending a
seminar a thousand bucks what that's not that big of
a loss let's say you go to a thousand or
two thousand dollar seminar right worst-case scenario you go to
an expensive top-of-the-line two thousand dollar seminar from a top
name guy and you sit there for three days and
you listen to all this material you're not going to
get a thousand dollars worth for that and even if
you lose a thousand dollars and say you pick the
wrong seminar pick the wrong guy pick the wrong program
I mean you lose a thousand dollars it's not that
big and the grand scheme of things what you could
learn for that thousand dollars is like exponential it could
be a hundred times worth it can be worth a
hundred thousand dollars really if you go out there and
implement that information and and so don't hold yourself back
with these kind of petty little concerns just say to
yourself that you know what I'm going to risk it
so what I mean I can take some risks in
life and this is not like jumping out of a
you know out of a moving train or something this
is this is a pretty same type of risk nothing
too bad is going to happen to you if you
go buy a book or an audio program and you
work it hard or go to a seminar nothing too
bad is going to happen to you so just take
the leap try it you know try it see what
happens and don't try it once maybe you get burned
the first time try it a couple times takes persistence
to get success in life that's just kind of a
fact all right so here it is I'm going to
give you the top ten or so points for what
you need to do to make self-help work for you
and actually deliver the results all right this is it
you ready okay so first is you need to be
adopting an experiment or mindset what does this mean just
basically what I was talking about you want to go
in there you want to be playing around with this
stuff it's like instead of saying mmm I don't know
if this will work let me sit there and nitpick
every single point that this guy is talking about no
no what you do is you come in and say
okay this is going to work well for me I'm
going to experiment I'm going to see what I can
what I can take from this and I'm going to
run with it not only am I going to take
what's here but I'm going to build on it I'm
going to run with it I'm going to play around
with that I'm an experiment I'm going to see I'm
going to try this way I'm gonna try it this
way so it's that kind of mindset experimenters mindset you
really really need that when you're going into one of
these information products okay number two is watch out for
idle theorizing this is what I call the mental masturbation
effect this is what happens when you just go to
one seminar then another seminar then another seminar and each
time you're in the seminar you're feeling great it's not
like you're sitting at seminar like damn this this is
horrible no it's like wow this guy's having amazing information
and I'm learning so much and picking all these notes
you know what I'm going to sign up to his
next seminar and buy these products I'm going to buy
some books this is amazing I'm gonna I'm going to
go talk with my friends about it and then I'm
going to read some more research online about it it's
that kind of mindset right and then what happens is
you do that for a year or two and let's
say you're working on your business and what happens is
you don't have anything built two years from that point
but you've gone to all these seminars you've hung out
with cool people you've got binders full of notes it's
because you were collecting theory and you weren't taking action
she's got to really watch out for that one that's
where you're losing a lot of your results take more
action less Theory you really don't need that much Theory
you need to be taking way more action than theory
a little bit of theory a lot of action alright
next point is you got to follow the instructions and
follow them closely and what I really found lately follow
them to the letter because some of these people that
create these programs they're not just good these are like
exceptional teachers these are some of the best teachers and
mentors in the world these guys really know their stuff
they're masters of their craft if you choose the programs
correctly so that means when they're telling you something it's
probably important and when they're telling you to do it
this specific way that probably has some significance so follow
those instructions I know myself I don't really like following
instructions I like to go off and do my own
maverick thing and that has definitely hit me in the
in the ass sometimes come back and hit me in
the ass because I would do it my way and
then only to learn after a lot of work and
labor that it was a waste and that I should
have done it the way that they were teaching it
in the first place so that can be a big
one to is make sure that you're actually following the
instructions and that doesn't mean that you need to be
a slave to the instructions it's not what I'm saying
I'm saying you follow the instructions and you see the
results it gets you and then you can of course
personalize it put your own style on and put your
own spin on it maybe change it totally around but
you got to start with the instructions because you're going
in there assuming that this guy knows what he's talking
about and maybe he doesn't but go in there assuming
that he does because you paid for the program you
vetted him you vetted the product and now you're going
in there and you're in it you're listening to what
he's saying you're following instructions then you could improvise later
all right the next point is take notes on everything
in review so don't sit through a don't read a
book even a book every book I read I take
copious notes on but of course if you're going to
a seminar definitely take notes if you're listening to an
audio program or a video program take tons and tons
of notes and then you don't just take the notes
then hide them under your desk you take those notes
and then you review them you review them in the
morning you review them at night you review them on
a weekly and monthly basis this is important to do
the follow-up with this stuff so you're you're studying you're
not just absorbing one hit of information you're studying the
information you're letting it simmer in your mind that's a
really important point then of course I don't have to
say this but I actually do is that you have
to work the program diligently people do not want to
work this stuff diligently diligently means persistently and consistently you
have to actually go out there and do it every
single day it's not that you go and you take
a seminar and then the week after the seminar you
work a little bit on the exercise they gave you
and then you stopped then you don't get results you
have to keep working on it work on it for
weeks for months for years however long it requires to
get the results that you want you got to keep
working at that stuff and you got to work hard
right you got to work hard this is something that's
important to you supposedly so put in the sweat put
in put in the blood that's necessary to get the
result out of it and then you will kind of
simple but that's where that's pretty much why people end
up in that 80 percentile group that gets me York
result is that they simply don't work diligently and I've
been guilted this myself so I can't really cast blame
the next point is only do one program at a
time it's really hard to dedicate enough attention and awareness
to doing multiple programs reading multiple self-help books taking instructions
from multiple sources at once that's going to get you
into trouble because what's going to do is you're going
to have fast multiple things when you should be excelling
and mastering one thing so if you want to take
multiple programs then set up a schedule and say that
you know for the next two months I'm going to
work on this one program then I might work on
another program two months after that and then maybe another
program for a year after that so you guys space
this stuff out and give yourself space to work it
and to really focus on it you don't want your
mind distracted by a bunch of other stuff then the
next point is that I really encourage you I found
that this is necessary pretty much to get all the
juice out of a program is you got to retake
the program multiple times I'm not kidding you that means
that when you listen to that Tony Robbins CD you
feel like oh man I can't believe it I just
made through this massive ten CD set I can't believe
I even did that okay now you got to do
it five more times yeah it's kind of kind of
a different level of commitment isn't it you don't just
listen to the program once you listen to it like
five times ten times as many times as you need
to really register it and that doesn't mean two or
three times that means like in the double digits that's
how you really extract all the juice your brain needs
that time to process it and each time that you
listen to it you're going to pick out more and
more because it's going to happen is you're going to
listen to it the first time you're just going to
get a general big-picture view okay it may be a
couple of little tidbit action items so then what you
do after you listen to the first time you take
a bunch of notes review them then you go out
and actually start to implement you start implementing you start
running into problems this and basically you forget what you
were learning you forget the theory so then you come
back to the program again you listen to it maybe
a few weeks later or a month later and all
of a sudden new things are you're taking new things
out of the program because it's like oh I've already
done that but I've had this problem and here's a
solution oh I should be doing this thing in addition
to or or oh that's what I was doing wrong
so you start to have these realizations on that second
listen through and then what do you do you go
out there new implement some more and you implement some
more and then you come back and you listen to
a third time and then a fourth time and then
a fifth time usually when you get like past the
third or fourth time you're not listening to it as
as focused ly as you would be like a lot
of times I'll what I'll do is I'll listen to
it to the program while I'm showering or unless I'll
listen to it while I'm cooking food so my concentration
is divided I'm kind of multitasking but it's still effective
to have that just information kind of streaming into my
brain so I might be listening to some some program
while I'm cooking myself some breakfast and it's a great
use of time because I would have been cooking that
breakfast anyways but here I have maybe fifteen minutes to
listen to a couple of CDs and while I do
that I get some tidbits that will then help me
with my workday that day it's just like little stuff
like that and doing it in little bite-sized chunks is
actually really good because you can't you can't implement too
much at once so just listening to maybe 10 15
minutes every morning or every evening already gets you enough
theory to then do a whole day or even a
whole week of work worth so that can be a
really effective way to do it but ultimately you got
to listen to it multiple times then the next point
is that you got to be very patient and like
I said you got to be consistent and you got
to be outcome independent so if you're going into these
programs and you're like okay I'm going to get this
program and I'm gonna lose 50 pounds I'm going to
lose 50 pounds in a month like that I'm really
committed I'm going to do it and look really hard
I'm a really Billa gent I've taken all the notes
I've listened to the program multiple times but the problem
is it you're so outcome dependent they're right you need
you need that outcome too badly you want it too
much and you you set like some ridiculous timeframe on
yourself like a month to lose 50 pounds it's not
going to happen you know you would be equally happy
if you lost those 50 pounds in 12 months would
you not I mean would you be equally happy if
right now you lost if you're 50 pounds over 50
pounds overweight and you lose that in one month versus
losing it in 12 months let's say two years afterwards
after that whole process you're still going to be just
as happy right you won't care that much so you
don't need to rush it you need to be patient
and you need to be outcome independent and don't always
be checking your result a lot of times that's will
happen to is that when you go in there with
a skeptical mind you're going to be like well okay
I'm gonna spend I'm gonna spend two hours doing what
they tell me and I'm going to see if that
had made a change or maybe I'm going to spend
okay I'm gonna spend the next week doing every little
detail that has been outlined in this program let's say
launching my business and then next Monday I'm going to
check and see if I got the traffic that I
wanted or if I got the sales that I wanted
or if I got the enquiries or the clients or
the money in my bank account that I wanted you
know being that outcome dependent is going to screw you
up because you're going to be looking for faults instead
of looking for ways to make it work this is
this is the mindset you want to shift out of
you want to be an experiment or not a critic
or cynic and then lastly and this goes back to
that original point we kind of started with is that
there is no magic bullet there is no one program
that's going to do it all for you what I
found is that you need to become a student of
it all and take multiple programs so if you want
to master some aspect of your business by one program
learn from it learn what you can finish it up
implement what you can get what you can out of
it then go buy another another thing go buy a
book read that book implement that book also on the
same topic then go out there maybe take a seminar
something a little more advanced more investment right spend a
couple months implementing what you learn in that seminar then
go out and maybe get another CD product maybe buy
another book if you want to get them become a
master at something you're basically you're your shelves have to
be filled with stacks of manuals and notes and books
and training material on that thing how do you think
people get good they don't just get good by picking
up one book let's say I want to learn how
to do public speaking am I really gonna get good
by picking up one book no I'm going to study
I'm gonna study a whole slew of books and I'm
gonna read blogs and I'm gonna take some programs and
maybe I'm gonna join some Toastmasters and I'm going to
go out there and give some speeches that's how you
get good you don't just get good by reading one
book that's just silly that's not how that's just not
how mastery works so keep that in mind all right
so we've gone through so much here I hope this
gives you a little bit more of an in-depth perspective
from an insider of kind of what it's like to
be consuming these information products because I know that there's
so many of these information products out there and when
I came into it I didn't really didn't know what
was in there and to me right now looking at
it's like damn there are actually information products at this
point on almost anything that you want to master your
life anything no matter how how niche it might be
there's a book an e-book a seminar on it it's
crazy you can find that stuff no matter how obscure
it is what you're trying to learn so that's the
first point in the second point is that if you
actually go out there and read this material and implement
it it will work for you it's rare very rare
to find material that doesn't actually work if you work
it which is to me an amazing thing because that
gives you so much power think of how much power
that it that that gives you to be able to
make these changes and I also kind of like the
fact that there is this 80 15-5 rule because I
know that if I work it really really hard and
I'm really persistent and I observe all these points that
we talked about then I'm going to be in that
5% and that gives me such a huge edge over
everybody else you know because one of the things I
don't like about these programs and this is kind of
been a limiting mindset of mind is that I'll go
into a program like well but then there's a thousand
other people learning how to make this business just the
way that I am what sets me apart what if
there's gonna be a thousand cookie cutter businesses now because
we all follow the same program it doesn't really happen
because 80 percent of them don't even do the work
probably half of them don't even like really complete the
program but then 80 percent of them get really mediocre
results then 15 percent of them get ok results and
then only five percent of those thousand will get exceptional
results and then all of them are going to be
their own different little niches and doing in different ways
so it's not really a big concern in the long
run and I like the fact that if I work
it really hard I can put myself into those 5%
alright so those are my thoughts go ahead and make
use of all the amazing information products that are out
there I think you'll be actually really blown away when
you try a couple of them how much you can
get out of them and of course the ultimate conclusion
here is that you get what you put into it
you're going to get out of it exactly what you
put into it alright this is Leo signing off go
ahead leave me some comments I love hearing your comments
and your thoughts and then please like this and share
