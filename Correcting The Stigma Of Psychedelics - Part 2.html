hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about correcting the stigma of
psychedelics part two [Music] you all right let's continue where
we left off with part 1 if you haven't seen
part 1 go do that there I talked a lot
about psychedelics and historical and cultural contexts from all around
the world I also talked about the many medical applications
of psychedelics which are legitimate scientific and clinically demonstrated medical
benefits in this part what I want to do is
I want to start to unravel this demonization yet at
the heart of this stigma and to demonstrate that first
of all that it is there because a lot of
people are in denial about the fact that psychedelics are
stigmatized they think that no ilio psychedelics are not stigmatized
that's just how they are no it's a stigma and
not only is it a stigma but it's a deliberate
stigma which I want to show to you and and
then we're going to talk about why this stigma exists
and what some solutions for it might be so let's
start with this issue of the stigma actually being a
conscious premeditated thing that society has constructed it's not an
accident and there's some very good underlying reasons for why
this is the case and what I want to present
as evidence number one this is perhaps the most outrageous
piece of evidence that I've ever come across in all
my research it just blew my mind when I read
this quote and I want to read to you because
it's really amazing this is a confession from the Nixon
administration and Watergate co-conspirator John Ehrlichman this was long after
the Nixon administration he was now at the end of
his life and this is an interview that he gave
in 1994 to Harper's Magazine and here's what came out
in that conversation and they were specifically talking about the
drug war the war on drugs and how it got
started why I got started so here here's what he
said the Nixon administration the Nixon campaign of 1968 and
the Nixon White House after that had two enemies the
anti-war left and black people you understand what I'm saying
we knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either
against the war or to be black but by getting
the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and the
blacks with cocaine and then criminalizing both heavily we could
disrupt those communities we can arrest their leaders we could
raid their homes break their meetings and vilify them night
after night on the evening news did we know we
were lying about drugs of course we did and quote
the source for this is Harper's Magazine an article called
legalize it all and I actually made a blog post
on my blog a while back maybe I'll link it
under this episode so you can read this if you
want and you can actually click on the link to
Harper's Magazine it's an online article you can go read
pretty amazing stuff so this goes to show you that
definitely there's a stigma around drugs this drug war is
not just some accidental or benevolent impulse from the government
to keep our kids safe from drugs it's a lot
more nefarious than that now of course you might say
well Leo yeah I mean in this case the Nixon
administration was corrupt and maybe they did push the drug
war too hard but if we look globally we look
at other countries they also stigmatize and criminalize psychedelics and
other hard drugs so how do you explain that I
mean surely the Nixon administration wasn't responsible for the whole
drug war because the drug war really goes on all
around the world not just in the United States and
that is true to some extent many countries around the
world especially first world countries do make it illegal to
consume psychedelics of course laws do vary from country to
country certain countries are more progressive and more lacks with
their laws others are more stringent that's true but the
reason that is is because the underlying motive which was
compelling the Nixon administration to start this war on drugs
is really the same motive that every government and every
society faces all around the world especially these days when
we're living in a sort of globalized first world highly
consumerist and materialist economy capitalist systems are the lifeblood of
every nation these days almost without exception even in eastern
countries and so the problem here is that psychedelics what
they do is they question this entire paradigm they question
the status quo of culture of society of capitalism of
government so it's really the fox guarding the henhouse government
is not your friend it's not some benevolent angel that
is sitting there and trying to protect your kids and
it's trying to do the best for you the best
for your mind the best for your consciousness the best
for your personal development it's not trying to create the
most conscious human beings as if it wasn't obvious already
at this point see culture is not your friend cultures
job is to seduce you into getting so sucked into
the reality of culture which is a fiction it's an
illusion so sucked into it that you just go along
without questioning anything and you just become part of the
herd that's what culture is about and then of course
culture is architected and engineer and all the government systems
are architected in such a way that the power flows
up to the top it's all about control of power
that's what it's about and of course psychedelics are antithetical
to all of this because what psychedelics show you is
they showed you the more compassionate softer side of life
and higher consciousness at higher levels of consciousness you can
no longer lie and cheat and steal and disproportionately accumulate
power and manipulate the way that governments love to do
to maintain the status quo psychedelics also questioned all cultural
norms all traditions all the conservative values and agendas that
conservatives cling to and love and hold so dear all
of that is questioned and culture and government are highly
biased towards conservativism in the same way that your mind
is biased towards conservativism nature generally biases bias towards conservativism
because if something works in nature it tends to have
a homeostasis to it that means that if something is
working your mind or the cells in your body or
whatever a species a population of anything a business a
corporation of government it wants to maintain that but then
you if we use study history you see that there's
a problem in that you have this conservative force of
homeostasis trying to keep things the same but then also
you have the force of evolution which is always moving
towards progress and things are changing and so you always
have this tug-of-war between the old and the new and
how do you reconcile these two because if you have
too much new coming too quickly it's too revolutionary you
can't cope with the change and you sort of self-destruct
and there are risks with going in new directions trying
out new things whether it's in business or in your
family life from your personal life or as a society
there's risks with with new technology with new developments and
there's risks when a species is trying to adapt to
a new environment there's risks with that but on the
other hand there's also risks with staying still because you
stay still then you end up like the dinosaurs so
this issue goes much deeper than just one or two
corrupt administrations although certainly I've presented evidence to you here
of that so we have a combination of that plus
we just have the combination of the systemic corruption which
is widespread across all governments and it's not just with
psychedelics governments are generally conservative about everything every new technology
every new development governments have to be careful with and
the history of human civilization has been a history of
new technologies coming up about new weapons new artistic movements
new forms of media the Internet and this goes back
way early and that printing of books and all of
those have been disruptive technologies which have challenged authoritarian power
structures and many of these technologies have been advancing democracy
which you might feel like well democracy's a great thing
if there was a technology that had that advanced democracy
surely everybody would love it not those who are in
power they hate it because when you're in power you're
at the very top of the hierarchy at the top
of the pyramid all the wealth all of the material
all the resources flow to you so of course when
you're sitting on top of that it feels good it
feels like you're on top of the world and you
don't want that system changed anyway but change is inevitable
so history goes on and those people usually get overthrown
and they get kicked out of office they get killed
or eventually they just die off and they're replaced by
a newer generation who tends to be more democratic this
is just a trend that we see throughout history our
culture demonizes psychedelics in many ways firstly in America specifically
I'm talking about we have had over 50 years of
propaganda and misinformation about the scientific and Klimek clinical facts
about psychedelics a lot of people just don't know the
facts there's a deep ignorance in our culture about these
substances and a lot of it is simply because few
people have actually tried them and I've had the direct
experience it's really outrageous that the people who denounce psychedelics
the most and the people who criminalize psychedelics and the
people who do all the drug enforcement and also all
the lawmakers that they themselves have never actually done psychedelics
they have no direct experience of what they're talking about
and what they're demonizing there's also a missing context in
our sure which I tried to address in part 1
of this series where we talked about the history of
psychedelics the rich history and how most religions have strong
influences from psychedelics all around the world all cultures for
10,000 years and even going back further than that all
the way to prehistory before we even had records there's
a lot of factually incorrect information out there and our
culture about psychedelics about their dangers and risks there's a
lot of myths and urban legends which I will address
later in this episode there's also this blurring of the
line between psychedelics and hard drugs and people just try
to lump them all together and they think that well
that's good enough psychedelics are just like any other kind
of drug and Leo if you're just talking about this
what you're doing is you're just drugged just to find
your drug use man that's all it is that's all
this this series is about it's like you started doing
drugs and now you're just trying to convince yourself and
you're trying to convince others and try to convince me
that what you're doing isn't drugs but actually it's drugs
this sort of mentality and there's a lot of irrational
and prejudiced reactions that then come about from this you
have to understand that our schools have been teaching misinformation
about psychedelics for the last 50 years so that's a
big deal that means that several not even one but
multiple generations now of adults are alive who have been
completely misinformed and they were misinformed at a critical time
in their life when they were still developing their minds
so literally they were imprinted and indoctrinated with these ideas
about psychedelics and so now even when a rational case
is presented to them even when science is presented even
when clinical evidence is presented they just don't want to
listen because their ideas were set ages ago generations ago
and then they taught that to their kids and then
they taught that to their kids you see that's the
problem with indoctrination is that it's a it's this pernicious
virus let's talk about the double standard of risk and
danger that accompanies drugs and psychedelics because this is a
really important point in the u.s. psychedelics are mostly all
classified as schedule 1 substances this includes LSD mescaline MDMA
DMT and psilocybin all these are schedule 1 the same
as heroin crack cocaine and even meth is not Schedule
one meth is schedule 2 which is a category lower
Schedule one is the worst category it's considered the most
dangerous and the most banned but this is quite ridiculous
especially when you go to the government website and you
read what is the definition of a Schedule one substance
here's there are three part definition this is straight for
their website firstly to be called a Schedule one drug
it has to have a high potential for abuse number
one number two it has to have no accepted medical
treatment or use and number three it has to lack
accepted safety standards so there has to be no safe
way in order to use these substances that's point number
three all three of these points are not valid for
psychedelics they're just scientifically and historically untrue so let's tackle
each one is there actually a high potential for abuse
with psychedelics not if you use them responsibly not if
you have the proper understanding of what they are and
you know the right dosages and you are given the
right education about how to use them then there's actually
very little evidence that people kill themselves or harm themselves
irreparably through taking of these substances and in fact I'm
gonna go a lot more in depth on this topic
I'm gonna show you statistics here in a minute and
charts that back up what I'm saying here the second
point is that there is no accepted medical treatment or
clinical use of these substances this is just flout right
flat out scientifically and clinically untrue there are studies and
there is research and there are actual clinical applications happening
right now all over the world with LSD with MDMA
with psilocybin mushrooms with ibogaine these substances are incredibly effective
at helping people to deal with depression with anxiety with
PTSD troops coming back from wars like Afghanistan and Iraq
are greatly helped by MDMA for overcoming PTSD this is
clinically proven now and there are in fact uh clinical
trials being run right now to make these methods legal
in the United States and I mentioned Rick Doblin with
with the maps program who's a serious researcher and scientist
who is working to introduce these treatments including LSD MDMA
psilocybin and ibogaine for treating all sorts of conditions that
I'm talking about here these these substances have been proven
to be effective in research for end-of-life people who are
going through through crippling cancer and they know they're gonna
die and then these mushrooms for example can help them
a lot and of course as I talked about in
part one is with addiction these substances are proven to
be extremely effective for treating the worst addictions to opioids
to heroin to cocaine to alcohol to smoking so this
is just flat-out false and the third point is there's
a lack of accepted safety standards for using these substances
clearly untrue the psychedelic community has shown that there could
be thousands hundreds of thousands of people using these substances
responsibly not just that but also we see historically and
also culturally all across the globe we see societies that
actually do accept psychedelics that do educate their children properly
about psychedelics they have a whole culture around it like
in South America or in Africa and also throughout history
this was the case in various cultures from Greece in
Rome to basically every single continent around the world and
that this this this was integral to their spiritual life
this was integral to healing themselves and actually contributing to
building a high quality high consciousness empathetic society one that
didn't just devolve into hedonistic materialism and consumerism the way
that our society is doing today and all the costs
that come from that many of those costs people don't
even consider as the has the downside of not doing
psychedelics the three most dangerous drugs you know what those
are Alcohol Tobacco and opioids prescription opioids and the fourth
one is antidepressants which are being sold by them by
the tens and hundreds of millions prescriptions are being written
all over the world for antidepressants and they come with
all sorts of nasty side effects you can't even stop
antidepressants once you're on them because of the risks of
suicide and I mean they have a whole host of
risks not to mention that they interfere with your your
hormones with your whole blood flow system with all your
all your neurotransmitters they can also be addictive and they
interfere with your sex drive all this sorts of nasty
stuff which psychedelics don't do let's talk about the statistics
here to back up what I'm saying it's very illuminating
to take a look at actual death rates and the
top causes of death in the United States and all
around the world so I'm going to be presenting some
statistics here for you I just went and I gathered
the most recent and accurate statistics that I could find
on death rates for various things so here's heart disease
in 2016 six hundred and thirty three thousand eight hundred
and forty two people died from heart disease four hundred
and eighty thousand died from smoking that's an average that's
not just from 2016 but that's an average dead that
government statistics cite an annual average all these numbers are
going to be annual averages they don't all come from
2016 some of these dates are from 2014 or 2015
so they're roughly the same ballpark but they're not identical
years from alcohol we have thirty thousand seven hundred twenty
people dying every single year from prescription opioids twenty thousand
one hundred and one died in 2015 from heroin twelve
thousand nine hundred ninety in 2015 from antidepressants I actually
I really wanted to find that statistics how many people
die from antidepressants every year but that statistic is not
readily available because part of the drug statistics is because
our cultural lumps a lot of these drugs together that
we don't always have concrete statistics on death rates for
every single type of drugs and every single category of
drugs for car accidents thirty five thousand ninety two people
die every year from firearms almost as much thirty three
thousand five hundred ninety nine how many people do you
think died from falling just tripping and falling every single
year this is a shocking number thirty one thousand nine
hundred fifty nine people died in 2014 from falling now
of course you have to understand that probably most of
those are like old people who have mobility problems or
senile or whatever but still over thirty thousand people died
from falling every single year puts stuff into perspective nearly
five thousand people died from food poisoning every year three
thousand five hundred thirty six people die from drowning three
hundred forty people died from ATV accidents ATVs are all-terrain
vehicles those like four-wheeler dirt vehicles fifty people die every
year from lightning strike thirty people die every year from
falling television sets and furniture that tips over seven people
die every year from playing on playgrounds kids of course
and this is an entry cystic how many kids are
injured from toy accidents now these are deaths these are
just injuries but still these are like hospital reported injuries
two hundred and fifty four thousand two hundred kids were
injured by toys in 2015 now what you have to
do is you have to put psychedelics into this context
because if you just say well psychedelics can kill people
sometimes people will post on my forum they'll post articles
like Oh somebody took some mushrooms and then he committed
suicide yeah of course that happens but you have to
understand when we're talking about a population of 330 million
people just in the US a lot of [ __
] happens from very innocent things like toys playgrounds TV
sets falling over you see so what needs to happen
is you need to put the psychedelics into context the
trick is that it's very hard to actually find any
statistics that are reliable on psychedelic deaths I did a
lot of searching I actually couldn't find any statistics from
any government organizations anywhere in the world about deaths from
psychedelics like zero none they don't really exist the trouble
is is that if there are drug statistics a lot
of them are just like drugs to to you know
drug deaths but drug deaths this is a way too
broad of a category to tell us anything about psychedelics
because most drug deaths actually result from either legal drugs
or prescription medications that have been overused or antidepressants or
heroin or crack or meth and I'm going to show
you some charts here which will show you the top
10 categories of drugs that people die from and overdose
from and psychedelics are not amongst any of those category
so what that should tell us is that first of
all we need our government to keep much better statistics
on this stuff so that we actually have the science
to to make informed decisions that's important we want to
guessing about this stuff but secondly what this tells you
is that if psychedelic deaths were significant they would certainly
be counted and they would be much more easier to
count so what this shows us is that realistically the
amount of people who die from psychedelics is extremely low
extremely low like very very very very low occasionally you
might hear a horror story here or there but you
also have to keep in to take into account that
you know what did this person actually consume did he
consume what he thought he was consuming or instead of
a psychedelic did he actually consume some sort of stimulant
something that was called a psychedelic but actually wasn't you
also have taken to account did he mix it with
alcohol did he mix it with we did he mix
it with all sorts of other stuff did he mix
it with antidepressants when you create these sort of combinations
and cocktails of substances that creates most of the problems
with psychedelics it's very unlikely that a psychedelic by itself
would kill you it's virtually impossible to do that with
a month with mushrooms or with with LSD for example
the only way that that would happen is if you're
taking these mushrooms or LSD like walking along a cliff
or on a rooftop or a balcony and then you
take it and then you jump off I mean that
could certainly happen but but the the substance itself is
not gonna poison here it's not gonna kill you that's
just not how these substances work let's take a look
at some of the charts here so first what I
have for you is a very important chart which is
how scientists rate the addictiveness and the lethality of various
drugs so what you see here is you have the
vertical axis and the horizontal axis on the vertical axis
is depicted the addiction potential of the substance in question
and on the horizontal axis is the lethality of the
substance so of course in the top corner we have
in red heroin and morphine these are they're really hard
the bad drugs you want to keep your kids away
from those highly addictive and also potentially very dangerous due
to overdose also up there we have cocaine notice we
have nicotine and alcohol look those are pretty high nicotine
is very very addictive nicotine is one of the most
addictive substances air is alcohol has a moderate addiction level
but it's actually one of the most lethal substances we
also have MDMA which is ecstasy we're gonna have other
charts about ecstasy that I'm going to show you here
in a minute keep that in mind but remember also
that ecstasy or MDMA is not a true psychedelic it's
in its own category it's a technically it's an EM
pathogenic so keep that in mind as we keep going
that's gonna be important we actually have caffeine there in
the middle and then marijuana there it has some addiction
potential but very low low thala tea and at the
very very bottom we have the psychedelics notice LSD and
psilocybin in the bottom most corner they have the lowest
possible addiction potential and the lowest possible lafalot II much
lower than nicotine than alcohol even than caffeine and as
I'll show you here with other charts that their risk
is even lower than Tylenol so here is a chart
the next one that shows us emergency room admissions for
various substances these are not deaths these are just emergency
room admissions so of course a lot more of these
than deaths so at the top is we've got opioids
we got cocaine we've got sedatives like xanax we've got
marijuana we've got antidepressants like prozac we've got meth we've
got NSAIDs which is Tylenol and other pain relievers like
that then we have ecstasy MDMA and at the very
very bottom we have LSD and psilocybin those are the
true psychedelics so much much lower now of course you
could say well Leo that's because psychedelics aren't very popular
and if they became much more popular then we'd have
a more admissions and a lot more deaths well that
is that's an interesting question that's actually something that needs
to be proven and tested you can't just jump to
that conclusion I mean certainly if LSD and psilocybin was
legalized and more people were doing it then you have
more issues but also on the other hand if they
were legalized and there was an education program that went
along with it and also our culture started to to
think about these substances in the proper way and not
stigmatize them and you rashly taught how to dose them
properly how to use them properly which substances not to
mix them with then I think that these substances would
still be very low on this list they would still
be much less problematic than opioids and cocaine and antidepressants
and even Tylenol let's go to the next chart this
is a drug overdose death chart for 2014 so here
you see at the top heroin cocaine oxycontin xanax and
so on going down the list method meth Val vicodin
valium to the bottom see all of these are either
prescription drugs or hard drugs opioids there's no psychedelics on
this list so what that tells us through inference is
that psychedelics would be lower than the lowest on this
list so they would be lower than valium so less
than a thousand seven hundred because if they were higher
there they would there be a category for them the
reason there aren't categories for these things most likely is
because the deaths are so low that they are in
the single digits so if they are reported they're just
like reported as freak accidents in the same way that
you would report deaths for chainsaws I'm sure a couple
of people every year or maybe even a couple dozen
maybe even a couple hundred died from chainsaws but when
you're thinking big picture when you're thinking systemically about how
to run an entire culture or entire society you have
to weigh those costs against the benefits of allowing chainsaws
see so this argument that all well just because a
people died that now has to be banned and demonized
and criminalized this is not an argument at all it's
a complete double standard because most things including cars and
chainsaws and all sorts of other stuff even children's toys
come with these risks you just can't stop it when
you're talking about dealing with hundreds of millions of people
here in this next chart this is some of the
only evidence I found it's the closest thing I found
to psychedelic deaths as a statistic this comes from the
UK they did a study where they tracked MDMA use
and death and so here what you see is that
in 2015 approximately 50 maybe 55 people died in the
UK from MDMA now you might say well that's a
pretty big number 55 people and that's in the UK
so if it was in the US then that number
would be significantly larger because we have a lot more
of a population here so that might say that hundreds
of people probably die every single year from MDMA in
the US and that might be like a pretty significant
statistic you might say well that's reason enough to ban
it but you have to understand something very important about
MDMA first of all like I said it's not a
true psychedelic so you can't extrapolate from this and say
well the same number of people roughly speaking like a
hundred people a year die for mushrooms that's not at
all the case and secondly it's especially not the case
when you understand that MDMA is notoriously impure MDMA is
used at nightclubs in raves music festivals it's like ubiquitous
there so hundreds of thousands millions of people take it
in the party scene all the time it's taken by
youngsters a lot of teenagers who go to these raves
people in their early 20s and the biggest problem with
MDMA is that they give you these pills they hand
out these pills at these music festivals they're consumed with
large quantities of alcohol and God knows what else and
these pills are almost never pure a lot of these
pills are not even pure and ma a lot of
these pills don't even have MDMA in them even though
they give them to you telling you that it's ecstasy
but it's not really ecstasy it's a much cheaper dirtier
substitute which has none of the properties of MDMA and
also comes with all sorts of side effects and health
risks and when that is consumed mixed with a bunch
of alcohol and God knows what else weed and everything
else at these raves these these very rowdy sort of
social environments with this loud music is it's a totally
inappropriate setting and it's not at all what I'm talking
about when I'm talking about responsible psychedelic use for personal
and spiritual growth is a totally different animal so from
that kind of stuff we get a hundred or 200
people dying every single year and that makes sense and
just by outlawing it you're not preventing it anyways in
this case you see if you actually made MDMA legal
and if you could go to a pharmacy before you
go to the rave and actually pick up some 100%
pure MDMA in a properly dose tablet you might actually
prevent many of these deaths and also if you had
an education program that put people through some sort of
rigorous process where they are taught about dosages about what
happens when you mix substances with alcohol with weed and
how that potentiates them or even causes potentially lethal combinations
when you combine them with antidepressants the problems that happen
there a lot of people will take psychedelics on antidepressants
or MDMA on antidepressants and that just creates them a
volatile mix that can result in all sorts of problems
so the key here would be education and also the
purity of the substance because pure MDMA take it at
a reasonable dose is not gonna kill you it's only
when you do something very irresponsible with it that that
happens and the reason that happens is because people are
doing it undercover in the dark hiding it because otherwise
they would be they would be stigmatized and they'll be
criminalized here's another chart from that same study from the
UK which compares deaths from tobacco alcohol and MDMA you
can see the whopping difference and that's MDMA I'm not
even considering that as a true psychedelic on this chart
mushrooms in LSD would be virtually invisible if we plotted
those here's another chart this compares the death rates for
various substances a chart from Vox tobacco alcohol prescription painkillers
cocaine heroin and marijuana the illicit marijuana is zero deaths
because they actually couldn't find any statistical data for marijuana
deaths from just pure overdosing on marijuana couldn't find it
because it's so rare doesn't really happen in this next
chart this is also data coming from that UK study
which which compared this was a pretty rigorous scientific study
that they did in the UK which tracked drug use
over like ten year period and it compared all these
substances and then it wanted to list them and here
they're using two colors per substance they got the red
color and the the turquoise color the red color is
the harm that this substance causes to other people to
society at large and the turquoise color is the harm
that this substance could cause to you personally to your
physical health so notice the alcohol is number one followed
by heroin crack cocaine meth regular cocaine tobacco is pretty
high up on the list and all the way down
at the very other end is we have mushrooms LSD
and MDMA notice that mushrooms in LSD have virtually no
red bar which means that they cause virtually no harm
to other people they can cause some harm to you
if you just use them totally irresponsibly that's an interesting
graphic and the next graphic is the same graphic the
same study the same the same data it's just broken
down into very very fine categories they're by different colors
and I'm not gonna go through all those colors if
you want you can look deeper into the slides into
these pictures and and see see what all those colors
represent that can be illuminating and this last slide that
I want to show you is poignant for illuminating this
stigma that I'm talking about in all these episodes and
why I wanted to shoot these episodes in the first
place because there's a big disparity between what people and
our culture thinks about psychedelics their dangers and their problems
and the reality of it so this chart perfectly shows
that so what you see here is how scientists rated
the danger of these substances versus what people think the
dangers of these substances are so the first thing to
note about these charts is that people completely overestimate the
danger of most drugs except for alcohol notice that's the
only one here that people underestimate and also notice that
alcohol is the most dangerous drug more dangerous than heroin
or cocaine or anything else that's quite amazing most people
don't know that also notice how low scientists rated the
dangers of LSD and mushrooms the only true psychedelics on
this on this list and also MDMA is also fairly
low same notice now the difference between how scientists rated
LSD in mushrooms versus what people rated LSD in mushrooms
as far as their danger potential see completely out of
whack like completely out of whack that's what I mean
by this stigma this is the problem with telling your
parents that you do psychedelics see if you tell your
mom you're doing psychedelics she's gonna freak out most likely
if she hasn't done all this research because she has
been taught she's just been told to assume that LSD
and mushrooms are almost as bad as heroin and that's
what you see on that chart there is that people
think that these psychedelics are almost as bad as heroin
whereas in reality they're significantly lowere see your mom wouldn't
freak out if you told her that you're going to
a party and you're gonna have some shots she'd be
totally cool with that I mean if you're an adult
but if you tell her you're doing a party or
that you're just gonna stay home and do some mushrooms
or LSD she'll freak out see that's the stigma that's
the problem that's what we need to fix is that
people stop thinking that way and also if someone in
in the news like a celebrity or something is seen
drinking alcohol taking shots no one's gonna care but if
someone sees them taking some elysee or some mushrooms and
they're gonna freak out then they might get their career
might be damaged from that and so forth and if
a serious person like a scientist or a researcher or
an academic comes out and says that they drink alcohol
nobody really cares about that if they say they smoke
no one cares about that but if they say that
they do LSD or mushrooms that's it that's the end
of their career they're stigmatized for life now forever they're
that kooky person who does these weird things that are
dangerous and that are so bad that's the stigma that
I'm talking about now of course I don't want to
build a one-sided case here for psychedelics I do acknowledge
that there are dangers and there are risks as with
almost anything when you put it into context very often
especially in our culture these substances are misused and there's
different ways in which they're misused they are overdosed they
are used in the wrong set and setting they are
used with the totally wrong intentions they're used in party
environments for raves and music festivals they're combined with alcohol
weed and antidepressants in dangerous cocktails that should never be
combined like that people if they were properly taught they
would not do that sort of stuff or at least
they would know better and access to high quality pure
psychedelics is quite rare most of the psychedelic that are
available are the ones that are most suited to partying
and even there they are very low quality to the
point where you might be getting a 50 percent dilution
of the original thing mixed in with 50 percent some
other kind of crap or even something totally different than
what you were told you're getting when you're getting LSD
you might not be getting LSD when you're getting MDMA
on the streets you're probably not getting real MDMA you
have to go out of your way to get the
pure substances this is not just something that you'll find
in a pure form in a party setting so these
of course create dangers and a lot of these dangers
can be alleviated if we had a sensible drug policy
and also we we had removed this stigma that I'm
talking about removing and we had the proper cultural context
which we don't have these days all of these things
you might of course say well yeah Leo because we
don't have them that's why they should stay illegal but
what I'm saying is then no that's backwards we to
correct the cultural context we need to educate people about
these things we need to bring science and the clinicians
and therapists into this stuff and have them lead the
way and then we can create a culture of responsible
psychedelic use and that would be the much better situation
than just demonizing them and then sweeping this stuff under
the rug I'm going to post these slides separately that
you can download and take a look at through either
a PowerPoint or some pictures so if you want to
look at those closer you can now let's address the
many different myths that exist around psychedelics so the first
myth is that psychedelics are addictive this is flat-out false
not only our second outlooks not addictive they're actually anti
addictive they cure addiction they cure heroin addiction crack addiction
alcohol addiction and they're very effective for that you know
the guy who founded AAA I think his name was
Bill Wilson AAA was founded on a program of curing
yourself alcohol addiction through LSD and also various psychological and
spiritual principles that was the foundation of AAA and as
you saw in these charts psychedelics are the least addictive
of all these substances caffeine is more addictive than psychedelics
the next myth is that psychedelics are dangerous well we've
shattered that myth here yes there is danger but as
we've seen the danger is completely within reasonable norms and
if you really want to be concerned about the danger
of things you should be more concerned about the danger
of tylenol and caffeine and tobacco and alcohol than you
should be about psychedelics the other myth is that psychedelics
have no legitimate medical uses that's clearly not true if
you want to go and do the research you will
see that there's a credible scientific evidence showing you these
uses go to check check out maps org that's the
program which is actually working with the US federal government
right now to legalize some of these psychedelics for clinical
use under a clinician supervision and some of those programs
are actually going through the FDA approval process right now
and the results are looking very promising and so we're
anticipating that within the next 10 years these things will
actually be legalized for clinical use which will be a
huge a huge victory which is coming way too late
but hey better better late than never another myth is
that psychedelics cause psychosis this is not true in very
rare situations what psychedelics can do is they can push
a person who's already mentally unstable off off the edge
so if you have a history of a severe neurosis
and psychosis and mental instability then you probably want to
stay away from psychedelics but this is not an issue
for for normal well-functioning human beings another myth is that
psychedelics cause brain damage there's no credible evidence of this
at all if you take psychedelics I've been taking psychedelics
now for a whole year various kinds you don't feel
like your brain is getting slower like it's getting damaged
when you're taking them and there's just no scientific data
to back this up psychedelics are a new-age fad that's
another myth this is clearly untrue as we illustrated in
part one of this series where I talked about and
showed all the historical and different cultural contexts in which
psychedelics have been used they were not used by hippies
in the past they were used by serious people they
were used by intelligent people they were used by philosophers
they were used by shaman they still are to this
day so it's not a new age fad at all
psychedelics are fun and recreational that's another myth they can
be like MDMA especially and the problem is that people
think that they understand psychedelics because maybe they have taken
some MDMA or they have heard about MDMA but MDMA
is not a true psychedelic a true psychedelic will take
you deep inside yourself especially if you don't do it
at a party setting and that's not always a fun
experience it's not always pleasant some of the psychedelic experience
I've had are are so deep and so profound that
I'm not quick to go back and have another hit
I'll wait months um sometimes I'll wait multiple months just
because it's scary to go back psychedelics are very very
deep and you have to be a lot of consciousness
work you have to be integrating all this stuff before
you really want to go back for a second hit
and we've also seen all across the world different cultures
using psychedelics not just for fun and recreation they've used
it for serious spirituality they've used it for enlightenment work
they've used it for rites of passage for their teenagers
and and their young adults they've used it for healing
various kinds of psychological conditions addiction fear whatever kind of
problems exist in in their cultures another myth is that
psychedelics are a slippery slope which are gonna lead to
heroin that's the that's the biggest concern parents have psycho
no first you're gonna do some some weed then you're
gonna do some mushrooms then you're gonna do some LSD
then you can do some DMT then you're gonna go
and do some heroin but the problem there is that
you're assuming that all these things are just one type
of substance when we've clearly shown that there they're different
substances they're very different chemically they're very different in the
effect they have on your brain some of these substances
truly are addictive like alcohol and heroin and crack but
LSD and mushrooms are not so they're not gonna send
you flying down that slippery slope especially if you are
properly educated about how to use them in fact what
they'll do is they will make you a a much
more responsible individual you're gonna care a lot more about
your impact in the world you're gonna tread a lot
more carefully and you're gonna you're gonna start to take
your personal and spiritual development a lot more seriously so
you're not gonna want to [ __ ] up your
life with heroin after you've seen some of the profound
spiritual truths that you can see on mushrooms or on
LSD or on DMT another myth is that psychedelics are
just hallucinations and so that therefore they have nothing to
teach you so call Leo is just a hallucination so
what can I possibly learn from a hallucination it's hard
to appreciate just how much you can learn from that
without actually doing it yourself this is a point on
which you have to just keep an open mind you
have to acknowledge yourself that if you've never done it
then you really have no right to criticize it or
to judge it what should you do is go out
and do it and then come share your thoughts with
me and then tell me that all is just hallucinations
well people don't appreciate is that what you think of
as reality itself might be a hallucination so what is
the true hallucination what you're experiencing right now or what
you experience on psychedelics now of course if you haven't
done psychedelics you'll say Leo that's crazy of course what
I'm experienced right now it can't possibly be a hallucination
this is real but that's exactly the problem and that's
exactly why I need a psychedelic is to show you
that you're wrong and the last myth that I'll talk
about here is that serious people don't do psychedelics there's
this idea out there floating around this is not true
serious inventors and engineers and artists and philosophers and thinkers
and academics and scientists and therapists and clinicians and shaman
and spiritual leaders have done psychedelics for thousands of years
and they do it still today they just do it
in the privacy of their own home they don't talk
about it because they know that there's this stigma floating
around so they don't want to make make a big
big splash about it publicly maybe they talk about one
or two of their friends who are very open-minded and
are interested in the sort of stuff but they do
it and they reap huge benefits from it it's just
that you don't hear it being talked about because our
culture is extremely low consciousness and our culture is skewed
towards promoting consumerism and just mindless materialism and of course
in that sort of conversation there's no room for having
any kind of deep meaningful conversations about the true nature
of reality or what psychedelics could reveal to you and
in fact as soon as you start talking about the
truths of psychedelics to to ordinary people they start to
think you're crazy it's not that you're crazy or is
not the psychedelics make you crazy it's that our culture
is crazy it's so shallow and so mindless that when
you start talking about deep issues about reality with people
they don't even know how to make sense of that
sort of stuff this is a real fault of our
culture and over time our culture will simply have to
evolve into this it's not really a choice our culture
is evolving towards higher and higher consciousness you're not going
to stop it you can resist it you could cling
to your old values and traditions but you're not going
to stop it this is a longer-term trend this is
a trend that's been happening for a thousand years and
it certainly isn't over now because of some silly drug
war so let's talk about why this stigma exists the
stigma around psychedelics exists because psychedelics threaten culture science religion
politics business and industries like big pharma and the military-industrial
complex notice that all of these social structures are all
about protecting a status quo even science size is very
defensive and tends to be very ideological and dogmatic when
it comes to defending itself just like religion just like
politics just like business just like big industries just like
culture at large all of these systems are predicated upon
holding firm beliefs about the nature of reality and what
psychedelics do is that they make you question these beliefs
they flip these things inside out and they melt your
notions of conventional reality they make you question things like
what am I doing with my life what's healthy what's
unhealthy what's fair what's unfair why do we have this
kind of government why am I going to work this
95 job this mindless job why am I just chasing
money why am i chasing sex why am i involved
with this industry why am i part of the military-industrial
complex why am i inventing weapons to kill people why
am i participating in these polarized partisan politics of bickering
back and forth between the left and the right and
the the alt-right and the social justice wars doll this
kind of nonce why is all this going why am
i part of this they start to make you see
the nonsense of all this psychedelics also make you radically
open-minded which is very threatening to everyone else around you
because when you open your mind to radical new possibilities
and you start to really develop yourself and grow it's
it's very threatening to everybody else you would think that
others would be happy for you but no they're not
because their entire reality is based upon these belief systems
they have all these firm beliefs about who they are
and what their country is and how business should be
and what family is all about and what religion is
all about and what life is all about and all
of these happen to be a house of cards and
so in a sense the most threatening thing to the
status quo to this house of cards to this illusion
is truth the devil is scared to death of the
truth because the truth will rub him out like literally
the devil is dissolved by the light of truth and
that's what psychedelics move us towards and that's exactly why
we need more psychedelics not less but of course that
means that is is sort of a rough adjustment because
there's just tug of war going on within you but
also within our society at large between selfishness and selflessness
between ego and between truth between the devil and between
God this struggle is going on inside of you and
outside of you and if you'd been doing conscious work
and personal development work and maybe moving a little bit
towards enlightenment then you have felt this tension within you
and it's hard it's hard to walk this tightrope between
these two forces there's a lot within our culture that's
going to distract you and that's by design it's not
an accident that's by design see the devil has infested
all these systems very carefully and by devil I mean
the ego both the individual ego and the collective ego
another reason that we have this stigma is that psychedelics
turn people into liberals that's a fact you're not going
to be able to stay a conservative while you're doing
psychedelics it's just it's not gonna happen well psychedelics will
reveal to you is that all you're conservative well maybe
not all but many of your conservative positions are just
that their ideological positions and they will melt before the
light of truth and that could be a good thing
could also be a negative thing for you because if
you're very attached to your conservative positions it's gonna be
a problem see what psychedelics do is they they remove
boundaries that's what truth is truth is the absence of
all boundaries that means there's no more boundaries between us
and them me and other reality and hallucination all these
boundaries get blurred because they weren't there in the first
place they were artificial they were conceptual and what this
makes you do is this makes you have a deeper
concern for the well-being of everything you become much more
holistic in your perspective on life you have a more
global concern you no longer just care about your state
your political party your country your family your ideology your
religion you care about everybody and this rubs many conservatives
the wrong way because they think well Leah that turns
me into a liberal that's what those bleeding heart liberals
are all about yeah those liberals are more evolved than
you I'm not just saying that because I'm a liberal
is just something you're gonna discover as you do conscious
work the more conscious you become the more liberal you
will become now I'm not saying that every silly thing
that liberals believe is true that's not what I'm saying
at all actually you will become much more radical than
your average liberal because what psychedelics do is they make
you selfless and compassionate that's an inherent part of pursuing
truth is as you pursue the truth you must shed
layer upon layer upon layer of your ego all of
your identify identify - country - political party - whatever
you have to shed all of those such that really
you're going hyper liberal because you have to even shed
all your liberal ideologies all your liberal beliefs all all
your liberal identifications you become so liberal you stop thinking
of yourself as a liberal because a lot of liberals
they're still very selfish they're still very ideological and that
prevents them from going to the next level and this
is what spiral dynamics is about I've talked about this
model in the past and it's extremely applicable to what
we're talking about right now because another way to look
at why there's this stigma against psychedelics is if you're
a student of spiral dynamics and you know that model
then we've got stage blue stage orange stage green then
we have tier 2 which is now stage yellow and
stage turquoise stage yellow and turquoise is a very small
percentage of society less than 1% and this is where
you get into tier 2 where you really get higher
levels of consciousness and you get a a really widening
of your concern because you're becoming less selfish so you
have a much broader or much more global perspective on
the world stage blue is the stage which is very
bureaucratic and you might say traditional conservative or religious then
you have stage orange which moves away from that and
it's very success oriented me oriented science oriented and Technology
orient and materialistic it's like hyper materialistic pursuing materialism without
any limit and then after that you got stage green
which is all the traditional classical hippies and New Agers
and the people who like free love and go to
gatherings and music festivals and smoke a bunch of pot
but then you go beyond green it's a yellow and
to turquoise see so right now in our country what
we have is we have this clash between stage stage
green and stage blue fighting in the midst and also
oranges in the middle but really what our society is
about is just it's just corrupted infested with stage orange
corrupted infested with materialism and so each one of these
stages as you can remember from spinal dynamics it resists
growing to the next stage and what spiral dynamics tells
you is that as you evolve your consciousness as you
become more personally developed you're moving up these stages and
that it's a linear progression you're not gonna jump over
stages but what will happen is you will resist every
single transition so if you're at blue right now you're
gonna resist orange if you're at origin resist green if
you're agreeing you're gonna resist going yellow and so on
and that's just natural that's just homeostasis this happens both
individually within you but also happens collectively we're seeing this
play out collectively right now in our politics and in
our culture and that's what all these cultural wars are
about and what psychedelics will do is that they will
they will dissolve all these stages and they will move
you all the way towards turquoise if you want to
think of it this way a powerful psychedelic like DMT
is like pure powdered stage turquoise you want to know
what stage turquoise it feels like take some DMT and
that's what you got it's such a radical state of
consciousness that it cannot even be conceived at at stage
green or orange or blue like it's a totally different
reality we're talking about a totally different reality even it
basically stay the same but your perspective on everything changes
so radically that it's like you're living in a different
world your politics change your behaviors change like everything changes
like it changes so much it's ridiculous and that's what
we're moving you tour is with all this self-actualization business
so of course psychedelics hasten that but also that's precisely
why it's resisted so now you understand why it's resisted
and the other reason we have this stigma is because
psychedelics honestly they are misused I read a lot of
trip reports from foolish people who use these psychedelics in
foolish ways I read reports or messages on my forum
about people experimenting with them and just doing the stupidest
things ignoring the most basic protocols because they haven't done
their research they don't take these things seriously they think
that they're just toys and then some of them experience
bad trips and that's not the reason why we have
this stigmas because yeah you do you can have some
bad trips some harrowing experiences on these substances but that's
actually not a bad thing that's a good thing that's
a good thing because that shows you how screwed up
and dysfunctional your psyche is if you're having a lot
of bad trips you got a lot grown to do
and those bad trips are actually part of your growth
process not a bad thing at all a couple of
bad trips for some of our politicians and some of
our leaders would be just the right medicine to give
them the kind of humility and compassion that they need
to have if they need to be leading a nation
of over 300 million people and this demonization business is
not something new it's not something original to to the
US or to the 20th century there's been a long
history of it throughout history think about the persecution of
witches by the church that was a thing witches were
persecuted for for hundreds of years and witches are not
a myth witches are real witchcraft is real it's been
persecuted precisely because it's a threat to Orthodox Christianity that's
why Christians are so freaked out by witchcraft that's what
the ego does to anything that threatens its status quo
how about the Spanish explorers the conquistadors that came and
conquered the Aztecs decimated the Aztecs and the Mayans of
of Mexico and and the Americas the Aztecs had the
Aztecs had a rich tradition of mushroom ceremonies using mushrooms
for spiritual purposes and one of the first things the
Spanish explorers did when they came here is they put
a lid on that thing and they they persecuted the
Aztecs for that because of course for the same reason
they're Orthodox religion was threatened by that the Catholic missionaries
in Africa also do the same thing with the booty
tribe that I talked about in episode part one who
used the eye boga plant they also try to demonize
eye boga and try to really eliminate it from their
culture but then the eye the booty fought back and
they and now they're still using it in fact actually
it's been legalized for them to use in that in
that part of the world and there's a lot more
of these examples many of these probably weren't even well
documented in history because simply history is a collection of
Orthodoxy so all the unorthodoxy that's stamped out doesn't get
recorded in history they don't teach it to you in
school or in the history books what this is from
a larger perspective is this is a battle between the
exoteric and the esoteric the exoteric is all the materialistic
stuff all the material trappings of religion it's all the
ideology the beliefs and rituals all the stuff we don't
like about religion all the stuff atheists move away from
and the esoteric is actually the true spiritual mystical kernel
that actually was that the inspiring source for all the
exoteric but the people who are engrossed in the exoteric
all the orthodoxy they are so engrossed in that precisely
because it's a great distraction from going inside and and
accessing the truth which is esoteric so the esoteric is
constantly being demonized and it's being suppressed by the exoteric
and what's really sad now the 21st century is that
this now is not happening through some Spanish Inquisition it's
happening through commerce through business through the shallow materialism of
stage orange spiral dynamics consciousness which is just really taking
over the whole globe it's hard to escape at these
days no matter what country you go to even in
the East it's taking over in China Japan other places
like that they're becoming highly commercialized highly exoteric to the
point where we're really getting disconnected from what life is
about which is growth which is about connecting to existential
truths which can only be accessed esoterically and not exoteric
lee that's why we have all these people who are
on opioids on prescription antidepressants who are on alcohol and
tobacco suicide racer' through the roof we have all these
mass murders and killings and terrorism and all this stuff
what is all this this is the excesses of EXO
terrorism backfiring on itself and the lesson from all this
to be drawn is hey dummy look inside turn inwards
esoteric is what you want turn inwards the solutions are
all inside and psychedelics can be a catalyst to help
you with that so what's the solution to this psychedelic
dilemma that we're facing well I think it's legalization do
I think all drugs should be legalized including heroin and
crack cocaine no I think that's probably going too far
I don't think we need to legalize heroin and crack
cocaine and some of these are pretty nasty drugs that
should not be available at the pharmacy but as far
as mushrooms LSD mescaline DMT five-o neo DMT and others
like that these should definitely be legalized they have way
less risk than many other things which are perfectly legal
I think what we need is not only legalization but
actually we need funding from our government we need leadership
and funding of science and research into these substances one
of the greatest shames that happened with this drug war
is that not only were these substance outlawed for consumers
but they were also mostly outlawed for researchers and clinicians
and there's still so much more about this field we
can learn it's a it's one of the most remarkable
frontiers of science that almost no one ever talks about
we haven't even scratched the surface of all the psychedelic
substances that could be found out in nature and that
could also be synthesized chemically in the laboratory and we
don't even have a clue as to what the full
potential is here these substances could have remarkable cures for
all sorts of ailments that we have and we could
potentially find much more powerful psychedelics that could have even
greater consequences for our spiritual development we don't know so
what we need is a lot of investment and money
into this sort of stuff like the maps program that
Rick Doblin is running and what is promising though is
that more and more research is starting to come online
in the last ten years the government has sort of
loosened its grip on this ban on research and so
we're seeing more and more this happen in the US
and also around the world which is very promising because
the more research that comes in the more amazed we
are what we find and actually this is going to
be important for understanding artificial intelligence it's gonna be important
for understanding mmm how consciousness happens where it comes from
what does it mean what is the connection between brain
cells and neurons and consciousness and different states so this
is a really exciting field and what we should really
be doing is embracing it funding it and then what
I would really like to see as a solution the
ultimate solution to this whole issue is that we need
a high quality education campaign which is truthful and based
on science and research within our school systems stop all
this negative propaganda and demonization and what I would like
to see as far as how people could legally use
psychedelics is as follows I would like to see a
program like an online course maybe a 10 or 20
hour online course that anybody could go and take in
the comfort of their own home they pay some amount
of money if they take this course they can get
a certificate which is a license for using psychedelics in
this course they will be taught about all the stuff
I talked about here and much more they will be
taught about the history the scientific evidence the clinical uses
they will be taught about all the risks and all
the dangers they will be taught about dosages how to
distinguish different substances how to weigh them how to consume
them proper methods proper protocols all this will be drilled
into you then you will go to a local center
like a DMV sort of thing but for psychedelics like
a little clinic there run by the government they will
give you an exam like a DMV exam for driving
your car you will take that exam you make sure
that you know all the safety protocols for that and
then what they do is they give you some psychedelics
of your choice you get to trip there in a
safe room with them they get to watch you make
sure that you're cool you go through a few of
those experiences while you're being monitored to make sure you're
doing it all safely and properly you get your bearings
straight and then you get this license and this license
allows you to go to a pharmacy and to purchase
LSD mushrooms mescaline DMT five Meo DMT this sort of
stuff and then you can use it legally and responsibly
at home and I think that would be the most
sensible solution and then lots of people could start using
it responsibly and also educating those folks who go to
raves and all that and misuse these substances and there'd
be a lot better support system for for those sorts
of settings and should actually reduce the risks and the
dangers that come from that which is very rampant right
now drug culture party culture nightclubs I live here in
Las Vegas it's a town full of party drugs so
and people are getting hurt by them just because they're
not being properly educated and they don't have access to
the pure substances that they easily could what's really cool
is how this field will develop in the next fifty
to a hundred years I think the society is gonna
be blindsided by some of these developments in the next
50 to 100 years governments are not just gonna be
able to put a lid on this thing the way
they have been forever that's not gonna fly and what's
gonna happen is gonna be a bill growing and sort
of bubbling underground community there already is it's already existed
for a long time but now just in the last
five or ten years it's been it's been bubbling more
and more psychedelic conferences are being held around the world
serious researchers and academics are putting their name to some
of these studies and doing this sort of research people
are coming out and talking about the amazing benefits that
they have experienced in their own lives so all this
is really good stuff and what we're gonna see is
we're gonna see a major evolution people these days are
very well aware of the internet revolution and the social
media revolution the technological revolutions the cell phone revolution that's
technology and there will of course be much more technology
but what's really interesting is this psychedelic technology which has
been laying there dormant for the last 50 years and
has just been suppressed and what could happen when this
technology is fully Unleashed with groundbreaking research being done and
new substances being synthesized and end and carefully test it
to make sure that they're safe and then education and
changing our culture that could be a huge thing this
could be a huge boon for society and a lot
of new scientific developments could happen here another thing that
people don't really appreciate on psychedelics is how much more
creative they make you have any deep insights they can
give you about not only your own life but and
the advancement of human civilization within science within technology and
inventions of all sorts and within art so we could
have like a renaissance if if this is done properly
now of course the dangers is doing it the way
the hippies did it in 1960s which is that everyone
just goes crazy with psychedelics and it's done very responsibly
and it's just done in this very idealistic sort of
utopian manner of like oh yeah all the world's problems
will be solved by psychedelics no that's not what I'm
saying here you still need to get the right education
you still need to do consciousness work you still need
to do personal development work so you still need to
read books you still need to do all the other
stuff but this can be a catalyst just you know
like with anything you need to strike the right balance
the hippies in 1960s they swung the pendulum too much
to one direction and then we swung it quickly back
in the other direction and both directions are wrong there's
a balance somewhere in the middle like certain cultures have
demonstrated in the past who have used it effectively that's
something we could learn from and folly when were open-minded
and willing to let go of certain preconceived notions that
we have and we're just open to change a lot
of this is just being open to change a lot
of persons the velvet is just being open to change
you think you want change but a lot of people
they only want change as lip service they don't realize
the full cost of change causes challenge it I mean
change is challenging it's emotionally laborious it can be scary
but then again you can't prevent it even if you
tried you can only stall it for a little while
that's what we see throughout history is that we see
conservativism it's a strong force but progress is a stronger
force it always wins out that's what evolution is about
that seems to be a fundamental feature of consciousness is
that it wants to evolve it wants to spread it
wants to diversify it doesn't like being solidified and bottled
up with authoritarian power structures see all those tend to
break down there is this equalizing egalitarian Democratic quality to
consciousness because the only reason you want to bottle something
up or cling to it or solidify it is because
you're uncomfortable with change but everything is changing your body
is changing and you're gonna die so this game of
playing this rich it self this game is not gonna
win it's a fundamentally unwinnable game you always lose that
game it's only a question of how long will you
hold on and how much suffering will you create in
that clinging process which is largely unnecessary it's a self-inflicted
wound so if you're suffering in your life or you
see your culture suffering you kind of put that into
perspective and and understand why this is happening why there
are these tensions why it seems so difficult in a
sense it's it's very difficult but in another sense it's
actually very easy if you would just let go and
surrender and have some humility and have some openness it
you just gotta be willing to explore and set truth
and consciousness as your number one priority above your ego
above your materialistic cravings and all that our society right
now is drowning in meaninglessness and spiral dynamics change Orange
there is a incredible potential to self-actualize the entire human
race and this potential has never existed the way that
it does right now in the way that it has
for the last 50 years really we have the magic
pill to enlighten every single human being on the planet
we have it right now 30 milligrams of 5 amiyo
TNT up your nose we'll show you the truth and
one of the most amazing things and why I love
psyckadeli so much is because they are so objective we
can take spirituality we can take religion and we can
throw away all the [ __ ] that comes with
it all the stuff the ego has corrupted it with
and we can show people scientific atheistic agnostic religious whatever
we can show them what spirituality is all about with
a very methodical clinical precise process I see a world
in the future where maybe a hundred years from now
or a thousand years from now a child is born
and they do not get to graduate elementary school without
doing 30 doses of five Meo DMT so by the
time that they graduate elementary school they they have access
to the deepest most profound truths in all of existence
already and then based on that foundation they can go
and learn and do everything and become well functioning members
of society and then based on top of that we
can build an entire society but you don't let a
human being be a human being without trying 5mu no
DMT that's what's gonna happen in the future in the
same way that with with self-driving cars in 20 years
and 50 years you're not gonna be able to drive
your own [ __ ] car because you can't be
trusted because people drive drunken people drive texting this is
not gonna fly it's too dangerous the only reason we
tolerate now is because there's no better alternative but that's
gonna change quickly the same thing is gonna happen with
these psychedelics we have that ability right now we're really
on the cutting edge people do not appreciate what's special
time this is that we're alive in right now in
a sense every era is a special time there's always
something happening there's always a new revolution and I hate
it when people say all right now it's like we're
in some special time but in other sense for really
in a special time with psychedelics this is a technology
that human society if we survive will look back on
this in a hundred years and 500 years they will
look back and then they will see what barbarians we
were and just how blind and ignorant we were with
our attitudes towards psychedelics in the 20th and the 21st
century they're gonna be blown away by this because for
them it's just gonna be the new normal everyone's snorting
fire on you that's gonna be the new normal and
you will really appreciate that when you try it for
yourself so everything I said here it's all good theory
it's all good talk whether you like it or not
these statistics you might think I'm just justifying and rationalizing
that is the case these are just rationalizations justifications what
you got to do is go try it yourself that's
the ultimate solution try it yourself and see what's up
and then if you still disagree with me then come
back and and we'll talk about the disagreements but try
it responsibly try it at a non-party setting try it
with a serious intent to grow your own consciousness try
with an open mind try it with the intention to
surrender fully to whatever is revealed to you and to
not bring your own prejudices and preconceptions into the experience
and then I think you'll be in for a pleasant
or maybe a rude awakening depends on how you hold
that stuff all right that's it I'm done here please
remember to click that like button for me and come
check out actualized org this is my website I've got
my blog I'm posting new stuff there I'm gonna post
a list of the dangers and risks of psychedelics I'm
gonna actually have a link down below to that post
because I want to be fair and accurate about this
I don't like when people present a one-sided like polemical
case about a topic I like to get all the
sides so there are some risks and dangers and you
can go read up on those on my blog check
out the forum a lot of people post their trip
reports on the forum which is cool I love reading
trip reports on the forum so post away there and
the life purpose course the book list and stick with
me for more deep topics to come you
