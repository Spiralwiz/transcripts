hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about what I call
lifestyle minimalism how you can double the happiest in your
life by just slowing the down the pace of your
life is totally unacceptable totally unacceptable it's too damn fast
it's too hectic you have no time to contemplate you
have no time to introspect you have no time to
be aware or conscious you have no time to strategize
and you have no time for being being as opposed
to doing you're all wrapped up in doing and this
distinction between being and doing such an important distinction I'm
gonna actually shoot a separate episode in future about it
but we're going to gloss over it here and I'm
going to show you how the pace of your life
is affecting the quality of your life which is something
you've probably never considered before as part of your self-actualization
journey what we're doing here together you know self-improvement this
whole journey that we're on to improve ourselves to grow
ourselves whatever you want to call that personal development self-help
or whatever as part of this journey you're changing your
life around right you're learning new stuff you're installing new
habits you're maybe you're meditating or whatever you're changing your
relationships you're going to the gym more and this kind
of stuff right you're eating more healthy okay that's good
now let me show you a kind of a high
level change structural change you need to actually make to
the entirety of your life how you live your whole
life in your entire lifestyle and what that is is
that you need to make a strategic change and slow
down your life strategically you're doing this strategically this is
not something you just do for a few days or
a few weeks this is something like a change a
high-level change you make to your life from here on
out until your death and you need to find ways
to do this there's multiple ways that you can do
this not just one way there's probably a dozen different
little changes you need to make to your life but
the gist of it is is that you can just
slow way down slow way down I'm talking about slowing
your life down on the order of 25% to 50%
slower than it currently is what does this actually mean
this means that you do 50% less whatever activities you're
involved with or are committed to you do 50% less
of those every day every week every month and those
activities that remain you do those activities 50% slower and
they take 50% longer than they would have otherwise taken
you so even something like sitting down to have a
meal which maybe normally you would scoff down in 10
minutes instead of doing it that way now you're going
to do it instead of in 10 minutes or do
it in 15 minutes and you're going to do it
more mindfully with more awareness that's basically what we're talking
about that's just one example but you see your life
is composed of many of these examples you don't just
eat you also do a bunch of other stuff so
apply this principle to everything you do in your life
yes see that's basically what I'm telling you here now
the reason I even started thinking about this topic lately
is because I was hanging out with my girlfriend and
she has a fetish for minimalism she's been reading some
books on minimalism and the kind of minimalism she's talking
about is like what I would call material minimalism so
it's it's all about this kind of movement maybe you've
heard of this this movement of like reducing and decluttering
the physical objects in your life so that you don't
have too much clothing in your wardrobe and that you
don't have too much stuff in your garage in this
sort of thing now I think that's a really cool
thing and I personally am pretty guilty of not being
minimalist I have a bunch of around my around my
place that I don't really need that I should probably
trash and I can see the benefits of that but
anyways I was thinking about this because she was telling
me about it she's passionate about this and as I
was thinking about this I read like well what's even
more important than physical minimalism is I'll sort of like
what I would call a lifestyle minimalism because just decluttering
the physical objects from your life that's good but what's
even more important is decluttering all the activities that are
bogging you down bogging down your schedule and sucking up
all your free time most people these days the Western
typical lifestyle leaves no free time have you noticed this
there's no free time in your schedule if you've got
the typical American or western lifestyle you go to work
and then after work you'd do all this other stuff
and before work you're busy and you're just constantly busy
from morning to midnight this is a big problem the
basic idea here is that you want to aim for
living a simple life a simple Spartan lifestyle in the
ancient times the Romans ancient Romans they actually had an
ideal a kind of a cultural ideal of living a
Spartan frugal lifestyle now of course a lot of Romans
like the aristocrats they lived very lavish extravagant lifestyles but
generally as a culture you know not everyone in Rome
was an aristocrat most people were just regular middle class
or even lower-class folk and for them there was some
kind of ideal about the Spartan lifestyle and even for
the aristocracy there was still that ideal of like you
know ideally you would live the way that a philosopher
lives or the way that a monk lives or the
way that an ascetic lives which is just like a
very simple very basic way of life you don't pamper
yourself too much and we need to get back to
that kind of ideal which is what I'm advocating here
in this episode the benefit of this is that you
have lots of free time to think think of it
this way you can measure your wealth in terms of
how much money you have in your bank account or
you can measure your wealth in terms of how much
free time you have to think and to contemplate and
just to be aware or to be rather than to
do we don't really think of this is something that's
very valuable to have free time to think but actually
this is one of the most valuable things you can
have because it directly impacts your levels of fulfillment in
life if you minimize the involvements that you have in
life all the activities and hobbies and all that crap
that you do if you minimize all that and you
leave only the bare essentials what you'll discover is that
your life becomes very very fulfilling it's shocking because most
people think like well what I need to get fulfilment
in my life is more success and more money and
then they go chase that for ten years and the
correlation between success and fulfillment is much lower than the
correlation between free time and fulfillment free time to contemplate
and to be aware that's what really produces fulfillment have
you noticed that the Western lifestyle that we live these
days is not at all conducive to self-actualization work maybe
you've tried to implement some of the stuff I tell
you through these episodes and you've tried like for a
month or two or even more maybe try to install
a meditation habit or eating healthier or some kind of
being more mindful in relationships this kind of stuff right
be more mindful of your emotions you try to do
this and maybe you try some of the exercises that
I show you in various episodes usually towards the end
I gave you an exercise right if you try one
of those you've probably noticed that it's hard right it's
hard it's hard to do this one of the reasons
that your mind is just stubborn and it doesn't like
to change but another reason is that the environment that
you're in is extremely unhealthy and neurotic it's not conducive
to self actualization work at all because that's not what
modern society is about this is not an accident not
at all an accident you have to start to realize
that the modern lifestyle that you have grown up in
that you're kind of like a fish in water you
don't see the environment that you're in because you're totally
surrounded by it and you have been probably from your
very birth everyone you know from your friends to your
family to your co-workers to your your boss and your
your preacher and your teacher and your professor all of
these people are in on it right they're all part
of the problem they're all part of the modern lifestyle
most of them are anyways so you don't really have
any good examples of what a proper healthy emotionally healthy
self-actualized lifestyle looks like the modern lifestyle is neurotic and
it's unhealthy and it's not how human beings lived in
the past this is more or less kind of a
modern development of the human species it wasn't always this
way and its really exacerbated by the rise of technology
technology takes it to a whole new level a whole
new level of unhealthiness and that's one of the reasons
why things like depression and anxiety and phobias are rampant
way worse than they were a hundred years ago or
a couple thousand years ago right because human beings are
not meant to live the way we live right now
we've kind of domesticated ourselves in a very toxic way
and you don't realize this yet until you're able to
kind of like get a clearing a parting of the
clouds until you see a ray of light shining through
until someone gives you an example of really what a
high quality lifestyle looks like and it might not be
at all what you think it is for example some
people ask me to post videos about like what my
lifestyle looks like they tell me like well leo post
us some videos about like what your day is like
you know I bet you you have the best lifestyle
you have such a cool lifestyle but you know what
if I posted you a video of my typical day
it would be extremely boring to you you would probably
be so boring to you that you would look at
it and you'd like scratch your head and you'd be
like wondering like well what the what the leo ah
why am I even following you and listening to you
and doing all the self-actualization stuff because it seems like
you're just living like the most basic the most ordinary
unleash a lifestyle possible like I don't need to work
hundreds or thousands of hours to get that kind of
lifestyle I could get that right now but see what
you fail to realize if you think that way is
that actually it'll take you years and maybe even decades
to come to the point where you're actually gonna finally
grasp with your mind what I'm talking about here and
the reason that I'm doing this with my life right
I don't want a lavish and extravagant lifestyle why not
because I know that it's not going to make me
fulfilled you see it's only going to make me more
busy it's going to be a veneer of success and
kind of a veneer of growth and development but it's
not going to be the real deal it's not so
let's get back on point here basically what I'm telling
you that your schedule is too full you're trying to
do too damn much too fast and this fast pace
that you're going at is making you unaware of life
it's impossible to be mindful and conscious in your life
when you have a fast pace for many of you
that's exactly why you have a fast pace is because
when you first start to become conscious and aware it's
actually painful and to avoid that pain what you do
is you put the pedal to the metal and you
increase the pace and any time you get a little
bit of free room in your schedule like you know
some time frees up or some like that you immediately
fill the vacuum with some other mindless activity because you
can't stand being because you're literally addicted to doing and
you're addicted to success see you can really get a
taste for this you can really notice this if you
ever do a meditation retreat or some kind of consciousness
retreat I've been doing a lot of these lately over
the last couple years and one of the most amazing
experiences and I'm not the only person I know people
who have gone this exact same experience is you go
to something like let's say uh 10-david pause on a
meditation retreat at this retreat it's total silence you're not
allowed to speak for ten days straight you're also not
allowed to use the internet or cell phones or anything
so there you are for 10 days doing absolutely nothing
you're just basically meditating for 10 12 hours a day
and the first 3 to 5 days are real tough
it's really painful because you're going through withdrawal symptoms because
you're addicted to this stuff but then after you know
the fifth day actually it feels wonderful finally you get
back to that original place that kind of place where
I would guess you know people as humanity well we
used to live in this place all the time before
the advent of Agriculture and big civilizations happen in religion
happened B happened education happened in politics happened before all
that kind of stuff you know human beings just lived
very simply as hunter-gatherers and life was a lot more
simple it was like this it was like I'm a
meditation retreat but then here's a really weird part that
happens is that after you're done you know you're feeling
amazing on the tenth day of the retreat like you're
glowing you're probably the happiest and most fulfilled you've ever
been in your entire life after those ten days and
then immediately you walk back into the airport and the
airport everybody's running around everyone's you know crazy and rowdy
and everybody talking and your cell phone starts blowing up
because all your friends are texting you and your your
girlfriend or boyfriend is texting you your family is texting
where have you been for 10 days you know your
business colleagues are texting you your customers your clients all
this stuff so you just get sucked right back in
to the fast-paced lifestyle within just a few days and
that glow and that fulfillment that you tasted is just
completely gone you forget about it and the way that
it happens is it's really sneaky it happens to you
in such a way that you're not even conscious that
it happens to you you have to go to a
couple of retreats before you really start to notice what's
going on here but most people they just go to
one of these retreats once or twice in their life
and then for the rest of their life they never
experience that kind of level of fulfillment and peace and
satisfaction they had during these ten days never again to
them it's just like a vacation or feels like oh
it's just you know it's a temporary special thing and
I shouldn't expect to live my normal life this way
well what if we turn that around and what if
we made the bulk of your life like a the
pass and retreat you know very slow paced very conscious
very deliberate very mindful and very present so that you're
being more than you're doing and then there's going to
be short intervals in your life where you know you're
going to go and you're going to do some fast-paced
stuff here or there but those are going to be
sporadic moments basically the inverse of what you're living right
now so I want to help you to actually imagine
this let's do a very short visualization just a couple
of minutes here all right go ahead get seated sit
with your back up straight and close your eyes I
just want to quickly get you in touch with what
I'm talking about here all right so you're having your
eyes closed take a couple of nice deep breaths and
just relax get into the present moment clear any images
you have in your mind so your mind is completely
blank and now what I'd like you to do is
imagine what your life would look like and feel like
if you slowed your life down by 50% imagine what
your life would feel like and look like if you
slowed it down by 50% and just take a little
bit of time to imagine it especially the feeling I
want you to connect to the feeling how would you
feel if your life was slowed down by 50% how
would you feel in your body how would that impact
the quality of your life how would it influence the
fulfillment levels that you have on a daily basis how
would it affect your mood okay take a few final
moments to wrap that up okay good and now you
can open your eyes and we're done with that visualization
very very simple now the question is what did you
imagine did you actually get in touch with what it
would feel like and if you did it should have
felt nice right it should have felt very nice your
mind should intuitively know that slowing your pace down is
going to make you feel better it's going to influence
and improve your mood and the fulfillment of your life
now that's if you're if you're kind of wise and
you have a good a sense of intuition sup for
some of you you might be so sucked into the
fast-paced lifestyle that just by visualizing what I was saying
your mind might have actually visualized negatives and it might
have said like something like aw but then you know
I'm not going to be successful and you know my
life is going to be so boring and it's not
going to be exciting and it's not going to be
fun like this kind of stuff so if for you
this visualization wasn't a nice visualization but kind of a
negative visualization that just shows you how out of touch
you are with being you're addicted you're addicted to stimulation
and to success see and don't think this is a
good thing this is not a positive addiction this is
a very negative addiction because you're not able to be
fulfilled and your success realize this that your sex success
doesn't count for if you're not fulfilled you see the
only reason you're pursuing success supposedly in the first place
is to find fulfilment but those two things can diverge
and they can take you in opposite direction right fulfillment
can be over here and success can be over there
and they can just take you a thousand miles apart
so you got to be very mindful that what needs
to happen is you need to start to cultivate being
instead of doing this is a cultivation this is something
that is kind of an acquired taste at first especially
in modern society because we been so detached from being
that you probably haven't really connected to being four years
or even decades maybe you have to go back all
the way to your childhood to really get some juicy
memories of the sweetness and satisfaction of being rather than
doing or maybe you can think of something a little
bit more recent like a vacation you took or a
trip out to some national park that you took or
you know other kinds of activities like that maybe a
meditation retreat that you did something like that that can
get you a real palpable sense of what being is
and why it's so important why I'm stressing it here
right why are you talking about it you must strategically
declutter your life and to do that what this means
is you have to pull out of activities you have
to pull out of commitments pull out of hobbies and
you have to break relationships and ties with people and
this is all scary stuff to do you might not
yet see the value of doing this it might seem
like olio you know my hobbies they give me pleasure
and joy why would I pull out of those and
you know my activities you know hang out with my
friends and socializing and all the partying I do and
going to clubs you know this stuff gives me joy
in my life leo so why would I want to
pull out of those and what about my relationships you
know that's crazy to break relationships and ties with people
that's crazy why would I want to do that but
see that's exactly what I'm talking about is that you
do have to do this and this is a counterintuitive
move another one of those counterintuitive moves that we come
across so often in self actualization work more than just
doing this I'll get back to this point in more
depth but more than just pulling out of these things
what you also have to do this is the most
important part is that you have to keep saying no
to new stuff that comes by you so not only
do you pull out of hobbies and activities and friendships
and socialization relationships and all this stuff you pull out
of all that and then you're very very vigilant to
make sure that you don't reengage any other kind of
mindless activities which will inevitably come your way people will
come to you and they will tell you I could
do this for me and do that for me and
let's go do this together and let's go to the
movies and let's let's go to the beach and all
this kind of stuff and you have to say no
no no no no no no no no no and
you have to keep saying no for the rest of
your life because people will keep coming to you and
putting stuff and presenting it to you right these are
all distractions but they don't feel like distractions they don't
feel like distractions at first you have to spend a
few years just kind of like extricate yourself out of
this mire and muck this quagmire that you're in of
distractions and hobbies and then when you look upon things
that come your way you'll be like oh that's obviously
distraction but right now you can't see that and this
whole process is going to be very difficult very challenging
for you and the biggest challenge here goes way deeper
than just pulling out of a few hobbies or commitments
or breaking a few relationships what I'm really getting at
here here is kind of like the really bitter peel
that I want you to swallow and I want you
to kind of open your mind to this because this
is this is a very bitter pill one of the
biggest challenges in your life you're going to really self
actualize you're going to take this project on seriously is
that you can have to make a very counterintuitive long-range
strategic move to renounce material life altogether to do this
you have to be a strategic thinker I have an
F the talks about strategic thinking and some people watch
that episode and then they wonder well but how do
I apply this in my life you know strategic thinking
it seems kind of abstract how does this relate to
self-actualization well here's one example for you and I'll give
you more in the future but here's one very concrete
one strategically as a strategic thinker you see what will
happen if you keep living your life the way that
everyone around you is living your life you see that
if you do that you're going to get exactly the
same kind of results that they get and you see
that they don't get very good results your friends your
family your co-workers they don't get good results even your
successful rich boss he doesn't have good results in his
life he's not fulfilled with his life don't confuse success
with fulfillment so seeing this now your minds start to
see like oh there might be a counterintuitive move here
in the long term maybe what I got to do
is I got a renounce material life altogether because it
doesn't work and then you strategize you say okay how
do I do that what are the pieces got to
put together to actually follow through on this strategy and
basically what you have to say before you start implementing
is you have to just be honest with yourself and
say okay basically what I'm committing to is I'm committing
to not have a life I mean I'm alive and
I'm going to stay alive until I die but I'm
committing to you know in common parlance so as they
say to not have a life I'm going to be
one of those people who doesn't have a life so
that when a group of friends looks at me they're
gonna be like man that guy is a boring ass
person what is he doing he's got like a stick
up his ass he's no fun right because you've committed
to not having a life ever ever you're never going
to have a life anymore you see this is what
self actualization is you're committing to not having a life
but it's counterintuitive it's so counter to it's super counterintuitive
because in committing to not having a life actually what
you gain is you gain true life because the you
have now that you call life having a life that's
not a life that's you being a gerbil in a
wheel spinning round and round around that's not life you're
like a domesticated cow and you're calling that life and
what I'm showing you is real life which doesn't look
like life at first from your perspective right it's the
life of living out on the you know on the
prairie or out in the woods in the wilderness now
a domesticated cow once it gets comfortable being domesticated it
can rationalize to itself like well you know I don't
want to go out into the woods because that means
I'd have to like go uh roam for food that
might be difficult you know there might be wolves out
there and predators you know that might be dangerous and
you know I just want to stay safe and my
little herd and you're going to have that you're going
to have that you know the fear the fear of
taking this kind of leap into the unknown because it
sure feels like well Leo you know renouncing life not
having a license is not what I'm in for that's
not why I started after self-actualization and of course you're
right because you started self-actualization because your ego comes into
this process and it has this dream of the hyper
active lifestyle the glamorous lifestyle the lifestyle of success and
fame and luxury and all this kind of stuff that's
what you come into this with that's kind of like
the initial child childish little dream you have but we've
come to the point where we have to shatter some
of these dreams that you have and be adults here
and be mature and realize what we're really doing and
what we have to realize is that all of that
is this hyperactive lifestyle is complete there's no happiness there
no happiness and anyone that you point to some celebrity
or some friend of yours or a boss of yours
who you can point to and say what leo look
at that person you know he's super hyperactive he's super
successful and he lives a glamorous lifestyle and his lifestyle
is awesome he's so fulfilled no he's not he's not
fulfilled at all the reason he's hyperactive is because he's
not fulfilled a fulfilled person doesn't need to be hyperactive
you get this this is a very deep truth I
challenge you to actually go and find these people who
you think have a great hyperactive lifestyle that you want
to emulate I challenge you to actually look deeper at
what their lifestyle is like and look and actually examine
how fulfilled are they now that's a difficult thing to
examine because you usually can't ask these people and even
if you do a lot of times they'll lie to
you and they'll tell you oh yeah my life is
great ah because this is such such a subtle thing
fulfillment you know successful people lie to themselves about how
fulfilled they are all the time because it's scary as
to admit that all your success did not get you
the fulfillment that you wanted you could spend 10 years
building a company that brings in 50 million dollars for
you and then a time will come when that person
has to be honest with himself or not but the
time will come when he has to make that decision
of like do I admit that this 50 million dollars
in these last 10 years hasn't increased my fulfillment at
all or do I just you know at this point
it's a sunk cost and it's like I just I'm
just gonna keep doing going down this road because even
though the road is bleeding towards hell you know already
so far down this path that I have no other
options I can't turn back most people don't even have
the psychological awareness to see that this battle is going
on inside of them all this stuff is largely unconscious
that's why even talking to these people is not often
going to be helpful for you so be very careful
about assuming who in the you know in the popular
culture as far as celebrities go and so forth is
actually fulfilled so these people or not it requires a
lot of wisdom on your part I might even say
spiritual wisdom to see to really see that this materialistic
lifestyle that all your friends are living and that you've
been living up to now is is really pointless it's
really pointless and on your deathbed if you're lucky to
have that moment of just kind of being there and
reflecting on your life you're going to regret this you're
going to really really really regret this and you're going
to really wish that you listened to me right now
but it's very difficult to listen to me because you're
afraid of where this will take you you're afraid how
this might sabotage your already existing success and you're going
to feel guilty you're going to feel guilty of pulling
out of these social relationships and social obligations that you've
committed yourself to but let me tell you a little
bit more about the strategy so the strategy here that
I'm proposing is that you're going to create space in
your life to focus on only a couple of key
things and you're going to slice and minimize everything else
very ruthlessly so here are the key things there's only
like a handful of them I can count them on
two hands here are the key things that you need
to focus on in life every human being this is
true for every human being I don't care who you
are don't care if you're a wealthy CEO I don't
care if you live in Africa or in Asia or
in America or whatever your situation is you need this
this is it meditation enlightenment your life purpose learning or
education slow deliberate mindful action contemplation and being that's like
I don't know is that like eight things seven or
eight things those are the things that you need to
focus on in life everything else as far as you're
concerned you shouldn't even be concerned about all right this
means and this is where you're I'm going to get
some hate I'm you're gonna hate me for this but
oh well this means minimizing your fret chips your relationships
your family commitments your hobbies and any kind of entertaining
recreational fun activities that you have it means minimizing all
this stuff okay if you do this as a strategy
think about this be a strategic thinker what's going to
happen to your life think it through 10 20 30
years down the road if you do this now I'm
not telling you to become like a Unabomber who lives
in a shack and hates human beings that's not what
I'm saying and you know who never has fun so
don't take it to that extreme but just think about
it you're meditating you're focusing on enlightenment you're focusing on
your life purpose you're focusing on learning and education you're
focusing on deliberate mindful action you're focusing on contemplation introspection
and you're focusing on just being think about what happens
if you do that for 10 20 30 40 years
if you do that I don't know if your imagination
can even imagine this but your life would be extraordinary
I'll be ridiculously satisfying ridiculously satisfying and if you don't
do it if you do what the average person does
which is kind of just like diddle around with their
friends and do a little bit of work and some
hobby stuff and a bunch of family crap and some
you know fun entertainment go to the movies go to
the beach all this kind of you do all this
for 10 20 30 40 years what is your life
going to look like it's gonna look at the average
life you're gonna have a life you're not going to
really enjoy what you do you're going to waste a
lot of your energy on relationships that aren't even with
you anymore you're gonna waste hundreds and thousands of hours
and all this emotional labor on relationships people that you
don't even know anymore because these people will leave you
they will die on you they will they will divorce
you they will get angry at you you know all
this kind of stuff will happen and you're going to
disperse all your energy you're not really going to focus
on yourself you're not going to cultivate being you're going
to be crack it all the time hamster in a
wheel and then you're just gonna be like in your
60s and you're gonna feel like life hasn't really been
fulfilling you're gonna feel like you've kind of been cheated
at life and you're not even going to be motivated
anymore to go out and do anything big because you've
kind of felt like well I've already done everything and
nothing has really satisfied me and you're gonna really believe
that satisfaction is not possible by that point and that's
even a kind of a best-case scenario worst-case scenario you
get depressed anxious commit suicide that's not out of the
question not at the question all so many people are
depressed anxious total victims why not because you're not turning
in on yourself right you're not strategizing properly you're being
a stupid strategic thinker I've been doing this lately in
my own life I mean I've been doing this the
reason I can speak pretty confidently about this is because
I've been doing this basically since I was a teenager
since I was a kid even before I was a
teenager I've just kind of naturally been gravitating towards this
kind of lifestyle my life is not busy I don't
fill it with a bunch of activities a bunch of
entertainment and this and that and going here and going
there and travel and this and that and all these
social obligations I don't do that I have some of
that I'm not totally isolated but if most people would
look at me they'd say oh man your life is
kind of like simple it's kind of like even it
kind of looks from the surface it almost looks a
little bit like below average but let me tell you
it's not on the inside my life is like amazing
right where it counts it's amazing and lately just over
the last few months you know I've been I've been
making some tweaks to make it even more amazing by
just like recommitting to this strategy because there are times
where I kind of deviate from the strategy because I
just forget so in a sense this is as much
reminder for me as it is for you right but
my lifestyle is more like becoming more and more monastic
like that of a monk or like that of a
sage it's really the lifestyle of a sage that's what
I'm really telling you to do here create the lifestyle
of a sage so I've been kind of like trying
to implement that more and more in my life giving
myself more free time more free time to just pick
up a book and read it more free time just
to meditate for an extra hour if I want to
sometimes I'll meditate for 3-4 hours a day when I
do that I feel amazing I can't even describe to
how amazing I was meditating the other day man-bat meditation
session that that's 60 minutes of meditation was it was
more powerful and more rewarding than any orgasm you'll ever
have in your life and I'm not even that deep
into meditation I'm not even talking about a Samadhi experience
or an enlightenment Easterners I'm just talking about plain ol
just basic meditation with monkey mind still going on but
still that experience is amazing the rewards that come when
you turn inside and you really focus on yourself through
contemplation and cultivation of being is incredible it's incredible I
got these like flavors of going back almost a childhood
it feels like I'm back in childhood again that kind
of like that sense of just being that kind of
freedom of being a child of really being connected existentially
to reality without a bunch of mental filters and beliefs
and stories and you know schedules and having to do
this and that just being free like I had memories
of me being back in in school you know those
really fond memories of being back in school during the
summer vacations where you've got nothing to do you can
just like lay around the house do nothing and in
a sense it's kind of boring but also in a
certain sense it's like you're really connecting with life that's
what your life should be all the time your life
should feel like a summer vacation from school and you
better believe that's possible this is something you can create
that some of you cultivate but you have to decide
on as a strategy because this is not something you
just do in a week or in a month this
is a long-term strategy takes of years to really follow
through on this strategy not to mention its initially very
scary encountering too for me personally what this required to
start to implement the strategy is a required letting go
of success and goals I'm actually very successful oriented guy
I'm not some bohemian hippie I love success I have
a business that I run right um if the more
I work on my business the more money that I
earn so for me no this is that this actually
very tangible stuff but I have to let go of
that stuff so like recently I've been just kind of
like letting go of certain goals for my business certain
success goals certain financial goals I'll just push those off
you know for the next year not to say I'll
never pursue them again but just like I'm giving myself
more room more room to breathe more room to think
to contemplate to read to meditate to be so I've
been doing that and that's been a challenge but I've
been doing it and I'm still going to keep doing
that also what's required of me is to say no
a lot so when people come to me with stuff
like hey I want you to do this and do
that and why don't why don't we do this with
the business and what about this here and let's you
know let's go out and have fun unless you know
just do the social gathering thing and basically I just
say no like no no no no no no no
because I can see I can connect the dots I
see I connect the dot between where I am now
and when I may be on my deathbed I connect
those dots and I just see that when I'm on
my deathbed all this social that's happening it's not going
to matter it's not going to matter all this fun
entertaining stuff watching movies playing video games all this crap
you do is not going to matter what's going to
matter is your connection to being to reality are you
connected to reality are you conscious of your own existence
on a regular basis are you conscious of it like
once a month right so what this requires is a
cultivation of a spiritual connection to reality that's all spirituality
is it's not some voodoo spirituality is a connection to
the present moment as it is without all the that
your mind spins every single our of every single day
that's a connection that needs to be cultivated if you're
going to be attempting to implement the strategy remember that's
a long-term strategy and that you're not going to be
able to for the first few months it's not going
to feel like oh my god everything Leo told me
is coming true it's not going to feel that way
because you haven't cultivated a connection to reality probably for
years this is all new to you so it'll take
you some time to get it up and running but
let me assure you that it's going to be a
very worthwhile investment if you do and one final thing
that this will require of you it's been requiring it
of me is that you let go release and exhaust
your carnal cravings what I mean by carnal cravings is
cravings for food cravings for sex cravings for drugs cravings
for music cravings for fun entertainment and stimulation of every
sort you know whatever your favorite addictions are you have
to exhaust those release those because as long as you're
completely consumed by your carnal cravings you're not going to
be able to to execute this strategy so if you're
addicted to a bunch of those check out my episode
called overcoming addiction it'll help you with that and guess
what the solution to that is the solution is just
sitting and doing nothing that's the solution it's very simple
the problem is you don't want to do it because
you don't see far enough down the road to what
your current lifestyle is going to produce it's going to
produce the lifestyle that you think is great this kind
of westernized modern fast-paced lifestyle of success this is a
lifestyle it can't even come close not even close not
even in the same ballpark not even like three orders
of magnitude of closeness to the awesomeness that your life
will be like when you actually follow through on this
strategy that I'm telling you about of minimizing your lifestyle
and you execute on that for let's say five ten
twenty years come talk to me then after you've done
that you're gonna come talk to me you're gonna look
at me tears will pour down your face because you're
gonna know that this point right now was the turning
point that made the difference between life that was a
life that was meaningful for you and enrich and amazing
this life of being and the kind of shitty ordinary
mundane life of doing and success that you otherwise would
have lived right it's literally the difference between a a
a fully lived life and a life pissed down the
toilet that's the difference so the choice is up to
you all right that's it I'm out of here signing

now been implementing some of the stuff that I say
for a year or two and man I get emails
