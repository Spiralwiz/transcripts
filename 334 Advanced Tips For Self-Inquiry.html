            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Y23xkd2kqlo' target='_blank'>Advanced Tips For Self-Inquiry</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Initial misconception about enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that anyone beginning this process of a self-inquiry should understand exactly what they're looking for. Many approach self-inquiry with the assumption that it will culminate in a mystical experience or thing that can be found, not realizing that the goal is to achieve formlessness, which requires disengaging from all forms, ideas, sensations, and experiences that have been encountered in life.
</li><li><b>Mistake of seeking enlightenment from others</b>: According to Leo, one should not ask others for enlightenment or the 'answer'. Seeking enlightenment from others, be it from a spiritual guru, a forum, or a book is a futile endeavor because enlightenment is a profoundly personal experience that cannot be verbally or logically transferred from one person to another. It can only be discovered through individual self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Distraction from self-inquiry</b>: A hint from Leo Gura advises that asking others for the answer or seeking it in books or gurus are distractions from self-inquiry, the only way to attain enlightenment. Each time when engaging in self-inquiry, one should remind oneself not to get distracted or try to find shortcuts but focus inward and engage in the process.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment is formless</b>: The process of self-inquiry involves understanding that enlightenment is formless, unlike all other experiences that involve some form of perception or concept. It is crucial to understand that any idea, sensation, feeling, mental image, scientific model, or perception is not akin to the true essence of enlightenment and such things have to be detached from during the self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Hallmarks of self-inquiry</b>: Self-inquiry involves repeatedly coming to terms with and reminding oneself of the nature of enlightenment. The process entails turning inward, letting go of all preconceptions, distractions, and ideas, and relentlessly pursuing realization despite doubts and challenges. It demands a high level of resolution, focus, trust, patience, and a clear understanding of the concept of formlessness. 
</li><li><b>Misguided expectations about self-inquiry</b>: Narrator warns about having misguided expectations from the process of self-inquiry. The results are not instant and it can be a frustrating, confusing process. Also, expecting to have a mystical or spiritual experience can derail the process as the true pursuit is achieving formlessness, which is diametrically opposite to anything one has ever encountered in life.
</li><li><b>Who should practice self-inquiry</b>: Self-inquiry is ideal for individuals who are unfamiliar with the concept of enlightenment but are keen on exploring it. However, while beginners can use guidance, enlightenment can't be taught directly but has to be personally experienced. Thus, self-inquiry is recommended for those who have already embarked on the journey and seek additional tips to counter feelings of confusion or discouragement. 
</li><li><b>The importance of consistent self-inquiry</b>: Consistent practice of self-inquiry is emphasized. It needs to be understood that this process is a pursuit of nothingness or formlessness and not of a tangible needle. And even if it seems paradoxical, there is the assurance that it has been achieved by many before, so it's possible. Thus, despite the seeming contradiction, consistent self-inquiry is necessary to realize this state of formlessness.
</li><li><b>Distractions and hurdles in self-inquiry</b>: It's important to recognize that asking for answers from others, trying to rationalize enlightenment and looking for shortcuts are distractions in the process of self-inquiry. The mind's tendency to cling to formed ideas or phenomena can also act as a hindrance in the pursuit of 'formlessness' which is the goal of self-inquiry. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding assumptions in self-inquiry</b>: During self-inquiry, it's beneficial for practitioners to avoid making assumptions about the expected form of the answer they're seeking. Assuming that the answer lies in a mystical experience, or adhering to a particular shape, size, emotion, or quality is discouraged. Instead, the focus should be on detaching from all forms of qualities until a state of formlessness is reached.
</li><li><b>Self inquiry is a personal journey</b>: The journey to formless enlightenment is a personal journey that cannot be taught or transferred from person to person. It is impossible to capture or symbolize enlightenment as a mental image or scientific model. The process of enlightenment involves personal self-inquiry and can only be discovered through individual experience.
</li><li><b>The process of enlightenment</b>: For self-inquiry, we should remind ourselves that nothing is hidden or elsewhere. What we're looking for is the present moment as it is, which is absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>The illusion of self</b>: Enlightenment entails understanding that we are neither the body nor the mind. These constructs we carry are illusions and coming to this realization is a major part of self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>The importance of being present</b>: In self-inquiry, it's important to be conscious of the present moment and of the fact of existence right now. The essence of the process is honing in on this without distracting thoughts or ideas.
</li><li><b>Exploring different angles</b>: In self-inquiry, we can approach it from different angles or ask different questions. These could include "Who am I?", "What am I?", "What is reality?", "What is existence?", or "What is God?", but all these questions eventually come to the same point of becoming present to what is happening now.
</li><li><b>The challenge of self-conceptualization</b>: Our minds are often caught in the addictive habit of trying to conceptualize enlightenment. However, we need to understand that the mind will never be able to fully conceptualize or symbolize enlightenment as it is a state beyond forms.
</li><li><b>The dream-like nature of reality</b>: Reality itself is an illusion and akin to being in a dream. This realization is part of the awakening that comes with enlightenment. Becoming aware of this that can guide us in our self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Commitment to the process</b>: The pursuit of enlightenment is the most significant thing one can do and requires dedication and patience. Despite confusion, pain, or emotional labor over thousands of hours, the discovery of one's true identity beyond the body and the mind can be a life-changing experience.
</li><li><b>Questioning One's Identity</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of questioning your identity during self-inquiry. He compares believing one is the body and mind to accepting societal delusions, suggesting that this belief is wrong. He encourages using thoughts during self-inquiry to constantly question reality and one's identity as the body and mind. 
</li><li><b>Using Monkey Mind for Self-Inquiry</b>: Leo suggests that the 'monkey mind,' or erratic thought patterns, can be utilized for successful self-inquiry. He advises using the monkey mind to question deeply ingrained beliefs about identity, comparing this to the internal conversations he has during his personal self-inquiry sessions. 
</li><li><b>Challenging Identity and Bodily Feelings</b>: An important aspect of enlightenment work, according to Leo, is to challenge the identification with bodily feelings, thoughts, and sensations as evidence of your existence. He suggests questioning the process of identity formation and the certainty of one's identity as the body and mind. 
</li><li><b>Present Identification</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to be honest about one's present identification, moving beyond theories or ideas from books. He prompts viewers to consider which specific part of the body or mind they identify with and to reflect on what they truly believe they are. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Precision in Self-Inquiry</b>: In self-inquiry, Leo emphasizes the importance of precision and specificity. He recommends picking a specific sensation or object in one's present experience to identify with and question whether that is what one truly is. This process, he says, helps to expose false identifications and challenges the core of one's identity. 
</li><li><b>Challenging the Fundamentals of Existence</b>: Leo suggests that one should challenge even the most fundamental aspects of existence during self-inquiry. He encourages questioning the validity of sensations, feelings, thoughts, and even one's very identity, likening this process to dismantling the physical fabric of space and time. 
</li><li><b>On the Concept of Existence and False Identification</b>: Leo discourages viewers from automatically identifying themselves as nothing or God and emphasizes the importance of focusing on what is actual &mdash; or what is present in the current moment. He differentiates between content, like forms and objects, and existence itself and urges viewers to focus on existence during self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Highlight importance of systematic self-inquiry</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the need for a systematic approach to self-inquiry. Instead of jumping straight to considering oneself as "nothing," individuals should question each identification or concept they hold about themselves and eliminate it through the process of elimination. Skipping this step may lead to longer periods of self-inquiry, as deep-seated identifications may persist without systematic examination.
</li><li><b>Challenging the very core of one's existence</b>: Leo pushes the idea that each self-inquiry session should challenge the core of one's existence. Instead of casual or philosophical pondering, Leo suggests intensely questioning the existence of physical reality itself, including the floor below one's feet or the body itself, with the aim to dissolve the physical fabric of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding the concept of 'nothing'</b>: Gaining clarity on the term "nothing" as used in non-dual teachings is another tip from Leo. It should not be confused with the regular English term nothing, but rather is akin to everything or absolute existence. Considering oneself as 'nothing' prematurely can be more limiting than helpful in self-inquiry. 
</li><li><b>Focus on 'actuality' during self-inquiry</b>: Leo asks individuals to focus on 'actuality' during self-inquiry. Actuality refers to the present moment, separate from ideas about the future, the past, or theories. It is crucial to train awareness to focus on actuality each time one sits for self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing content from existence itself</b>: Another tip from Leo is to draw a distinction between the content of reality (forms and objects) and existence itself. To illustrate, he uses the analogy of the TV screen (existence itself) and the images displayed (content). One should attempt to shift focus from the content of consciousness to the fact of existence itself, which although slippery and elusive, is a beneficial switch for self-inquiry.
</li><li><b> Enlightenment as the constant</b>: The concept presented is that enlightenment is the one constant that exists across every moment of lifenot a specific state, emotional or otherwise. This understanding helps to orient and ground oneself during self-inquiry, avoiding mistaken identifications of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Existence of an ever-present element</b>: Leo Gura states that the object of enlightenment is an ever-present, eternal "thing" that exists invariable across space and time. This "thing" existed before the individual was born, when they were asleep, and will continue existing after death. This constant existence provides a ground for inquiry and clarifies any misinterpretation.
</li><li><b>The principle of change and impermanence</b>: With a simple practice of blinking eyes and turnings heads, Leo demonstrates the impermanence and changeability of perceptions and objects, suggesting they can't be the true self or enlightenment. Since perceptions, ideas, and the physical body didn't exist before the individual was born, they are not enlightenment. What existed before one was born is the true self.
</li><li><b>Difference between observation and trying to figure out</b>: Leo suggests moving away from trying to figure things out and towards pure observation. He emphasizes trusting in the power of pure observation, which takes time, patience, and focus, but reveals enormous insights in the long run. 
</li><li><b>Understanding consciousness versus thinking</b>: Leo promotes gaining an intuitive understanding of consciousness, distinct from thinking. He suggests the use of psychedelic substances to get a quick grasp of different degrees of consciousness, which can otherwise be hard to comprehend due to lack of comparative experience. The goal is to raise consciousness levels and become aware of existence.
</li><li><b>Naive Realist Paradigm</b>: Leo Gura advises to challenge the naive realist paradigm, our inherent belief in a physical reality as the basis of our existence and universe. This generally accepted view of reality is contrary to the true nature of existence, which Gura describes as a collective construct of hallucinations or dreams.
</li><li><b>Non-Physical Reality</b>: In Gura's explanation of reality, there aren't any physical substances, rather there's a spectrum of hallucinations integrating into the human perception of existence. He equates our lived experiences to dreams &mdash; nonexistent in substance, but cognizant in our minds.
</li><li><b>No Specific Process towards Enlightenment</b>: He clarifies that there is no definitive technique or process that guarantees enlightenment. Techniques can increase the likelihood, but the actual moment of achieving enlightenment is compared to a "fortunate accident".
</li><li><b>Differing Teachings on Enlightenment</b>: Leo discusses the opposing teachings of enlightenment &mdash; the Buddhist "no self" and the notion of a "true self". He suggests that these perspectives are not contradictory; instead, they offer alternative ways of examining the same concept. The teachings ought to be used flexibly, depending on a student's inclinations or preconceived attachments.
</li><li><b>Multiple Paths to Enlightenment</b>: Gura emphasizes that there are multiple valid paths to enlightenment, and it is individual-specific. It's non-productive to criticize other paths and make comparisons. He encourages focusing on personal growth and staying resilient against self-created distractions.
</li><li><b>Avoid Mechanical Meditation</b>: Gura advises against performing meditation or self-inquiry mechanically. The goal is to grow consciousness and awareness, which is not achieved through ritualistic practices without full awareness. He encourages maintaining heightened awareness at all times, and marks this as the essence of meditation  not specific techniques or formal postures. 
</li><li><b>Long Stretches of Focused Meditation</b>: He insists on long stretches of focused meditation or self-inquiry, noting that serious progress demands intense concentration. Daily sessions of meditation are beneficial but insufficient on their own. Gura suggests incorporating multiple retreats every year, with long hours of uninterrupted self-inquiry or meditation. 
</li><li><b>The Role of Fear and Terror</b>: Leo concludes this section by stating that experiencing feelings of terror and fear during self-inquiry can actually be a positive sign of progression, as these can indicate that one is getting closer to breakthroughs and enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Breaking Through Fear on Path to Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura stresses the inevitability of experiencing terror and fear on the path to enlightenment. The key to overcoming such fear is to continuously challenge it, despite the discomfort. It may feel like death, triggering an intense reaction akin to a panic attack. However, subsequent confrontations with this fear eventually desensitize individuals to it, enabling a breakthrough.
</li><li><b>Difference between Glimpses and Constant Enlightenment</b>: Gura warns against equating temporary mystical experiences or glimpses with true enlightenment. True enlightenment is an unchanging, constant state that survives all kinds of challenges, including death. Enlightenment, according to Gura, predates birth and extends beyond death. Therefore, individuals need to strive for this ultimate realization, irrespective of any initial breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>Degrees of Enlightenment</b>: Viewers are warned against assuming they have fully achieved enlightenment after a profound realization. Gura insists that this state has various degrees and depths, requiring continual exploration and self-inquiry. The ultimate form of enlightenment is so significant that life as known comes to an abrupt end.
</li><li><b>Building Mindfulness Abilities</b>: Using mindfulness with the labeling technique is strongly recommended by Gura as a way to fortify mindfulness abilities and aid self-inquiry. He adds that consistent use of this technique amplifies its efficacy.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Distractions</b>: Distractions are common occurrences on the journey towards enlightenment, increasing as individuals make significant progress. Gura states that the ego introduces these distractions to deter the pursuit of enlightenment. However, he assures listeners that commitment and vigilance can ward off these distractions, thereby securing the path to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Reality as Hallucinations and Dreams</b>: Gura describes reality as a collection of hallucinations and dreams, brought together to imitate substance and solidity. Enlightenment, he believes, is a shift from this conventional understanding of reality to the realization that it's all but a mirage.
</li><li><b>Relevance of Psychedelics in Boosting Consciousness</b>: Psychedelics, while not absolutely necessary, are pitched by Gura as valuable aids in self-inquiry through their ability to introduce individuals to what they're seeking. He, however, adds that using psychedelics is up to individual preference.
</li><li><b>Effect of Emotional Labor and Frustration</b>: Gura reveals that emotional turmoil, frustration, and commitment to hard work are part and parcel of the processes leading to enlightenment. Profound results ensue from this blend of emotional labor and dedication, culminating in a total realization of reality.
</li><li><b>The Ultimate Reward</b>: Gura emphasizes the unprecedented reward ensuing from a successful pursuit of enlightenment. According to him, the reward is the entirety of realityabsolute infinitydelivering the answers to life's greatest questions.
