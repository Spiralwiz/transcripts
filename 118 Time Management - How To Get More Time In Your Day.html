            <ul>
    <li><b>Time Management Paradigms</b>: The traditional paradigm involves trying to optimize schedules and fit more into the day, but this often doesn't work and can lead to stress. Instead, a minimalist approach can be more effective and sustainable over time.
</li><li><b>Reducing "Stupid" Tasks</b>: A significant part of effective time management is to recognize and stop engaging in unnecessary and unimportant tasks that take up time and don't contribute to one's life. Such tasks and commitments should be critically evaluated, questioned and, if possible, eliminated.
</li><li><b>Methodical Activity Evaluation</b>: A good practice in time management involves identifying and listing all activities and commitments, then critically assessing each to see whether it is really essential and how much value it is adding to one's life.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Essential Activities</b>: After critically evaluating all activities and commitments, one should focus on those that are essential, contribute significantly to one's life and align with their highest values. Any commitment that doesn't match these criteria should be dropped.
</li><li><b>Being a Self-Editor of Life</b>: One should consider themselves as an editor of their life, removing unnecessary aspects and commitments much like an editor removes fluff and extraneous content from a manuscript. Just as this editing improves the quality of a book, it can improve the quality of one's life too.
</li><li><b>Discipline is Key</b>: To properly manage time, a high level of discipline is required. One needs to be ruthless in cutting off unnecessary commitments and distractions, much like an editor cuts off irrelevant parts of a manuscript.
</li><li><b>Shift in Approach to Scheduling</b>: To achieve a more effective and less stressful schedule, individuals must undergo changes in their approach to time management Â– changing from a frame of mind that is all about doing more to one that is about doing less, focusing on what is truly important and contributes positively to their life.
</li><li><b>Notion of Minimalist Paradigm</b>: The minimalist paradigm in time management is about committing to less, reducing activities to those that are absolutely essential and contribute significantly to one's life goals, values and wellbeing. 
</li><li><b>Feeling of Overwhelm and Not Enough Time</b>: The feeling of being overwhelmed and not having enough time is not about a true lack of time, but rather the result of ineffective allocation of time and energies towards unimportant tasks and commitments.
</li><li><b>Starting with a Clean Schedule</b>: Begin by imagining your schedule is completely empty. With this mindset, only integrate things that are absolutely essential. By cutting out unnecessary commitments, your schedule becomes minimalistic, freeing up time to relax, think, and decompress.
</li><li><b>Taking Full Responsibility for Your Schedule</b>:  It is crucial to take full responsibility for your own schedule, meaning you should stop blaming external factors for your lack of time, like demanding bosses or hectic conditions in today's digital world. You have total control over your commitments and the tasks you choose to take on. Accepting this can lead to empowerment and can offer a sense of relief.
</li><li><b>Applying the 80/20 Rule to Your Schedule</b>: Use the 80/20 rule to decide what tasks to remove from your schedule. Write down all recurring tasks then identify the top 20% that contribute to 80% of your results or fulfillment, and then remove the remaining 80% that only generate 20% of your results. This opens up your schedule while still maintaining the majority of your desired outcomes.
</li><li><b>Committing to 100% Responsibility</b>: To truly gain control over your schedule, you must commit to taking full responsibility for it. This includes owning every commitment, realizing that every task on your schedule is within your ability to control or cut out and accepting the sacrifices that come with removing commitments.
</li><li><b>Creating a Productive, Fulfilling Schedule</b>: Aim to design a new schedule prioritizing performance, peace of mind, and happiness. Doing so will not only make you more fulfilled but also more productive and successful.
</li><li><b>Promotion of actualized.org</b>: At the end of the video, Leo Gura encourages the audience to visit actualized.org where they can find a newsletter with free exclusive content every week, including more life-management tips and strategies to optimize personal fulfilment and experience success without the usual hectic routines.
