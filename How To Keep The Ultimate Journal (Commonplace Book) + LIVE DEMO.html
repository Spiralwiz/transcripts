hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about how to keep the ultimate
journal your commonplace book stick with me throughout this whole
episode because towards the end I'm gonna show you a
live demo of my ultimate journal my commonplace book and
I'm gonna show you all the categories that I set
up and how I use it to really supercharge my
creativity but before we can get there we need to
talk about what is a commonplace book and why it's
so important this is one of those things that's so
practical that it will completely change your life as it
snowballs over the years over the years over the years
and I want to show you the effect that it
had in my own life so what is a commonplace
book a commonplace book is a repository of all your
knowledge every idea that you run across that strikes you
as important or significant or inspiring you write it down
and you organize it and you put it all together
into a sort of personal Wikipedia this is like a
scrapbook that contains notes clippings lists of goals to-do lists
random ideas that you have for projects and business ideas
and any kind of hobbies that you have any lessons
that you learn from books or from listening to videos
listening to me or any insights that you personally have
in your psychedelic trips or whatever sources you're getting your
insights from your writing all those down you have lists
of quotes drawings you can have Diaries in there where
you write down your intimate thoughts exercises that you do
personal development exercises consciousness work sort of exercises or whatever
you could have schematics picture tables lists of resources links
to stuff that you find on the internet like articles
that are very important that you've read you can have
screenshots and screen clippings of important stuff that you've seen
and it can just go on and on and on
you can have videos in there you can even have
audio in there all of this put together into a
scrapbook scrapbook sort of thing now this word commonplace book
it's a bit of a weird word why do I
use this book why don't I just call it a
journal most people would call it a journal well when
you say journal usually what that implies to me and
to most people is just like one page and it
just Scrolls down and down and down you're just writing
stuff down sequentially that's not what this thing is this
thing is much much more robust than your typical journal
so the alternative to that is personal Wikipedia that's how
I like to think of it that's how robust it
can be with links pointing to different places like that
so this word commonplace book I didn't make it up
myself this is actually a term that exists and commonplace
books became a popular tool for intellectuals thinkers and philosophers
in the era of early modern Europe so as Europe
came out of the Middle Ages we had the Renaissance
then we quickly had the Scientific Revolution then around the
French Revolution there was the Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire and
Rousseau and you can think about people like Rene Descartes
Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo Galileo Copernicus so all these people
who had a very significant long-lasting effect on European intellectual
tradition and of course Western your Western intellectual tradition that
has now not just in Europe but it's really affected
the entire world and of course it's here in the
United States so these thinkers started to organize all their
thoughts into commonplace books and so what this would be
I mean back then there was no computers no digital
stuff so it was just this gigantic book literally a
scrapbook where they would paste all the kind of stuff
that they ran across that was important to them pieces
of paper clippings and was it's very messy giant sort
of ultimate notebook you might think for a thinker and
what was so significant about that is that when you
take all these ideas that you randomly just run across
throughout your everyday life and you compile them together into
one source and then you can just look through it
and it's all organized and you can look through it
very quickly you can kind of scan it get a
picture of you and you can refer back to it
constantly then that has a very powerful effect on your
mind and it organizes this information in an interesting way
where your mind can pick out new creative insights from
all of that so that's what you need to have
why do you need to have it because it organizes
all of your learning and most importantly because it supercharges
your creativity it's hard for me to articulate how significant
my own commonplace book has been over the last five
years that I've been keeping it I've got hundreds of
tabs hundreds of categories in there literally thousands of pages
of information and it's all really densely packed it's not
like I'm just randomly writing down my thoughts like in
a diary I do have some Diaries in there that
I keep but mostly the information is like really dense
lists of ideas and insights and stuff for my business
and stuff for my personal life stuff for my own
growth and just ideas that I find interesting and all
this stuff when I look through it it organizes itself
in a sort of organic way that then I can
just by glancing at it for five minutes I can
get all sorts of spontaneous insights that would be completely
impossible without this thing in place without it I don't
think actualised org would be possible I started my commonplace
book in 2012 right around the time where I was
getting the idea the first inceptions for actualized org and
what ended up happening over the next five years is
that it just sort of built and built and snowballed
on itself and insights were had creative ideas were had
that would not be possible otherwise and it's not just
for my business and it's not just because I teach
personal development as a significant for me but also for
my own personal growth I've gotten so much of my
own personal growth actualized because of this because in this
book I have my values my purpose various visions that
I have for my business and for myself personally various
exercises that I've done over the years hundreds and hundreds
of various exercises journaling exercises and so on and it
just goes on and on it's hard to it's hard
for me to even bring to mind all the stuff
that's in there there's quite a lot which is why
you have it because you just can't contain that kind
of stuff all in your mind you see so really
the commonplace book is like an extension of your mind
and it overcomes the limitations of the mind because the
mind thinks in a linear fashion whereas this commonplace book
it's more like a tangled hierarchy and this sort of
network like a web which is much more powerful than
being able to just think linearly and also of course
it overcomes the problem of memory and all that sort
of stuff I actually bought a laptop specifically so that
my commonplace book could be portable back in 2012 and
at the time I was thinking like man do I
really want to spend $1,200 on a cute little portable
laptop for this purpose I thought it was kind of
being frivolous and just wasting money but what turned out
to be the case is that that one investment in
the infrastructure of my life and I've talked about in
the past infrastructure building infrastructure for personal development building infrastructure
for your own success I have a whole episode about
that well this is one of the most important infrastructures
that I put into place in my life and has
changed my life forever that's just been five years of
this thing being in effect so it's just gonna continue
to snowball and snowball and snowball and what I've seen
is that the growth from this sort of thing is
just exponential and it also excites you intellectually it excites
you it incites you creatively because you can always turn
to this thing to this commonplace book if you build
it robustly you can turn to it for ideas and
inspiration that is just never-ending it is infinite and then
you just add more and more and more to it
who is a commonplace book good for well first and
foremost for sages and philosophers for self actualize errs for
designers any kind of designers whether you're software design or
a clothing designer doesn't matter artists also any kind of
artists musicians authors and writers researchers scientists engineers architects entrepreneurs
and of course students so really every human being I
think needs to have one of these especially if you're
intellectually inclined you know some people hoard weapons as Arsenal's
because they love guns some people hoard golf clubs or
fishing equipment and tackle boxes because they love to fish
or some people hoard collectibles stuffed animals or stamps and
coins and all this sort of stuff but you know
what the most powerful thing to hoard is knowledge not
just knowledge but wisdom and also creative ideas so that's
what this commonplace book amounts to in the end is
it's a hoard of the best of the best ideas
and what's really amazing about ideas is that ideas are
the kernels and seeds of everything that you see around
you in your life so as much as we talk
about non-duality and the evils and dangers of the monkey
mind and how thinking is wrong and bad yes that's
true one hand but then there's also the other side
of that equation which is that even though thinking can
be problematic when you're doing consciousness work it's also really
important because thinking is what inspires you thinking is what
creates a vision what motivates you to go out there
and do stuff and in fact what motivates you to
go do consciousness work or to pursue enlightenment and thinking
is responsible for every single thing that you see around
you right now so look around you look at the
device or phone you're holding in your hand or the
computer screen you're looking at look at the building that
you're sitting in look at the chair that you're sitting
in or the sofa you're on or the shoes that
you're standing in look all around you everything you see
started from a kernel of an idea that hot that
happened in the human mind that's creativity at work so
if you want to really be powerful at executing on
your life purpose if you want to contribute creatively to
the world there's nothing more important to you than having
this very personalized commonplace book in place so let's move
on to talk about how to actually keep one of
these so how do you keep it well of course
the preliminary question is should it be digital should be
paper in the old days it used to be paper
nowadays I definitely favor digital because there are just things
that are possible with a digital commonplace book that are
just not at all remotely possible in a paper form
and I get it some people love the analog feel
of pen and paper and notebooks and I love that
too and sometimes I still take notes on pieces of
paper and I used to in the past but the
power of digital is amazing because we have software and
tools these days which allows you to do things that
are unthinkable for paper notebooks and you would you would
need a small personal library of notebooks to be able
to do everything that one of these software's can do
search features are especially important because you'd have so much
information and I need to search through it quickly you
can't do that with paper also there's formatting functions also
there's a lot of multimedia stuff like how are you
gonna have links to internet pages or articles or videos
or audios on your on your paper notebooks it's just
not gonna work so you need some kind of digital
repository and also digital is great because it can be
very very portable so I definitely recommend you go digital
which of course then leads to the next question of
which software is the best and there's a lot of
suffer these days that's out there Evernote Microsoft products Apple
products and all sorts of apps you have stuff for
your PC you have stuff for your phone you have
so for your laptop tablets combinations of all sorts of
things so I'll make it really simple for you I
found what I think is the perfect common book note-taking
software and it's Microsoft OneNote it's actually a piece of
Microsoft software that I think most people completely overlooked and
yet it's the most powerful piece of software in the
Microsoft Office suite it's more powerful than word more powerful
than Excel more powerful than PowerPoint and yet most people
don't really know about it and they haven't really tapped
into it what OneNote allows you to do is it
allows you to organize a bunch of digital notebooks and
tabs and it has all the features that you could
possibly want it's available for a PC it's available for
Mac and there's different versions of it it's easy to
get it's pretty cheap to get if you want to
get a used version of it you could if you're
scrapped for cash so that is my favorite software and
let's talk about the requirements that you need for a
commonplace book software so if you're going to toy around
with other kind of software keep in mind these requirements
and also this will show you why I think OneNote
is perfect because it really fills all these features perfectly
so the first thing you're going to want is you're
going to want your commonplace book to be portable now
it's a little tricky because portable doesn't necessarily mean that
it's on your mobile phone in fact I don't have
my commonplace book on my mobile phone portable I mean
laptop because what I think you need for a commonplace
book is a laptop with a real keyboard and no
not an iPad that doesn't count you need a real
keyboard and not even some of those stupid flimsy Windows
tablet things which are like those too and ones which
have a sort of flimsy flip-out keyboard you need a
real solid keyboard so you can type fast on this
thing and it feels good so what I recommend is
getting a laptop but not a huge chunky laptop get
a really small one I use a 11 inch MacBook
Air and so Apple has some nice light laptops or
you can find others Chromebooks won't work where at all
because OneNote I don't think is available for Chromebooks so
that's for Portability that allows you to use this commonplace
book on your couch different parts of your house it
allows you to go outside with it to Starbucks it
allows you to use it on your airplane in a
car that sort of stuff very easily now other features
that needs to be there you need a system of
robust tabs sections and categories so you're gonna have a
bunch of pages in it but then those pages need
to be organized in a multi-tier structure and that's exactly
what OneNote allows you to do some less robust note-taking
software it doesn't allow you to do this and it
doesn't have enough hierarchy so it's going to be challenging
for you to organize once you get hundreds and thousands
of pages of notes and stuff in there you need
of course a nice robust search function and OneNote covers
that you want different rich formatting abilities you want of
course bolding underlining different colors and highlighting and different texts
and fonts and you want all that to be very
easily applied and that also cleared Microsoft lets you do
that easily then you also want robust easy-to-use bulleted lists
I think this is one of the features that I
use the most within OneNote is bullet list I just
have lists and lists upon list and a lot of
these lists are tiered lists with different tiers and levels
of indentation in them I'll show that to you in
the live demo and you want to be able to
not just make these lists but then quickly reorganize them
all very easily and that's something that OneNote is awesome
at letting you do you want to be able to
create tables those are useful you want to be able
to do interlinking between different pages and that's something that
I see that some less robust note-taking software doesn't let
you do I don't just mean linking to a web
page I mean linking to an internal page or an
internal notebook within your commonplace book that's what lets you
create this sort of a Wikipedia effect you want options
for tagging you want options for quickly saving and loading
files in fact you want this to be completely seamless
you want this commonplace book to be so easy to
use that it's always on you don't have to open
an application you don't have to load a file you
don't have to save a new file every time you
jot down a note and that's what's so awesome about
OneNote is that it it's completely seamless I have it
on 24/7 on my laptop I'd never closed the application
I never have to even click the Save button on
it because everything is saved every five minutes automatically I
don't need to create new files the way you would
if you're working with Microsoft Word or something you don't
need to create individual files there all of it is
saved into one file and it's constantly open so you
don't even need to waste time opening up the application
and then that's that's the ideal situation there because you
have you have a lot of you have a lot
of sort of like friction usually for taking notes because
to take a note when you get a random idea
you have to like go get a pen pen you're
gonna go get a piece of paper write it down
file it somewhere make sure that you remember that then
you have to organize that also see that that is
an obstacle to you writing down all your ideas and
this commonplace book is supposed to make all that completely
effortless and frictionless you also want local storage so that
your files are stored locally which is what OneNote allows
you to do although some newer versions of OneNote are
now designed to only work in the cloud I've heard
that from people definitely don't use those versions use one
that allows you to do local storage there's some older
versions you can buy which work perfectly as a bonus
nice features to have are the ability to make screenshots
and screen clippings and insert that into your commonplace book
the ability to insert pictures to actually record your own
voice and audio take audio notes and stick them right
in there all of this OneNote lets you do drawing
little pictures and schematics and sketches and as a bonus
of course cloud sharing cloud backup and if you can
get it mobile access on your phone but I wouldn't
sacrifice all the above just to get mobile access so
there are a lot of apps that are available for
iPhone and Android users these days which are all centered
about mobile access but then they lack a lot of
these other features there is a OneNote for smart phones
you can get that the trick there is that it
is then have to be stored in the cloud I'm
not sure how that works with local copies I actually
don't use it because I I don't like taking notes
on my phone on my phone I just I do
sometimes take notes on my phone if I'm in a
in a bind and I don't have any other option
no piece of paper or anything but usually all write
down notes on a on a post-it note and then
I'll transfer into my commonplace book at some other time
so anyways these are all the features that you really
want and OneNote offers it to you so if you
could find some other application that does then great I
haven't explored all of them so you know people will
talk about Evernote I doubt Evernote has all these features
it has many of them but I don't think it
has it all of them if you're wondering whether you
can keep a commonplace book with just using Microsoft Word
definitely not that's highly inefficient or if you're thinking about
using notepad definitely don't use notepad Google keep I know
that one that's not robust enough either maybe you're thinking
oh maybe I can use some personal Wikipedia software there
actually is a possibility of setting up your own like
free wiki software and developing your own literal private wiki
I don't think that's ideal it's it's cumbersome there's all
sorts of coding and stuff that goes into it and
it's just not as as effortless as OneNote would be
so that's my case for OneNote I make a pretty
powerful case for it because well I don't get paid
for it it's not a sponsorship or anything like that
I don't have any affiliate links for it I'm just
talking about it because I love the software that's been
really helpful for me in the last five years don't
be lazy or cheap when it comes to investing in
your commonplace book invest in a good high-quality laptop which
is very portable has a good battery life and invest
in one of these software's like Microsoft OneNote I actually
use a version of Microsoft OneNote which is 2010 it's
quite old but it works perfectly for me you can
buy that on eBay for 50 to $100 if you're
worried about the expenditures here and don't sign up to
any stupid subscription services where they force you to these
days you know software companies love the subscription services where
they force you to pay every single month or every
single year for this sort of stuff to have access
to your own data no don't do that just go
buy an old copy on eBay and you pay once
and you use it for the rest of your life
and it works perfectly no problems you don't need internet
connection you just use it locally so without further ado
let's get into the live demo and I'll show you
how I run my own commonplace book that'll give you
some ideas for how you can set up yours all
right welcome to the live demo of my commonplace book
so this is my PC and this is my desktop
and I'll be showing you around here in a second
so I am screen recording this and if you're listening
to me on iTunes or mp3 audio that means that
you should go check out the video cuz all the
magic is gonna be happening here on the screen and
I don't think you're gonna get very much just by
listening to me but anyways let's get started so here
I have opened OneNote this is Microsoft OneNote 2010 edition
it's a little bit old but actually it has all
the features I want you can check out the newest
versions there are some even free versions but actually there
are limitations there that I don't like as is commonly
the case with software developers these days new versions tend
to be less not more than they used to be
which is rather unfortunate but you can experiment with that
and just see what will work best for you what
you like best if you want to buy this version
you can find a cheap copy on ebay very easily
a used copy so I am running this on a
Windows machine I'm just running it on my desktop here
because it's easier to record usually though I run it
on my laptop now I told you my laptop is
a Mac so you might be wondering how do I
run this on a Mac well there are Mac versions
but I don't use Mac OS whenever I buy a
Mac laptop for example I'll always install Windows on it
just because I need Windows because it's a lot more
flexible it allows me to do stuff that would be
unimaginable to do on a Mac and anyways all my
software and all my knowledge is windows-based so that's just
an FYI in case you were wondering about that disparity
so here we are in OneNote here's how it works
you've got a section here on the left you got
a section at the top and you've got a section
here on the right and then you got your formatting
options up here so on the left here we have
the highest level of organization these are like actual digital
notebooks which contain tabs here and then each tab contains
pages that can are gonna go down here so you
can see I've got three different notebooks and you can
have more you can create as many as you want
but mine are main misc and business so if I
click on misc and business you see the tabs here
they change the pages they also change because the pages
are connected with the tabs so this is the highest
level so let's just take the main and then if
we click on one tab here like blueprint this is
a product I developed fractionalize that'll work a long time
ago it's sort of antiquated so I don't really recommend
using it very much it's about four or five years
old maybe I'll work out in the future but anyways
so you can see that this is the tab there's
a page here and then there's a bunch of other
pages and you can click on those and you can
see what's going on here so that's how it works
pretty simple so let me show you how to create
new tabs if you want create a new tab you
just click this button here boom got a new tab
we can name it we can give it a title
usually I erase this stuff I don't need the dates
although you can use those if you care about it
and then you can just start typing away like this
if you've got a idea you got to write down
real quick that's your note right there and OneNote puts
it into a little nice floating text box which you
can drag around and you can resize and what's really
cool is that if I click here and I just
start typing again it'll create a second text box you
see how it works and these text boxes are very
flexible that are resizable they scale and they stretch as
you type they can go infinitely far down there's no
limit to how long your pages can be they can
go on forever so this is very convenient by the
way if I want to re color a tab I
can just right click on it choose a different color
let's pick teals to see now it's teal colored this
changes to teal color if I want to create a
second page I can do that page number two and
put stuff here and see now I've got the first
page in the second page I can rename this page
number one there you go and of course we can
change the order of these pages we can add more
pages as many pages as you'd like the order of
these pages is easy to change like this like that
see and of course the tab itself you can change
the position of this tab you can put it anywhere
you'd like like that let me show you some other
features that we've got here so of course you've got
all your standard formatting functions like you can bold stuff
you can change the size of fonts to your heart's
content you can color them any color you want you
can highlight stuff in a ton of different colors like
so what else can you do you can create lists
so let me show you how that works so if
I want a list I just click like this very
easy I can also convert this entire thing into a
list just by doing that now you might say so
what you know every software has lists Microsoft Word has
lists but not like these let me show you what
I mean so let's say I type a BBB see
here's what you can't do in Microsoft Word you can't
grab an item on a list and just drag it
like this too quickly reorder stuff lists for me are
the bread and butter of all my notes I don't
write long paragraph notes I don't write you know diary
entries I make lists of stuff it's very condensed it's
very easy and then what I do is I just
manipulate the lists so I can just drag it to
indent create all sorts of deep structures like this if
I want to I can take this entire thing here
and I can just drag it over here like that
see quickly rearrange stuff this is impossible to do in
most software and yet this is something that I do
all the time here super valuable what else I can
do is I can use the tag functions which are
really nice a tag is just a little icon that
you put next to an item so like this a
star question mark a to-do box you can actually check
this off mm-hmm there's all sorts of stuff exclamation points
but these are not just aesthetic these are functional because
if I click on this button fine tags OneNote pulls
up this tag search which pulls up all the tags
on every page throughout the whole notebook and I can
quickly search through the specific items that I've tagged so
for example I will use this gold star very very
often to tag the most important item so if I
have a list like this and I have this item
which is most important I will tag it with that
gold star so that I can easily see it and
of course if I drag it around the gold star
comes with it and it doesn't even need to be
a list item it can just be a regular like
this line I can just put a nice little gold
star next to it pretty cool what else I can
do is I can create tables very easily right on
the fly you just type and then you press tab
type tab type tab type tab type tab and and
then enter to create the next row like this and
of course you can quickly resize stuff here you can
do things like that and of course you got a
individual text box you can even overlap them in case
you would want to do something so crazy but yeah
you have all these kinds of options and that's not
all it goes on we have all sorts of multi
media functions which are really cool of course you can
insert images right into here you can do screen clippings
from the internet you can do hyperlinks so if I
want to turn this into a hyperlink to some online
website I can do that even better let's say I
want to turn this into an internal link so I
want to make my own sort of personal Wikipedian let's
say I have something important over there on some other
page some other tab that I want to link to
I can just see I can just find that tab
here and then let's say I want to link to
life purpose page see and if I click this look
what happens it takes me to the tab it opens
the tab and it takes me to the page not
only that I can even link to a specific line
so if I want to link and have me jump
right here I can do that and that turns out
to be a super valuable structuring tool you can make
some very complicated documents using all these sort of structures
whereas with Microsoft Word you couldn't do that because you
have all sorts of different individual documents linking them is
a challenge because then you're renaming them as soon as
you rename them that breaks your links and you have
to have folder structures and you have problems you can't
rename your folders so you see all sorts complications arise
that do not arise here other multimedia functions you can
insert files like PDFs and so on you can even
record audio and video directly into here and it will
spit it out right here with a player and you
can click the button you can play it so audio
recordings if I just click this button I can record
my audio I won't do that now or a video
if you have a webcam you can do that there's
all sorts of calendar functions equations and symbols and for
the artists in the audience there are drawing tools which
are super cool I'm just using a mouse here so
it looks ugly as hell but if you had a
tablet one of those Windows machines with a tablet then
you could really do some creative stuff here you see
and see you're not going to some third party paint
application it's all happening right here very seamlessly which is
what's so what's so awesome about it of course there's
a very powerful search function so if I click control
F I can search and find stuff right on the
page like if I type in the letter with the
number one there you go see what it did is
it highlighted one one one one all the instances of
one were highlighted but what's really powerful about the search
there's an advanced search which lets you limit where you're
searching so you can search on this page or on
this whole tab all these pages or you can search
across this entire notebook all these tabs or you can
search the entire commonplace book all these notebooks so that
level of specificity is super useful to you when you've
got a very large bulky commonplace book going which you
probably will after years of doing this stuff and perhaps
lastly the most cool feature that I love about this
is the auto saving feature of OneNote so the way
that I run OneNote is as follows I just leave
it on my laptop running 24/7 I wrote I leave
it running for months at a time I never opened
files I never closed files I never save files I
never rename files none of that ever happens all I
do is I just open this thing and I start
typing away the only things I have to name or
rename or or move is these tabs really I very
rarely need to create a new notebook just these tabs
and then mostly pages and that's it it auto-saves about
every five minutes so everything is saved the program runs
very stable II it doesn't crash I don't think I've
ever had it crash on me in five years they're
using this thing so that's great and just try to
imagine how you would pull that off it's something like
Microsoft Word where you would have to be again renaming
all your files changing stuff even just opening a word
file it takes half a second but still that's half
a second too long and then saving it yet I
remember to save it and then you got to give
it a name to save it no that's a pain
in the ass and so that's why you don't take
notes as much because it's not effortless when you have
a system like this it becomes so easy and so
painless that you start taking a lot more notes and
everything just works it's quite perfect so that's it as
far as the features now let me show you how
I organize my tabs and let me just start by
cautioning that of course this is a very custom thing
that you want to customize to yourself so don't try
to copy me just to copy me you are gonna
have your own requirements if you're an artist or an
engineer or a programmer or whatever you're gonna need your
own tabs your own structure but of course some of
this stuff is universal so for example let's start with
goals everyone I think needs to have a goals tab
and these are some of my goals not all of
them and actually some of these are outdated a lot
of my goals I just keep in my head these
days bother to write many of them down but if
you're starting off like when I started off years ago
I would write down hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
goals so you can organize your goals by year by
month by week by day you could have big goals
little goals you can have business goals personal goals personal
development goals fitness goals whatever so that's a great one
I have you can have different pages for different types
of goals I have some old pages here I usually
would organize goals by year and I have different old
years here and of course I'm not showing you everything
so I'm gonna be going through these tabs here and
showing you stuff but don't get the impression that this
is exactly how it is for me I have deleted
and moved and redacted some stuff here just to make
sure that this information is not abused by people so
you're getting a little just a little preview don't get
the impression if this is all that I had that
these are all my goals that's not how it is
at all this is just to get you an idea
all right speaking of ideas the next tab is called
ideas so these are designed for typing any kind of
random ideas I have for about for my business or
for other stuff that's what I have this one for
blueprint I already showed you a little bit of this
this is a product I worked on a long time
ago for actualized org I don't talk about it much
because it needs a lot more work to really be
useful to people in the way that I'd like maybe
I'll do the work later but for now I just
want to use it as an example to show you
how you might structure something a little more complicated in
the sort of private wiki fashion so see I would
have different pages click on them there's I have hundreds
of pages here and this is a really good way
to organize a book that you might be writing or
a big project you might be working on the book
notes tab you definitely want to have one of these
if you're a voracious reader like I encourage you to
be here's just one example of a book and it's
notes that I took again it's just a simple list
with a couple of indentations here and there but no
fancy formatting just very clean and simple and of course
don't get the impression this is just one book I
mean for every new book I would have a new
page and again I removed some stuff here just to
prevent people from abusing it because some of these books
I put on my book list and some of these
I recommend and the life purpose course as perks and
bonuses for people who support actualized org because this thing
does take money to run so that's the book notes
I've got hundreds if I keep scrolling down there you'll
see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds well maybe not hers
but dozens at least many dozens of notes that I've
taken then i've got product notes which is basically the
same sort of tab as this one except there i
put all the seminars i watch video courses i take
audio courses that sort of stuff workshops i go to
meditation retreats i'll take notes on all those and i
basically just do one page per product ttc notes this
is just some college lecture notes that I was taking
here journals this one you'll definitely want to have so
one of the problems when you have all these tabs
and all these categories and all these pages is that
when you have an idea you're not quite sure where
to stick it and that actually takes mental resources to
figure out where does something belong because sometimes a thing
belongs in three different places you're not sure where to
put it so in that case what I do is
I come here I created just one generic catch-all chronological
journal so here this is like my diary so if
I want to jot down a quick idea I just
come up here on the first line and I type
in today's date and I jot down my ideas or
whatever and there it is and then I just keep
keep doing that you see and then tomorrow I'll do
this like that and it just keeps going it keeps
scrolling down and down and down and down and I've
got if I keep scrolling there's literally hundreds of pages
it all goes all the way back to 2012 now
of course I don't take notes here every single day
necessarily I mean you could that would be a journaling
habit and that's probably great if you're new to this
sort of work I don't find that I need to
journal every single day maybe I will in the future
but you know usually I only journal when I have
something that I I need to put there which doesn't
belong easily in some other tab a lot of the
work that I do these days I put into my
business tab rather than here in this journal so and
of course that was just one page what I do
on top of that is I created dedicated specific journals
for specific things that I'm working on so if I'm
doing yoga I'll have a yoga journal if I'm doing
some other Sedona Method I'll have a Sedona Method Journal
if I'm doing some other kind of thing like my
meditation or my enlightenment or my trip reports or whatever
I'm doing I'll have a separate journal dedicated to that
activity so that can be quite useful the next tab
is quotes I actually have an index here of different
types of quote serious Coates funny quotes I also have
other quotes that are listed in other areas not here
see if I just show you the serious quotes this
is a list of all the most profound quotes that
I've ever found and no this is not the full
list it's just a sample I can keep scrolling down
it'll continue for dozens and dozens of pages of awesome
inspiring quotes and you can have different pages for different
types of quotes you can categorize and organize them however
you want I also have this me tab the me
tab is basically all the private personal stuff about myself
like my vision my values my greatest fears my biggest
obstacles and stumbling blocks stuff that I need to work
on stuff that I have already solved in myself you
know stuff about my health etc so I have different
pages for all that sort of stuff I'm not going
to go into it because that information can get abused
so I'll just protect that privacy here for now but
you know you definitely want to have something like this
in fact if you took my life purpose course there
I showed you how to create a Mii sheet this
is the me sheet here where I show you how
to list in one area all your values your strengths
your your domain of mastery your life purpose and all
that something how to figure it all out that's what
I cover in the life purpose course the next tab
is the actualize that org tab which has a lot
of different pages here which all have to do with
structuring all the information for actualized org and for the
business not just for the videos themselves but here on
this page as these are the video topics so I
just have a long running list of thousands of items
I can keep scrolling down and it'll just keep coming
down and down and down and down forever of all
sorts of topics now of course this doesn't mean that
I'm going to shoot a topic on every single one
there's way too much for me to shoot it would
take me a lifetime to shoot them all I literally
couldn't do it in my lifetime if I was shooting
one every day I couldn't do it I would die
from exhaustion so these are just ideas I come here
to inspire myself at anytime I get a new idea
just plop it on this list and then later I
come back and I just scan through the list and
I find topics that I like and I shoot stuff
on that but again this list goes all the way
down but I'm not gonna scroll down because I want
to keep a little bit of surprise I don't want
to spoil the fun for you the next tab is
a neuro feedback tab I was doing some neurofeedback training
and I needed to take notes on it and have
various logs and stuff so here's an example of how
you might do a chart so for example see if
I do basically one row per week and then I
have columns for day seven columns for seven days and
then if I succeed in doing my training that day
I just put an X like this see that's what
these tables can be good for so that's that's how
I did that I mean there's a lot more here
but I'm not showing it to you just because also
the other thing is that I noticed that when I
show when I show very detailed things to people in
a sense it also is a disservice to them because
they see it and then what they do is they
just start copying it like a monkey without doing it
for themselves it's sort of like getting answers from the
back of the book just because you have the answers
in the back of the book doesn't mean you understand
a damn thing and so I don't want people like
going through this stuff and trying to copy all this
stuff not because you know it's gonna hurt me per
se but it's just it's gonna hurt you sitting there
poring over this information that's not what you want to
do nor do you want to get so invested in
my own life that you need to pour through this
stuff it's kind of silly anyways the next tab is
psychedelics and here I have notes on various psychedelic substances
and I have trip reports and all sorts of psychedelic
related stuff like for example here I'm in a chart
of various substances methods of ingestion dosages small medium large
doses durations notes comments and stuff about that this is
very useful to me but again don't just copy a
blindly like a monkey because some of this stuff might
be outdated some of it might be wildly inaccurate so
you can't just copy stuff like this and expect it
to work I mean this is serious stuff if you
get one of these dosages wrong if you kill yourself
or have a terrible terrible trip so be careful about
that you got to do this own reason you know
this research for yourself your own research I have various
trip reports that I've written and insights from various trips
and trip logs here where I keep a log of
every trip I took how long it was what happened
so these are just notes for myself to remember so
that concludes the first notebook then of course I've got
the miscellaneous notebook which is just more random stuff like
I have recipes here that I like I have my
old PA log here I have some old archive where
I throw stuff I don't use anymore I have coaching
notes where I was taking notes on how to improve
my coaching when I was doing life coaching one-on-one with
clients then I have my business no book business is
a lot of stuff so here's where I develop my
courses for example the life purpose course was developed here
I have all these pages related to my life purpose
course all of it is in their life purpose books
those are related to the life purpose course I have
my book lists here with all the different book lists
I'm not showing it here so that not to spoil
it for people the reprogramming course this is a new
course on working on for reprogramming your subconscious mind it's
still in its early phases of development Leo's resources also
another thing I'm working for you guys is to get
you some really good reviews of resources you can go
to online resources seminars and other places like that that
would be great for your self-actualization journey and then the
epistemology book this is actually my most voluminous tab I
have the most content here I have hundreds hundreds hundreds
hundreds of pages I can just keep scrolling down and
down and down and there's a lot of stuff here
this is for my book that I'm writing don't ask
me when it's getting released it's a year's away maybe
five years maybe ten years I don't know how long
it'll take this is very complicated stuff very nuanced tough
there's insights here that I haven't shared with you guys
and won't be able to share with you guys through
videos and maybe for years to come because it's very
complicated it's it's nuanced it's very difficult to articulate sometimes
and it takes a lot of work to develop it
and I've been working on already for a year or
more and I've got all sorts of quotes related to
a different pages here I have various kinds of outlines
I have actual stuff that I've written paragraphs and entire
pages and chapters some of it that I've written and
all of that is in here so there you go
those are the notebooks this is how it works I
showed you the formatting you get the idea I hope
that this has inspired you make sure that you customize
it and tailor it to your own needs and if
you're inspired go start your own right now so there
you have it that's how you can set up your
own commonplace book let me just guide you a little
bit with the ultimate vision here I want you to
just imagine what will happen if you set this up
in your life starting tomorrow and then every single day
for the rest of your life until you're dead which
will hopefully be decades and decades you will keep adding
all of the insights all the juicy quotes all the
creative ideas that you have throughout your day throughout your
life all the books you read all the audio books
all the stuff you learn for me you just keep
putting it all in there all in there all in
all the stuff you find online links and videos and
audios and pictures and you just cram this thing full
of that imagine if you had a resource like that
in your life and then think about what your life
purpose is what your career is and how that could
supercharge the creativity in your career whether you're an artist
or a designer or a teacher or a a serious
student a PhD student or research or a scientist whatever
it is or maybe you're just doing personal development and
you just want to get the most out of my
content just imagine what would happen if you keep doing
this imagine if you keep keeping journals and Diaries and
doing exercises within these journals and then you can always
reflect back and you can keep building on that year
after year after year imagine what that would do for
you and then go and do it that's it this
commonplace book is just a very practical technique alright I'm
done here please click the like button for me and
come check out actualized org I've got my blog where
I'm posting insights almost on a daily basis these days
the forum which is it seems like the forum is
is getting fired ups getting better and better over time
it seems like the people who were there initially who
were just kind of bullshitting and trolling and stuff that
a lot of them left and now what we have
is we have people left who really care about helping
you grow helping themselves grow so you can get some
valuable insights and advice there and just some inspiration from
fellow self-actualize errs go check out the forum the life
purpose course the book list and all have more resources
for you in the future so that's basically it but
let me just reiterate that see this episode here you
might think Leo why don't you make more episodes like
this it was very practical your other stuff is very
abstract and theoretical and philosophical I'm an extremely practical guy
despite what my abstract episodes might lead you to believe
what you need to get good at is you need
to get good at taking the theory and all the
abstractness and then actually boiling it down to concrete stuff
like this and believe it or not you can do
that everything abstract I talked about you can take and
you can distill it down into concrete steps for how
to actualize it in your life that's something you have
to get good at don't expect me to be like
a mother bird regurgitating practic every practical step-by-step technique into
your mouth you got to learn how to do that
for yourself I talk about a lot of high-level stuff
because if I have to go into every technical detail
of how to actualize every big picture thing that I
talk about I would need 10 lifetimes to do it
there's just so much stuff to talk about here all
right so the abstractness doesn't mean it's impractical it just
means you have to go to extra steps you have
to actually put some thinking and put some skin into
the game start taking action and that's ultimately one of
what I want you to start doing is start taking
action on everything that I'm saying all the little things
I give you little hints little exercises here and there
little ideas for what you could do to get this
stuff functioning in your life because if you're not getting
it to function in your life is just mental masturbation
it's just ideas ideas in and of themselves they can
be powerful but you got a couple it with pragmatism
and putting stuff into practice implementation the most successful people
have a rapid speed of implementation that means as soon
as they hear a cool idea they go and they
they get to work to implement it into their life
the very next day just like you should be doing
with this commonplace book build your infrastructure for self-actualization build
your infrastructure for consciousness work build your infrastructure for your
life purpose for your creativity and stay with me or
more in the future you
