            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/DV7a-N3-nkw' target='_blank'>Building Your Existential Vocabulary</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The importance of understanding fundamental words</b>: Leo Gura, in this video, emphasizes the importance of understanding and contemplating fundamental words and concepts such as "reality," "awareness," "self," "reason," "experience," etc. These words, he argues, carry much deeper meanings than we commonly perceive and forming clear definitions of these from multiple dictionaries can help us develop a clearer understanding of life. 
</li><li><b>Impact of vocabulary on perception</b>: Leo points out that our vocabulary shapes our thinking and, consequently, our experiences of reality. He asserts that the most potent vocabulary comes from understanding basic concepts rather than using complex and exotic words.
</li><li><b>Reviewing metaphysics and philosophy</b>: Leo discusses the implications of metaphysics and philosophy, stating that whether or not someone actively engages in them, they subconsciously follow the default metaphysics of their culture. As a result, they limit their understanding of reality without questioning it.
</li><li><b>Critiquing education system</b>: He criticizes the education system for focusing heavily on teaching advanced vocabulary while neglecting the comprehension of fundamental concepts like reality, time, space, etc. He argues that the significance of these basic terms is often overlooked.
</li><li><b>Leveraging internet resources</b>: Leo encourages the use of online resources like Google and digital dictionaries to understand definitions. He suggests keeping a log of these words and their meanings, and 
</li><li>everyday contemplation on how these words interlink and affect the conceptual understanding of life.
</li><li><b>Overemphasis on complicated language</b>: Leo shares his experience of academia and the unnecessary complexity of language often used to sound intelligent  a practice he finds pointless for practical, everyday life. He argues for clarity and simplicity in communication for effective knowledge transmission.
</li><li><b>Understanding the limits of language</b>: Leo also talks about the limitations language places on our thoughts and perceptions. He argues that language can often deceive the mind, leading to misconceptions, making it crucial to study the limits and implications of language. 
</li><li><b>Lifelong commitment to understanding language</b>: Leo recommends making a lifelong commitment to understanding fundamental words and their origins that form the basis of our reality and life. He also emphasizes studying the subtleties of language as a part of furthering one's comprehension skills and strengthening the mind. 
</li><li><b>Use of technology in language learning</b>: He suggests using technological tools like smartphones for immediate research on unfamiliar words, which can contribute significantly to improved language skills and more articulate thought processing. 
</li><li><b>Interplay of enlightenment and thinking</b>: Leo advises against the misconception that enlightenment equates to thoughtlessness. He asserts that clarity in thinking can aid the pursuit of non-duality, promoting a synergy between understanding and existential enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Transcending language for non-symbolic experiences</b>: Leo discusses the possibility of transcending the limits of language for non-symbolic experiences of reality. He emphasizes that formulating and sharing insights on such experiences can be a challenge due to their abstract nature, but it's necessary for effective teaching and communication.
</li><li><b>Struggles with content creation</b>: Sharing his personal experience with content creation, Leo expresses the challenges he faces in maintaining content quality without repetition, expressing complex topics simply, and maintaining audience engagement.
</li><li><b>Understanding of basic concepts</b>: Leo points out that most people struggle to articulate basic concepts such as existence, time, space, matter, and energy. Individuals often use circular definitions, thus demonstrating their lack of understanding. 
</li><li><b>Science and fundamental concepts</b>: Despite the meant-to-be fundamental nature of science, scientists often ignore or inadequately define concepts like time, space, matter, and energy. They generally focus on manipulating these elements as variables without fully understanding their essence, often dismissing deeper contemplation as metaphysics.
</li><li><b>Results of superficial understanding of concepts in science</b>: Although the practical aspects of science have led to many technological advancements, this superficial approach to understanding leaves several unanswered questions and loosely defined concepts, resulting in a perception that science is more complete than it actually is. 
</li><li><b>Importance of articulation</b>: Articulation serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it facilitates communication and persuasion, essential for teaching principles and concepts. Secondly, it allows individuals to clear misconceptions and deepen their understanding by forcing them to define and explain complex concepts. 
</li><li><b>Difference between implicit and explicit knowledge</b>: Most people know things implicitly, meaning they haven't spent time thoughtfully defining or understanding them. Leo emphasizes that being explicit about knowing the meaning of words and concepts is advantageous.
</li><li><b>Learning and improving vocabulary</b>: Leo shares his own experience of learning English as a non-native speaker and emphasizes the importance of actively learning and looking up the meanings of words.
</li><li><b>Clarity over complex language</b>: Leo points out the tendency among academics and philosophers to use complicated language, which he believes makes their ideas less accessible. He prefers to use simple, clear language to communicate his ideas, valuing clarity over sounding academic. 
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding often results from complex language</b>: Complex language can often mask the simplicity or flaws in the original ideas, leading to misunderstanding and erroneous interpretations. Leo emphasizes the importance of keeping communications clear, simple, and straightforward.
</li><li><b>Understanding Concepts Implicitly vs Explicitly</b>: Leo accentuates the difference between implicit and explicit understanding of concepts. Implicit knowledge refers to effortless understanding usually acquired in early life, while explicit understanding involves intentional, conscious knowledge. He indicates that language and mind go hand in hand and are more slippery than we think. By consciously crafting a solid grasp of essential concepts, one gains an in-depth knowledge about the building blocks of reality and disputes the mainstream notion that our understanding of reality is complete.
</li><li><b>List of Words to Explore</b>: Leo provides a list of fundamental words and concepts while emphasizing the importance to search their definitions immediately when they arise in everyday life. Some of the words he suggests people explore are reality, existence, time, energy, matter, perspective, truth, God, science, religion, consciousness, wisdom, insight, creativity, philosophy, mindfulness, and enlightenment among others.
</li><li><b>Criticism Towards Rationalism and Atheism</b>: Leo criticizes rationalists and atheists who dismiss concepts such as 'God' and 'spirit' without fully understanding the meaning of these words. He mentions the importance of studying the limits of science, arguing that people who claim to be champions of science often overlook its limitations.
</li><li><b>Understanding Etymology and Synonyms/Antonyms</b>: Leo encourages his listeners to examine the etymology of words to understand their historical derivation and how language evolves, which provides deeper insight into their meanings. He suggests exploring the Greek and Latin roots of words, and studying synonyms and antonyms to comprehend the nuanced differences in meanings.
</li><li><b>Journaling and Lifelong Learning</b>: Leo recommends maintaining a journal to document word exploration and insights, emphasizing how this can enhance ones overall understanding of life, improve communication skills and thought clarity. He suggests making a lifelong commitment to exploring basic, fundamental words which represent the building blocks of life and reality. He concludes that such a habit will provide profound knowledge and skill over time, not just for personal understanding but also public communication and teaching.
</li><li><b>Teaching Basic Concepts</b>: Leo explains the importance of teaching basic concepts including 'God' and 'spirituality' to people around us such as family, friends, coworkers and so on. This doesn't demand a lot of time and can be done in as little as five minutes a day or a week.
</li><li><b>Value of Basic Vocabulary</b>: Leo emphasizes the impact of language on one's cognition. Understanding and discussing basic vocabulary can significantly shape one's perception of reality. This effort, though initially seeming insignificant, will gradually bring about noteworthy changes in various aspects of life, including relationships and self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Importance of Technology in Language Learning</b>: With the advent of smartphones and internet, searching for word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and etymology has become easier than ever before. Leo encourages using these tools to continually enhance vocabulary, which over the years can lead to expertise in language understanding.
</li><li><b>Technique for Non-native English Speakers</b>: Leo stresses the necessity for non-native English speakers to invest more time in understanding and learning English words. Commitment to learning new words enhances language mastery and gives a deep appreciation of language which most native speakers take for granted.
</li><li><b>Avoiding the Trap of Sloppy Thinking</b>: While pursuing enlightenment, it is erroneous to presume that thinking is unnecessary. Leo argues that there is no contradiction between enlightenment and becoming a clear thinker. In fact, both can progress in harmony and mutually aid each other.
</li><li><b>Exploration Beyond Language</b>: Leo talks about exploring beyond the limits of language to have non-symbolic experiences of reality, even though communication, teaching, thinking, and writing are crucial skills for success in life.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Producing Content for Actualized.org</b>: Leo expresses his struggles in producing content for Actualized.org, trying to maintain a standard of high-quality, comprehensive content without repetition. Despite the complexities of exploring and presenting profound concepts, Leo reiterates his commitment to provide new content every week.
