you know what's up this is Leo for actualise org
and today I want to talk about the issue of
fear and how fear can be holding you back from
really achieving a lot of the success that you might
want in your health career relationships its etc areas in
your life and some ways to reduce fear in fact
one really good technique for this that I found is
by simply asking the question what's the worst that could
happen so I asked you what is the worst that
can happen of the thing that you fear most if
you dig into this what you'll tend to find is
that the worst-case scenario is really not as bad as
you make it out to be or that it's not
as a it's not as likely to happen so you
make it out to be or that really that that
underlying fear that you have is rooted in something even
deeper and even deeper fear that pervades everything that you
do in your life and finding that and then working
on that and sorting out the inner demons around that
really deep-rooted fear is I think one of the best
self-development things you can do for yourself because it will
unblock a lot of a lot of obstacles for you
in your life because how you do one thing tends
to be how you do another thing because it's all
motivated from someplace deeper within so what are the key
questions that uh that you should ask yourself when you're
feel about something for me fear comes up when I
have to make decisions for example one one really big
decision I had to make lately was moving here to
Vegas right now I'm sitting in a little park area
outside my outside my apartment in Vegas and where I
live now but I used to live in Dallas and
I made that transition just earlier this year and for
me is a really big really big shift in my
direction in my life and what I was doing and
also pretty substantial move across the country was like 1,200
miles from Dallas to Vegas I have to move every
being over my family was back in Dallas girlfriend was
back in Dallas uh friends were back in Dallas and
I really had nothing nothing that I knew here in
Vegas I was moving to someplace that was fresh and
kind of a clean slate for me so for me
that was a really tough decision in fact at that
point I was still going through my coach training and
interestingly enough I had a coach that I was working
with through the training process and one of the issues
that I discussed with him was was this Vegas decision
it was tricky because you know obviously we did all
the kind of standard stuff making lists of pros and
cons of why to stay why to go but in
the end no matter how much I thought about it
I thought about it a lot it knows I was
very diligent about the whole thing I didn't I did
the right research about all the costs and everything like
that and I had the I had stayed a month
in Vegas the prior year so I was kind of
familiar with what I was getting myself into but even
after all that logical analysis I was still feeling very
I had a palpable feeling of fear about moving here
and about how how much was at stake and whether
I would really regret moving here maybe if I would
have to move back if something would go wrong and
if this was a direction I want to take in
my life this was a pretty bold and radical move
even though I've made moves like that before I've been
in California Boston Dallas so I've been around but I
want to briefly kind of use this as a point
to illustrate the thinking process that goes around goes into
uncovering your true fears because a lot of times what
you think you're fearing what you're fearful of is not
really the route fear underlying everything so with this with
this Vegas example we kind of went along these lines
and I have I have the dialogue somewhat translated directly
in the article below so you can go ahead and
read that for all the details but the gist of
it I'm going to go through here was something like
this is that the key tool that you use to
find out what your fear is is to ask what's
the worst that can happen and then when the person
answers that question then you asked them and why is
that so bad now these are some very simple two
very simple tools very simple questions that could be asked
and it's easy to get the strong by not digging
deep enough so I want to show you how it
worked in my case when I was moving to Vegas
and I brought this issue up with my coach you
know he asked he would ask me okay so so
what what are you really afraid of what's the worst
that can happen and and I would say something like
well I'm gonna move to Vegas and I'm really gonna
hate it and and then he would say okay and
and why is that going to be bad what's so
bad about hating moving to Vegas and I would say
something like well I've made moves before I've moved from
California to Boston didn't really like that move didn't didn't
have friends there felt kind of lonely because I was
away from my family and just didn't really like the
weather up there so all sorts of circumstances I basically
put myself in an environment that I didn't really like
and that was frustrating and and painful to some degree
and so he said okay I hear you say that
and what was so what's so bad about living in
a place you don't like and then I really kind
of thought about and I said well it's really bad
about that is that I ultimately I have to start
planning to move out of it like I want you
know I want a stable place to live and I
have to now I have to plan somewhere else to
move so there's certain like instability there it says okay
well what's so bad about living in a place where
you don't feel comfortable and you said that the worst
thing about it is moving out granted now what's so
bad about having to make plans to move somewhere else
I said well there's a lot of hassle involved a
lot of a lot of energy wasted a lot of
a lot of time wasted money wasted resources wasted that
I could put to better use okay and so he
says and so what's bad about wasting your resources and
I thought about that I said well what's bad about
wasting my resources is I kind of view my time
as precious and my money I only have so much
money and what I really want to do is is
kind of settle down and really focus on on my
career and focus on being productive rather than diverting my
energy my attention away to moving here or doing that
or doing this which is ultimately not significantly what I'm
when I'm chasing after I want my career to be
good and I want my job to be good and
I want to accomplish good things I don't want to
be successful he says okay so what's so bad about
not being successful and not being able to to put
those resources towards your career and and I thought about
that and I said well ultimately if I don't put
my my energy if I don't put energy into my
career I mean I only have so much time my
life ultimately is pretty short at least I tend to
think of it that way and I have only lived
at a time on this earth to accomplish what I
want to accomplish to set to set out and make
a difference the kind of difference that I'm proud of
the kind of difference that I want to make so
that I'm proud of my life and he said okay
and what's so bad about about not being able to
make that difference and not being able to to be
proud of your life and and I thought about that
and I said well well that's that's probably the most
important thing to me is to live what I think
is a meaningful life and to make some sort of
positive contribution that I'm that I'm happy with some sort
of creative contribution where I don't just live a life
and then die with regrets and not having done anything
anything amazing in it and not having contributed to it
somehow in a creative way in a productive way and
and that was it right there you know that was
at that point we kind of hit rock bottom and
we hit the underlying here and see what happened there
as we went through this process just asking the simple
question and what's so bad about that and what's so
bad about this and what's so bad about that what's
so bad about this and ultimately what you get to
is you get to something very deep and in my
case it was really a fear not of moving it
was more fear of of being of wasting my resources
which ultimately meant you know why was I afraid of
wasting my resources well that means I wouldn't have those
resources to use towards being productive and creative and if
I wasn't doing that then ultimately my life would be
meaningless it's kind of struck to put it like that
right you don't tend to think of it like that
but that's really how your brain is functioning you just
never have articulated it at least I hadn't really articulated
that before and so that's powerful to figure that out
because I can definitely see how that is a pattern
through everything that I do I'm very a kind of
career motivated and work motivated I started my own businesses
various projects and websites and I've done that because I've
always been looking for that thing where I can make
meaningful contribution and something that I enjoy both doing and
then having that that creative output be enjoyed by other
people or be useful to them in some way so
that's cot that was kind of the route fear that
I had and my route fear was that if I
moved to Vegas that I'm gonna waste my resources and
then I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be successful and
I'm not gonna be proud of my life ultimately if
it goes if it all goes bad of course working
with a good coach the coach will start to reframe
some of these things and when I ultimately realized with
this discussion about Vegas was that the reason I made
the decision to move here or started considering that decision
in the first place was because I saw it as
a great opportunity for myself because I was in live
involved with the nightlife scene and I really I really
spent a lot of time over the last year going
out hitting of bars and clubs doing a lot of
socializing and building up my social skills um that's something
that I was that I came from kind of deficient
background in that from from high school college and so
I'm kind of making up for it now and really
boosting up my social skills by going out there every
night and practicing this stuff a lot and Vegas was
a great opportunity or great place to do that maybe
one of the best places in the country just because
you know it is Sin City it's a party town
this is this is where you can go any day
any night of the week and find something fun to
do out at night which is challenging in in other
cities and can be challenging in Dallas Dallas is very
very widespread big sprawling metropolis and so to me basically
Vegas was this opportunity and with with this coach I
realized that ultimately I was making it as considering the
decision moved to Vegas because of the opportunity that was
there for me and what's the worst that could happen
well the worst that could happen ultimately is that I
move here I don't like it and then I have
to move back and sure there's there's this hassle a
little bit of waste of energy in productivity to do
this move both to and away from Vegas if I
don't like it but ultimately the raw cost of that
is it's not as great as I made it out
my mind the rock cost is maybe if week of
moving to Vegas a week of moving away from Vegas
and those those couple of weeks lost in terms of
time but then of course the cost of moving it
cost me about 4 grand to move to Vegas cuz
I had to pay some lease breaking fees to my
apartment and then it would cost me to about 2
grand I calculated to move back out of Vegas to
Dallas and so total that's six grand and when I
really thought about that I thought about in that light
and I said well you know what what am i
doing if I move here I have a lease term
for at least a year so I have to stay
to make us for a year that's fine and I'm
going to lose two weeks of my time moving plus
I'm going to pay 6 grand potentially on this endeavor
and when I kind of stacked when I stock when
I stacked the scales like that I saw that moving
to Vegas was actually an amazingly cheap opportunity for me
so for six grand and and some hassle sometime of
moving I basically got to live in Vegas for at
least a year to me when I put it in
those words sorta thinking about like that it really made
a lot of sense and I thought and I said
that you know that's that's an opportunity that I have
to seize upon and that I shouldn't be too worried
about it going wrong because if it does go wrong
at the very least you know I would tell myself
that I paid six grand just to have the experience
of living in a new city in Vegas and getting
to know some people here getting to know the nightlife
here just partaking of it all and even if I
had to move back to Dallas well those are still
really valuable life experiences that I feel I would have
grown from and they would have been worth much more
to me and want it over the load the course
of my life than six thousand bucks and two weeks
of my time so once I started seeing it that
way would help my coach then decision really became very
clear and a lot of that fear fear subsided so
the lesson from all this is to really dig into
your fears and try to ask yourself what the worst-case
scenarios are for you the trick here is to really
dig deep it's not enough to just to ask yourself
what is the worst-case scenario and then you come up
with it and then to ask yourself well why is
that bad and then you you answer it with some
sort of vague abstract like pseudo feeling well that would
suck that would suck well well you really what you
really want to do when you're doing this and you
can do this as an exercise by yourself you don't
need a coach per se for it is you can
sit down and whether you're facing a big decision that
you're afraid to make or you have some other fear
that's there you know really ask yourself what's the worst-case
scenario here and write it out write it on a
piece of paper what's the worst case scenario you can
imagine and after you do that ask yourself so what
so what's really what's really horrible about that and your
mind is going to come up with some sort of
generic initial answer and what you're gonna want to do
is you're going to want to persist then you're going
to want to say okay well I hear that and
then say and then ask the question just simply again
what's so bad about that thing and then your mind
will help with a slightly more specific answer and and
then you're gonna say okay and what's so bad about
that and what's so bad about the next thing and
what's so bad about the next thing and what's so
bad about the next thing and eventually you're going to
get down if you keep digging you're going to get
kind of hit a rock bottom where you get to
this point where you hit upon something that's very core
to you that is that you feel is like a
part of your identity that's something you can't really live
without like for me so this is very core to
me is is to have achievement in my life and
to to be creative in a positive way like for
me if I if you take that out of life
that really Rob's me of almost all the meaning of
life so for me that's something personally that is very
important to me and so I'm driven by by two
sides of this coin the one side is that I'm
afraid of of living an insignificant life and having no
achievement in it and basically being a failure and and
then on the other hand that's the negative motivation on
this on this other hand the positive motivation is that
I'm really motivated to be productive and be creative and
to just to generate value for other people without specifically
just like wanting wanting stuff in return and so that
can be very positive thing so those are two sides
of the same coin this coin of productivity and and
meaningfulness in life or finding that and needing it and
so that's I definitely have got a firm sense of
what that is for me what my root motivation is
and so my question is what is that for you
what is really the driver in your life whether it's
positive or negative shazar there's probably facets of both of
these most likely more negative than positive unless you've done
a lot of self development work and you really kind
of mature so so some common root fears I actually
got a list here because I wanted to make sure
I get them well these are ones that are just
common across the board they're very generic and kind of
abstract and they actually manifest themselves in in so many
different ways well one of them for sure is fear
of being of being insignificant or having a meaningless life
just finding meaning in life is important for people fear
that you are unlovable fear that you're not good enough
or smart enough fear of going broke fear of rejection
by others fear of embarrassment in front of others fear
of failure and maybe fear of failure in the in
the eyes of others not only in your own eyes
fear of reverting to your old self so maybe there's
some some some progress that you've made recently in your
personal development and and you've got that deep fear of
RHIB AK sliding and reverting back into it even though
you've been doing pretty good lately so fear of that
fear of well maybe even fear of success because of
the kind of burdens that success would put on you
that can be a very very pernicious limiting fear or
limiting belief that you can have is to is to
worry about all the all the problems that come with
being successful whether it's having more money or having more
friends or being more popular having more prestige that sort
of stuff so these are these are some common root
fears maybe already you're getting some ideas about which of
these you tend to gravitate towards and if you're not
if you if you're kind of unclear then take a
look at what you're feel fearful of in your life
and really dig down into it chances are that if
you have if you have if you have significant fear
around anything in your life in different areas those if
you dig if you dig and trace those back down
they're all going to trace back down to something some
sort of underlying underlying motivations underlying structures and anxieties that
you have and so a great way to do that
that digging process is with the question of what's the
worst that can happen and why is that so bad
and also another one that I like is what will
what will I do when the worst does happen all
right that is a good way to take a little
bit of pressure off in fact since we're on that
topic really the whole point of digging into your fears
is to to move forward and to be successful and
productive in the kind of way that you want to
be so that you're not blocked or limited and the
best ways to do that I found well actually the
very best way I think is just to take action
if you take action against your fear the fear just
kind of tends to melt away and dissipate a lot
of your fears are are very very illusory very self
deceptive coming from that negative side of you that lower
self of you that wants security and comfort and if
you just if you just brute force your way through
it with action a lot of times that will do
the trick and that will eliminate the fear whatever you're
afraid of if you're afraid of public speaking go up
there give a speech great way to reduce public speaking
if you're afraid of going through a job interview process
go and apply to ten different jobs and go through
the process ten times you'll find that by the tenth
time the fears going to be gone if you're afraid
of if you're afraid of being poor not that I
really recommend this but you could actually try to be
poor and see what that feels like and you'll probably
notice that it's not so bad it's not the worst
thing that can happen in your life and that a
lot of your fears are simply exaggerations or flat-out falsehoods
that are coming from some part of you that isn't
is it very conscious now when you face when you
face your fears there's 10 there tends to be or
what I found like 5 different ways that this that
this this process can play itself out one way is
that you just refuse to face your fears which is
basically you know you you give up on on the
whole process and when you refuse to face your fears
you kind of just stick your head in the sand
you don't want to hear what other people are telling
you you don't want to you don't want to hear
what what reality is telling you so if you're suffering
this usually there's a long string of suffering in your
life it's usually because well you're hitting your head against
the wall and reality is telling you one thing and
you're being stubborn you're being a stubborn jackass and you
don't want to recognize what reality is telling you reality
something they got a change you're going to change your
situation you got to change what you're doing at a
change your behavior to change your mindset whatever that might
be and and so if you refuse to to take
on that that message then you're going to suffer more
and more and your fears are you going to just
going to fester and basically that's the strategy of sticking
your head in the sand right like an ostrich so
that's not the way you want to go the second
way when you face your fears what happens is if
you're facing your fears you're gonna realize that they're exaggerated
like we talked about so you might be over blowing
and catastrophizing how bad it would be to be poor
or you might be blown over blowing how bad it
would be to miss one day at the gym or
you might be over blowing how bad it would be
if you got a bad review at work or how
bad it would be if you snubbed one of your
friends right chances are that you're building that up for
yourself and you're turning it into this massive catastrophe like
your wife would be ruined if this happened and in
most cases that's just not true even in very serious
cases like I'm talking about serious fears like fear of
losing your business if you're losing your money all your
money in the stock market fear of maybe a child
dying one of your kids dying fear of of losing
a spouse fear of losing your parents these are these
are like really serious serious life circumstances invited by no
means am i saying that they're not they're not legitimate
but it's still the case that if you're living your
life fearing those things you're living in a very disempowering
way you're probably not getting awesome results in your life
and even if you are getting great results you could
be getting much better results if you eliminate those fears
that you'd be free to act in an empowering way
in a positive way and you'd also feel better about
yourself so the exaggeration happens the the third thing that
happens is a lot of times that worst case there
that you can that you come up with is highly
improbable so even though it might happen it's very very
very unlikely so you know when I was moving to
Vegas um I could come up with all sorts of
worst-case scenarios like well worst-case scenario is that like I
moved to Vegas and Vegas gets attacked by terrorists while
I'm here or some stupid thing like that um sure
I mean granted yeah that could happen under the hand
that could also happen in Dallas in theory so that
kind of worst-case scenario is all the likely highly probable
and not a good way to base your your life
decisions around that kind of stuff so that kind of
stuff you just have to ignore and do the best
you can with the stuff that's likely to happen it's
much more likely that I'll move to Vegas and have
an awesome time here learn a lot and be really
happy then it is that I'll move here and get
attacked by terrorists right um the more likely worst-case scenario
for me would have been that I just moved here
I didn't really feel feel like I fit in with
the crowd I didn't really do my my socializing stuff
maybe I wouldn't have been able to establish the business
that I wanted to establish here and then I would
have to move back that's kind of a realistic worst-case
scenario whereas the terrorists worst case near that's like a
highly catastrophize exaggerated worst-case scenario and also very probable now
when you're digging into fears the other thing you might
find the fourth thing you might find is that when
you're digging into them is that the fear that you
thought you had is not the true fear is that
it's like a surface fear that's underlying something that's that's
sitting on top of something much bigger and so that's
where that process comes into bigging into it seeing really
what the root fear is and then fifthly once you
once you kind of come face-to-face with your fear and
you see it for what it is and maybe you
even recognize that this is a legitimate fear like maybe
maybe you're at work and there's a little legitimate chance
that you're going to get laid off in the next
few weeks because the company is going bankrupt you know
that sounds like something that's mostly out of your control
if you're just an employee and the something that you
just have to kind of accept whether it's going to
happen or not and in that case you could go
about those two weeks and the rest of your life
while you're still at that job really fearful about it
and what that's going to do is it's going to
tend to disempower you so you're going to take stupid
this you're gonna make stupid decisions you're going to make
bad actions you're going to behave in a way that's
actually probably going to lead to a sort of self-fulfilling
prophecy effect or at the very least it's not going
to finally lead to good performance at work or you
could just recognize that you know what I do have
this fear it might be even legitimate there's a chance
that it will happen but how do I want to
proceed from here do I want to proceed in an
empowering way or or do I want to proceed in
a kind of a victimized hopeless mindset that comes with
with always being fearful and if you want to get
the best performance out of yourself then always the empowering
way is the best way to go and also makes
you feel feel good to be empowered rather than always
anxious and worried about worst-case scenarios and all that nonsense
so about worst-case scenarios there's just kind of a caveat
that I want to make about this and that that
is that it really helps do this exercise this whole
digging in and asking yourself what's the worst that can
happen and what's so bad about that helps to do
that by yourself if you're in a very kind of
high consciousness state in a relatively empowered state and not
in a in a desperate emotionally weak low willpower low
consciousness kind of state because if you tend to be
a like or if you tend to be a habitually
negative thinker then and I ask you or you ask
yourself what's the worst thing that could happen you're going
to tend to dig a hole that you can't dig
your way out of it's almost like if you're going
to use these tools you go balls to the wall
and use them full-on like a hundred percent use them
to get to the bottom of your fear if you
use them half-ass you go only a little bit if
you like dip your toe in the in the pool
what's going to happen is you're gonna make yourself feel
worse you're gonna ask yourself what's the worst-case scenario gonna
come up with something that's that's very unlikely and irrational
and then that's just going to make you feel bad
and you're not going to be able to kind of
prop yourself out that's why I have it a coach
sometimes helps when you're doing this because the coach is
objective and they're not connected to it they can always
pop you out and they can be careful to watch
out for that kind of negative thinking and challenge you
on some of those limiting beliefs that you have and
assumptions that you have that might be holding you back
if you do attempt to do this yourself just be
aware that if you do have kind of a pattern
of thinking negatively you might want to avoid this entirely
or do it at a point where you're feeling stronger
and make sure you dig all the way so you
get the full benefit of finding out what your root
beers are it's a tricky process because it's easier to
stick your head in the sand right it's always more
convenient to stick your head in the sand and never
address your fears and if you do that that's like
putting a band-aid over a broken leg it you know
am I it might even stop the bleeding for a
little bit and it might make it kind of look
better and mask the fact that there's a bone sticking
out of it or whatever but in the end it's
not the best approach and what we're all about here
with actualize that org is how to get you sustainable
long-term success in whatever part of your life that you
want it in and also fulfillment and good feeling the
best way to do that is to spend your time
digging to your fears even if it's painful so that
you can you can release that pressure off of yourself
and you'll find that when you're doing these exercises at
first it might be kind of challenging but as soon
as you really look into that fear you're going to
find that it's not as menacing as you thought it
was and that the fear of the fear was worse
than the actuality of the fear coming about so I
encourage you to add to ask yourself what you fear
the most right now in your life and go through
and dig into it and see if you can get
to the bottom of it so that you can start
to release some of that suffering and start to live
a more in a more empowered way and feel much
better about yourself you
