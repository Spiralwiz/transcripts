            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6CWyUuMbegk' target='_blank'>Life Purpose - The Thrill of Creative Contribution</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Star Trek Nexus analogy</b>: Leo identifies with the main villain of Star Trek The Next Generation who spent his life chasing the Nexus, a wave of energy that transports people back in time to relive their best memories. Leo feels like he has spent the last five years chasing a sense of fulfilling creative contribution akin to the euphoria of the Nexus.
</li><li><b>Fundamental transition from college to professional life</b>: After college, Leo desired to be a game designer and worked eight months on a game design project hoping to land a job. The project, a mod for the game Oblivion and named La Spires, was a labor of love, and he enjoyed the process of creating it despite the immense work involved.
</li><li><b>Success and validation of La Spires</b>: La Spires, to Leo's surprise, became the top mod for Oblivion and had over a hundred thousand downloads. Leo felt a sense of accomplishment seeing his design recognized and appreciated. He enjoyed the reinforcing external rewards, which matched the satisfaction he derived internally from working on the game.
</li><li><b>Chasing the euphoria of creative contribution</b>: Leo describes the six months following the release of La Spires as the greatest feeling he's ever experienced. The pride and validation from seeing his creative work being enjoyed by others gave him a unique sense of satisfaction. He feels that this creative fulfillment, derived from sharing his talent and bringing joy to people, is the key to a gratifying professional life.
</li><li><b>Benefits of trusting your creative instincts</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of trusting oneÂ’s creative instinct while pursuing any project. He felt validated and accomplished when people appreciated his work, which he crafted according to his preferences as a gamer without worrying about public opinion.
</li><li><b>Reliving the Nexus moment</b>: Leo has spent the past five years trying to relive the feeling of absolute creative fulfillment he experienced with his game mod, which he likens to the euphoria the villain in Star Trek felt chasing the Nexus. He acknowledges the challenge of bottling up the feeling of such fulfilling creative contribution and gifting it to others.
</li><li><b>Gift of Creative Work</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that people gain the utmost pleasure when their creative work, which is essentially their gift to the world, is appreciated and loved by others. This satisfaction is the distinction between having a job or a career and having a life calling where you are deeply involved and passionate about your work.
</li><li><b>Game Project's Impact</b>: Leo acknowledges that his small game project might not have made a significant impact globally, but it was gratifying knowing that he could provide entertainment and temporary relief to someone in distress through his game. This, according to him, is a positive impact on the world.
</li><li><b>Job Satisfaction Post Success</b>: After his game project's success, Leo started working as a professional game designer in Boston. However, he spent the next five years trying to recapture the satisfaction he felt when he was working on his game project. Leo signifies that he has begun experiencing a similar feeling of creative contribution with his personal development blueprint that he launched. He believes that the nervous excitement of expecting reactions adds to the fulfilling experience of being creatively involved in your work.
</li><li><b>Importance of Creative Work</b>: Leo Gura expresses concerns about people not experiencing the joy of creative work. He suggests that individuals often miss out on the immense pleasure of creative contribution due to their nine-to-five job framework where they work without investing their creativity or their soul. He emphasizes that people should strive for creative contribution in their careers.
</li><li><b>Dilution of Creative Contribution in Team Environment</b>: After becoming a professional developer, Leo Gura found less creative autonomy and contribution in a team environment as it gets diluted. The sense of creative contribution he felt while working on his small project was not readily available in the big team. He found the realization bitter and depressing despite it being his dream job.
</li><li><b>Shift towards Entrepreneurship</b>: Leo concluded that he needed to shift to business in order to regain his sense of creative contribution. However, he was unsure about the process and it required financial stability which he didn't have at that time. Nevertheless, he started researching and planning with the aspiration to create his own game studio.
</li><li><b>Shift from game design to internet marketing</b>: Leo transitioned from game design to internet marketing in hopes of raising capital to start his own game studio. Despite financial success, he was unable to reach his goal and felt a loss in passion for game design as he no longer felt like a game designer.
</li><li><b>Lack of fulfillment in internet marketing</b>: Leo admits to being lured by the financial comfort that internet marketing provided, which allowed him to live comfortably with little creative effort. However, this shift led to a loss of the satisfaction he got from creative contribution, leaving him feeling off track and not fulfilled.
</li><li><b>Struggling with loss of creative contribution</b>: There was a persistent struggle as Leo continued with internet marketing whilst seeking for that euphoria of creative contribution he had experienced in the past. As time passed, the feeling became less tangible, leading to complacency and rationalizations of his comfortable life.
</li><li><b>Transition of life purpose</b>: Dissatisfaction with internet marketing led Leo to seek a new purpose. Acknowledging game design had lost its appeal, he faced the challenge of finding a new direction. This led to a journey of soul-searching, exploring personal development and enrolling in a coaching program.
</li><li><b>Challenges of expressing creativity</b>: Leo discusses the complexities of expressing oneself creatively. His endeavor to create a unique, expressive website that reflected his personal journey came with several creative challenges, insecurities, and self-doubt.
</li><li><b>Rediscovering passion and creative contribution</b>: After a five-year journey of discovery, loss, and finding a fresh passion, Leo feels he is on track again. He acknowledges there are still multiple obstacles to overcome but is excited about the future potential of his endeavors.
</li><li><b>Importance of experiencing high states of consciousness and peak experiences</b>: Leo emphasizes the significance of high states of consciousness and peak experiences, particularly in the context of career and life purpose. 
</li><li><b>Creative contribution as a key to meaningful work and life</b>: He underscores creative contribution as the core of fulfilling work and purposeful life. He challenges his listeners to seek this kind of fulfillment, reinforcing that life should be about giving of oneself and exploiting one's talents and passions to contribute positively to the world.
</li><li><b>Value of coaching, mentoring, resources, books, and seminars in figuring out life's purpose</b>: Leo underscores the importance of support systems in exploring different opportunities and discovering a purposeful and fulfilling life. He reminds viewers to consistently seek satisfaction in life and encourages engagement through comments and questions.
</li><li><b>Unique contributions over common service</b>: Leo differentiates between generic contributions such as volunteering at a soup kitchen and personalized contribution that taps into one's unique gifts and talents. He suggests that everyone has a unique way in which they can contribute to society based on their talents, strengths and the impact they aspire to make.
</li><li><b>Linking contribution to work and career</b>: Instead of solely focusing on earning money to contribute materially, he advises setting up a life where your greatest gifts and passions fuel your work, career or business contribution, making it much more fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Misplace priorities in contribution activities</b>: Leo highlights the common mistake of working in jobs that may not fulfill one's potential but provide monetary gains that are then used for purposes of charity or family support. Although commendable, he emphasizes that a more powerful route is aligning your work with your greatest strengths and contributions.
</li><li><b>Use of personal strength for impactful contribution</b>: Using personal anecdote, Leo describes his own contribution - creating awareness about practical psychology through videos, articles, and coaching, which not only brings him immense personal satisfaction but also positively impacts others. He also mentions his intention to be financially compensated for his work, enabling further personal and social contributions.
</li><li><b>Potential rewards of creative contribution</b>: He explicates that creative contribution not only brings unparalleled joy and fulfillment but also positions one for financial success. The caveat here lies in the need for introspection, soul-searching, and a willingness to experiment.
</li><li><b>Acknowledgement of the challenging journey and resources available</b>: Leo emphasizes the challenging and uncertain journey of finding one's unique path of creative contribution by detailing his own five-year process. He acknowledges the importance of resources such as coaching, mentors, books, seminars and urges people to utilize these resources.
</li><li><b>The drive for change and improvement</b>: Finally, Leo underscores the need for a drive or motivation to pursue a fulfilling and exciting life, to live on the edge and ultimately die with no regrets. He appeals to people who feel they're missing out on fulfilling experiences to do some soul-searching and be open to possibilities even if it involves sacrifices in the short term.
