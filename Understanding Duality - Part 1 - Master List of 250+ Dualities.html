[Music] in this episode we're gonna be taking a look
at what is duality understanding dualistic cognition that's quite a
mouthful there but this is a very very foundational topic
and you're probably thinking Leo I've heard you talking about
duality a bunch already so what more is there to
say well actually I've spent the last two years compiling
a list of dualities or dualistic categories that the mind
uses to try to understand reality and so this episode
and the next one is going to be a miniseries
here probably two parts maybe a third part I'm not
sure how much I can cram into two two episodes
I'll try to do it in two but in these
two episodes I'm gonna give you my master list of
over 250 very common and important dualities and this is
gonna help you to understand how your mind make sense
of all of life the entire worlds this is this
is very foundational stuff and I haven't really covered it
as directly as I'm going to cover it here and
I'm gonna address every single one of these dualities to
lesser and greater degree and we're gonna break them apart
into three groups the first one is going to be
just common dualities the second group is going to be
scientific types of dualities for scientific thinking and the final
category or group is going to be existential dualities so
the most important part of this series is going to
be part two so make sure you stick around for
part two I get the sense that most people they
watch part one they get bored with it halfway through
then they ever gets it part two but part two
is usually the most important part of my series or
the last part of the series is always the most
important because we're building something up throughout the series that's
why the series is needed in the first place because
there's a lot of content so I've been compiling this
list for for a couple of years I want you
to understand how much work and thought goes into this
thinking about this stuff so let's begin so what you
got to understand is that the human mind when it
tries to understand things the way that it thinks and
in fact all thinking is basically dualistic you cannot think
you cannot speak you cannot write you cannot communicate you
cannot do science even nor philosophy or any other kind
of intellectual human activity without creating dualities dualities are like
the structure of the entire universe and the way we
come to know the entire universe every concept that we
have have you noticed it's defined against its opposite so
if we have a concept like energy then the only
value of that idea of energy is precisely that it
designates some thing which is distinct from some other thing
which is not energy because if everything was energy then
in a sense you couldn't use the idea of energy
in any practical way because every time you spoke of
it you'd be speaking about the entire universe so it
wouldn't really be a handy word or a handy concept
and so when we're thinking we're creating these dualities all
the time with our mind we're doing it when we're
doing science we're doing it when we're in casual conversation
we're doing it when we're talking about politics when we're
talking about religion when we're talking about our opinions about
things and of course we're doing it when we're doing
philosophy or trying to understand the nature of ourselves or
reality or anything else but the problem is is that
we create these dualities but we're not conscious of the
fact that these are dualities and this leads us astray
so firstly you got understand that your understanding of the
world is composed of these dualities what do I mean
by these dualities I mean for example things like up
versus down that would be a duality you're defining up
but up is defined relative to down such that you
can't have a down without it up and you can't
have an up without a down this seems very simple
it seems very obvious and of course in the case
of up and down it is very simple and very
obvious but not always in fact there was a time
when most people on the planet did not understand and
appreciate the relativity of the notion of up and down
they literally thought there was an up direction in the
universe and a down direction in the universe and that
object just naturally fell down that's what objects did of
course later we realized that that's not how gravity works
it took a genius like Newton to realize that up
and down or relative and of course the Greeks before
him realize it as well I've also talking about dualities
like success versus failure or reality versus fantasy or life
versus death or a good versus bad or science versus
religion so even though most people understand that up and
down or relative notions and that they depend and are
defined in relationship to each other such that you can't
have one without the other they then don't understand that
when it comes to other categories and they don't understand
that their own mind is creating these categories so it's
relatively easy to see how the human mind is creating
the category of up versus down which doesn't exist in
nature otherwise but it's a lot harder to see how
the human mind is creating the category of life versus
death or a good versus bad or reality versus fantasy
or science versus religion these things they seem like they're
out there in the real world and not something that
our mind is creating but of course the distinction between
your mind and the world what is that but another
duality you see so everything that you say and any
model that you constructed the world it always relies upon
these dualities but the problem is is that there's a
very fundamental law of epistemology that I want to share
with you that you really need to start to appreciate
is that all dualities are ultimately untenable and temporary all
dualities are ultimately relative and they must eventually collapse this
is something that we don't like to accept because it's
very threatening because we build our lives and our societies
and our cultures upon certain unquestioned categories and dualities for
example man versus woman in a lot of cultures what
is a man and what is a woman is very
strictly defined by certain conventions and tradition traditions and orthodoxies
and then it's taken as an absolute not as a
relative thing and then people struggle with that especially we
need to blend and blur gender roles and identities so
all conventional traditional Orthodox and even scientific cognition is dualistic
you have to understand have you looked at how conservatives
for example think about politics and gender and religion and
the world it's extremely dualistic now of course liberals are
not completely free of dualistic thinking either most liberals are
are full of dualistic categories but they're a little bit
less dualistic and so as you become more conscious you
become less and less dualistic and you start to realize
that more and more of the dualities that you thought
were fundamental and unquestionable the lines between them start to
blur and you start to see the interrelationship between these
various polar opposites that you've always just taken for granted
since you were a child mm-hmm because your culture just
told you that they were true so one corollary of
this law of epistemology that all dualities are ultimately untenable
and the reason that is by the way is because
reality of course is non-dual that's why all dualities are
untenable is that dualities only hold when they are not
deeply explored so you can create a category like man
versus woman or man versus machine or progress versus regress
and it might seem at first glance that well yeah
it's pretty pretty there's a pretty clear line Leigha there's
a pretty clear line between for example man versus machine
it's not hard to distinguish those two but what I'm
telling you is that yes it's not hard to distinguish
those two and usually it's not hard to distinguish a
man from a woman but there are edge cases that
you're not taking into account and also what's gonna happen
is that as we move forward into the future you're
gonna see that these dualities start to bleed into each
other more and more to the point where maybe 500
or a thousand years from now it will be pretty
hard to distinguish a man from a machine already we
have human beings who have pacemakers which are machine components
embedded into the body various kinds of implants artificial hips
and knees made of titanium and other kinds of metals
and new materials and this is just gonna keep happening
more and more and more to the point where like
seriously like in five hundred years Society culturally is gonna
have a problem distinguishing a man from a machine and
then you know questions will arise of course as they
do in science fiction movies about you know do machines
deserve human rights the same rights that a man has
that a woman has or the machines have a different
set of rights is it for example is it ethical
and moral to force a machine to work 20 hours
a day in a factory without any rest or relaxation
is that ethical well right now it's not a problem
because this easy distinguished man from machine but it's gonna
get harder and harder and harder another example is like
I sighted progress versus regress a lot of people especially
progressive people liberals they tend to have a very simplistic
dualistic notion of progress versus regress and so they see
the Conservatives as being the ones who are regressing Society
and then the progressives or the Liberals they're the ones
who are progressing or advancing Society and generally we tend
to look at the world we see well that case
right there is either a case of progress or regress
but it's not so simple because what you're not taking
into account is how the to play into each other
in a certain kind of liberal progressive fantasy you might
imagine that well wouldn't it be great if there were
no conservatives and all we had was just pure progress
all the time we're always hitting the accelerator with no
brake this is a dualistic delusion and fantasy it can't
be that way because reality always has complimentary and opposite
forces that are at play with each other and oftentimes
what ends up happening is that in order for us
to progress we first need to regress and you can
notice that both collectively throughout history in how societies and
cultures and nations evolved but you can also see it
individually within yourself in your own life there are moments
in your life where you're gonna be progressing and it'll
be moments in your life we're gonna be backsliding and
regressing and we tend to get mmm we still don't
we tend to feel guilty when we're regressing in our
lives especially with personal development and if you're a self-help
junkie then you get guilty about this stuff and you
just have this again this kind of self-improvement fantasy is
like well what if I could just be progressing all
the time with no backsliding and no hiccups whatsoever but
again that's a that's a dualistic delusion it can't be
that way and you need to understand that your progress
comes about precisely oftentimes because of your regresses so those
moments when you're the most depressed when you're backsliding the
most when you're cheating on your diet when you're cheating
on your plans and you're you're failing to fall through
on your goals it's that it's it's your failure which
then ultimately leads you to your next great success but
most people think way to do listicle ii to simplistically
too much black and white to see these these dialectical
interplay that happen between these opposing forces and also of
course you have to recognize that these these categories of
like man versus machine progress versus regress these are not
just found in the world as if they're just kind
of floating around in the universe somewhere these are things
that your own mind is creating your own mind is
defining what is a man and what is a machine
and so of course you should expect that the categories
that your mind comes up with they're not going to
be able to be true to ultimate reality they're not
going to be absolute none of your categories are gonna
be absolute same thing with progress or regress nothing in
the universe there's no like book in the universe that's
floating it around in space that you can go and
you can look up and see okay here's a list
of what qualifies as progress and here's a list of
stuff that qualifies it's redress no we're determining what progress
and regress are and so a lot of what politics
is is is about it's a battle about how to
define various terms whether it's man versus machine or progress
or regress or man versus woman or anything else like
that so what I'm telling you here we're still talking
about this one corollary of this law of epistemology that
all dualities collapse so the corollary is that if you
deeply explore any duality to its ultimate root what you
will discover is that as you get further and further
away to the edges of this duality is you will
see it collapse and bleed and the edges will come
back and circle back around and embrace each other in
a unity and you will realize that the entire time
the two were defined in terms of one another because
fundamentally what you're doing is you're using your mind to
to place boundaries within reality and so you're carving up
reality but then who is carving up reality while you
carve it up one way your neighbor cards it up
another way I carve it up another way and then
we all disagree because we've carved it up in different
ways and then who gets to say which way of
carving it up is the best way well of course
that depends on your goals that depends on your survival
agenda that depends on what your need ego needs but
we don't admit of that usually what we say is
we just say well no mind you ality is just
the way that reality is it's not something that I
created it's not something relative it's how it actually is
and my way is the right way it has nothing
to do with me this problem of drawing lies within
reality is really tricky it's notoriously tricky in philosophy this
is known as the the Heep problem how do you
define what a heap is so if you take a
couple of grains of sand and you put them together
does that constitute a heap or just a few grains
of sand well you might say it's just a few
grains of sand okay but then if we take a
million of them a million grains of sand and put
them together would that be a heap you say yeah
it's probably a heap okay but where do you draw
the line between a few grains of sand and a
heap is it ten grains a hundred grains a thousand
grains who gets to say if I say it's a
hundred and you say it's a thousand which one of
us is right see but this goes way beyond just
grains of sand it's much more significant I'll give you
a scientific example for example a lot of scientists and
people who follow all the space launches that are happening
these days with various companies you know they argue about
what qualifies as outer space what is outer space we
have the earth and then we have outer space but
how many miles above the earth is outer space is
it fifty thousand sixty thousand one hundred and twenty thousand
or a hundred and twenty miles above not thousand hundreds
of hundreds of miles above above the earth what qualifies
is outer space do you have to actually like be
in geosynchronous orbit do you have to be out of
Earth's orbit to be in outer space or is it
enough for you just to fly out the atmosphere he's
a jumbo jet in outer space when it's flying speaking
of which you know where is that boundary like if
you really think about it I'm sitting in outer space
right now because there's no boundary between where I'm sitting
right now and you know 120 miles up there which
would be considered outer space by most I most scientists
well there's no boundary I mean how are spaces right
here of course there's air here but the space is
all the same so you see so who's defining this
so a lot of debates and misunderstanding and miscommunication and
confusion comes precisely because of this because we're drawing these
lines but we're not admitting that we're drawing these lines
or here's another example when does a molecule or a
collection of molecules become a living cell who determines that
is there some law in the universe that says well
if you have a hundred thousand molecules arranged in this
fashion that all the sudden now it's a living cell
but before it wasn't si or going up a little
bit further another level up from that is when do
a clump of cells become a human this is a
very tricky issue for for abortion rights and for religious
people when they think about reproductive rights who's defining when
a clumps of cells equals a human is is it
precisely at the moment where that the egg meets the
sperm it's like and does the egg just need to
touch the sperm for it to be a human or
does it thus perhaps actually enter into the egg and
then stay there for some time and how many how
many seconds does it need to say how many minutes
how many hours who gets to say see it's very
tricky or how about the question of when did an
ape become a human mm-hmm it's pretty easy to tell
a chimpanzee apart from a human but there was a
time in in in the past where there existed hominids
something between a chimpanzee and a human some common ancestor
and it would really it must have had traits very
similar to half chimpanzee half human something quite similar to
that I mean there are plenty of fossils in the
in the fossil record too to give us good evidence
of this and it must have acted really similar to
humans in certain ways but also it wasn't quite human
he's a Neanderthal a human or not see really interesting
so when did the first human get born really interesting
question and and who determines that that was a human
is it the human that s born it says I'm
a human but of course that's very self biased because
of course yeah you get to say you're a human
but does that really mean that you're a human what
if you get what if you teach a a hominid
on the and earth all to say that it's a
human does that does that mean it is and does
it have human rights at that point see how tricky
it gets how about what determines when a computer becomes
intelligent that's very tricky as well very tricky problem in
computer science and that problems going to only become more
and more thorny in the in the next couple hundred
years as all these AIS become more sophisticated and more
developed it's going to become harder and harder to to
distinguish human intelligence from computer intelligence so that's that's very
interesting it used to be thought that well if a
computer could couldn't beat a man at chess that it
would be intelligent well that happened in the late 90s
and but we still don't consider computers intelligent so what
is what does that boundary there how about the boundary
between the thought and an emotion when does a thought
become an emotion in Windows an emotion become a thought
have you ever noticed this how closely related the two
are and oftentimes though we talk about them as though
they're two different things like well I'm thinking now and
I'm feeling something else later but then of course they're
very related because what you're thinking now affects how you
feel later and in fact people have been asking about
this on the on actualised forum they've been asking about
pain is pain thought or is pain and emotion and
a feeling well of course the answer is that pain
is a complicated thing which includes both a thought component
and an emotional component and if you understood that you
became fully conscious that that might allow you to overcome
some serious chronic pain that you're having that otherwise you
wouldn't be able to overcome because you're not conscious of
the interplay between thoughts and emotions and how that affects
the pain you feel or the suffering you feel most
of the suffering you feel is fought driven and not
just purely a feeling or a sensation or how about
where do you draw the line between love and hatred
where does love and and hatred begin now you might
think well leo these are two clearly different things there's
no problem distinguishing love from hatred they're opposites really are
they really see it seems like they're opposites but then
when you like I tell you if you if you
really explore the duality in a lot of detail and
you go all the way out to its edges you're
gonna see that they're gonna loop back around and come
together for example a lot of people who are filled
with hate are actually filled with love for some partial
thing within reality so for example a man who feels
hatred towards someone who physically abused his daughter is he
acting out of hatred or out of love you might
think well he's acting out of hatred for that guy
who who beat up his daughter and that's wrong and
that's evil and so he's he's right to hate that
guy because he shouldn't have slapped around the daughter okay
that's one way to look at it but another way
to look at is that really um he's doing out
of love his hatred is out of love you see
because he loves his daughter so much um so see
it's not so simple not so simple at all and
in fact for for that guy who's filled with this
hatred in order to overcome his hatred he's gonna have
to recognize that there's this interplay between these various forces
within him so it's not just hatred it's also love
and he needs to recognize that that hatred itself comes
from a certain partial kind of love and when you
realize that then you can kind of let go of
that and you can expand your love to even include
those objects that you hate and that's exactly what you
need to do in order to have a a non
dual living experience of life so our goal ultimately is
to sort of take the rigidity of all these categories
and then shake it loose so that you're liberated and
you're free your mind is free to explore reality without
being straitjacketed by all these categories that you've constructed or
that your culture has constructed and programmed you with but
of course the problem with that is precisely that our
mind is so rigid and so closed from exploring and
breaking apart these rigidities we don't want to explore these
dualities too deeply because if we do ultimately what's gonna
happen is we're gonna get not just to the simple
dualities of like 8 versus human or man versus machine
these are simple they don't affect your life too much
one way another they're kind of philosophically you might almost
say but you start going down this rabbit hole eventually
you're gonna start to get to dualities like reality versus
fantasy or sanity versus insanity or good versus evil oh
boy now we're getting into existential dualities and these really
are the things that shape how you perceive the entire
world and shape your entire attitude towards people things yourself
and the world and these are very very practical and
significant and not just merely philosophical and most people don't
want to question these dualities they don't want to admit
of the possibility that the boundary between reality and fantasy
might not actually exist for example or that the boundary
between the mind and the world the inner mind and
the outer world might not actually exist or that boundary
between the mind and the brain scientists love to cling
to that boundary and they love to prioritize the brain
over the mind such that the mind is inside the
brain rather than the opposite possibility see so you sort
of play around with this stuff and all of a
sudden you get into some very mind-bending territory and a
lot of stuff becomes a very fluid and your reality
starts to melt before your eyes and fall apart and
that can be very scary and very threatening which is
why most people don't want to go down this route
so for now I just want you to remember that
your mind creates categories and then what it does is
that it cleverly denies that it created these categories and
this is how reality arises which of course is itself
a category all these words that I use mind creation
denial world self category good love what are these these
are all categories even the word category is a category
and so by denying that we create these categories this
creates enormous degrees of ignorance resulting in deep misunderstandings of
how reality works as a consequence human understanding is then
very partial biased and lopsided and very confused mankind tends
to hold these dualities and categories as sacred as dogmas
trying to resist their collapse but of course one of
the key laws of epistemology is that every duality will
eventually be subverted so just keep that in mind so
with that introduction out of the way let's actually get
into the list of these dualities so let's start with
some very simple ones that don't eat that much explanation
up versus down left versus right East versus West hot
versus cold soft versus hard small versus big front versus
back forward versus backward clockwise versus counter clockwise so you've
heard all these before you learn them when you were
young as a child and to you they just seemed
very obvious but I want you just to start to
notice that always these are relative terms defined in terms
of each other so for example what do I mean
well let's just take left and right is this left
or is this right or is this right and this
left it depends on whether you're looking at it from
this direction or from that direction so for me this
is right but for you it's left and vice versa
and it's important to understand that in fact I had
to teach myself as I was shooting all these videos
over the years I had to teach myself that what
I'm talking and I'm presenting something to you I have
to point in this direction like if I'm trying to
show you a graph of my progress if like I
let's say I'm showing you my progress in person about
I'm growing right see I have to draw it this
way because from your perspective that's the right way but
for my perspective it's backwards so I have to train
myself to think backwards ly as I'm showing stuff to
you through this camera and a lot of times I
watch for example CNN or some other news network and
some expert that they have there is is sitting there
and he's trying to draw some sort of graph with
his fingers but the way he's drawing it he's drawing
it backwards from the viewers perspective because he's drawn it
from his own perspective and I can see that he
didn't train himself to look at what he's doing from
the viewers perspective see so this is just gives you
a little a little example of of how powerful it
is to be able to look at the world from
other people's perspectives because then you can present information in
ways that will work for that person that of course
facilitates communication facilitates relationships facilitates teaching but it also facilitates
understanding the other person which is a very rare very
rare it's very rare that people go to great lengths
to try to understand somebody else's perspective usually people are
just stuck in their own perspective all right so so
left and right is relative and as are all these
other things who gets to define for example what qualifies
as forward versus backward let's go on with the rest
of the list weak versus strong slow versus fast easy
versus hard smooth versus rough short versus long empty versus
full odd versus even you might think well Leo odd
and even that's that's very clear-cut that's a mathematical notion
so it should be easy to know if something is
odd or even well let me ask you this is
zero even or odd is pi the number pi 3.14159
etc is that even or odd see so when you
start to think to simplistically with these categories what they
do is they limit your imagination see if you take
a little child and you teach him about even and
odd and you tell him all numbers are even and
odd or odd one or the other at first glance
he's just gonna believe you and he's gonna accept it
it's gonna look from his perspective it's gonna seem like
yeah that's right look here's number one it's odd here's
number six it's even here's a num number 500 that
it's even and so forth he can go through a
few examples and he can learn the distinction of odd
versus even but then you asked the child what about
zero and now he gets confused he doesn't know how
to answer that or you give him a decimal point
and he doesn't know is it odd is that even
is it neither you see when he then understands that
Oh even an odd doesn't automatically apply to all numbers
then that sort of opens up a new possibility for
him but imagine a child who's just been taught from
an early age in a dogmatic fashion that numbers must
always be odd or only be even and that this
is a just like a brute fact of the universe
is that if it's a number it has to be
odd or even and it can't be both and it
can't be neither you see he's gonna have real difficulty
in the future when he does advanced mathematics and he's
dealing with fractions and decimals and imaginary numbers and transcendental
numbers and God knows what else he's gonna have a
real difficulty with that so that's that's sort of what
we're dealing with here a lot of the stuff that
I try to communicate through my speaking is these sorts
of advanced mathematical concepts to use this analogy but many
of the people that I'm communicating with they're using this
very simple black and white dualistic thinking to try to
understand some of these trans rational truths that I'm trying
to communicate and then what ends up happening is that
it doesn't compute for them it doesn't make sense and
then of course if it doesn't make sense for you
you can't understand it if you can't understand it you're
missing out on the most advanced wisdom and lessons from
life so you have to evolve your cognition in order
to be able to really understand the deepest truths that's
why we're talking about all this moving on with the
list high versus low decrease versus increase heads versus tails
narrow versus broad shallow versus deep these are all relative
you know what I consider a shallow book for me
a shallow book might be very deep book for you
just depends if you're just a newbie getting into self-help
then most books will seem very deep to you which
for example to me after I've been doing it for
five or ten years now seem very shallow aren't really
worth my time and of course that it depends depends
on where you are on your personal development journey and
what I consider a deep book today is gonna turn
into a shallow book ten years from now see but
most people you know they don't they don't they don't
really appreciate this this relative nature of these categories and
now on the list we get to the category of
good versus bad and good versus evil and this is
this is a very important one and we're gonna pause
right here in order to introduce an additional concept we're
going to need as we're talking about these dualities going
forward and that is the concept of the absolute or
that transcendent so usually we set up a category like
good which is defined as the opposite of bad and
then what what I'm gonna tell you now is that
their relative good and bad is relative so what's good
for me might be bad for you and vice versa
for example if the government confiscates all your money and
gives it to me that's good for me but it's
bad for you and vice versa of course it can
also do something that would be good for both of
us or bad for both of us but might be
good for some other group like for example if we're
mmm if if you and I are in the upper
class of society and the government starts taxing the upper
class well that's bad for us but it'll be good
for the lower class so most people don't even admit
this about good and bad how relative it is to
to our self agenda so that's just a basic point
of relativity but some people then get trapped in the
in the trap of relativity they think well all good
and bad is just relative and that's the end of
the story except it's not the end of the story
so in certain cases there are absolutes so with the
case of good and bad there's absolute good what is
an absolute well that's the deep topic I'll have actually
episode on in the future about what is an absolute
and what is absolute truth and we're also gonna be
talking about absolute and relative in the future as well
cuz there's so much to say about that but um
briefly here an absolute is that which has no opposite
is transcendent of this duality so for example when I
say good as an absolute or good with a capital
G this is a good that knows no opposite that
has no opposite so really what it does is it
takes the lowercase G good and the lowercase B bad
and it sort of recognizes them as a duality and
then it it incorporates all of that and transcends it
at the same time and that that unity is what
we're calling good with a capital G now of course
someone's gonna wonder here well Leo but what about bad
with a capital B isn't there an absolute bad as
well if there's an absolute good no there isn't because
if there were that would again create a new duality
so what I'm talking about is good as a non
duality now you might wonder well Leo if your emerging
the lowercase G good with with the lowercase B bad
you're merging those together into one thing why are you
then calling it good with a with a with an
uppercase G aren't you being biased shouldn't you give it
some neutral term and the answer is no because from
from an absolute level of consciousness what you can realize
is that there actually never was such a thing as
bad dad was always relative notion and as an absolute
all there ever was was good so all that stuff
you thought was bad was actually always good but it
wasn't the lowercase G good it was the uppercase G
good so I understand this is a bit confusing and
all but this is a very powerful notion that I
want you to understand because we're gonna be coming back
to it over and over and over again especially in
part two of this series so keep that in your
back pocket and while we're talking about this let me
of course bring up the very well-known symbol of the
yin-yang sign this is the universal symbol of non duality
and also duality so understand that non duality contains within
it incorporates within it duality so non duality is a
transcendent or absolute which contains within it here you see
the the white and the black the white we say
let's say it's the good or the light the dark
is the bad or the shadow but but notice that
the symbol requires both parts in order to be complete
so you might focus on the white and think of
that as the good with the lowercase G you can
focus on the black and see that as the lowercase
be bad and then you can look at the entire
symbol and see that the totality of it as a
whole and what that is is that's the unification of
everything and that is the transcendental or the absolute with
the capital a/c and also what I want you to
notice here is that very interestingly there's a dot in
each of these teardrop shapes there's a dot so the
black has a dot of light and the white has
a dot of black so that's very important because what
that is communicating to you is that there's this dialectical
interplay and that it's not so simple to separate the
white from the black or the good from the bad
always within the good you're gonna find a little bit
of the bat and always within the bad here to
fine a little bit of the good kind of like
that example I was giving you with love and the
hate see there's this kind of dialectical interplay there there
there's this interconnectivity between whatever categories you create within reality
and so just keep that in mind there is a
sort of unacknowledged unity that we are denied which you
will start to admit and see more and more of
as you become more conscious and do more of this
work so let's keep going with the list right versus
wrong this is very similar to good versus bad and
on this duality we can also we can also say
that there is an absolute are with a capital right
with a capital R that would be the absolute which
is when you realize that everything is right there's no
such thing as wrong see you can become so conscious
that you realize that wrong is it's just a concept
and then everything is perfectly right going along with the
list positive versus negative you can also realize that there
is a positive with a capital P positive as an
absolute such that you become so conscious that you realize
that there's no such thing as a negative everything's a
positive there's a relative negative but as an absolute there's
only positive are you following me I know it's a
little tricky it's tricky because most people don't have a
reference experience for what the word absolute means so when
I say absolute if you've never experienced or become conscious
of the absolute then you don't know what that word
means it might sound like a belief or an idea
the absolute is not a belief or an idea it's
something you can become directly conscious of it's a way
of looking at the world let's just say for now
it's it's a more accurate way of looking at the
world from a higher consciousness elevation next on the list
is moral versus immoral this trips a lot of people
up a lot of people believe that certain things are
just fundamentally absolutely moral and other things are absolutely immoral
and in fact our legal system is sort of built
upon this fiction of this duality in fact our entire
sense of morality and even a lot of our emotional
system is built upon this fiction of this duality because
when we think that someone did something immoral usually the
way we think of it is that that guy did
something truly immoral truly evil and wrong and so he
deserves punishment he deserves to go to prison he deserves
to be executed he deserves whatever suffering he's receiving from
the universe for that he deserves his bad karma or
something like this see and then of course we get
angry when that person doesn't get whatever we think he
deserves for being immoral but you always have to wonder
who is determining what is moral and what is immoral
have you noticed that every tribe of humans across the
entire planet across all the different eras that humans have
been alive have had their own unique senses and notions
of what's moral and what's immoral oftentimes exactly the opposite
how can that be the case well it's because actually
moral and immoral are relative they're not absolute so one
of the key mistakes that people make here especially if
they're at spiral dynamic stage blue level of development or
below is they mistake for example lowercase G good and
lowercase G be bad they mistake these two as if
they're absolute rather than relative because stage Bleu is absolute
istic in the way that it thinks it's absolute istic
cognition so beware this trap all of your morality all
of your ethics everything you think is positive or negative
right or wrong or good or bad or evil all
of that I'm telling you right now is relative and
on top of that there is an absolute but the
absolute is not what you think it is it's not
what you think it is in fact it's usually the
opposite of what you think it is which is why
this is so tricky so most fundamentalist religious people the
thing they think is the absolute is actually relative the
thing they think is moral is actually just a fiction
of their own mind but there is an absolute that
they could access there is a good with the capital
G that they could access but they'll never access it
precisely because they're so stuck on defending this relative duality
as if it were absolute you see so they're clinging
to a false absolute is the problem which prevents them
from being able to access the true absolute and of
course to make this all even more confusing true and
false we'll be talking about that part two is itself
a duality that you're creating but on top of all
that there is an absolute truth which is not something
you're creating got it okay good now we'll be talking
more about it in part two we're getting ahead of
our skis here next on the list should versus shouldn't
this makes a lot of people feel very guilty and
bad about themselves is they they think of their stuff
they should be doing and stuff they shouldn't be doing
and they take it as absolutes that's sort of the
whole function of the notion of a should is if
something should be done that means it everyone has to
do it it should be done like you should not
kill people that's an absolute well really it's not an
absolute it's a relative because of course we kill people
in war we kill criminals we kill we kill all
sorts of people all the time people getting killed but
still we have this absolute silly idea that people shouldn't
get killed but you can transcend that and you can
get to should as an absolute shoot as an absolute
with a capital S is simply everything that is so
whatever is happening in the universe right now is precisely
what should be happening such that there isn't any shouldn'ts
there's only shoulds so is there a war going on
that you don't like well you tell yourself it shouldn't
happen actually it should because it is happening so therefore
it should and whatever else you think shouldn't be happening
if it's happening it should be happening who are you
to question what should be happening really as an absolute
what you realize is that everything that is happening is
what should be happening and there's no such thing as
something that shouldn't be happening because you're fully accepting it
so what you realize is that the notion of something
that should not be happening is itself a fantasy and
then you surrender that and you just accept everything exactly
as it is and that's what should be happening and
now you don't have a constant back and forth anymore
between should and shouldn't and in general that's the whole
value of realizing the true absolute when you realize the
true absolute you transcend the pettiness of the sort of
bickering and dialectical tug-of-war that goes on between these these
relative dualistic notions so you rise above good and evil
you rise above should and shouldn't you rise above morality
and immorality but that threatens a lot of people because
they think well leo but if I'm gonna rise above
good and evil that means what I'm gonna I'm gonna
be okay with evil happening but that's not what it
means but you had at the same time that is
what it means so it's tricky it's very tricky you're
transcending both of them you just have to trust that
when you truly transcend both of them what you're gonna
end up with is something better than what you had
at the level below where you were stuck in this
tug of war so this is how liberation is achieved
have you noticed how much tug of war there is
going on within life in the news in politics in
religion in science and academia and universities at your job
within your family within yourself everything's a tug of war
so in a certain sense what we're looking for with
with spiritual work and with personal development is to rise
above the fray as they say and to transcend this
tug of war how do you do it well you
can't do it by engaging in more tug-of-war you need
something new you need something Metta which is a higher
elevation above the tug of war so for example if
if you're in some political battle and your opponent is
slinging mud at you well you have an option one
option is to sling mud back and then you get
into a tug-of-war I'm right he's wrong and of course
he says that he's right and that I'm wrong and
then this tug of war goes back and forth and
some debate starts and this is very unproductive and you
see this everywhere you see this for example with with
the israeli-palestinian conflict the sort of tug of war that
never ends you see both sides sides are fighting with
each other not really understanding the other side so um
so the solution is to rise above that how do
you rise above it well that requires becoming conscious of
transcendent absolutes which of course most people are too busy
engaging in the tug-of-war in the debate in the conflict
in the battle in the struggle to to have time
to become conscious of the transcendent and the absolute because
if they if they became conscious of the absolute that
whole conflict would automatically melt away and it wouldn't exist
as a problem for you anymore in fact problems and
solutions what is that but another duality see so long
as you believe in that duality so long as your
mind is creating that duality then you're always gonna have
problems have you noticed that every problem you have you
create a solution for and then just another problem pops
up and you never run out of problems life is
just a never-ending stream of problems wouldn't it be nice
to find a way to transcend that well and what
you need is you need the ultimate solution and what
is the ultimate solution well that would be awakening waking
up from the dualistic dream that you're stuck in next
continuing down the list worst versus best how many times
have you caught up got caught up in this duality
trying to determine well who's the worst who's the best
out of all these people or out of all these
objects judging and evaluating and ranking and then arguing that
people like you and your friends you start arguing about
what's the best movie what's the worst movie and then
everyone has a different opinion right because it's relative how
about sad versus happy this is very tricky a lot
of people who get into personal development really what they're
looking for is happiness but they don't really understand how
tricky and counterintuitive happiness is they think they can get
happiness by developing themselves being successful getting money getting a
six pack abs and getting a hot girlfriend or a
nice husband or whatever else they think this will make
them happy of course it's not realizing that you can't
just have happiness without sadness because the way that you're
defining happiness is just one pole or end of this
duality and so the way that you're going about life
you're gonna have a lot of sadness as you're simultaneously
creating a lot of happiness and at some point you
get fed up with this sadness and you gonna say
[ __ ] man I want I want true happiness
is that is there a possibility for transcending this this
back and forth tug-of-war this up and down between being
happy and sad I'm tired of this I just want
to I want peace and I'll do whatever it takes
to get peace and then you do that and then
finally you awaken and you realize that to transcend happiness
and sadness you discover the absolute which is happiest with
a capital H you transcend both of them and then
you can be happy all the time without sadness but
that's something that's completely outside the realm of possibility for
most human beings because they're stuck in this the dualistic
relativistic tug-of-war between their emotions continuing on with lists old
versus new have you noticed how everything new becomes old
very very quickly what's new today will become old tomorrow
fashions video games movies technology you know take the newest
smartphone that came out this week well it's gonna be
old news by next year hmm interesting how that works
so is there actually anything new you might wander in
the universe is there actually anything old see what's old
is a is is is the first iPhone is that
old or is some dinosaur bone that's 50 million years
is that old or is some some galaxy which is
billions of years old or is that is that old
see it's all relative who gets to say and then
of course these terms are always context-sensitive so when we're
talking about technology we're using a very narrow a span
of time when we're talking about old and new you
know usually if it's if it's more than a year
then it's old as far as technology it within the
context of technology but we're talking about in the context
of dinosaurs or astrophysics or societies and now we're talking
about thousands of years millions and billions of years how
about moving on with a list foreground vs. background inefficient
versus efficient useful versus useless this one is really important
people don't realize that usefulness is relative so whether something
is useful to you depends on who you are and
what you need to survive consider the following possibility that
if you weren't you and if you didn't need to
survive then nothing would be useful to you or just
more practically if your goals change then usefulness changes too
maybe you have some goal in life like you have
the goal of earning a lot of money so then
you look at the whole world and perceive it in
terms of what's useful and what's useless to you in
terms of achieving that goal so maybe a relationship or
a marriage time with your kids that might all be
useless if your goal is to earn the most money
but then your goal changes and now your goal is
love to maximize love in your life and not to
maximize money let's say you get to that point in
your development well now all the sudden a lot of
useless stuff now all the sudden looks very useful to
you it's a useful towards maximizing love so now spending
time with your children and with your family and maybe
doing some charity work and doing some meditation and whatever
else now or some psychedelics maybe now all that has
become very useful and now running your business that's become
useless looking at your bank account and counting your money
that's become useless to you now see not only is
it useless it's actually negative it detracts from your time
pursuing love for example not to say that they'd necessarily
have to be in opposition you can you can earn
lots of money doing stuff you love for example so
again they're not they're not opposites you always have a
little speck of one within the other sometimes a lot
of speck and not just a speck but an entire
ocean of one within the other going down the list
boring versus exciting have you noticed how relative boring and
exciting are some game that you just buy some video
game you play it's the hottest newest game it's so
exciting you're playing it and then a week later now
it's boring did the game change nothing in the game
changed it's all you your mind is doing it it's
crazy crazy how that works huh sometimes you're sitting there
meditating you're bored out of your mind other times you're
sitting there meditating you're excited just like your meditation is
going good you're in the zone you're locked in you're
all focused you feel like you're getting some good gains
out of it now it's exciting for you and then
you get bored again how do you transcend that so
that your life is always exciting exciting with a capital
e is that possible maybe maybe could it be that
boredom is something that your mind is doing maybe going
down the list here versus there near versus far rich
versus poor you know it's funny it's so funny because
with rich and poor a lot of people think that
rich and poor are like these fixed categories but of
course they're not even the poorest person in America let's
say still lives like a king compared to how people
lived 2,000 years ago even the most lavish kings like
think about the the Pharaohs of Egypt or some you
know some emperor of Rome or whatever you would think
well these were the richest these were the richest people
in the world and they lift laut live lavishly but
they didn't have air conditioning didn't have refrigerators they didn't
have ice cream they didn't have fast food McDonald's that
you can buy for five dollars they didn't have cars
didn't have a bunch of stuff so I mean we're
all in the 21st century living like rich kings and
yet it's still not enough for you you're still miserable
so this tells you it doesn't matter how rich or
how poor you are of course rich and poor is
also relative in the sense that what really matters is
how rich or how poor are you relative to the
people you surround yourself with see if you're the richest
among all your friends you're gonna feel pretty good whereas
if you're the poorest among all your friends even if
you let's say you've got a million dollars but all
your friends have hundred million dollars are you gonna be
happy of course not you're gonna be miserable you're gonna
feel poor like you're really gonna feel poor because you're
gonna see all your hundred million dollar friends you know
buying expensive yachts and helicopters and other things jumbo not
jumper just but private jets let's say and you won't
be able to afford those with a million dollars but
you see what Ann went up went up even a
poorer person looks at that situation that they will that
Leo that's just ridiculous that's so ridiculous if I had
a million dollars I wouldn't be like that I would
be happy I don't need yachts and helicopters and and
private jets right that's because right now you're so poor
that you only have like ten thousand dollars if you're
earning a couple you know a couple dozen like what
let's say you're earning $30,000 a year if that's your
salary then of course a million dollars to you is
like it's like a pipe dream it's a fantasy you
think it's gonna make you happy until you get it
and then what you'll realize is that it's not all
it's cracked up to be and then you're actually gonna
be depressed you're gonna be depressed when you get it
cuz that fantasy is gonna be is gonna be rudely
popped a little bubbly yours is gonna be popped so
I'm telling you all this so that you see your
mind becomes flexible enough to see this relativity then you
can start to like look into the future and kind
of start to plan and figure out how things are
gonna work in counter intuitive ways that's important for the
kind of work that we're doing here how about the
duality of normal versus weird that trips a lot of
people up I know personally had a huge influence in
my life because we go to school right and in
school we're at school for 12 years basically and then
we go to college to most of us and and
through peer pressure and various kinds of cultural norms people
pick on us they laugh at us for being weird
and we're taught that being weird is wrong or bad
and so we're taught that we have to be normal
we have to fit in so we have to check
ourselves when we're going out we check ourselves in the
mirror are we Norma do I look normal I'm right
weird am I being weird is it weird if I
say this is it weird if I act this way
is it Moo is it weird if I if I
ask this person for something and then I guess the
point where we really start to feel like well all
that that thing is really weird no we laugh at
other people see we participated in all this ourselves so
we see some some some kid who dresses funny and
so oh look at like that weird kid let's laugh
at him let's pick on him see we do this
and in our mind as we do this as we
believe others and others bully us we reinforce this notion
of what's normal and what's weird but of course all
this is totally relative you go to a different school
you go to a different country you go to a
different time take a time machine go back a thousand
years normally weird are gonna be totally opposite so then
why do you take them so seriously why do you
invest so much emotional energy into being normal or maybe
the opposite maybe you're sort of the contrarian and you
actually have taken on the identity of being the weird
one and so now you've acted up and so like
you dress weird on purpose you act weird on purpose
you get weird tattoos and facial piercings on purpose to
kind of freak people out cuz you're gonna like a
sort of a anti-authoritarian streak in you but see you're
playing a role that role is now defining your whole
life you're a prisoner to that you're a prisoner either
to being normal or you're a prisoner to being weird
and as you're engaged in this tug of war you're
not able to be authentic an authenticity would be sort
of the absolute or the transcendent in this case it
would be authenticity with a capital A which transcends normality
and weirdness how about black versus white racially speaking African
versus European millions of people are hung up on this
as though it's important as though it matters as though
these categories are somehow given to us by God given
us to us by nature given us to us by
genetics but you know what many good biologists and and
serious scientists when they actually look into the data they
look it into genetics it's actually very difficult genetically to
distinguish many Europeans from Africans a lot of Europeans have
DNA that's closer to an African than to Africans have
to each other if you select the right throughout European
the right Africans see so a lot of these categories
though that we've constructed culturally just don't pass muster they
don't pass muster scientifically in many cases but even even
deeper than that there they don't pass muster even if
they did pass muster scientifically even if you showed me
all the genetic data that said that well there's a
very clear difference between Africans and Europeans or males and
females you know all males have a Y chromosome and
all females have two X chromosomes you might say that
means nothing that's only the scientific level you got to
go deeper to the existential level because what is a
chromosome and why do you hold it as being important
at all see a chromosome itself is a distinction X
versus Y chromosomes that's a distinction who created that distinction
you did of course who's giving that distinction importance you
are of course see where in the universe does it
say that there should be importance given to an X
or to a Y chromosome no where we made it
up why do we make it up because it's convenient
for our survival and to realize that we made it
up gives us the freedom to change it to let
go of it because you know what a lot of
times we make up [ __ ] that we think
is gonna help our survival but actually it hurts our
or it used to help our survival but now it
doesn't now it's become counterproductive because we've evolved beyond that
you know when we were living in the in the
savannas and the forests and jungles thousands of years ago
there was a much greater significance between males and females
and those gender roles than there is in 21st century
Western democratic society because most jobs today don't involve heavy
manual labor which was that distinguishing important factor between men
and women and most people today they're not engaged in
warfare tribal warfare and most women can do most of
the jobs that men can do and vice versa see
but if we get stuck on our old paradigms and
dualities and categories that holds us back and then we
get silly notions thinking like well but women aren't as
good engineers as men are we create these sort of
very simplistic black and white generalizations and then that can
harm people too it keeps us from interfacing more accurately
and directly with reality because really what we're doing is
were we're filtering reality through our categories and that radically
changes how we conceive a reality and then how we
relate to reality and then what we do with reality
and that's your whole life right there see so if
you really want to change your whole life start changing
and questioning these dualistic categories that you always take for
granted that's just a given has absolutes they're not absolutes
being black or white is not an absolute there are
people who were half and half what do you call
a person who's 50 percent black and 50% white 50
percent African 50 percent European are they black are they
white a lot of whites would call the black isn't
that interesting very uh very a biased way to look
at it and even many black people would call that
person black precisely because they know that even you have
a little bit of black in you you're gonna be
treated like you're black because that was the the way
that Europeans acted towards Africans for a long time and
that's that's still a trend it's it's deeply ingrained in
our culture very interesting isn't interesting when you have a
person who's 50% African and 50% european he's going to
be considered african not european by most people by our
culture very interesting and then of course look we create
entire identities you know people spend 50 years living this
identity of being african or being european they get wrapped
up in it whether they're reacting against it or whether
they're embracing it doesn't matter you could be some white
nationalist thing that europeans are the best or you could
be an african american spending your whole life building an
identity fighting that but in either case you're trapped in
it you're in this tug of war how do you
transcend it well of course you have to transcend race
even transcend the notion that you're a human being that
you're an animal that you're even a creature all of
this can be transcended if you access the absolute but
take some work and you can't do that work so
long as you're clinging to your African identity or you're
a pure European identity or your human identity what you
need to discover is your absolute identity and that's what
awakening is that's what non-duality is see when you fully
awake in what you'll realize is that your African your
European your Chinese your Asian your your Eskimo your Japanese
your your your all animals your dog your cat you're
an elephant you're a fly you're a mosquito you're a
space alien floating around on some planet inside their galaxy
all of it is you no boundaries no dualities no
categories see that's the power of questioning these categories these
categories are not just a conceptual thing you have to
understand and we'll we'll talk about this when we get
into part two but just to give you a preview
here these categories go to the very bone a reality
such that reality itself like I said before is a
category your body you think your body is a physical
body says who says you and what are you you
think you're what whatever you think you are that's a
category you're creating you is a category body is a
category you're creating these but you're not taking them as
something you create you're taking them as a given as
reality so what you have is you have this nested
web of belief which has been built up this sort
of operating system that's running your entire mind and your
entire life which is sort of categories nested within other
categories going all the way down more and more and
more fundamental and then there's a few super fundamental categories
at the very bottom the rock bottom that solidify your
entire life such that if these categories were seriously questioned
and unraveled your entire life would dissolve the notion of
you having a body would disappear you see most people
aren't open to this possibility but you are gonna be
practicing radical open-mindedness so you should be open to it
okay next moving on next duality flawed versus perfect we
tend to treat these as real like that's a perfect
diamond and therefore it's worth millions of dollars or no
that's a flawed diamond it's only worth $100 and you
might determine how much your husband loves you by the
size and quality and perfection of the diamond he gives
you and of course your husband will be judging you
based on the perfection of your beauty so he will
judge your body and your face and your butt and
your boobs and everything about you and your personality and
rank you on a scale of one to ten and
depending on where he ranks you he'll give you a
bigger diamond you see and while all of this nonsense
is going on what will be missed is perfection as
an absolute perfection of the capital P you can become
conscious that everything is perfect all the time there's no
such thing as imperfection imperfection is a relative thing wouldn't
that be an interesting way to look at the world
to see it as perfect all the time no matter
what is going on that's a powerful that's a powerful
shift in perception if you can accomplish that straight versus
curved dark versus light dirty versus clean this one is
interesting so notice the following if you take a piece
of [ __ ] on the sidewalk is it dirty
or is it clean of course everyone would say it's
dirty well not to a fly to a fly that's
that's a beautiful sight to a fly it's very clean
the fly will actually lay its eggs in the [
__ ] feast off the [ __ ] so first
of all notice that secondly though also notice if we
take a microscope and we zoom into that [ __
] let's say we zoom into it to the molecular
level and we take one molecule like a carbon atom
within the [ __ ] is the carbon atom dirty
or clean see you can't apply the category of dirty
and clean to a carbon atom because that category has
been created relative to us humans it's not an absolute
it's not like in the universe somewhere there's a database
that says that dog should is dirty no we created
that distinction what we mean when we humans say that
something is dirty is we mean that it's it's got
a certain relationship to our survival function so for example
you know we wouldn't want to wash our hands in
dog [ __ ] because we can get a disease
and then we could die from that and so in
that sense we call it dirty but that doesn't mean
it actually is dirty all it really means is that
this is something that might harm my survival ok that
might be true I don't recommend that you go washing
your hands in [ __ ] but see the problem
is is that some people get in their mind that
some things actually are dirty like sex is dirty the
Catholics will will guilt you into believing that sex is
dirty and then every time you have sex you're gonna
feel dirty then you're gonna go run take a shower
to wash yourself and you might say we'll leave with
that that's good because you know I don't want to
get some STD or something yeah but uh but you
can never enjoy sex now ever in your life because
you always think it's dirty see you're reacting against it
you're not doing it consciously if you really want to
see a shower go take a shower there's no problem
taking a shower after sex if you feel you need
to the problem is that you do it compulsively and
you feel guilty about it and you suffer for it
wild versus tame and what point does an animal become
tame you know humans tamed cats and dogs and cattle
and so forth I was watching a interesting documentary recently
was advice maybe Vice or box I don't know what
I was watching some YouTube video and they were talking
about how some Russian scientists Soviet scientists in like the
1950s or 60s developed a program for for breeding foxes
and it was thought that you can't tame a fox
did you know that some animals are actually tamable whereas
others are not for example you can't tame a rhinoceros
we're so conventional wisdom says and in fact one of
the one of the reasons that European civilization developed faster
than all other civilizations for example Africa and other places
like South America one of the reasons is because Europeans
were fortunate enough that they had when they were you
know still in there at caveman days before civilization is
they had an abundance of tamable animals which is purely
a coincidence it's a geographic and sort of coincidental factor
Europeans had access to horses and cattle and sheep and
goats and all sorts of animals that could be tamed
relatively easily you now see you go to Africa and
see a lot of white nationalists they'll make this argument
they'll say well but Europeans were the most advanced race
were the smartest way the highest IQs don't kid yourself
don't kid yourself you know how hard survival is in
Africa you know many how many diseases they have there
of course that's because of the geography because it's much
warmer wetter more humid there's a jungle there it's so
much harder to survive in Africa in the wild than
in Europe and they have a lot fewer table animals
go try to tame a giraffe go try to tame
an elephant go try to tame a rhinoceros or a
lion or a tiger can't do it in most cases
that you can tame elephants but but most of those
other animals you're not going to be able to tame
them because they're there their physiology and their genetics and
their psychology actually determines whether it attainable or not so
what this Russian scientist did in the Soviet era is
he was trying to tame foxes and so he was
selectively breeding foxes in order to to like breed breed
ones that had the kindest dispositions to human beings you
know the ones that would bite the least and so
forth and eventually he was able to succeed to the
point where now there's a semi tame version so it's
not fully tamed it's like half tamed it's still half
wild half tamed but you can actually keep it as
a pet so if you're wondering why why aren't you
know we have cats and dogs as pets we don't
have foxes as pets well because foxes were difficult to
tame and you know it took thousands of years all
the way till the 1960s for someone to tame tame
these foxes and even still they're not totally tame they
can still bite you and you can buy these foxes
they're very rare they're very expensive they cost like tens
of thousands of dollars but you can buy these semi
tame foxes very interesting scene so that just shows you
how how much bleed through there is between these categories
it's not so simple as just saying well that animals
a wild animal that name animals a tame animal right
but but at some point you got to figure that
for an animal to become tame it had to go
through a process of becoming more and more and more
tape so there were degrees of tameness it's not a
binary wild or tame next simple versus complex this is
relative wet versus dry common versus rare pros vs. cons
upsides vs. downsides fair vs. unfair a lot of people
complain about the unfairness of life how unfair things are
but that's only because they haven't transcended this dualistic notion
of famers is unfair to get to the absolute which
is fairness with a capital F so when you realize
that you as universal consciousness will live through every single
incarnation in lifetime of every human being in every animal
in the entire universe that has ever occurred ever will
occur which I talked about in my episode called the
radical implications of oneness so when you truly realize that
there's only one being in the entire universe that's gonna
live through all of itself all of the permutations when
you realize that you'll also realize that the universe is
perfectly fair fair with a capital F what that means
is that in one lifetime for example you will get
robbed and that will be unfair for you in that
lifetime but simultaneously you're also living as the person who
robbed you you see so that person who robbed you
they get to enjoy the money they stole from you
so that's the fairness pay back but who's it paid
back to you think it's paid back to them no
it's paid back to you because you're gonna be the
one who gets robbed from and the one who Rob's
and then enjoys that money see so you're gonna experience
both sides of every equation in life a very situation
so whatever you think is unfair now you'll experience the
opposite of it you'll experience everything and by doing that
it will be one complete fare perfection but of course
that takes a radical degree of awakening to realize how
about winning versus losing gain verses loss have you noticed
how relative this is people get hung up on being
a winner or being a loser they build their entire
identity around this look at our president he's obsessed with
being a winner and not being a loser like it's
driving his whole damn life look at what it's making
him do it's driving him crazy he actually thinks it's
that there are winners and losers in life success versus
failure a lot of people get hung up trying to
be successful in life and not being a failure because
their father didn't give them enough love so they need
to prove something to themselves and to their father or
to whatever notion they have see without realizing that of
course success is all relative what is what is success
is earning a hundred million dollars is that success or
is becoming awakened and raising your capacity to love or
is that success or having a successful marriage with with
beautiful children's that success what is success is there even
such a thing as failure people become very depressed by
believing that they've failed in life or they failed in
their career they fail as an artist or they fail
to as a husband or as a wife or as
a son or a daughter see so this is not
just philosophy it's very practical stuff here we're talking about
fake versus genuine what happens when you make a fake
that is so good that you can't distinguish it from
something genuine does it stop being fake at that point
fiction versus nonfiction a lot of times fiction has more
truth in it than nonfiction have you noticed that good
fiction always has a lot of truth in it and
a lot of nonfiction doesn't or it has shallow truth
cowardice versus bravery these seem like opposites but are they
really most people who do brave stuff they do it
despite the fear they have the line between some act
of bravery and cowardice is very very thin a lot
thinner than most people think a lot of people get
in their mind that well well that person he's brave
he's a brave person and that person's a coward well
of course sometimes it's very clear like that some people
are very fearful and therefore cowardly but a lot of
what we would call brave people that we idolize really
you know they're just like hairs with the way from
having been a coward the difference is very small and
a lot of people could be brave about one thing
but then cowardly in some other thing so it's not
like you're brave across the board in all situations there
are certain areas in life where you'll find it easy
to be brave and other areas in life where you'll
find it very difficult to be brave you'll be a
coward in those areas those will be like your weak
spots but see what if someone gets it in their
mind that all have a coward I have a coward
and they keep telling themselves that story all the time
and they start to believe in it they build an
identity out of being coward based on a couple of
cherry-picked you know situations from their life how about slave
versus master you can't have a slave without a master
and you can't have a master without a slave in
a certain sense and this is this is sort of
the whole idea of things going full circle a master
a slave master is enslaved by owning slaves he's enslaved
to that paradigm see he's enslaved to being a slave
master now of course being a slave master is better
than being a slave but you're still not free as
a slave master how about superficial versus profound this is
very relative abstract versus concrete general versus specific growth versus
decay growth and decay always follow one another people keep
chasing never-ending growth never-ending profits never-ending excitement never-ending happiness never-ending
personal growth it doesn't happen whatever goes up must come
down as the saying goes how about versus calm you
can transcend this duality to an absolute calm calm with
the capital C by awakening about arrogance versus humility a
lot of times the most humble people are the ones
who were extremely arrogant earlier in their life so really
what happened is that their humility is not in opposition
to their arrogance it's actually the consequence the culmination of
arrogance is humility because you act very arrogantly especially when
you're young in your 20s and 30s and then you
become wiser you discover deeper truths and you use self-reflect
and you see your arrogance with the airiness with which
you behaved and you you got humbled by your own
arrogance it becomes disgusting to you you can't stand it
anymore but then you become humble you get sick of
your own arrogance how about the duality of violence versus
peace war versus peace a lot of people get hung
up on this and uh and a lot of liberals
and progressives get hung up on this because liberals tend
to get this idea that well peace is good vile
is bad war is bad all war is bad all
war is wrong there shouldn't be war speaking of shouldn't
shouldn't be war there shouldn't be any war without realizing
that actually it's only possible to have peace through violence
and through war so you can transcend this duality and
you can realize that there is only peace as an
absolute peace with a capital P and what that means
is that even when war is going on your collection
enough to realize that that war that violence is actually
leading to an ultimate greater peace that's part of the
whole long-term design of the universe is that every act
is ultimately leading towards greater greater good and greater peace
greater love greater unity greater consciousness see but most people
aren't you stuck in the tug of war to realize
the function of war and violence they just want it
to end but what they're doing in that situation is
they're just they're mistaking peace with a lowercase P for
peace with an uppercase P you can't just have total
peace without any war violence can't have that there's a
reason why war happens and violence happens because it should
happen you need to surrender your notion that it shouldn't
happen now that doesn't mean that you can't take actions
to limit war and violence so I'm not saying you
know go nuts and start bombing everyone that's not what
I'm saying I'm just saying that if bombing happens when
it does happen since it is happening it is happening
and therefore it should be happening and you need to
realize that you can realize what is the role that
that bombing is playing the larger scheme of everything that's
something that many liberals and progressives just can't stomach that
it's it's beyond them because they're they're stuck on this
relative duality personal versus impersonal is the universe personal or
impersonal it's it's so both it's so much both it's
so impersonal and yet it's also so deeply personal that's
what makes it so interesting that's the paradox so you'll
discover that when you awaken innocent versus guilty oh this
is this is hornet's nest people start arguing about where
guilt and blame should go and who's really innocent that
becomes a dualistic trap past versus future have you noticed
that the past or that the future always becomes the
past and the past has always been a future at
some point until it happened and then it became the
past confused versus clear capitalism versus socialism versus communism oh
man people are getting so confused about these labels these
political labels or for that matter conservative versus liberal this
duality it's a totally relative duality what does it really
mean to be conservative or liberal I mean people who
were liberals 50 years ago are now conservatives legal versus
illegal this of course all relative countries have very different
léo systems we make them up out of thin air
criminal versus non criminal criminal versus police terrorist versus non
terrorist these are all very tricky dichotomies you know criminal
versus police when you create this dichotomy it makes it
seem as though the police can never be criminal but
we have to realize that the police can also be
criminals so you know in many third-world countries the police
are more criminal than the criminals are that they're supposed
to be policing so that that's exactly what that yin-yang
symbol is showing you you know in the white there's
a dot of black and you gotta be mindful of
that otherwise what's gonna happen you're gonna be you're gonna
be running the police department not realizing that there's a
giant cancer corruption growing in your Police Department terrorist vs.
non terrorist people get this idea that it's very easy
to classify what a terrorist is but you know as
we discovered after the Iraq war and with all the
fiasco with Guantanamo Bay and imprisoning and extraordinary rendition all
this kind of shady stuff that the u.s. was doing
all these enemy combatants that were classified as terrorists so
they could be tortured and and interrogated in cruel ways
a lot of them it turns out you know years
later we see the reports leaking a lot of them
like we're not even close to terrorists they were just
like random guys that were picked up in Iraq or
somewhere else you know that we're mistaken for a terrorist
you know just like an innocent mistake and he was
just like a guy walking down the street and then
he gets into some you know a Guantanamo prison gets
gets tortured like he has no information to give you
but he's just classified as a terrorist he gets no
due process doesn't see a judge for decades can't defend
himself eats thinking about it's a horrific situation but a
lot of people they just say well the government called
him a terrorist so he must be a terrorist and
then what qualifies the terrorists you got to be a
Muslim to be a terrorist mmm does a white guy
shooting up a school or a church does that count
as a terrorist many white guys think no terrorists must
be Muslims see so this notion of terrorism gets linked
with nationalism these categories become very very black and white
very overly generalized and lead to all sorts of delusions
and bad policy hero versus villain you know my favorite
movies is where the hero and the villain aren't very
clear [ __ ] with your mind because it's very
easy to write a story or a movie or you
have just a clear hero clear villain but that's not
how it works in real life in real life you've
got that white but it's got a spot of black
and you've got that black but it's got a spot
of white so if you really want to write a
good story as a writer you got to really understand
this psychological stuff you know if you watch actualize that
org for five years and you learn everything I talk
about and you do the practices and you're a writer
you want to write stories you're gonna you're gonna be
a [ __ ] genius at writing stories cuz you're
going to know all the emotional buttons to push and
you're gonna be able to write characters that are just
like so psychologically true so psychologically true because you're gonna
for example understand that you need to give your villain
some redeeming loving qualities you need to show how your
villain when you're when your villain is doing evil in
whatever story you're writing write it in such a way
such that the audience realizes that the evil he's doing
is actually being done out of love from his perspective
that's how you write a good villain and and then
with the hero the hero you got to give him
some weaknesses he can't be a superhero strong he has
to have legitimate weaknesses and aspects of darkness that pull
him away from his heroism into villainy that's how you
write a a realistic and emotionally resonant hero and then
when you get them fighting with each other weren't conflicting
with each other dad you had this interesting interplay that's
how a great story is is made see you got
to really understand human psychology it's a right good story
in fact one of the reasons I got into studying
human psychology is because I wanted to be a writer
I wanted to write science fiction when I was younger
and I was really interesting like how do I make
a good film and I didn't want just to make
he's just evil like I really wanted my villain to
be relatable and I wanted the audience to have empathy
for the villain in fact I wanted the villain to
end up being like the the main part the shining
part of the whole story not the hero so that's
a little tangent for you journey versus destination a lot
of people chase destinations without realising that the journey and
the destination are holding the same ruler versus ruled ugly
versus beautiful that of course can be transcended to beauty
with a capital B where you see everything as beauty
there's no such thing as ugliness there's only beauty when
you get to the absolute art versus non art discord
versus harmony masturbation versus sex this one's funny people get
hung up about masturbating and fab nofap and all this
but when you become truly conscious what you realize when
you realize non-duality when you realize oneness is actually you
realize that all of this is just God's masturbatorium God
is just masturbating that's all God is doing cuz God
is one so there's nobody else here but you you
are God so anyone you're having sex with is you
masturbating so what you're doing is you're using their body
to masturbate there's no difference between masturbation and sex not
really not if you take a high-enough perspective on it
student versus teacher well the best teachers are usually great
students and also if you want to learn a lot
if you want to be a really good student try
being a teacher teaching is one of the best ways
to study child versus parent or child versus adult we
create these cat korie's but you know what a lot
of adults are more immature than some children and of
course every adult is itself a child name me one
adult who is not a child at the same time
every adult was a child and still is a child
to some other adult which is why your mom still
treats you as a child even when you're growing up
because she still sees you as a child from her
perspective you know it's all relative and then of course
children become parents children have other children just shows you
how interesting the interplay is it's really profound when you
start to contemplate this and I recommend that you contemplate
all these dualities for yourself don't just take my word
for it really think about it there's there's a lot
here there's a reason I made this long list healthy
versus unhealthy personal development versus or sorry product development versus
marketing product development not person the moment so what I
mean by this is you know in certain companies they
will separate the product development department from the marketing department
so like the product whatever pertinents we're making some phone
some gadget some iPod or whatever okay so we're making
this iPod that's done in the product development department the
engineers do that and then we have the marketing department
who's creating the marketing campaign for the iPod and they
don't communicate with each other they're separated in two different
buildings around the world they don't talk to each other
and then you got a terrible product and marketing campaign
both to have a really successful product launch you need
to integrate from the very beginning the product development with
the marketing a lot of newbie business people they they
spend all their time on product development zero time on
marketing and then they develop a product the product might
be great but then the marketing sucks so the product
never actually gains traction nobody knows about it nobody buys
it it goes out of business because you didn't pay
attention to how the product would be marketed you got
to design your product in such a way that it
will market itself that takes work so the best product
developers are often the best marketers you see oftentimes by
studying marketing you can learn what kind of product you
should be developing like what kind of features do people
want what kind of features are actually marketable and then
sometimes you have the opposite problem which is where marketing
dictates to the product development people what they should be
developing and so then what you get is you get
a sort of a a very marketing cheap salesy type
of product which is trying to appeal to everybody and
it doesn't really have a heart or a soul that
a great inventor or designer or engineer or artist would
have put in to developing that product so there has
to be a delicate balance between those two if you
want to get it right a lot of times notice
within academia and universities they create different majors different sub
schools different departments mm-hmm like you've got the engineering department
which is separate from the computer science departments separate from
the biology departments separate from the humanities separate from the
arts they're all in different buildings they don't talk to
each other they criticize and look down upon [ __
] so these CAD but these are all artificial dualities
there's no real separation between the humanities and the sciences
and the arts this is a fiction there's no real
separation between biology and chemistry this is a fiction and
this creates bad science because most of the interesting science
especially nowadays is happening at the intersection point between the
hard sciences and the soft sciences and the arts and
the sciences and mathematics and physics and chemically it's all
in-between in the cracks is where you find the really
juicy stuff how about uncivilized versus civilized well that's very
relative Europeans have considered most other nations around the world
and peoples around the world very uncivilized and yet you
go to the Amazon you discover some some tribe of
the Amazon that doesn't barely wear any clothes and and
yet they have very sophisticated spiritual wisdom teachings traditions that
are more sophisticated for example in the Amazon you'll find
very sophisticated spiritual psychological development through the use of ayahuasca
for example stuff that in America in the West Western
psychologists and psychotherapists can't even comprehend the degree of wisdom
that might be present in some shaman who's doing ayahuasca
and yet they considered the shaman to be the uncivilized
one how funny is that how about spirituality versus politics
or church versus state you could make the argument that
it's important to separate Church versus you know church from
state that is true that was an important development within
our politics but at the same time you also can't
separate spirituality from politics when your politics is divorced completely
from all spirituality what you get is you get a
sort of technocracy and a sort of corporatist evil just
materialism run amok so actually you do need spirituality to
inform politics just in the right way not as an
organized religion per se but you do need spiritual wisdom
within politics or it's it's going to be really bad
and in fact in the future we're gonna see a
trend where more and more politicians are more open about
their spiritual not about their religion but about their spirituality
and how that shapes their vision their goals their values
and their leadership ability in fact some of the best
political leaders were deeply spiritual practitioners like Gandhi would be
a great example of that and we're gonna see more
of that in the future it's really difficult to get
that balance right because politics tends to be very dirty
and but at the same time is precisely because politics
is so dirty that it's so deeply in need of
consciousness and spiritual wisdom and spiritual leaders at the same
time when you combine spirituality and politics you get a
really nasty combination such that the politics can end up
dragging the spirituality into the mud so you got to
be very firmly rooted in your spirituality has to be
very genuine and authentic in order for you then to
be also a good political leader very few people can
pull that off and that's because they're they're not practicing
spirituality on deep enough level it's just mostly dogma and
beliefs that's not gonna cut it so if we're talking
about dogma and beliefs in organized religion then yes it's
very important to have a separation of church and state
important versus unimportant that's very relative significant versus insignificant mother
versus father what if you are raised by two fathers
two gay men gay couple they adopt you and they
raise you do you think that's gonna affect your understanding
of the word mother and father that category for you
you will have a different sense of that category than
traditionally raised people about democracy versus tyranny it might seem
that these are two totally opposite things but not necessarily
a lot of tyranny can come out of democracy Hitler
was democratically elected see a lot of times unconscious ethnocentric
people will elect a highly ethnocentric authoritarian leader who then
becomes a tyrant but he's lefted democratically and then even
in a democracy you could still have a sort of
tyranny of the masses where the majority can oppress the
minority which is why minority rights protecting my only right
is so important sober versus intoxicated this one's very interesting
because sometimes people say well Leo was did you have
a real awakening or was it a psychedelic trip that
you did and I look at that and I say
well what's the difference what's the difference you're making this
category of being conscious without a psychedelic or with psychedelic
whether you're intoxicated or not it's still you're still having
some kind of awakening now of course there are important
differences I'm not saying that they're indistinguishable but all I'm
just saying that the boundary is not so easily set
as you think it's possible to have a deeper awakening
intoxicated than sober see most people don't think that way
most people think very simplistic like well if it's intoxicated
that it can't be a real enlightenment it can't be
real wisdom it can't be real insight it can't be
real truth man uh-huh I've access deeper truths than you
will ever access sober while I was intoxicated so just
keep that in mind and not just me many many
other people you've got to be intoxicated in the right
way beginning versus end have you noticed that every mmm
end is some new beginning and every beginning has an
end need versus want that's very tricky these change so
much your knees and your wants what you need what
you feel you need a billionaire might feel like he
needs a yacht and you might say well he doesn't
really need it well to him it seems like he
needs it and as long as it feels that way
to him it'll it'll be a need not just a
want most of the stuff in life that you need
you don't actually need you want it then again you
need to satisfy your wants it's sort of programmed into
you do you need to live or do you want
to live think about that is there a need for
you to be alive or is it something you want
there's no need so in that sense what do you
need at all you might say well you need water
and air well only if you need to be alive
but you don't need to be alive so if you
want to be alive then you want water and you
want air see how we can play with these it's
very fluid pain versus pleasure people hold these opposites when
really they're not it's actually possible to enjoy pain and
pleasure can get so pleasureful and so so much too
much too cloying to the point where it gets nauseating
too much pleasure and it's possible to transcend living your
life between these poles of chasing pleasure and avoiding pain
does that tug of war never ends you're always stuck
bouncing back and forth yo-yoing between those two and that
in itself becomes painful and then become quite frustrating so
it's possible to transcend that such that you're in sort
of a state of joy which transcends both pleasure and
pain individual versus group or individualism versus collectivism I see
people talking about this in the political context as if
like individualism is good and collectivism is bad or vice-versa
no there needs to be a very delicate balance between
these two you can't have a society that totally values
individualism and nothing no collectivism or vice-versa it's very important
to strike a delicate balance between those two because actually
the importance of collectivism is that when you get the
collectivism right when you get the right collective it actually
empowers individualism that's what people to understand who are harsh
individualist s' that's what a lot of like libertarians and
conservatives don't understand about socialism for example if we get
socialism done right it'll actually enable individualism because right now
under the current system in America for example your individualism
is crippled by the economic conditions under which you're in
so the capitalist system actually makes it less possible for
the majority of people to be individuals and to be
free that's the paradox and irony of it but of
course if the collectivism becomes too much then you get
the sort of Borg collective scenario where it's sort of
like I guess a little bit like Communist China where
you know the government is is censoring everything and dictating
everything you do you know implanting chips into children so
that they can monitor them this source of stuff that's
happening in China and you know that that is problematic
that does actually hurt individualism so there's an important role
for both of these forces and really what you do
is through non-duality and spirituality you transcend them both and
you realize how important both of them are you need
to allow people to be individuals but at the same
time individuals also need to recognize that they must sacrifice
for the collective good for society it's not just about
you the way that libertarians I think like well if
I just get what I want and you know I'm
left alone and I'm doing good then that's all that
like matters and that any any sort of collectivism well
that's a man that's infringing on my rights you know
taxation that's infringing on my rights to keep all of
my income you're taking my income at the point of
a gun but you live in a society dude you
live in a [ __ ] society you're a tribal
ape creature and the only reason you're alive and that
you were even born is because you're part of this
collective whether you like it or not the problem is
that libertarians don't accept that they're in a collective they
don't fathom this and that being in a collective means
certain sacrifices have to be made you don't just get
individualism to the hilt primary versus secondary as a duality
fought feeling emotion we already talked about that a bit
inclusion versus exclusion theists versus atheist this one I've talked
about this one at length in the past so I'll
just briefly touch on it most theists and atheists think
that the spectrum just has two ends to it and
that's it they don't recognize there's sort of a meta
level and meta meta meta levels that incorporates both and
you can transcend both theism and atheism they're really not
opposites at all most theists and atheists have a lot
in common a lot more than they're willing to admit
and they both have a lot of delusions that they're
not willing to admit consistent versus inconsistent moderate versus extreme
what is extreme extreme is completely relative attraction versus repulsion
these are defined in terms of each other contraction versus
expansion dominant versus submissive you need both for that relationship
to work gross versus subtle popular versus unpopular main stream
versus niche what's mainstream today used to be niche ten
years ago and vice-versa status quo versus change again in
politics people love to get hung up on this they
either defend the status quo or they want change without
realizing the importance that both forces play it's important to
preserve the status quo in a certain way and it's
important also to get healthy change it's possible to get
dysfunctional and unhealthy status quo and also dysfunctional and unhealthy
change so it's not enough to just say that you're
for change what kind of change are you talking about
and it's not enough to denounce the status quo because
you're gonna recognize all the foundation that the status quo
gives you that you wouldn't otherwise have all the luxuries
and freedoms you have given the status quo I've given
the infrastructure built by society you know you gotta respect
that to a certain degree incremental change versus revolutionary change
people argue about this should we change government a little
bit or a lot and then the revolutionaries they criticize
the incrementalist s-- because the incrementalist are viewed as just
being too you know too lukewarm to moderate and the
revolutionaries they don't realize the importance of incremental change you
can't just revolutionize everything it's gonna be unstable and it's
gonna collapse but also they're right in a certain sense
because the moderates an incrementalist you know they're a little
too conservative and in certain times you need revolutionary change
you need a big change sometimes in your life or
in your government in order to move up to the
next level so how do you find that balance well
it's tricky it's not black-and-white stable versus unstable temporary versus
eternal this is one of those absolutes you can transcend
this to eternal with a capital e where you realize
that everything is eternal it exists outside of time this
very moment exists outside of time it's an absolute addition
vs. subtraction for example isn't it interesting how you can
add a negative number to a positive number or you
can like you can subtract two negative numbers and then
that like gives you a positive number it's kind of
weird how the rules of that work when you start
to work with like double negatives mixing and matching positives
and negatives in your addition and then you know you
learn those rules in elementary school I'm so so like
your your adding and subtracting positives and negatives and it
can work in counterintuitive ways we're like negatives can add
up into a positive how about work versus play do
you think of your work as separate from your play
or is your to work your play see what determines
whether something is work forces play have you noticed sometimes
you're playing a game it's a fun game but then
you start to grind on that game and now it
feels like work and then sometimes you're working but it's
if you're so engrossed in it you're so excited by
it and you're so passionate about it like you're following
your life purpose let's say and now it starts to
feel like you're playing and you're not working like if
you're maybe doing music you're playing with music or you're
playing with paint on the canvas if you're an artist
or you're playing with words if you're a writer and
then your work becomes play how do you turn work
into play and how do you prevent play from becoming
work not so easy content versus context this one's tricky
a lot of content becomes the context for yet more
content context is usually a self content of some kind
so sort of like content is nested within context but
then you can have multiple nestings multiple contexts within each
other multiple sets of content closed versus open local versus
global minimum versus maximum buyer versus seller lender versus borrower
entrance versus exit every entrance is an exit unless of
it's a one-way door and then it only is an
exit or an entrance like versus dislike ignorance versus wisdom
emotional versus rational this is a really tricky duality that
people get stuck on they either think of themselves as
being emotional or rational they side with one or the
other but that realizing that the two interplay with each
other a lot of rational people don't realize that their
rationality itself is underpinned by emotional needs and attitudes and
that all their logic and reason is actually infested and
motivated by unconscious emotions which will be a rude awakening
for them to discover because it'll it'll burst that entire
rationalist bubble that they're operating under usually these are staged
orange people functional versus dysfunctional very relative employee versus employer
sexual versus non-sexual what makes a thing sexual it's kind
of a gray area you know people have weird sexual
fetishes our feet sexual or non-sexual for some people their
sexual leader versus follower you can't have a leader without
followers you can't have a follower that leader victim versus
abuser usually these two you know as they say it
takes two to tango usually these two kind of work
in tandem with each other if you get victimized a
lot it's because you're playing a victim a lot and
then you're playing into this into this role of victim
abuser and likewise if you're an abuser and you tend
to seek out victims to relate to creating these dysfunctional
relationships and a lot of times the victim him or
herself is an abuser also in a different way in
a different scenario so while they're complaining about being a
victim they themselves are abusing somebody else predator-prey friend versus
enemy us versus them people versus corporations this is an
interesting one especially in the context of politics we didn't
talk about all the corporations are the evil ones that
of course corporations do do a lot of evil selfish
stuff that benefits only them but then again don't treat
corporations as though they're separate from people who creates these
corporations who runs these corporations a corporation is made out
of its people so to really understand the politics of
corporations you've all felt you have to you have to
really understand that corporations are people because they're made out
of people in a sense and they have a similar
psychology and dynamics to people because they're mad at people
private versus public it's another thorny duality for for politics
like we tend to think of like there's the private
realm and there's the public realm and they're separate but
of course they're not separate your private life will bleed
over into your public life and your public life will
bleed into your private life how people think of you
publicly will affect how you deal with your family and
your children and your wife or your husband and how
you deal with your family your children your wife and
your husband will show up publicly and people will judge
you for that a lot of people who are public
celebrities and so forth they try to kind of like
live double lives they have a public life and have
a private life and they're separate and they act differently
publicly than they do privately but then that becomes difficult
to maintain and yet at the same time you also
need to maintain some distance you can't just you know
reveal your credit card number to everybody and like show
pictures of your naked children to people and in public
you know you got to have some boundaries so how
do you strike this balance well it's tricky the whole
point of life is that the devil is in the
details what life is is reality sorting out all of
this and working with these boundaries you see is that
it's a dialectical dynamic activity of drawing these boundaries so
your mind is constantly doing it but it's always happening
in reality as well stuff like predator and prey you
know they're they're always fighting with each other chasing and
running away and doing that and who's gonna win well
you have to actually have kind of a clashing of
opposites to see who wins the tug-of-war you don't know
ahead of time competition versus cooperation this is an interesting
duality oftentimes you compete with those people that you cooperate
with the most for example if if you're working in
some office you've got 20 people on your team and
you guys are working together on some project you're supposed
to all be cooperating yet at the same time there's
a lot of competition within that cooperation precisely because those
people working with you are the ones who are going
to be now considered for the next promotion and there's
only so many of those promotions you're not and not
everyone's gonna get one so you're trying to cooperate and
compete at the same time that's tricky how do you
balance that safety versus danger that's very tricky to balance
as well for example with with with things like gun
gun control or even with controlling drugs and psychedelics you
know there's certain dangers with psychedelics you can't just give
it to everybody that would be dangerous at the same
time you don't want to overemphasize the danger of psychedelics
the way that it's been demonized in our culture to
the point where many people who suffer from PTSD depression
anxiety ADHD and so forth who would benefit enormous Lee
and could heal themselves through psychedelics they can't because people
just naively think that they're dangerous because the dangers are
completely overblown so it's not the case that psychedelics don't
have any danger they do it's just it's been overblown
mediocre versus excellent implicit versus explicit culture versus cults very
interesting what's considered a cult and what's considered mainstream culture
a lot of times that difference is very thin as
we see in our politics right now a lot of
our politics is dominated by by cult psychology cults of
personality which have become mainstream in a certain sense ordinary
versus extraordinary and of course you can transcend that to
experience the absolute which is extraordinary the capital E when
everything becomes extraordinary nothing is ordinary to you anymore and
lastly serious vs playful a lot of times comedians will
actually use humor and be playful about the most serious
things precisely because that's where you need humor the most
is when something serious happens it's sort of a psychological
coping mechanism sometimes something is so serious like have you
ever experienced a trauma so bad situation so bad that
you just say you start to laugh because if you
took it any more seriously it would be tragic it
would be suicidal and I'm gonna end on on two
dualities here which one serious one or one playful one
so the first one is the serious one masculine versus
feminine or man versus woman I touched on this already
but it really bears going into a little bit deeper
because we're seeing a trend now culturally especially with young
males where they're sort of reacting against feminism against femininity
and there's a sort of desire for hyper masculinity and
macho Ness the sort of red pill culture this MOG
men going their own way this mocktail culture pickup culture
gender norms are being questioned homosexuality is becoming normalized but
yet people still resist it especially more conservative parts of
the country and though in the world still resist it
still deny it and you know common sense people say
Leo what are you talking about I mean isn't it
obvious there's a man there's a woman you can clearly
tell them apart is this really a category that the
mind creates I mean is the mind really creating a
dick with balls and a vagina is that what the
mind is creating of course not of course the mind
is not actually creating the physical organs in that way
that you think that simplistic way but what you're doing
is you're creating these categories of man versus woman and
part of the reason that we're having this sort of
backlash against social justice warriors is because they're blurring the
boundary post-modernism is blurring the three between what it means
to be a man and what it means to be
a woman homosexuality does that - which is why there's
homophobia because really homophobia what that's about is it's about
not accepting your own feminine side trying to act macho
when really you have some feminine side in you that
you're denying and repressing and creating a shadow out of
so his man and woman is male and female is
this a mental construct the answer is yes it is
gender roles are categories that you're constructing using your mind
now of course it's not just you personally using your
mind it's the entire culture and also all the ramifications
and repercussions and significance that comes with this and it
has huge enormous significance and it's precisely because the significance
is so large and it's so practical and useful that
you consider it so real when it's actually not real
so um first of all you can have biological organs
that people are born with which is just a weird
combination of stuff it's not just your standard set of
parts that a man and a woman has it's some
weird combination so how do you classify those people are
they men are they women what set of criteria are
you gonna use can you see how it's relative in
that sense so you can see in that edge case
how those edge cases are precisely what breaks down the
duality and you should expect that such education exists because
otherwise you get this very simplistic notion of thinking like
well only humans can be born with either one penis
or with one vagina and that's it that's the only
way they can be born with it's just not medically
that's false so you gotta count for those edge cases
but even if we ignore those educators and we just
look at anatomical man and anatomical women let's say they
the men have X and y chromosomes and the women
just have the the X chromosomes and you're just gonna
judicata that way that's still that's still a mental construction
because your notion of man and woman goes way way
way beyond any kind of sense of chromosomes in fact
what you're doing is you're using the notion of chromosomes
and biology or physiology to backwards rationalize your concepts and
categories of man and woman you have very rich categories
of man and woman with a lot of ancillary associations
so when I say man you think of certain things
and not other things you think of beards and you
think of strength than you think of you know fast
cars and a lot of associations and when you think
of women you think of a lot of other sorts
of associations so you got to understand that you're a
category this duality it's not just as simple as like
oh well it's one thing or it's another thing it's
like no there's there it brings with it so many
assumptions and it interconnects with the rest of your view
of the world and who you are your personal identity
right this is all very deep and it's all wired
into your emotions as well so it's not just like
some dry thought of like well we're just gonna we're
gonna create a formula for identifying a man versus a
woman yes you can create a formula which will be
maybe 98% accurate and identifying a man versus a woman
like you could train a computer to do that a
computer could take photographs of the below the waist of
a man and a woman and be very accurate identifying
which was a man which is a woman but um
but this tells you nothing about the fact that these
are some sort of real or absolute categories that are
mind independent because when we say man or woman it's
mostly all the association's you have with that that matter
not your at your ability to identify one versus the
other and we're not saying here don't make the mistake
of thinking that what I'm saying here is that it's
impossible to distinguish a man versus a woman or it's
impossible to distinguish for example safety versus danger where it's
impossible to distinguish of mediocre film from an excellent film
that's not what I'm saying you can distinguish these things
just recognize that you are the one who is doing
the distinguishing and also recognize what role does this play
in how you then interact with life what significance do
you attach to the distinction for example I can easily
distinguish most men for most women as can some red
pill mocktail guy but there's a very big difference between
my understanding of men and women and my integration of
masculine or feminine versus some MOC Thao guy because the
mocktail guy will think of like a woman and then
he'll have a bunch of associations women always cheat they're
their [ __ ] they're [ __ ] they're there
over feminizing young men there destroy society they're feminists feminism
is wrong I've got some emotions about that as this
guy this red pill guy I've got some I've got
some insecurities about that that I'm hiding I've got a
shadow I'm repressing I've got various political views there shouldn't
be a woman president there shouldn't like there shouldn't be
women in the military and women are weak they're the
weaker sex and you know I need women force F
for sex see it's not all negative of course your
relationship is conflicted and and fragmented as this red pill
mocked out guy because see on the one hand you
hate women and you demonize women and judge them on
the other hand you still need them because you've got
your sexual needs so what do you do on the
one hand you're criticizing women on the other hand you're
going downloading porn and watching women and jerking off to
them and getting your you know your sexual needs met
that way you think that's not creating a problem in
your minds there that you're gonna have to recognize reconcile
later in your life it is it absolutely is so
with spiritual practice as you become more conscious what you're
gonna do is you're gonna transcend and incorporate or integrate
masculine or feminine man and woman you're gonna stop identifying
as a man or a woman and you're gonna realize
that these are just two forces and that your your
above and beyond that you are the absolute which includes
everything and just to finally nail this point home one
of my favorite video games is morrowind I love love
love that gave so much and one of the sort
of pieces of lore within morale it's got a very
rich and deep lore that I haven't even really studied
much but um part of it that I do know
is they have this character called vivec and if you're
if you're sort of a gamer nerd you know vivec
then you know vivec is multi-coloured he's divided in half
he's actually not a he it's sort of like a
he-she it's it's a mixture of male and female which
is very interesting and vivec also in this in the
lore there he's supposed to be kind of awakened enlightened
in this null state which is very interesting and so
what it shows is that he is like a god
a deity whose incorporated the male and the female aspects
into himself or into herself as a powerful image but
you know where they got that from they didn't make
it up of course they got it from Hinduism in
Hinduism they have a deity called and this is a
tongue-twister of a name our Don our Ishwara our Donna
Roush vara and this deity is half male half female
and it sort of represents the pinnacle of non-duality when
you become fully conscious of the absolute you transcend the
male and the female unifying them both not excluding either
one not blending them together into a into a muddled
mess so it's not like you become indistinct the distinction
is still there it's just sort of like half and
half and they're well integrated together and they function harmoniously
rather than a fragmented neurotic way daddy is the highest
ideal and that is exactly what you will become if
you go all the way with your spiritual work and
you fully actualize the absolute you will transcend masculine and
feminine and when you do you will discover a joy
and a strength which is so much more powerful than
any kind of red pill hyper masculine long town nonsense
that you've been studying or learning or any kind of
pick up nonsense that you've been studying and learning this
will be a power that transcends mortal power you will
become a god integrating it all and that's when you
will finally be at peace and that's when you will
finally be able to love and that's when you will
finally understand everything and that's when everything will make sense
to you and that's when you will transcend all this
crazy dualistic back-and-forth tug-of-war nonsense that you've been engaged in
your entire life this is what you're looking for is
you're looking for the ultimate integration you're looking for the
ultimate unity and we'll talk a little bit more about
that in part two when we really get to the
deep existential dualities we still haven't gotten to them yet
this is still the beginning of this series finally though
I want to end on a funny note which is
the duality of cat versus dog most people think that
there's a cat and there's a dog and you can't
have both well I would challenge that I would challenge
that well the way that Nickelodeon did with the cartoon
cat dog it's a funny cartoon I used to watch
when I was back in the 90s late 90s this
cartoon came out funny cartoon about cat and cat dog
seriously though you know human beings will be able to
genetically engineer animals we're already starting to genetically engineer even
human embryos it's already happening so it's only a matter
of time before we start to generate means from your
animals and you better believe that some scientists will figure
out a way to take the genes of a cat
and the genes the dog blend them together in some
weird way and come up with some sort of hybrid
so the reason I'm telling you that it's not just
some interesting science fiction fact I'm telling you that to
show you how your categories are not as solid as
you think they are and I'm also telling you this
so that you prepare yourself mentally and psychologically prepare yourself
for the radical changes that are coming in the future
our technology is accelerating crazy [ __ ] is gonna
be happening in the next hundred years prepare yourself prepare
your children for weird stuff that's gonna be happening wouldn't
be mixing man and machine man and animal and man
and plants and all sorts of stuff is gonna be
mixing man and woman like [ __ ] is gonna
get mixed up in the future we're moving towards greater
integration so you need to start to appreciate that open
your mind to that and not get so stuck in
your own categories alright that's it for part one make
sure you stay tuned for part two that's going to
be the culmination that's going to be the whole point
of part one where we'll be talking about scientific and
existential dualities see you then you
