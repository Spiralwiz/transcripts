hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm going to talk about freedom versus self-discipline and
how do you go about creating more freedom in your
life I'm really excited about this video topic because this
is something that isn't very obvious to many people and
this is something that really takes wrapping your mind around
to understand before you can get true freedom that you
really want out of your life so this video what
I want to talk about is the importance of self-discipline
in order to get freedom how those two are connected
and why what you currently think you have as freedom
isn't real freedom and that real freedom is something that
you can develop through discipline and personal development so let's
talk about this I can to here or I imagine
you guys sometimes saying this to me you know Leo
you're posting all these videos with actualised org about how
to work really hard to get the inner psychology down
in order to create an amazing life so if you
want financial freedom if you want freedom in your career
or if you want artistic freedom or freedom in your
relationship then how is this a vehicle towards gaining that
freedom because you might tell me Leo this self mastery
stuff that you talked about it's so strict it's so
rigid all these rules and all these principles all this
stuff that I have to do you don't have to
go meditate for hours I have to go work on
myself I have to go do introspection I have to
journal I have to take coaching I have to maybe
go see a therapist I have to have these difficult
conversations with with either my friends or family or my
my spouse or my girlfriend or my boy friend so
all of this stuff you know you talk about taking
massive action you talk about really being honest with your
ego this is all difficult work and there's a lot
of rigidity here how does this not create a strict
and boring kind of life I mean leo I don't
want to turn into a monk you're telling me that
I'm going to become a monk and I'm gonna be
happy well maybe even a monk is happy but I
don't want to be a monk I want to be
free right I want to live that exciting adventurous life
that I imagine for myself that's what I really want
I don't wanna be a monk so some of the
stuff you talk about being happy like a monk and
meditating like a monk and taking principles from a monk
that all of these things might be good for him
but they're not good for my kind of life I
mean I'm a very down-to-earth kind of person right very
down-to-earth not too religious not too airy-fairy enough some sort
of hippie I just want kind of a simple life
where I have the freedom that I want to do
the things that I want how do I get that
leo I'm glad you asked because right now what you're
really looking for is you're looking for fun you're looking
for excitement and you're looking for freedom you're looking for
adventure that's what you're looking for right but you're not
going to get that with your current mode of operating
you're not going to get it and in this video
I'm going to talk about why it's interesting I have
this quote that I really like I don't know if
I came up with it or if I read it
somewhere I think I might have kind of come up
with it but it goes like this the easy thing
is the hard thing and the hard thing is the
easy thing so many people get this wrong I see
this manifesting everywhere I see this manifesting in companies I
think this manifesting with leaders I see this benefiting in
in everyday lives I see this everywhere and it's this
idea that people are looking for a shortcut people are
looking for the fun the excitement the money the profit
the value right away they want it up front they
don't want to work for it and so what they
assume is that if they go directly for the good
stuff they go straight for the jackpot that if they
do that then that's the most direct route that's the
easiest route right why would I want to go meditate
for a decade to attain peace of mind leo that
doesn't that doesn't make sense to me I don't want
to do that that's too extreme too rigid my life
would be miserable if I did that consider though that
that might be easier than what you're presently doing because
what you're presently doing is you're looking for the easy
jackpot and you keep going for the easy and you
keep taking shortcuts and so what happens is that the
easy actually turns hard because what is your life right
now are you really happy with your life are you
really satisfied are you living a life where you're accomplishing
all your dreams where you're really fulfilled inside where you
have true peace of mind where you can say that
you have control over yourself and that you really have
a choice about what you do in your life can
you say that you really have a choice or are
you just a puppet controlled by your desires what you're
going to find is that you are a puppet right
now you think that you're the puppet master but you're
not the puppet master so you think you have freedom
now you think you have freedom now to go eat
an unhealthy meal or skip the gym or be lazy
in a relationship be lazy at work watch some television
do some internet smoke some pot all that's the all
have stuff is fun exciting adventurous right and you think
that that's freedom for you but what you're going to
eventually discover is that that's not freedom you are actually
a slave to your desires and that the one that's
controlling you is your desires you're not controlling your desires
at all and when this is the case then you
cannot have a happy life it will not happen for
you I mean I wish it would if it could
be that easy and I would be the first one
doing it I would be doing it but I learned
long ago simply through the school of hard knocks by
hitting my face into the into the brick wall I
learned that that it doesn't work that way you have
to be a little bit smarter you have to be
a little more strategic about how you go creating an
amazing life you have to be a lot more strategic
if you want happiness you have to be a lot
more strategic if you want fulfillment you have to be
a lot more strategic if you want peace of mind
I want to read an important quote here here's the
quote don't think that you can attain total awareness and
whole enlightenment without proper discipline and practice this is egomania
appropriate rituals channel your emotions and life energies towards the
light without the discipline to practice them you will tumble
constantly backward into darkness Lao tou said that you have
to really start think about this this you chasing after
freedom and this you thinking that self discipline is something
evil the word discipline is bad these rituals that you're
supposed to have you thinking that they're constricting you you
thinking that they're taking away your freedom that's nonsense they
are your only vehicle towards developing true freedom it's very
naive to assume otherwise because you're not really free your
desires have you by the balls and they are extorting
you every single day extortion outright extortion is happening you
know how this game plays right you decided to go
to the gym get a little more fit because you're
not happy about how you look in the mirror too
much fat on you you don't like that you want
a little bit sexier you want to attract a better
mate so you start hitting the gym but then what
happens you hit the gym but it's hard requires discipline
requires practice requires consistency requires expenditure of labor emotional labor
goes into that then you start to scratch your head
and wonder well why does it have to be this
hard too hard it's too hard I don't want to
be consistent I'm just going to do it as it
comes to me so you get lacks you get lazy
you stop going to the gym entirely after a while
and then you get even fatter you get even fatter
even lazier you start having some health problems you start
having some back problems you go to your doctor you
have high cholesterol your doctor also tells you that you
have some sort of weird cysts or lump developing somewhere
in your body from an x-ray all of a sudden
you get scared you go back to the gym now
you're in the gym and you're afraid you're afraid of
your health and what the doctor will tell when you
go back for your next visit you're also afraid of
the pain of going to the gym now you've got
pain for both sides you're afraid of not going to
the gym because of the health problems and also your
worsening looks but you're afraid to go to the gym
too because of the pain of going to the gym
the required discipline that goes into that and so what
do you do your life becomes this waffling it's this
waffling that's going back and forth and back and forth
and back and forth running always running from the thing
that pains you the most so in this situation do
you really have freedom here what I want to submit
to you is that you don't what you're doing is
you really are just being that puppet it's being controlled
by your by your desires and this is preventing you
from going out there and being a creator you can't
create the kind of life you want when you're always
running away from pain and also you can't actually realize
your dreams whatever your dream is a relationship a business
certain out of money health you can't realize those not
if they're really meaningful dreams without a lot of work
you're not going to do it and so to do
that you need to start to cultivate an attitude of
self-discipline but not in a harsh self-critical sort of way
I'm not telling you need to be flagellating yourself all
the time although sometimes you should be harsh on yourself
but generally you need a easy sort of discipline but
still discipline nonetheless because what you're going to find is
that the more discipline you are the more habits you
install in your life the more you get on that
narrow straight path to your goals the more you're going
to start to feel free you're going to get fulfilment
you're going to get this sense of relief that you
have a huge weight will lift off your shoulders when
you stop worrying about all the stuff that you're constantly
worrying about because that's what's beautiful about being a creator
as you're creating the stuff that you want you're building
and building and building capital in yourself you're basically investing
value in yourself and you are slowly growing over the
months and years you're growing and you're appreciating pretty much
like a stock and if you do that for a
good amount of time five ten years down the road
it can feel very very rewarding because it's like having
a stock that tripled quadrupled ten times multiplying its value
that makes you feel awesome right but the really awesome
thing is that when you have these disciplines and rituals
installed in your life you feel like finally you have
some choice you can really choose what you want can
you choose right now whether you want to work at
your job or not is that a choice that you
have if you don't why is that it's because you
need the money and you're trapped there so you say
that you have freedom at your job but you really
have freedom at your job did you really do the
work that's necessary the discipline that needs to be put
into your career or into your own business so that
you do have the freedom to choose whether you want
to work or not anymore and the freedom to choose
the kind of work that you want to do see
a lot of people don't have this and they're not
free in that area are you free in your relationships
are you free to leave the person that you're with
right now are you free to choose and attract the
kind of mate that you want whether for a short-term
fling or a long-term relationship whatever you want or a
marriage are you capable of doing that have you gone
through the discipline and practice that's required to build yourself
up so that you do have those options see building
those options requires emotional investment emotional labor work discipline people
who have not put in that work I know what
their life is like they have very very limited options
they feel very very stuck why is that because the
options are not there by default usually usually if you
just go and work at a nine-to-five job you're not
given a lot of options about where you want to
work in the kind of work you want to do
and the kind of money you make but if you
start your own business you have a lot of options
if you haven't really worked on yourself then you probably
don't have a lot of options with the opposite sex
you can't attract that partner that you want so you
end up settling for the one that you don't really
want that creates a lot of problems a lot of
frustration for you so even though you say maybe you
have the relationship you want is that really true are
you really free in that relationship I bet you that
if you actually had some real options you might exercise
those options so true freedom is about creating options for
yourself and this is not an easy thing this requires
work people don't usually give you many options you have
to go out there and fight for it you have
to start to admit to yourself right now that you're
a slave you're not free you're a slave and what
are you a slave to you're not a slave to
society you're not a slave to your to your boss
or to your wife or to your husband or anything
like that you're a slave to yourself to your own
desires you're a slave to your own emotions you're a
slave to your own moods you're a slave to your
own neurotic thoughts you're a slave to your horrible habits
horrible habits I know the kind of habits you have
if horrible habits and you're definitely a slave to your
external circumstances you're thinking that you are right because you
give away all your control you think that you're a
slave your job or to your health or to your
late ship but really that's ultimately you being a slave
to yourself whenever your slave to a circumstance it all
comes back to you if you look deeply and honestly
enough so the solution is to start to to work
on yourself right that's what all these videos are for
it's kind of like a change in philosophy about life
a lot of people will again take that philosophy of
easy over hard but it comes out the other way
for them they think that sitting at home playing video
games and smoking pot that's the easy life right how
nice well I want to go out and work why
would I want to go work on my career really
hard well that might be easy for now how long
is it going to be the easy life how long
is going to stay easy and how fulfilling is it
even now probably not very fulfilling now but let's say
it even ease is a little bit fulfilling for you
but that's not going to last that's going to be
a little bit of easiness and comfort relative to a
huge amount of pain and cost that's going to come
later so you're just doing that as a short-term gratification
thing you're not thinking too far ahead so the point
that I want to make in this video is that
freedom is discipline discipline is what's necessary to create options
so discipline is used to create options which then create
freedom they're all very closely interconnected so don't think that
by shunning discipline you're somehow creating more freedom for yourself
that is a big trap and I want to end
this video with a quote a powerful quote which goes
really to the heart of this issue and it really
inspired this video when when I read it and wrote
it down immature so here it is kind of long
stay with me the gift of self-discipline is that it
has the power to take you beyond the reasoning of
temporary motion to freedom think of how empowered you felt
on occasions when you haven't gone into the I don't
feel like it syndrome and you honored your commitments to
yourself what is not feeling like it really have to
do with anything the combination of love for something with
the willingness to do it to do what it takes
to practice it discipline that results in freedom and that
is a quote from Michael Beckwith food for thought think
about it think about what this means for the way
that you live your life I think you'll find something
powerful here and you could have a shift in philosophy
a shift in approach which might be somewhat first but
will eventually pay really big dividends for you alright this
