            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/JZqEMok_NXw' target='_blank'>The Root Solution To People Pleasing & Loneliness</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Addressing People Pleasing and Loneliness</b>: Leo Gura aims to provide a profound root solution to two common personal development problems, primarily people pleasing and loneliness. He posits that these internal issues are the result of extrinsic reward mechanisms that we develop in early life, learning to derive happiness from the approval, love, and satisfaction of others. This results in individuals behaving in certain ways to gain love and approval from others, leaving them empty when it doesn't come.
</li><li><b>Women and People Pleasing</b>: Women, according to Gura, are more susceptible to become people pleasers due to their inherent inclination towards nurturing and caregiving roles. They find more satisfaction from social interactions and tend to seek validation more from others.
</li><li><b>Schooling and Extrinsic Reward Mechanism</b>: Gura shares his personal experience, where he associated his self-worth with academic achievement. The reward mechanism developed in school made him feel good when he scored high grades but left him empty when there were no more grades to be scored after finishing school. Dependency on external validation leads to the continuous pursuit of pleasing people and an eventual lack of genuine fulfillment. 
</li><li><b>People Pleasing as a Problem</b>: People pleasers seek happiness from others and constantly engage in actions to be rewarded, acknowledged or validated by others. This, Leo Gura suggests, leads to never being deeply satisfied or fulfilled in life.
</li><li><b>Breakdown of Happiness Source</b>: A person who seeks validation and approval from others has given away their happiness to those others. These people then control the distribution of happiness and recognition, leading to a never-ending chase for fleeting moments of satisfaction and happiness.
</li><li><b>Becoming your own Master</b>: The solution Gura presents is for one to take control over their own happiness and approval. By converting the extrinsic reward mechanism to an intrinsic one, a person is able to find internal validation, thereby improving their sense of self-worth and satisfaction. He suggests short-circuiting the need for external approval and validation and directly giving oneself the love and satisfaction they seek. 
</li><li><b>A Counter-Intuitive Solution</b>: This inward shift might initially be challenged due to years of societal conditioning, where people are taught to seek approval from others rather than themselves. By emphasizing the importance of starting this change, Gura argues that such a shift will lead to finding authentic happiness within oneself. 
</li><li><b>Self-love and Appreciation</b>: Cultivating self-love and appreciation forms a solid foundation for authentic happiness and satisfaction, and prevents feelings of frustration and disappointment often tied to unmet external validation. 
</li><li><b>Pursuing Self-Pleasure and Fulfillment</b>: Leo Gura suggests focusing on internal sources of happiness while stepping away from the extrinsic reward mechanisms that perpetuate the cycle of people pleasing. He argues for a deeper sense of self-satisfaction, and teaches that this is possible through self-recognition, self-understanding and self-love without depending on others for validation. 
</li><li><b>Problem with Societal Conditioning</b>: Our society conditions us to believe that only material possessions, achievements and other people's recognition and approval can bring about real happiness, satisfaction and fulfillment, which is not true. The true source of lasting happiness and satisfaction lies within one's self.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Validation</b>: Gura discusses the importance of intrinsically validating oneself rather than seeking validation from others. This concept involves cultivating self-love, acceptance and acknowledging your own worth and ability to be happy regardless of external rewards or opinions.
</li><li><b>The Pavlovian Dog Analogy</b>: Gura uses the analogy of a Pavlovian Dog to explain how obsessing over external validation can turn individuals into puppets jumping through hoops for mere moments of happiness.
</li><li><b>Changing the Reward Mechanism</b>: To reach the highest levels of satisfaction in life, Leo Gura suggests shifting the focus from extrinsic rewards to the appreciation of intrinsic qualities like love, consciousness, and goodness that are inherent in every individual.
</li><li><b>Need for True Self-Recognition</b>: In order to find true satisfaction and happiness, it is crucial to recognize your own good qualities, achievements and progress without relying on external validation. This process requires self-reflection and recognition of one's own love and consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Practicing Self-Appreciation</b>: Leo advises conducting self-reflective activities like anonymous acts of kindness or giving oneself praise and love to help foster a greater appreciation of your innate goodness and foster intrinsically satisfying reward mechanisms. 
</li><li><b>The Dysfunction of Extrinsic Reward Mechanism</b>: Extrinsic reward mechanisms are dysfunctional because they make individuals reliant on others for their own happiness. Removing these dysfunctional reward mechanisms can lead to personal growth and the ability to genuinely help others. 
</li><li><b>Shifting Focus from Others</b>: Leo explains the idea of shifting the focus from seeking approval and validation from other people to appreciating one's own company. This empowers the individuals to be more sovereign and authentic and resist the urge to control or manipulate others.
</li><li><b>Find Fulfilment within oneself</b>: Gura acknowledges the difficulty of finding joy and fulfillment within oneself, especially due to societal conditioning that encourages external validation and approval. However, he emphasizes the importance of being able to appreciate and enjoy experiences on your own, without the need for validation or sharing with others.
</li><li><b>Self-Love is a Long-term Process</b>: Cultivating the muscle of self-love and joy is a long-term process most individuals are unaware of. Training this muscle can lead to a level of satisfaction incomprehensible to most, help overcome feelings of unworthiness and undeserving love, and reaffirm the truth that real love and happiness come from oneself. 
</li><li><b>The Ultimate Solution</b>: Gura suggests the ultimate solution to overcoming people pleasing and loneliness is to discover ones divine inner nature and see its beauty in the fabric of existence. This process involves doing inner work to cultivate awareness of one's true nature and to build a connection with reality on a deeper level.
</li><li><b>Finding Profound Life</b>: Gura suggests that in order to truly reach profound life, one must be willing to engage deeply with personal growth, put in the required effort and commitment, and not expect quick solutions.
</li><li><b>Extrinsic Reward Cycles and People Pleasing</b>: Leo discusses the problematic nature of extrinsic reward cycles such as approval and recognition from others. This can lead to people pleasing and reliance on external sources for happiness and love, which he suggests creates a cycle of unhealthy dependencies.
</li><li><b>Discovering Internal Love and Satisfaction</b>: Leo suggests going against conventional thinking to give oneself happiness and love directly. Although initially counterintuitive and resembling cheating, he suggests this approach could lead to long-lasting internal satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Societal Conditioning</b>: Leo warns about societal conditioning creating guilt around self-love and self-satisfaction. He indicates that people often develop standards, often tied to careers or service to others, that stop them from feeling love or deserving love without meeting certain external conditions.
</li><li><b>Sovereignty and Independence from External Validation</b>: The emphasis is placed on reclaiming ones sovereignty to feel happiness, satisfaction and love independent of external sources. He suggests that this could help avoid a life of pleasing others and avoid bitterness when ones efforts are not appreciated.
</li><li><b>Non-Dual Approach to Happiness</b>: Leo introduces a non-dual approach to happiness as a more advanced and mature way of living. This approach involves integrating the self and the other, thereby taking full responsibility for ones happiness without expecting validation from the other.
</li><li><b>Potential Consequences of Short-Circuiting Extrinsic Rewards</b>: Leo acknowledges concerns about the potential lack of motivation to achieve if one finds happiness in oneself. However, he redefines it as a feature and not a bug, suggesting it could lead to autonomous actions and a sense of freedom.
</li><li><b>Happiness Derived from Self-Satisfaction</b>: Leo proposes a scenario where people satisfy their own needs for happiness, love, and approval, such that they are overflow with these feelings and naturally share them with the world. He suggests that this is the ideal alternative to seeking external validation.
</li><li><b>Extrinsic Validation and its limitations</b>: Leo Gura discusses the issue of depending on external validation and how it can lead to dissatisfaction. He reflects on his own experience of deriving satisfaction from his work at Actualized.org. However, he recognizes that continuously releasing new videos to obtain satisfaction and pleasure places him in a perpetual state of work. Moreover, he notes that his deepest insights and understandings are becoming too profound to share, leaving him feeling disconnected.
</li><li><b>The Trap of Sharing with Others</b>: Gura identifies the trap of sharing joy, experiences, and achievements with others as a source of happiness. He notes that not being able to share these moments can make them feel less impactful. He highlights his own experience with profound consciousness work, acknowledging that the greatest achievements at this level are often unacknowledged and unnoticed by others, and can thus feel less rewarding.
</li><li><b>Self-reliance for satisfaction</b>: He addresses the need for self-reliance and the ability to bask in ones own accomplishments without the need for external recognition. The true happiness and satisfaction lie within oneself, he argues. Gura underscores the importance of rewiring the reward mechanism to gain satisfaction purely from self-realization. 
</li><li><b>Extrinsic Vs. Intrinsic Rewards</b>: Reiterating his emphasis on intrinsic rewards, Gura suggests that the ability to sit quietly and appreciate one's own joy and understanding of existence is key to achieving the highest levels of satisfaction and love. This intrinsic satisfaction eliminates the need to share or seek validation from others.
</li><li><b>Undoing the Conditioning</b>: He advises his viewers to reverse their conditioning of needing to share their achievements and joyous moments, by simply appreciating and enjoying them on their own. He discusses the connection of this realization with loneliness. The shift from extrinsic to intrinsic rewards may seem to create a bubble of solitude. But, in reality, it instills self-validation and frees from the need for external validation.
</li><li><b>Self-humor and solipsistic views</b>: Leo Gura proposes a mindful change, where instead of seeking external validation through humor or acceptance, one should learn to be content laughing alone or being the only being in its universe. This approach diminishes external reward mechanisms and forces an individual to seek personal satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Dependence on external validation</b>: Leo observes that if the thought of being alone on Earth leads to feelings of despair or desires to end one's life, it signifies an unhealthy reliance on external sources for happiness and validation. He advises that the true measure of a content mind is the ability to find joy and happiness in solitude.
</li><li><b>Deep metaphysical connection to reality</b>: Leo posits that the most profound joy in life comes from an appreciation of existence, not societal interactions. Spirituality is about building a deep personal connection with reality that brings internal satisfaction. To reach this state, one must treat every external joy as an icing on the cake, not the cake itself.
</li><li><b>Alleviating loneliness and people-pleasing tendencies</b>: According to Leo, feeling lonely is a symptom of one's inability to connect deeply with self and reality. To overcome loneliness and people-pleasing, one should spend more time in solitude and work on self-validation instead of seeking validation from others.
</li><li><b>Giving away power and sovereignty</b>: Leo cautions that by constantly seeking validation from others, we give away our power and sovereignty. We build dysfunctional relationships where we sacrifice our own values, and even with that, never achieve true satisfaction. This fulfillment can only be found within oneself.
</li><li><b>Solution to lack of self-validation</b>: Leo advises cultivating a sense of appreciation for being the only conscious entity in the universe. Understanding one's own innate love, goodness, and consciousness, and developing self-recognition and self-understanding can solve the problems of people-pleasing and loneliness.
</li><li><b>Self-centeredness in social interactions</b>: Despite emphasizing self-validation and joy, Leo clarifies that he's not advocating for reclusiveness or dismissive behaviors towards others. Social interactions should be seen as added layers of happiness, not its core.
</li><li><b>Selfless acts of goodness</b>: Leo suggests practicing selfless acts of goodness in anonymity as a way to focus on one's own innate goodness, without seeking praise or validation from others. He emphasizes that personal acknowledgement of these acts carries more weight than superficial praises from others.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-recognition and self-understanding</b>: In the pursuit of highest levels of satisfaction in life, Leo insists on the importance of self-recognition and self-understanding. There should be a shift from seeking external approval to relishing in one's own accomplishments.
</li><li><b>Creating a stronger spiritual connection with reality</b>: Leo advises spending more time in solitude to cultivate a deeper spiritual connection with reality and self. This process focuses on appreciating the innate consciousness in oneself, leading to a satisfying spiritual life. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's push towards appreciating one's own goodness</b>: Gura shares a scenario in which an individual feels down because their acts of kindness are not appreciated or even criticized by others. He argues that such situations could be avoided if individuals stop seeking external validation for their good deeds. Instead, he suggests recognizing and appreciating one's own inner goodness and selfless actions independent of others' recognition.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-recognition and slowing down</b>: Gura elaborates on the difficulty of acknowledging one's goodness, which requires self-reflection and solitude. He notes how most people rush through life, chasing accomplishments without time for contemplation, leading to a lack of self-gratitude. He argues that feeling unlovable and guilty prevents self-praise, and urges viewers to aim for a high level of consciousness and maturity to recognize their own goodness.
</li><li><b>Desire for an ideal state of consciousness</b>: Gura expresses a desire to reach a state of consciousness and spiritual development where one is fully satisfied by simple existence, appreciating reality without needing external activities or productivity for happiness. He suggests that this can lead to a deeper level of bliss as one becomes more conscious of the spiritual nature of their existence. He acknowledges that this may seem selfish and solipsistic but argues it enables a person to interact and socialize from a deeper, more satisfied place.
</li><li><b>Arguing against perceived dysfunction of self-satisfaction</b>: Gura tackles the common perception that achieving self-satisfaction is dysfunctional. He maintains that achieving self-satisfaction allows individuals to interact with others not from a place of neediness, but of fulfillment. This may require a period of perceived selfishness, similar to Buddha's story, but it sets the stage for being able to genuinely help others.
</li><li><b>Shifting the aspiration towards true self-love and selflessness</b>: Gura challenges the self-image of people pleasers, especially in women who end up in abusive relationships, arguing that their perception of love and selflessness might not be true or deep enough. He encourages spiritual work to realize self-love, stating that you can't help others to love unless you're able to love and accept yourself.
</li><li><b>Overcoming ego's control through unconditional happiness</b>: Gura discusses how the mind uses conditions for happiness to exert control and motivate survival activities. He suggests that this control reveals a lack of higher motivation. He refutes claims that cultivating unconditional satisfaction and happiness is just self-brainwashing or wishful thinking. Rather, he argues it's about building a deep metaphysical connection with reality and recognizing one's inherent goodness and love.
</li><li><b>Materialistic Paradigm</b>: Leo Gura explains that having a materialistic viewpoint  valuing things like money, tangible accomplishments, and material possessions as the source of happiness  is a flawed perspective. The truest form of satisfaction doesn't hinge on these exterior factors, but rather, it's based on recognizing and appreciating your own intrinsic worth, consciousness, and existence.
</li><li><b>Recollecting Sovereignty</b>: Leo advises the viewers to reclaim their sovereignty or control over their lives. This has to be the anchor from which all actions, emotions, and thoughts stem. By doing this, one could overcome issues like people-pleasing, materialistic pursuits, loneliness, and the inability to appreciate the beauty of the universe.
</li><li><b>Solitude Practice</b>: Leo encourages viewers to carry out practices that build self-satisfaction and self-love. This could involve doing activities, they would usually do with others, alone. Travelling alone, eating out alone, even appreciating a movie alone can all be highly beneficial. Not relying on others for validation and enjoying one's own company is a step towards authentic happiness.
</li><li><b>Fulfillment from Sole Experiences</b>: When carrying out activities alone, Leo advises allowing these experiences to be enough and build upon that feeling. Achieving satisfaction from solo experiences can lead to deeper forms of joy and a stronger appreciation when they do share experiences with others. He stresses the need for deriving happiness from a place of satisfaction rather than desperation.
</li><li><b>Conscious Existence</b>: Leo maintains that as the only conscious entity in the universe, appreciating existence and reality is an individual's responsibility. Deepening this appreciation is a prolonged process, requiring years of cultivation. Recognizing this and working towards deepening this appreciation over time may bring a level of joy most people won't understand or experience. This joy is personal and might not be shared with others, but that is not an issue once the individual learns to bask in their own joy.
</li><li><b>Self-Love as a Solution</b>: Leo emphasizes that the key to overcoming feelings of being unlovable or undeserving of love is simple - one must learn to give themselves the love they need. Developing a deeper awareness of oneself as a source of love can solve issues of self-esteem and foster a sense of completeness. The ego manipulates our understanding of love and happiness to suit its agenda, so we have to claim autonomy over our love and satisfaction to truly feel fulfilled in life.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Satisfaction and Happiness</b>: Leo Gura explains that the societal conditioning that exists is based solely on survival, not happiness. To find long-lasting happiness, one must cultivate satisfaction and love within oneself. This requires appreciation of the beauty that surrounds us. Outsourcing appreciation of life to others is impossible and leads to a state of misery. No amount of love from external sources can replace the infinite love found within oneself. 
</li><li><b>Recognition of Divine Nature Within</b>: It's important to uncover your own obscured divine nature within. Layers of societal conditioning, fear, guilt, shame, bad habits, survival programs, indoctrination, and negative beliefs from teachers and parents have perpetuated neglect of this divine nature. Discovering and recognizing this inner divinity is the key solution to people-pleasing and loneliness, as it allows you to find what you are truly seeking.
</li><li><b>Practicing Recognition of Divine Nature</b>: Taking actions to practice and cultivate this divine nature is essential. Delaying this practice leads to prolonged misery and regret. Ultimately, awakening to your inner nature as love, goodness, god, and absolute truth, can bring more presence, grounding, and an appreciation for the beauty of life, encouraging a deeper metaphysical connection to reality. 
</li><li><b>Appreciation of Reality</b>: This cultivation enables an appreciation of reality itself, including seemingly commonplace things such as a dinner fork. The seemingly ordinary becomes extraordinary when recognized as a finite manifestation of the infinite mind. It leads to feeling delight and joy through the increasing appreciation of reality, as one recognizes the intelligence, beauty, and goodness of all things.
</li><li><b>Practical Paths to Reach to Divine Self</b>: Leo Gura provides resources to help along the journey such as a book list, a life purpose course, a blog for new resources, a discussion forum, and his second channel ActualizedClips for easier referencing. It's acknowledged that deeper, long-term solutions are harder to understand and require more investment, but they offer the advantage of addressing the root of problems, thus being more beneficial in the long run.
</li><li><b>Depth in Life</b>: Self-help is all about depth which requires effort, commitment, seriousness, and the desire to explore profound depths of personal development. Its effectiveness relies on these factors. Deep down, the idea is to have a profound experience of life, which is dependent on the willingness to dig deep and do the work continually.
